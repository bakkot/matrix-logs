{"content":{"body":"it's been a quarter, and it's not like we're opposed to the idea of keeping the git metadata around, but there's no good project management reason to gate merging on it until either 1) the script appears or 2) other stakeholders pipe up that care about the metadata","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586229547000,"senderName":"shu","senderId":"shu@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"how do you all feel about how to describe normative optionality","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586302793000,"senderName":"shu","senderId":"shu@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"SAB and cleanupSome's is, the host can decide per execution due to some environment factors (headers, main threadedness, etc)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586303370000,"senderName":"shu","senderId":"shu@irc"},
