{"content":{"body":"like with https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2185, though that was a followup to an editorial PR rather than a normative one, so perhaps not comparable","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1603160909000,"senderName":"Bakkot","senderId":"Bakkot@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"i think the main thing is that normative PRs don't necessarily need consensus when they're obvious errors, but i'd lightly prefer we label things normative when implementers would have to adjust their implementation","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1603161074000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"so any lone accesses are really spec bugs, and given the implementation reality of [[OwnPropertyKeys]] where detached TAs present as length 0, makes me all lean towards editorial fix suffices without needing to get consensus","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1603231889000,"senderName":"shu","senderId":"shu@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ok - being normative doesn't necessarily mean we need consensus, if it wasn't possible to implement differently, but if it's editorial then we definitely don't","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1603234905000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"}
