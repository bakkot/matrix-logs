{"content":{"body":"the notion of what is a valid element changed significantly with the introduction of web components","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597802214000,"senderName":"Bakkot","senderId":"Bakkot@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"re: pr, I think not? I would assume if someone is doing --watch they just want to see the rendered output","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597802214000,"senderName":"Bakkot","senderId":"Bakkot@irc"},
