{"content":{"body":"which boils down to the requesting URL and policy.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346484000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Because the network stack lives way above Blink, and has no way of digging back down into the execution.context.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346535000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah that makes sense","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346548000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But we currently set referrer to \"client\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346572000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Hmm...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346599000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"And then the referrer specification does all kinds of tricks with request's client","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346657000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But you want to do tricks with the \"loading\" client","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346673000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Yeah, I guess we could pull some of that logic back in HTML too...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346708000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm just trying to figure out what a better setup would be","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346736000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think the easiest would be to introduce an additional client","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346763000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Since service workers also wants the \"loading\" client, afaict","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346772000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: ^^","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346781000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm somewhat surprised nobody noticed this before","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346787000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Well maybe I shouldn't be, review of Fetch and Service Workers is notoriously poor","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346813000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The whole integration with navigation seems a bit hand-wavey.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346844000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But hey! We can fix it all now!","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441346878000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"We're punting fetchEvent.client to v2, so we can make changes here","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347035000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So either we introduce \"requesting client\" or \"loading client\" next to \"client\" but some specifications will need to change","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347088000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Oooh","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347117000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I know","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347120000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Well, hmm, I was thinking \"navigating client\" as the client that initiates the navigation, but that might as well refer to the client that is navigating...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347164000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"\"navigate requesting client\"?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347194000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Because this is only needed for Fetch resulting from a navigate attempt... It would mean that referrer policy needs to if/else on the two clients","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347228000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But that doesn't seem too bad?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347242000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"It also means that mkwst can just continue to use client as he wants to in Mixed Content and that the current Service Worker setup is correct too","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347272000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"And this should be what CSP wants too","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347284000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think that sounds right. Let me get to my desk and think about it.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441347567000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: mind if I take over your top-links work and finish it?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441348739000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"mkwst: certainly, once you tentatively approve I'll file a bug on Fetch and Referrer","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441348774000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"mkwst: thankfully you got to this before I started rewriting HTML","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441348784000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm only looking at it now because you're making me rewrite MIX. So, thank _you_, I guess? :)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441348809000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: ah, I knew there was something I dropped on the floor in the last couple days. Sure, go ahead, since now is supposedly sleepytime for me.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441348829000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The other thing on my to do list is to respond to https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/62 ... we shouldn't leave issues unanswered like that for too long","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349020000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Fortunately mkwst hangs out here","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349049000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"My main problem there is lack of interest from other vendors","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349066000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So, for MIX, I thing I really only care about the context making the request. iframes don't actually matter, because they're just like every other blockable subresource request.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349109000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"For CSP, I need to know both the context making the request (to apply the correct policy), and that the request is targeting an iframe (to know to apply `child-src`)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349141000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Referrer Policy needs to know the context making the request (for the origin/cross-origin distinction, and the referrer policy). I'm not sure it needs to care what context is being targeted.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349194000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: What annevk said. I floated that proposal a million years ago on Specifiction and WHATWG. Crickets.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349227000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: Once Firefox has a reasonable process model they may be more interested, as one of the things it would allow us to do is to keep passwords in the browser process, so that a corrupted renderer couldn't get direct access.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349265000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: And it's a mild protection against XSS stealing form data directly.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349281000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: Since it's trivial to implement, I think it's worth doing. Especially since the opaque FormData bits of it are necessary for credential management anyway.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349312000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So it's really just more or less defining an attribute, and cutting off JavaScript access to `value`.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349344000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah but it's kind of a question of should it be in the spec if only one browser does it or is planning on doing it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349493000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Not disagreeing with you. :)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349507000,"senderName":"mkwst","senderId":"mkwst@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Which is a somewhat broader problem","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349509000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I am having vague 3am visions of rendered spec diffs or checkboxes to turn on experimental awaiting-implementations features while viewing the spec or something.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1441349561000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
