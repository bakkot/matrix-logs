{"content":{"body":"Although, I don't like that it does it for numbered lists. In markdown I prefer starting each list item with `1. `, rather than giving it the proper number. That means I can rearrange items without manually updating the numbers.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1617951236000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"JakeA: so currently I guess a session history is definitely BCG scoped. After your work though it'll span BCGs, right? For app history we only want to show the current-BCG subset, so will there be a way to differentiate which session history entries are in the current BCG?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1617979885000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
