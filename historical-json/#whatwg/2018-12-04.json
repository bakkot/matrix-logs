{"content":{"body":"> I'm told that Microsoft is throwing in the towel with EdgeHTML and is instead building a new web browser powered by Chromium, a rendering engine first popularized by Google's Chrome browser. Codenamed Anaheim, this new web browser for Windows 10 will replace Edge as the default browser on the platform.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543891236000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: Yeah, really hoping that turns out to be misleading and they're actually not replacing Edge but some other HTML-rendering component. OTOH the fact that it seems so plausible even when unconfirmed should be very worrying to everyone.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543924210000,"senderName":"jgraham","senderId":"jgraham@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"jgraham: We’ll see, but I’m guessing it’s gonna turn out to not be misleading.

{"content":{"body":"That said, I still think the commits could be unrelated (and likely are, given MS wouldn't do such a thing without considering what might happen first): Chrome running on Win/ARM64 is pretty easy to argue as essential for the success for Win/ARM64.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543929270000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
