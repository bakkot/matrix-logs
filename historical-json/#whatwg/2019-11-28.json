{"content":{"body":"Hi again. I don't intend to be off-topic, but I thought you might like to see what your attention to detail in writing the specs has let us do: https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/full-google-mail-in-a-clean-room-browser/","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574951753000,"senderName":"PiersW","senderId":"PiersW@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"how many people have you had working on that engine and for how long?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574952937000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Thanks... It sort of evolved from our earlier SVG-only browser (2006), then we started on HTML in 2012, but only started seriously in ~2014. 5 or 6 people, since then.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953085000,"senderName":"PiersW","senderId":"PiersW@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The SVG browser was used in lots of set top boxes. We kept adding newer DOM/CSS features, so it was sort of why not do the rest :-)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953158000,"senderName":"PiersW","senderId":"PiersW@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"impressive","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953188000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"for the whole time the WHATWG spec work has been going on, the specs have been written with the goal that they could be used to write a new engine from scratch","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953336000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess servo was kind of the first test of how well the specs met that goal","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953363000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but now it’s encouraging to hear that y’all found it possible","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953410000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah, I worked on an embedded browser in ~2001, and the specs were not very good. When we started the HTML parser (2012) the level of detail was pretty amazing.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953422000,"senderName":"PiersW","senderId":"PiersW@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah it’s like night and day compared to the old days of specs for the platform","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953449000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I remember HTML parsing was the biggest blocker for web compatibility, really. But now it's the huge size of the JS APIs.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953493000,"senderName":"PiersW","senderId":"PiersW@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah I can imagine","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953507000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"it’s an extremely ambitious task to take on","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953530000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"super cool to see it happening and really producing something","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953559000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"We haven't written the JS engine from scratch - it's spidermonkey. But everything else is clean room. OpenGL rendering (like web render), and multi-threaded layout engine (erm, like servo).","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953563000,"senderName":"PiersW","senderId":"PiersW@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ok","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953603000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JS engines are naturally a whole other thing","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953652000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess you can build in such a way as to be able to swap out the JS engine later if you wanted to","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953686000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"or write your own if you wanted to","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953693000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah, the separation is very clear (from an implementor's pov), so can be swapped not that we have any intention of doing so.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1574953698000,"senderName":"PiersW","senderId":"PiersW@irc"},
