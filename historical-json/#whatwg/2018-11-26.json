{"content":{"body":"Domenic: so anywhere else you argue for mostly explicit management of things, and we also have construction and destruction of realms mostly defined, but agents is too far and needs to be circular?

{"content":{"body":"annevk: You're right in this case, and I'm writing up why. But in general I much prefer simple definitions based on the properties of an object, over manually adding and removing things to a collection","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543248448000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Layered != circular","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543248488000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Domenic: so I tried to sketch it out in OP; a BC group holds a map for agent clusters, when you navigate around you pick from that map and construct/deconstruct agents and realms in it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543249103000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: and it also holds a set of browsing context trees that belong to the group","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543249134000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"sorry, \"Spectre\" (as a bit)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543249238000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Domenic: we could have a separate map for shared/service workers I think, those could always be origin-bound agent clusters","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543249337000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"I guess top-level versus not","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543249484000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: if the map returns nothing for your cluster, you need to create a cluster, if there's a cluster, there's an agent you can use most likely (unless you're the first, but then it would be created as part of creating a similar-origin window agent cluster I think)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543249528000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
