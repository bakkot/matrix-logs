{"content":{"body":"TabAtkins, do you mean like `new Something.OtherThing(…)?`?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344045073000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"TabAtkins, hasn't come up so far. but also I think you can just write a static operation and using new on it will just work.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344045122000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"heycam: Yes, that's it.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047469000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"heycam: I'm not sure how it would work with a static operation.  I could certainly define it to work as a constructor, but the definition of the returned type would presumably still have to be an interface, and thus would appear on the window, right?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047520000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"TabAtkins, oh I see, so you want to have the interface object itself under a different object, not just an additional constructor","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047558000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Well, I suppose it's not important to hide the interface object.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047581000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The point of putting it under another object is to curb verbosity, is all.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047592000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But if the \"real\" interface exists and has a long name, that's irrelevant I suppose.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047606000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"TabAtkins, because you get to use a shorter name?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047613000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047615000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"that kind of thing?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047638000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yup.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047639000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"will all these constructors return an object that inherits from the outer thing on which you're putting the constructor?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047683000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"No.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047690000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The outer thing will pretty much just be a namespace object.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047699000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The plan is for a CSS interface, which is like navigator or something - a place to stash CSS-related things so they don't end up on window.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047738000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I see","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047754000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"well if this is a pattern that we want to go forward with I can certainly add something to the spec","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047772000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess hold off for now, until we have confirmation that we want to go that way.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047788000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But provisional acceptance is good.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1344047792000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
