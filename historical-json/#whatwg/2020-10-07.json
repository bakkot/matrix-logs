{"content":{"body":"I wanted to include \"Cover-to-cover, multiple times, then backwards at least once, and finally by picking random sections from the contents list and following all the cross-references.\" but it went over the character limit","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602070783000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"annevk: wrap sections of the spec in an element (probably all h2 sections and h3 sections?), then give them `content-visibility: auto; contain-intrinsic-size: 1px 5000px;` - ideally the 5000px should be a rough height of the element, which is used before layout is done properly. I guess you might use a different number for the h2 sections vs h3.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071345000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"And page width yeah, but it really doesn't matter if it's wildly wrong","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071429000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Anyway, sounds interesting and I believe Domenic has been thinking about using more structural elements","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071433000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The more wrong the value is, the more the scrollbar will jump when layout is computed properly","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071456000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But meh, scrollbars are jumpy on native mobile for the same reasons","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071483000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"But interactive sooner is nice of course","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071538000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"It's a tradeoff yeah. If you wanted accurate values I guess a build system could generate them for various widths? But I don't think it's a big deal vs the gains","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071551000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Might still go wrong depending on unusual constructs, so hmm","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071680000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah that might give you more accurate values. Although you're either having to calculate that at build time, or come up with a generic value for all sections, which will still be massively out for some sections","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071688000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Since some sections of the spec are short, some are massive","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071700000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Butâ€¦ the scrollbar jumps around in the HTML spec already as it's loading. This is just doing it later","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602071740000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"annevk: no, no, that's the pr-preview app itself (well the underlying Express framework, really).","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1602080233000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
