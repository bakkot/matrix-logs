{"content":{"body":"hello! apologies if there's a better place to ask this, but I'm unsure about this: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#images-processing-model:concept-microsyntax-parse-error - what would the difference be between fatal and non-fatal in this context?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1548031450000,"senderName":"atrigent","senderId":"atrigent@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"atrigent: “non-fatal” in that context means that parsing does not fail. It means the parser doesn’t stop but continues on despite the error in the input.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1548041342000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: so here: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#parsing-a-srcset-attribute:concept-microsyntax-parse-error for example, the commas would set there as having been a parse error, but otherwise they would basically just be ignored?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1548041641000,"senderName":"atrigent","senderId":"atrigent@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"anyway FWIW the HTML checker at https://validator.w3.org/nu/ will still report an error for those cases ー even though browsers will accept that input, the checker still reports it, since the checker’s purpose is to inform authors about cases that don’t match the spec requirements","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1548042362000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
