{"content":{"body":"JonathanNeal: hello","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408847474000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JonathanNeal: btw if you have any questions about the sort stuff don't hesitate to ping me","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408847489000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Hixie: I wrote up a little something, it doesn’t address all the use cases, but it works.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408847506000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the spec doesn't, or your impl doesn't?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408847567000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"As of right this second, my implementation is limited to ascending alphabetical sorting.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408847625000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408847662000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the autosorting algorithm is the best part of the proposal :-)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408847684000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Hixie: it’s kind of the point, yes?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408847998000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"i didn't read all of the details of the proposal, does it offer different sorting algorithms or even custom ones for people who want those?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848040000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"well not so much algorithms","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848075000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but comparison routines","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848087000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JonathanNeal: well, the point is sorting. it could do the job with a dumb algorithm, or with a selector for picking a simple algorithm, or with a callback or something","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848176000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"caitp: if it does, i missed that part, and was wondering the same thing. It has a lot of built in sorting rules. The thing that was most vague was how table[sortable] might be exposed to the ui.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848181000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JonathanNeal: but instead it has the algorithm it has, which imho is pretty cool.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848202000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"caitp: i encourage you to read the spec","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848213000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JonathanNeal: re the UI, the idea was just that you'd click the <th> to sort by it.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848225000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"i'll read it if i have time to hack together an implementation for blink :p","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848233000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but my schedule is pretty tied up the next few months :(","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848246000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"that is true of all of us","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848276000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Let me share what I have. It’s the first draft, but it’s fun to see, maybe just for me though.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848362000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"http://sandbox.thewikies.com/table-sorting/","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848459000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"cool stuff","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848481000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I figured the standard sorting is based on the visible content of the cells, eg innerText and not textContent.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848565000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JonathanNeal: if you're planning on implementing the spec's algorithm, i have a test dataset somewhere i can mail you if you want to test the spec against what i think the spec says","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848584000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yes, that would be wonderful.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848598000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JonathanNeal: send me an e-mail, i'll find it and mail it to you (maybe monday when i get to work)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848618000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Sure thing.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848668000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"it doesn't look like there's very much in the wpt about that feature yet, apart from idl assertions","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848758000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"you could probably contribute some while working on the polyfill","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848772000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"There are many steps. So far this: finds eligible tables, fires and checks the status of a sort event, gets the order of the heading cells, orders the body cells by that heading cell order. Thanks to Mr. DOMSubtreeModified, we can respond to changes instantly.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408848934000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Oh and there’s a good catch, the event can’t remove the sortable attribute from the table, so it needs to be checked again. That’s wisely in the spec.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408849086000,"senderName":"JonathanNeal","senderId":"JonathanNeal@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JonathanNeal: sent","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408859329000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"hmm, no better suggestions so far","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408871564000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"thinking..","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408872525000,"senderName":"smaug____","senderId":"smaug____@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"well, making click cancelable doesn't really make the API any worse","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408873244000,"senderName":"smaug____","senderId":"smaug____@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but would be really really nice if one user input wasn't represented as several click events","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408873266000,"senderName":"smaug____","senderId":"smaug____@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"gsnedders: Yeah, we need a list of tests that are expected to fail. It's the only sane way to deal with the situation where you have tests from \"upstream\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408873492000,"senderName":"jgraham","senderId":"jgraham@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"jgraham: not entirely clear how to implement that, though :(","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408884894000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"gsnedders: It's not impossible though. You just need to make up an id for the tests","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1408886558000,"senderName":"jgraham","senderId":"jgraham@irc"},
