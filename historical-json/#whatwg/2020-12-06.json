{"content":{"body":"But yet another (third) related issue occupies me. When I traverse the images, I see that Chrome doesn't cache them :|.

I did that yesterday, and indeed I concluded that doing it in the same thread might not do it, so I did set it up on the promise.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1607263057000,"senderName":"croraf","senderId":"croraf@irc"},
