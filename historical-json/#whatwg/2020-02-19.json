{"content":{"body":"hey all, wondering about the goals of the URL living standard as it applies to specific protocols and this project. On the one hand there's a lot of language on the site that indicates it's meant to replace the RFCs and be the end-all-be-all standard. On the other hand it seems like it is narrowly focused on the needs of web browsers. The relatively recent removal of gopher mapping to port 70 is an","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582147348000,"senderName":"tomasino","senderId":"tomasino@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Speaking for Anne & co, so take my words with a grain of salt, but: URL Standard is aimed at browsers. By implication, it's also aimed at anything that wants to interoperate with browsers, which is most URL-consuming things.
