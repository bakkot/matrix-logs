{"content":{"body":"Yeah, some bits of HTTP are being incorporated such as header parsing, so there is room for this. HTTP defining it for all clients is preferable though.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543303836000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"annevk: I'd prefer making the top-level BC and auxiliary BC set explicit independent slots, instead of one big set","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326554000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm also a bit concerned about doing the worker changes separately leaving us with a hard-to-understand mismash, but wanting to chunk the work is also understandable...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326669000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: for the worker stuff the current declarative definition doesn't seem entirely problematic","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326721000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah agreed, but having two different styles for very similar things seems like it'd be confusing.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326748000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: I'm not really sure what independent slots buys us here and it might make things more complicated for various traversal operations","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326757000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Independent slots make the model a lot clearer to me. You don't think there will be a use for getting the single top-level BC?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326786000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm afraid folks would use that kind of thing instead of finding the root of their tree, which is what they really need to be doing","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326837000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(most of the time)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326844000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Because of the long conflation of top-level and auxiliary to mostly mean the same thing","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326863000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Hmm","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326868000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Well, I guess keep it in mind while writing the algorithms... I suspect it'll be clearer than a big bag that has hidden structure.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326899000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess if some state from top-level is important, it'd be better to store that directly on BCG","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326912000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Though it's unclear what would happen if the top-level was closed","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326926000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(which is another thing I wouldn't expect folks to deal well with)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326936000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Right... wait, doens't the definition of top-level handle that?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326961000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Oh, so right now I think all auxiliary BCs are also top-level BCs","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543326992000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"right","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327002000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Let's not change that?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327009000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"E.g. there is a bunch of spec work like https://github.com/w3c/payment-request/pull/811","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327035000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Agreed, perhaps I'm stressing the difference I want to point out incorrectly","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327044000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah, probably need new terms","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327053000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Maybe I can work on some diagrams and ask you to write nice text around them :)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327149000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"That sounds great","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327177000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think there's an open clarification issue about diagrams","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327178000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Maybe the distinction top-level/auxiliary doesn't even matter as much anymore with BCGs","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327212000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Because any important state would be anchored there","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327225000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Well it's not a distinction","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327245000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"And any BC can be an opener BC","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327248000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"I think specs like https://github.com/w3c/payment-request/pull/811 or feature policy do care about top-level-ness","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327266000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"I can't think of anything besides the window.opener spec that cares about auxiliariness","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327316000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Although I guess maybe some of the security stuff gets inherited into auxiliary... but maybe that's better served by BC groups...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327400000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah, we might be able to do away with that term","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327406000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"It still seems roughly useful to be able to talk about popup windows in some way, but maybe it's more confusing than helpful, and it's better to just talk about top-level BCs that have an opener versus don't.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327436000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Have an opener is dangerous as you can set it to null, but it might still be too late","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327490000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Right now I think we keep it around so that they stay in the same URSOBCs","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327545000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"We cannot, because the WindowProxy can be leaked at any point","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327549000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"We can set the opener to null and keep them in the same BCG I think","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327562000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So they'll have to stay in the same BCG and the same agent cluster","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327564000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Ah yes","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327568000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Whereas right now we \"disown the opener\" but leave the pointer there","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1543327576000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
