{"content":{"body":"Ah, okay, so errant question then","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037600000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Thanks for letting me know.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037604000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"like, what do you mean by “experiment”?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037624000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I wanted to try writing some css for it and implement it and see how it looks.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037637000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"by “implement”, you mean, write browser code for it?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037684000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"like, a browser patch for Chrome?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037696000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I was hoping I wouldn't have to","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037709000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"OK","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037717000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I was wondering if there was an actively worked on version that I could subscribe to the version of that would support some experimental features.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037728000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I see","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037746000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"For example I signed up for a beta patch with Brave and I tried out some of their new features before they got rolled out to everyone.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037759000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm not sure if that exists for the people writing the browser patches themselves.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037770000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess you know that browsers have some options that you can enable to turn on experimental features?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037775000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yes, which is part of the reason why I came here","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037792000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"For example I'm familiar with https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/canary/","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037826000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"OK, I don’t know if there is such an option for enabling experimental support for text-overflow; I will look now","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037835000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wait","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037856000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"text-overflow is already supported, isn’t it?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037873000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yes","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037877000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm looking at fade","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037885000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The fade keyword clips the overflowing inline content and applies a fade-out effect near the edge of the line box with complete transparency at the edge.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037900000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ah OK","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601037921000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so sometimes the Browser Compatibility tables in MDN will have specific information about values that have experimental support","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038003000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and the data for that comes from, e.g., https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/css/properties/text-overflow.json","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038038000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Okay","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038077000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"OKay thank you","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038081000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but if I look at the data there for that fade value at https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/css/properties/text-overflow.json#L119, I don’t see any notes about experimental support","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038099000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Right","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038112000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah, so that’s a data point which suggests that no browsers have implemented it yet, even experimentally","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038139000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I see, I misunderstood the table. I didn't see a value with experimental, only a key","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038167000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"...and so there’s not gonna be any option you can flip on to try it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038169000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The people that make the drafts - how do they see what they're making?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038208000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the css spec","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038214000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"they write up quick little sandbox pared down concept examples?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038230000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"no in most cases they write a definition of the required behavior without actually writing any actual code to implement it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038307000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the people who write the specs are usually not the people who write the browser code","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038328000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the spec comes first, the browser code comes after — sometimes very long after something is first specified","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038417000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and in the meantime there really is no way to test out a feature in the spec prior to it getting first implemented in a browser","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038458000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"That's a lot of trust to give to browsers","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038508000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"a lot of work too, I'm sure","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038525000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"well I guess it’s also a lot of trust to give to spec writers","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038532000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but in practice, it’s in iterative process","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038549000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Why? Browsers aren't compelled to support anything spec writers put out, no?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038553000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"What trust is given to them?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038564000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"well spec writers don’t just pull stuff out of their hats","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038576000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm not saying that, and I'm not saying they don't do things intelligently","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038595000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah I understand","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038610000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ok","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1601038613000,"senderName":"MassDebates","senderId":"MassDebates@irc"},
