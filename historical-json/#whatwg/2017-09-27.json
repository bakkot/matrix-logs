{"content":{"body":"but if I do, is CSS Overflow Module Level 3 eventually going to become obsolete/stale/unmaintained, and the current/up-to-date/maintained spec will always be https://drafts.csswg.org/css-overflow and the 'overflow' property definition will eventually move back there?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1506485800000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
