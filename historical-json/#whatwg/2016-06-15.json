{"content":{"body":"Maybe the spec should change, since it is hard to use new void elements in content and still have it degrade gracefully. And there may be more content using it wrong.

{"content":{"body":"So I guess you can always use end tags to support browsers that don't match the latest spec, but if you actually try to use the allowance for tag omission you will get unexpected parsing in older browsers","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1465977240000,"senderName":"othermaciej","senderId":"othermaciej@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"maybe so. but you don't see people doing <video><source></source> because it parses differently in old browsers. so in 5-10 years maybe people will happily use <menuitem> without the end tag, if that is supported?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1465977511000,"senderName":"zcorpan","senderId":"zcorpan@irc"},
