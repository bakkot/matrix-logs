{"content":{"body":"annevk: I edited https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts to make a number of refinements to align it with the Secure Contexts spec.

{"content":{"body":"gregwhitworth: it could be some kind of activation behavior I suppose; but yeah, mouse events are not really defined, hit testing is not defined, and the select popup box is not defined","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591243357000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: it might be better to say top-level document as the browsing context can contain both secure and insecure contexts; it strikes me that “context” was a poor word choice for this feature","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591243560000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: also maybe make mitm say monster-in-the-middle","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591243591000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: thanks for fixing it up!","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591244080000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: so I actually replaced some instances of “top-level document” which had been in that article — because neither HTML nor Secure Contexts defines “top-level document”","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247537000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so now I’m unsure how to word it in order to align it with how the specs actually define things","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247577000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: you could also top-level browsing context's active document","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247585000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: but the thing to keep in mind is that a browsing context doesn't have authority","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247604000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: it doesn't have an origin, it represents a sequence of documents that can all have different origins","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247643000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"well that’s hard to tell from the Secure Contexts spec as well","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247644000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"aha yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247651000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm not surprised","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247666000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah you were able to explain it clearly in a couple sentences","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247704000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so I wish the Secure Contexts spec could be refined to state it in similar terms","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591247737000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"gregwhitworth: makes sense, filing an issue against whatwg/html for the click/activation behavior on option might be worth doing","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591249047000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"sounds good - let me get the Open UI group aligned a bit on the event mapping so it's a bit more clear. Also, I'd like to extend the invite because the Open UI discussions will propagate to WHATWG for web platform changes at some point","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591249131000,"senderName":"gregwhitworth","senderId":"gregwhitworth@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"noamr: I'd like to talk to heycam a bit; it might actually be better if EXIF wasn't exposed for opaque images at all (or treated as if not present); because making each caller do the correct origin check seems like a recipe for disaster","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591286511000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: I see a risk there... people would enable CORS on image just for the sake of getting them to display correctly, exposing the image content to canvas","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591286578000,"senderName":"noamr","senderId":"noamr@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"noamr: I don't think we can guarantee there will never be such features, right? Would each such feature need to get a security check?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591286703000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: I think so, if the alternative is to cripple features that in themselves don't pose a security risk...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1591286810000,"senderName":"noamr","senderId":"noamr@irc"},
