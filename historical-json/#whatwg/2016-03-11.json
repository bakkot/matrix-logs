{"content":{"body":"annevk: I suppose we could find walk up the event path 'til the first target which is a node, and use that to filter the results","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1457677324000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1457677333000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
