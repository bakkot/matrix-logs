{"content":{"body":"Ms2ger: ah, so if something takes a WindowProxy we want to validate it's a WindowProxy","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551186999000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Ms2ger: I guess in a way its brand is that it has this [[Window]] slot","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551187026000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Ms2ger: so yeah, that's another thing that needs to be done somehow then","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551187113000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Ms2ger: so I think the simple solution is for WindowProxy to define [[PrimaryInterface]] as being << \"WindowProxy\" >> or whatever it needs to be","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551187961000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Ms2ger: unless that has weird side effects...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551187981000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"good times in exotic objects land","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551188009000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"That sounds like a reasonable option, but I'd need to think through the consequences","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551188030000,"senderName":"Ms2ger","senderId":"Ms2ger@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#concept-custom-element-definition-observed-attributes says that observed attributes are a `sequence<DOMString>`.  Can anyone point me to the actual definition of `sequence`?  specifically I want to know if a JavaScript `Set` object qualifies (all examples I've seen use `Array` objects).","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551191185000,"senderName":"coreyfarrell","senderId":"coreyfarrell@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"coreyfarrell: so Set ought to work I think as it has Symbol.iterator","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551191348000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: great, thanks for the link.  I had already verified it works in current Firefox and Chrome, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't relying on some undefined behavior or bug.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551191401000,"senderName":"coreyfarrell","senderId":"coreyfarrell@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"coreyfarrell: the simple explanation is that sequence converts an iterable to a list on input, and converts that list to an Array on output","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551191500000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm guessing that providing an Array in the first place wouldn't allow any optimization of that process since creating a shallow clone of the original iterator is intentional?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551191768000,"senderName":"coreyfarrell","senderId":"coreyfarrell@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"coreyfarrell: something something sufficiently smart compiler","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551191850000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"coreyfarrell: engines have options and I've definitely heard of \"nobody touched Array.prototype\" as a thing that might create different code paths","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551191932000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"coreyfarrell: in this case though I wouldn't worry about that too much as this is a one-time conversion that the browser then caches for the lifetime of the object","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551191994000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"coreyfarrell, there's the conversion to a DOMString in-between as well, so I doubt there's much room for optimization like that","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551192094000,"senderName":"Ms2ger","senderId":"Ms2ger@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ahhh good point, I can actually see that from my coverage report that the `observedAttributes` property is only read once per instance.  I guess that makes sense reading it on every attribute write would be bad.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551192215000,"senderName":"coreyfarrell","senderId":"coreyfarrell@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4335#issuecomment-467485655 if whatever's shorter is better, surely we should just copy all pointers?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551196010000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: well, I guess my point was more that each should have a distinct set of things accessible from it, and then you should prefer taking as an argument whatever has that thing, instead of e.g. taking a Window and doing window's environment settings object's X.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551196124000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

Some folks from GitHub (the company) would like to attend, and I want to avoid a repeat of last time.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551201127000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: maybe email? I lack context I think","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551201323000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"you can be *personally* invited to TPAC while not an employee of a W3C Member or an IE in any group, but AFAICT the W3C is loath to invite anyone (and especially people working for major companies who presumably could in principle be paying Membership fees)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551202702000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but the spring components f2f isn't tpac?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551202747000,"senderName":"hober","senderId":"hober@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"If it's not a W3C meeting at all, then more than likely Domenic's concern is satisfied?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551202791000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":" but, like, unless mozilla is charging an entrance fee to the toronto office i think they should be fine, right?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551202798000,"senderName":"hober","senderId":"hober@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah, ok, I guess tpac was a special case. But e.g. we've had W3C chairs run previous meetings too, in Tokyo for example.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551202853000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"If this is not such a meeting then we're indeed fine.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551202864000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"aside from TPAC, external people can be invited at the chairs' discression, IIRC; obviously they might be subject to pressure from W3M, but in principle the decision is the chairs'","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551202915000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"i think annevk's hosting so maybe he can answer that","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551202935000,"senderName":"hober","senderId":"hober@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yeah, neither do i","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551203324000,"senderName":"hober","senderId":"hober@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"isn't this the wg","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551203751000,"senderName":"hober","senderId":"hober@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"i guess some components work ends up in other specs, but the vast majority of it is in html, which is here","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551203882000,"senderName":"hober","senderId":"hober@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah, I guess now custom elements is merged it's basically all WHATWG","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551203911000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"There’s new stuff coming, but all of it are PR-sized additions in my mind","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551204031000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But yeah, I guess if Mozilla hosts I’ll clarify that all are welcome","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551204059000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Well, no, I guess a bit more refactoring of all the \"Page load processing model for X files\" is needed, since those often follow the pattern \"create a Document, do a few things to the Document, initialize the Document\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551221987000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So I guess maybe we need a separate \"create a Window and environment settings object\" or something, and then we refactor all of those into (numbered) \"create a Window, create a Document, do a few things to Document, initialize the Document\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551222019000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
