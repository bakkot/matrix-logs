{"content":{"body":"however, we can't ask users to install that, it has a ridiculous amount of dependencies","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303520000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"but just like on Linux, where you also cannot expect it to be installed, you can still fall back to it if available","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303580000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but on linux it is \"native\", and we can let the packages depend on the right packages","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303581000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"it's as much \"native\" on macports as it is on ubuntu","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303640000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"it's just a package to be installed","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303641000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I just did \"port install gstreamer\" and it got all the dependencies","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303642000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"if you do any kind of development on the mac, it is","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303644000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"normal users probably won't have it installed","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303700000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"this is why I say: when it's available, it would make sense to fall back to it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303701000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"otherwise you can do what you do on windows","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303702000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"btw: some ppl also have gstreamer \"natively\" installed on Windows - but probably a lot less than those who have macports or fink","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303703000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I will make a minimal mac build, like on windows","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303704000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah, that will be the best","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303760000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but why not have that for all platforms and only use it where gstreamer is not installed natively?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303761000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"on Unix there's no need - GStreamer will be there (once our package dependencies or installer scripts make it so)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1262303940000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"}
