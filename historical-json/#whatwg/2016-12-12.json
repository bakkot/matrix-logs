{"content":{"body":"JakeA: has there been any discussion of background sync events only when you are wifi, etc?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481565696000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: I have someone requesting that feature... which seems kind of reasonable","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481565874000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"right now its only really doable with navigation.connection on the main window (AFAIK)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481565898000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wanderview: yeah, that feature got dropped from the MVP","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481565923000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wanderview: although devs would have to be careful, some users *never* go on wi-fi","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481565946000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so it'd have to be a choice they expose to the user","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481565954000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"although, I question why limiting to wifi is important. If the uploads are large, background sync is probably the wrong choice vs background fetch","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481565984000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: well, background fetch does not exist yet :-\\","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566002000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: I think the use case here is opportunistic pre-caching... but they don't want to waste metered network for it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566031000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(yea, wifi does nto necessarilly mean not metered)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566043000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wanderview: I think it's a reasonable feature... I'm just worried it's wrong for this particular use-case","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566131000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: background fetch would not disciminate between mobile data and wifi, right?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566173000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: anyway, I suggested they write a bg-sync spec issue","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566346000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wanderview: I don't have anything in background-fetch for that right now. I can't decide if it'd be better as a per-site feature or a browser feature","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566600000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wanderview: eg the browser could assume wifi only unless the user clicks something in the notification to start it now","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566618000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: I think in this case they would not want to pester the user with a notification at all since this sounds like low-priority opportunistic stuff","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566754000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: seems like sites should be able to indicate \"the users asked for this explicitly... download ASAP\" vs \"I think maybe they want this, download if possible but whatever\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566785000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wanderview: hmm, but if it's large background download, it really need to be visible from a privacy perspective","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566786000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: I don't think these are particularly large","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566796000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wanderview: large enough for wi-fi vs cell to matter","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566809000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: do you think a native app like Snapchat should have to put up a notification if its downloading images in the background?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566856000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"only thinking of that one since I know snapchat ate a ton of my wife's data plan one month with background downloads","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566883000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wanderview: the podcast app I use does, and I kinda like that it does. Also useful if I have limited bandwidth I can see that the podcast app is clogging up the pipes","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481566922000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: play store updates do as well... but it just feels different to do it for large things like apps, videos, podcasts... vs \"I'm downloading 20 articles I think you might want to read maybe\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481567009000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: I mean... why wouldn't small stuff using bg-sync be able to discriminate based on wifi?  why restrict it?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481567039000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"wanderview: yeah, I think it's a feature we should have. It was in the original designs","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481569687000,"senderName":"JakeA","senderId":"JakeA@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"JakeA: I feel like we have a long tail of stuff we should implement... hard to prioritize","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481570153000,"senderName":"wanderview","senderId":"wanderview@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Domenic: we still have links to it from the servo code base, we should probably update at our end.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1481571007000,"senderName":"ajeffrey_","senderId":"ajeffrey_@irc"},
