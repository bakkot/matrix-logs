{"content":{"body":"Domenic: thanks for the feedback on the event loop refactoring. I replied to a bunch of your feedback to give some additional context that could use follow-up. I might also push out a commit with some of the more trivial fixes that don't require further collaboration.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1549290584000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"nox: are you planning on working more on this btw? I guess writing tests and then seeing what the model should maybe be?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1549290669000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"annevk: Yeah, no worries, that's why I wanted to write tests for current behaviour,","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1549290718000,"senderName":"nox","senderId":"nox@irc"},
