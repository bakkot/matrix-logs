{"content":{"body":"yup","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095561000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I know some people (including myself) have a tendency to implement whatever spec says without doing the sanity check of the spec itself","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095562000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"hmm, yeah, that's definitely not the way it should work","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095620000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: so there's a very interesting implication on accessibilty","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095621000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: good one actually","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095622000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095623000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"how so?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095624000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: if we expose \"commands\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095625000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: then it could be listed in context menu, etc...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095626000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095627000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: and assistant technology can provide a higher-level semantics of what an app does","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095628000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"which is a superb solution to listing buttons and letting people figure out what those buttons do","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095680000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so the spec already does some of that by tying it in with accesskey","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095681000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"also, you could imagine that if command has some human readable level such as \"create a new note\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095682000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"then voice recognition software might be able to automatically execute that command","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095740000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"when the user instructs it to do so","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095741000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: yeah, typing it to accessKey is nice","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095742000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: but we aren't so happy about how command's states are tied with the element that defines it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095800000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah, there's a lot of utility that could be had from this feature, so it would be nice to see it getting some more scrutiny and refinement","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095801000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095802000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095803000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: e.g. we had an idea to tie the command with execCommand's commands","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095804000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: and with tthat","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095805000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: you can also tie it to radio box, checkbox, etc... states","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095806000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"OK","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095860000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: for example, you can imagine that if you have <input type=\"checkbox\" command=\"bold\">","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095861000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: then UA can automatically check this box when the command state is bold","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095862000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I mean when bold command's state is true","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095863000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095864000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and uncheck when the state is false","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095865000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: we can apply similar mechanism to select, radio, etc...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095920000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: from that perspective, the current design of ting the command state to the element","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095921000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and furthermore having inputelement-like checked state isnt' ideal","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095922000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"because you may want to have multiple UI widgets referring to the same command","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095980000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"e.g. <select command=\"color\"><option>blue<option>green","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095981000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"<","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095982000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"</select>","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322095983000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"in this case, you want blue or green to be selected when color command's state is blue or green","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096040000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but in addition to this select element","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096041000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the same app may have another UI widget that has <input type=\"color\">","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096042000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: and this one should automatically reflect whatever the current command value is","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096043000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"OK","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096100000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: furthermore, we probably want to let authors to define and implement their own custom UI component","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096101000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: and those component should probably be able to be notified of command state's change","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096102000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: so we need some sort of registry mechanism","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096103000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: also we need to be able to scope commands","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096104000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"e.g. many websites include WYSIWYG editors but commands available inside a editor are vastly different from those available outside the editor","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096160000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: but there's a lot of \"data-binding\" aspect here though","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096220000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah, so that gets into the components stuff","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096221000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"right","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096222000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and maybe it's good to wait on the command things until components is further along","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096280000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: could be","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096281000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: but I think we can start the discussion","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096282000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: and get more attentions","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096283000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096284000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: I was hoping to get the discussion started by now but it seems like I've caught up by other stuff :(","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1322096340000,"senderName":"rniwa","senderId":"rniwa@irc"},
