{"content":{"body":"maybe it's fine to use the same bit for now","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586952334000,"senderName":"littledan","senderId":"littledan@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Or is there more to do than set a boolean for HTML?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586952384000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"well, we decided that different hosts can settle this differently, since not everyone even uses an event loop style","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586952388000,"senderName":"littledan","senderId":"littledan@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"You'll at least have as much of a loop as needed for promises presumably","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586952410000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"editorially we decided to go for the most parsimonious thing, that it's just \"normative optional\"--hosts can already resolve that, as they do for Intl and Annex B","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586952418000,"senderName":"littledan","senderId":"littledan@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"right, ultimately these are all different ways of talking about the same thing","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586952458000,"senderName":"littledan","senderId":"littledan@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"I'd rather hosts be able to say things like \"expose X\" and \"don't expose Y\" at their leisure than require that they only have control over a proscribed set of things ES takes the time to expose an API for.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586962377000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"ecma262 needs to be exact in what is normative optional (e.g. the data property on the global object), but i'm also confused by the confusion","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586966558000,"senderName":"shu","senderId":"shu@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: because HTML says it must?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1586966598000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
