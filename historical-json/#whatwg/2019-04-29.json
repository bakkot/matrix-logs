{"content":{"body":"annevk: and I read the documentation of `.any.js`, document says `.any.js` will transform the test into `fetch_tests_from_worker` automatically. but both tests will load different url for `Worker` and `SharedWorker`, I'm stuck at I don't know how to load a different url in `fetch_tests_from_worker` for `.any.js` ü§î","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1556523844000,"senderName":"cybai","senderId":"cybai@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"cybai: you could turn them into .window.js, but as they need to use the Worker and SharedWorker constructor that's really the best you can do","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1556524244000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"cybai: an HTML test file that contains the XMLHttpRequest constructor can typically be turned into .any.js, as it should work when executed in a worker or shared worker context as well","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1556524323000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"annevk: I see! Thanks! So `.any.js` is handy for `XMLHttpRequest constructor` tests with the `fetch_tests_from_worker` function and it doesn't work for `open-url-redirected-worker-origin.htm` and `open-url-redirected-sharedworker-origin.htm` because they're instantiated by different urls","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1556524457000,"senderName":"cybai","senderId":"cybai@irc"},
