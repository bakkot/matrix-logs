{"content":{"body":"here's the background:","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715681000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"there are two APIs that currently happen to be the same API: HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks, and MediaStream.videoTracks","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715740000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks has as purpose the following:","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715741000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"- expose what video streams are in the media resource","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715742000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"- allow the author to introspect them","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715743000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"- allow the author to switch between them","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715744000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MediaStream.videoTracks is currently misdesigned but in principle its purpose is to allow authors to turn off individual tracks before sending them to a peer","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715800000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"to implement e.g. video mute","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715801000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(everything i'm saying here has a parallel with audioTracks, but for simplicity i'm just going to talk about videoTracks here)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715802000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"now the problem with the API that is used for both of the above is that it's awkward to use","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715860000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"instead of saying media.videoTracks[0].kind you say media.videoTracks.getKind(0);","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715861000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"it's less intuitive","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715862000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(getKind() et all is also slightly nicer from my standpoint because there's no extra object to worry about, so no lifetime issue, no edge cases to define like \"what if you keep a reference to a track and ask for its kind after the video has changed number of tracks\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715920000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"or \"what happens if the first track changes kind mid-way through the stream and you ask for its kind using a reference you picked up earlier\")","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715921000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"now i'm trying to fix two problems:","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715980000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"1. changing to the intuitive API for HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks, by having it return a Track object of some kind","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715981000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and defining all those edgecases somehow","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308715982000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"2. making the \"video mute\" feature actually work","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716040000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"to do 2, my current plan is to have a way to create a new MediaStream from an existing one, so you can manipulate the outputs on the second one without affecting the first one","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716041000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so you can getUserMedia() a (Generated)MediaStream, and plug that in (via getObjectURL) to <video>","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716100000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"call that one userStream","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716101000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and you can also call  new MediaStream(userStream)  which returns a new MediaStream, call it secondStream","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716102000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"on which you can disable the video without affecting the <video>","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716103000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and you would send secondStream to PeerConnection","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716160000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ok i'm shutting up now","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716161000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"oh wait i never talked about seekabality","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716162000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so anyway, the concern was that at one point instead of new MediaStream(aStream) I was thinking of allowing new MediaStream([array, of, tracks])","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716163000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and you wouldn't want to be able to take Track objects from the HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks list","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716220000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"because those have nothing to do with the kinds of tracks in a MediaStream","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716221000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I mean, they're similar, but they're not compatible concepts","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716222000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but that's academic at this point since I don't think we need to allow that necessarily","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716223000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ok now i'm really done","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716224000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I see","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716280000,"senderName":"roc","senderId":"roc@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I agree building a Stream out of Tracks sounds dangerous","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716281000,"senderName":"roc","senderId":"roc@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"what if you build a Stream out of Tracks, start playing it somewhere, and then change the media resource in the HTMLMediaElement you got the Tracks from?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716340000,"senderName":"roc","senderId":"roc@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the resource loader that loaded the Tracks will have gone away","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716400000,"senderName":"roc","senderId":"roc@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"building a stream out of tracks from a <video> element just doesn't make sense to me","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716580000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"i need to figure out what it means if you create a MediaStream from a MediaStream that has disabled tracks","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716641000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"do they come along as well but disabled?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716642000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"if so, it's kinda weird, because it means getting a url out of a MediaStream, or putting one in a PeerConnection, gets you something different than what you get if create a new MediaStream from one","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716700000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but if you don't, then you can never have more than one videoTrack per MediaStream constructed in this way","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716701000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716702000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"not sure where to go with this exactly","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1308716703000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
