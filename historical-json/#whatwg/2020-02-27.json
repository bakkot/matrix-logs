{"content":{"body":"hey folks :) I've stumbled across a pretty interesting case today and reading the spec hasn't helped me so far, so maybe you could help me out here. <3 so...does anybody know why `Number(document.createElement('a'))` yields `0`, but every other element (or even an anchor element which has an `href`) seems to return `isNaN`?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582803849000,"senderName":"Loilo","senderId":"Loilo@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Loilo: because, uh, toPrimitive(_, hint: number) calls .valueOf then .toString","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582804886000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Loilo: HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils defines a stringifier which returns obj.href, which in that case is \"\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582804912000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"empty string converted to a number is +0, therefore you get 0","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582804939000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"aww... I've read through ecma-262 to see how ToPrimitive works in the first place, but I just realized I read the spec for ES 5.1 which was way less comprehensive about that subject... had I read the es2019 spec, I may have figured this out myself ._. thanks a lot!","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582805460000,"senderName":"Loilo","senderId":"Loilo@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"the ES5.1 spec points to some internal [[DefaultValue]] for objects. it also pointed to how [[DefaultValue]] works for \"native ECMAScript objects\" (which I'm not sure about to what it applies)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582805726000,"senderName":"Loilo","senderId":"Loilo@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yeah I didn't assume that either, would be extremly unusual","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582805807000,"senderName":"Loilo","senderId":"Loilo@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but I thought maybe DOM elements are not part of what the spec refers to as \"native ECMAScript objects\" and therefore have a different algorithm for determining their [[DefaultValue]]","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582805857000,"senderName":"Loilo","senderId":"Loilo@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The 2020 spec doesn't use that term, but it sounds like it's referring to anything that's not exotic objects.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582805943000,"senderName":"andreubotella","senderId":"andreubotella@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"okay thanks for alle the pointers :) I just realized my error in reasoning was not actually about how the ES spec reads ([[DefaultValue]] in ES5.1 seems to be what is described as OrdinaryToPrimitive in ES2020) but that I overlooked what HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils has to say on the topic","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582806140000,"senderName":"Loilo","senderId":"Loilo@irc"},
