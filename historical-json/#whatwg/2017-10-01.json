{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: I'd missed that HTML specifically describes its conformance classes. That's great. WebIDL does the same: https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#conformance claims that it only 'must's IDL fragments.

{"content":{"body":"I think my axiom here is that we need to make sure our requirements for each conformance class are \"complete\", meaning they cover what happens when other conformance classes fail to live up to their requirements.
