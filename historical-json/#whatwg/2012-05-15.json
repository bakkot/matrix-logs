{"content":{"body":"zcorpan: we don't, generally, hence the discouragement in the spec. but there are certain cases where maybe the UA has reason to do otherwise, e.g. it wants to use the image for the biggest possible viewport width because it has reason to believe the user is about to switch to a wide viewport width (e.g. because the tab is only displayed narrowly when in the background)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1337125000000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
