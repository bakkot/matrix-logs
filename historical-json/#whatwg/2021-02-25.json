{"content":{"body":"annevk: I don't know what context you were talking about `else if` from, but no, `else if` is usually treated as a syntax construct in its own right, like Python's `elif`, even if it's actually just an unbraced `else` followed by an `if` block. There is no chance of confusion or misparsing for it, so there would be no reason to agitate for additional braces there.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1614267844000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Sure, but it's an edge case where it's literally impossible to make a mistake and cause a misparse. You can leave off the braces around the following `if` block and run into problems, but braces around the `else` body would gain absolutely nothing, so no, no one would insist on that.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1614268054000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
