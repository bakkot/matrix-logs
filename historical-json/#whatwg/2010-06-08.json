{"content":{"body":"but the text about the algorithm to convert a string to a number tells it has to follow the rule of parsing a floating point number which is about float and not double","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038420000,"senderName":"volkmar","senderId":"volkmar@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"i suppose a clarification is needed","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038421000,"senderName":"volkmar","senderId":"volkmar@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"volkmar: file another bug :-)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038480000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Hixie: i know","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038482000,"senderName":"volkmar","senderId":"volkmar@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"i wanted to be sure valueAsNumber is going to stay as double","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038540000,"senderName":"volkmar","senderId":"volkmar@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"no idea","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038541000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ok :)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038542000,"senderName":"volkmar","senderId":"volkmar@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"since JS only has one Number type, i don't know that i really care either way","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038543000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"for the implementation, that's quite different","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038600000,"senderName":"volkmar","senderId":"volkmar@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"anyway, i will file the bug","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276038601000,"senderName":"volkmar","senderId":"volkmar@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"volkmar: I checked the discussion from when it was changed, and it turns out float won't work at all since the timestamp is milliseconds and not seconds","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276040580000,"senderName":"Dashiva","senderId":"Dashiva@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Dashiva: Why does the scale matter? Doesn't that just mean the maximum is 10^34 seconds, not 10^37 seconds?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276040820000,"senderName":"Philip`","senderId":"Philip`@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(so it's still plenty of ages of the universe)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276040880000,"senderName":"Philip`","senderId":"Philip`@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Philip`: Timestamps need to be precise, so a float is pretty much a 24-bit integer in this regard","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276040940000,"senderName":"Dashiva","senderId":"Dashiva@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But I suppose you're right, and float would be too small even for seconds","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276041000000,"senderName":"Dashiva","senderId":"Dashiva@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Oh, so the issue is that it has a precision of milliseconds and a range of >2^24 larger than that, rather than the issue being that it's scaled to milliseconds","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276041060000,"senderName":"Philip`","senderId":"Philip`@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Things would be much easier if time didn't change so frequently","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276041120000,"senderName":"Philip`","senderId":"Philip`@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Sounds like you're onto something","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276041180000,"senderName":"Dashiva","senderId":"Dashiva@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"24fps is enough for visually smooth animation in films, so we could just quantise the universe to ~100Hz and nobody would notice","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276041240000,"senderName":"Philip`","senderId":"Philip`@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm pretty sure we'd notice when chemistry stopped working.  Well, actually, we wouldn't, but for entirely the wrong reason.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276041241000,"senderName":"AryehGregor","senderId":"AryehGregor@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"It seems today's date requires 31 bits for second precision, 41 for millisecond precision","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276041420000,"senderName":"Dashiva","senderId":"Dashiva@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"It requires 0 seconds for arbitrary precision, if you pick the start date correctly.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1276041480000,"senderName":"AryehGregor","senderId":"AryehGregor@irc"},
