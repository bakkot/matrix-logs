{"content":{"body":"though i have begun editing the spec","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272935944000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"you wanted something?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272935945000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"nessy: i was going to ask you if we really needed to support <trackgroup>","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936000000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and if so, what it was solving","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936001000,"senderName":"Hixie","senderId":"Hixie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so, there are two things that were a requirement when we designed the <track> element","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936002000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"one was that we wanted to be able to have multiple tracks active at the same time","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936003000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so, for this we would simply have multiple <track> elements inside the <video> element","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936060000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"then they could all be active at the same time, if the author or user so desired","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936061000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the other requirement was to be able to specify that several <track>s are alternatives to each other and only one of a group should be active at one time","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936120000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"for example if you have text audio descriptions in multiple languages, you would only want one of them to be read out by the screenreader at one point in time","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936121000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"is there a use case for multiple sets of mutually exclusive alternatives?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936122000,"senderName":"othermaciej","senderId":"othermaciej@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"to specify this, we introduced the <trackgroup>","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936123000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"then all the <track>s inside the <trackgroup> would work like a radiogroup","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936180000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"well, that, too","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936304000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"just specify  what you want active in parallel in multiple <tracks>s and what you want exclusive inside a <trackgroup>","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1272936420000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
