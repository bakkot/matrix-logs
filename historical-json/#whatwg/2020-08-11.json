{"content":{"body":"I see that the options for signing the agreement are either as an individual that is not currently working in development/programming/software or as a representation of an entity that does. In cases where someone works for multiple entities at the same time, are they free to just pick one?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597150732000,"senderName":"jrmykolyn","senderId":"jrmykolyn@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"jrmykolyn: the way I understand it, the agreement is a way to keep track of potential patent owners which might've changed the standard to incorporate their patents, forcing every browser vendor to pay them","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597151818000,"senderName":"andreubotella","senderId":"andreubotella@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"andreubotella: Thanks for following up. I'll have a look at the 'field of web technologies' document that you shared.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597152905000,"senderName":"jrmykolyn","senderId":"jrmykolyn@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"This is hypothetical now, but let's say person A works for vendor 1 and vendor 2. Person A must sign the participant agreement on behalf of both vendors in order to contribute?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597152970000,"senderName":"jrmykolyn","senderId":"jrmykolyn@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"jrmykolyn: that seems correct, indeed. If they only signed for vendor 1, then they could act on behalf of vendor 2 to get a patented-by-vendor-2 technology into the standard, and thus cause serious problems for the ecosystem.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597154550000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"My current understanding is that someone who works as a professional developer/programmer/software engineer may sign the participant agreement _as an individual_ so long as their employer(s) are not 'web technology vendors'.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597160300000,"senderName":"jrmykolyn","senderId":"jrmykolyn@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Hey! Are there some test cases somewhere for parsing javascript: URLs, i.e. https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/URL_schemes#javascript:_URLs ?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597172500000,"senderName":"The-Compiler","senderId":"The-Compiler@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"The-Compiler: not sure exactly what you mean by parsing, but there are some tests for javascript: URLs in general in https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/html/browsers/browsing-the-web/navigating-across-documents","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597173125000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Parsing JS URLs should be the same as parsing all other URLs (https://url.spec.whatwg.org/; see tests link in the header) but the tricky part is executing them","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597173201000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Domenic: parsing as in \"getting the javascript source\", it was a bit unexpected that e.g. query and fragment are also added so that ? and # works unescaped","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597173262000,"senderName":"The-Compiler","senderId":"The-Compiler@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Right, per the above algorithm it's just \"everything after the leading 'javascript:', percent-decoded\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1597173294000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
