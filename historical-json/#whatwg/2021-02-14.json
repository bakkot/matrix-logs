{"content":{"body":"I'm 99% sure the answer is \"No\", but... I was just noticing some short-lived cookies might be lasting longer or shorter than they should due to them not yet using \"Max-Age\", which with client clocks not perfectly in sync means when setting \"Expires\"  to (now+ 10 seconds) on the server quite probably results in cookies being expired on arrival or lasting minutes/hours longer than they should.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1613333124000,"senderName":"Krinkle","senderId":"Krinkle@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"My question is: Was it ever considered to \"fix\" this by interpreting \"Set-Cookie: Expires\" in relation to the \"Date\" response header? There may be compat concerns which is why I think \"No\", but it seems like a neat way to e.g. improve modern browsers for web apps that never adopted Max-Age.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1613333179000,"senderName":"Krinkle","senderId":"Krinkle@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I looked for the original RFC and could not find any clear definition of what the expires date is interpreted in relation to, I'm guessing local device time. And didn't find relevant errattas or newer whatwg/w3c specs that would alter this for web browsers specifically, so I'm guessing it's still that way. I also couldn't find anything obvious in gecko/chromium/webkit tests that suggest the Date header is in any way considered today.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1613333285000,"senderName":"Krinkle","senderId":"Krinkle@irc"}
