{"content":{"body":"lgrahl: as much as I would like to see Web RTC use Streams properly, it seems like a long and expensive education campaign, much of which would be done on mailing lists I don't have easy access to. So my current strategy is to just hope for the best. Eventually they figured out promises, at some cost to them due to the transition. Probably similar things will happen for streams.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1528987458000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"}
