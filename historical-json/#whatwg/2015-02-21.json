{"content":{"body":"can probably profile a lot from fonts anyway just by doing layout and checking the results to see if it's installed, so browsers that care about privacy would need to be able to limit available fonts anyway","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1424477792000,"senderName":"zewt","senderId":"zewt@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"zewt: Yes, that's what I said earlier.  If you just have a few thousand font names and a few seconds of compute time, you can probe someone's installed local fonts today.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1424477827000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
