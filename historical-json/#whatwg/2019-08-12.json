{"content":{"body":"Question: There is Subresource Integrity to check integrity of loaded resources. For the use case I have in mind, I also want to ensure integrity of the main resource file (HTML). Thereby, the integrity of the whole \"app\" can be verified. Is there a way to do this without an extension?

{"content":{"body":"annevk: HPKP? Yeah, I know about that one. But this is more about not trusting the server that is delivering the web app. Similar to how I (AFAIK, and at least technically) don't need to trust the Play Store servers as the APK is signed.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1565624803000,"senderName":"lgrahl","senderId":"lgrahl@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Okay, so the alternative someone else brought up was to install a local webserver (go through all the hassle of doing this for every platform) that runs the backend of the app and the frontend then just connects to that.

{"content":{"body":"But I get your point. Maybe mobile apps and web apps actually are actually quite similar regarding those security properties and it just \"feels\" different.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1565626031000,"senderName":"lgrahl","senderId":"lgrahl@irc"}
