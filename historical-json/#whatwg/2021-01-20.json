{"content":{"body":"JakeA: so Chrome's behavior is a bit weird; it doesn't follow redirects across origins, but it does follow them within the same origin and as long as the final URL is identical to the URL determined to be the final URL in the initial request it will continue doing range requests","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1611137612000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
