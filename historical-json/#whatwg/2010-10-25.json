{"content":{"body":"yeah sure","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1287995943000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I mean, for a particular UA you can write a specification that includes UI requirements","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1287995944000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"true","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1287996000000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"another thing with all the console methods is, they don't actually write messages to the console","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1287998580000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"it can be any kind of object","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1287998641000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"so it's not a \"message\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1287998643000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
