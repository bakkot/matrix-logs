{"content":{"body":"so as far as the \"change the authoring guidance\" part I think that in part might amount to more than just changing guidance but also signficantly changing the normative document-conformance requirements","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266249000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266271000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266362000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yup","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266388000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so yeah I strongly agree with the goal","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266412000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"concretely I think it might amount to requiring/saying that h1-h6 cannot be used in ways differently than they could before <section> and <article> existed","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266498000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"personally I would like to see the spec say that","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266512000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"it's basically how *all* tools see it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266600000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the only exception are the tiny handful of things that implement the outline algorithm","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266621000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"all that said, I think the challenge there is a social one, not a technical one, in that we would be rolling back what the spec has previously made valid and even recommended to author-developers","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266677000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"getting author-developers to quit using h1 nested in <section>, despite years of the spec recommending that they do it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266749000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah that sounds about right","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266756000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"OK, well I'm funlly on board with that, if that's where we want to take it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266786000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Part of that I think is making the outline algorithm produce the same outline ATs use","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266792000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yup","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266799000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I have actually already implemented part of this in the HTML checker","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451266936000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"instead of showing what it looks like according to the outline algorithm","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451267127000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"tantek: but anyway I agree we should obselete section and hgroup if we could","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278332000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"that would be a good start","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278352000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"especially hgroup literally has no purpose at all outside of the outline algorithm","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278365000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and to be fair, I was a fan of hgroup originally","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278370000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"well currently I think its only purpose/effect in practice is to hide/suppress subheadings in the outline algorithm","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278409000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"used / taught it in the book and everything","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278411000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"well I think a lot of this is hindsight","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278430000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think most everybody thought this stuff was a good idea at the time","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278460000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I wanted to believe and all that.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278471000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Enriching the language to cover more use-cases etc.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278487000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278491000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Then it turned out many of these use-cases were too edge-case.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278507000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"And weren't worth the cognitive cost of added complexity to the core language.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278526000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah, and like a lot of other things with the platform, it's turned out to be a lot more complicated than it seemed, and has had bad unintended side effects","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278552000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Agreed","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278588000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Also I've pretty much given up on sets/pairs of nested tags for special functionality. Too awkward and easy to get wrong.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278625000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"And then we end up having to define what should happen when they're misused anyway","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278642000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"tags work best when they perform single self-standing functions","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278676000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think one good rule of thumb is that when somebody finds themselves repeatedly using an argument in support of something of the form \"Vendors should just fix their buggy implementations\", they seriously need to consider if they're on the wrong side of the argument (and the wrong side of history)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278714000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"tantek: yeah, it's a KISS thing in part","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278736000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yes, that's a good way to interpret the data point(s) of \"buggy implementations\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278757000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"FWIW it's taken *a lot* of work to figure out good ways to do hierarchical objects of any kind from microformats to microdata/rdfa to microformats2. And we're still finding edge cases to fix in parsers (to handle apparent natural author expectations).","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278947000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so as far as getting concrete progress maybe the lowest-hanging fruit is changing the spec so that we no longer have \"h1 inside section that acts like XHTML2 h\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278951000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"tantek: yeah I can imagine","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278969000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MIkeSmith yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451278996000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the only way we have made any such incremental progress with mf2 is with active live use on the web, implementation in parsers, use of parsers by actual sites consuming and doing stuff with the data, then publishing more of it. a tight real world feedback loop.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279045000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"without such real world publishing/implementation feedback loops, any attempt at language iteration is speculative at best, likely to fail at worst.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279068000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yup","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279075000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"hence I've pretty much given up on anything unimplemented 1yr+ after being spec'd","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279092000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"or specing at all before at least one prototype implementation","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279110000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah and that's also why we should always be extremely cautious about adding any new elements","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279135000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think we have been actually","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279155000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: at this point we have web components to experiment with new elements","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279159000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279166000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yes","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279184000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but yeah, I wouldn't add anything to the core until there's some pretty serious critical mass","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279191000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and OTOH I'd drop tons of stuff from the core, section/hgroup is just a start","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279215000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah I think we mostly have agreement about that these days, fortunately","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279218000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I mean about the critical-mass thing","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279259000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I figured","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279285000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"btw about h1-that-acts-like-h, for that I've already basically put some facts on the group by having the HTML checker (validator) emit warnings about it. I think I've had it emitting those warnings for almost a year or so now","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451279335000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
