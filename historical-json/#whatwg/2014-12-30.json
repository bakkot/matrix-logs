{"content":{"body":"agreed on that point","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1419951703000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"tantek: Pointing out internal inconsistencies in openstand makes sense.

{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith - yes the Netmundial thing is more interesting - there's a bit more provenance / names of people there","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1419952013000,"senderName":"tantek","senderId":"tantek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1419952020000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
