{"content":{"body":"would it be correct to claim that in the past, a regular page transition (as in link) resulted in a blank page before the new page was loaded","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594129448000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and that this is no longer the case with modern browsers?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594129454000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(the background here is just letting the browser handle navigation vs. pjax-style optimizations)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594129463000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"as in: I seem to recall the process used to be","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594129907000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"click link → draw about:blank → request → response → draw new page","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594129916000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and that second step is now skipped, resulting in less jarring visuals - am I fantasizing?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594129947000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"FND: there was never such a second step","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131325000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"What you are likely noticing is that your internet connection has gotten faster","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131347000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So the amount of time that the browser spends displaying `<html><head>... a bunch of stuff that doesn't cause the screen to be anything interesting ...` is decreased","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131375000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I didn't literally mean \"visit about:blank\", more \"clear the screen before _starting_ the request\" - but that's not the case either?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131387000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"let me check with throttling (again)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131393000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Indeed, no","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131396000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"so, I just made Slack (the slowest thing I could think of) reload, in the browser of course:","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131547000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"it _looks_ to me that even with a slow connection, the previous state persists until the new one is ready to replace it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131585000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"oh, that's probably a service worker lying to me","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131661000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"browsers don't start building the DOM until they've gotten 1024 bytes of a response, due to encoding sniffing","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131668000,"senderName":"andreubotella","senderId":"andreubotella@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess it's just a lot more complicated than my mental model accounted for","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131887000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so I gotta find a different way to convince folks that letting the browser handle page transitions (by default anyway) makes for decent UX","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594131946000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think there have been changes (and there continue to be) to how much work is done on the next document before making the switch","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594133100000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"that's a bit of a relief, so at least I'm not fantasizing _all_ of it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594133517000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"you don't happen to have some sort of link?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594133525000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(I realize much of this is probably engine-specific optimizations which are subject to change etc.)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594133566000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Not really, \"page load\" might yield some results in bug databases, but couldn't find anything useful quickly","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594133909000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"nods","msgtype":"m.emote"},"ts":1594133982000,"senderName":"FND","senderId":"FND@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"annevk: it can't be resolved in a single commit.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594139285000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"i.e. we need to merge the PR, then fix that TODO after the linking databases pick up the change.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594139303000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Domenic: I see","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1594139360000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
