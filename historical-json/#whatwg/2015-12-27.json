{"content":{"body":"I should really understand how the a11y layers work better.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451253959000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"They don't do anything with it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451253976000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I thought most a11y stuff had ways to jump between sections?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451253996000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"They just do a naive outline based on the headings","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254006000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Or is that just jump between sections?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254009000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"naive headings level","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254020000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah they provide jumping","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254046000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So do they have *any* concept of an outline?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254069000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But they do not understand nested h1","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254071000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Right, that's not what I'm asking.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254078000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"no they do not","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254082000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm asking do they have an outline or do they have \"jump to next heading in document order\"?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254100000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"They treat every h1 as a top level heading","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254111000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Do they have a concept of levels of heading?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254123000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"If they do, do we not need a conformance class for accessibility tools?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254145000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"They create a naive hierarchy based just on h1 to h6","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254155000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So you can navigate to/through all the H2 headings etc","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254210000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Right. So all we're asking them to change (currently) is how they build their hierarchy. OK.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254217000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254229000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"the way I address this problem in the HTML checker is to emit a warning if an h1 is used in a nested section or article","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254350000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So again: Do we need a new conformance class for accessiblity tools?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254363000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"that is, other than at the top level","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254367000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Because currently there isn't one that applies for stuff like that.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254371000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"We already have that conformance class, I think","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254386000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But if not, yeah, we should add it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254405000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"definitely","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254409000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess half the problem is the mismatch of things exposed via the accessibility APIs on different platforms","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254446000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and by different rendering engines","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254464000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"btw I also tried to address this need in the HTML checker by adding a Show Outline feature. which many people do useー just as many did use the Show Outline feature of the legacy W3C markup validator","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254528000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"gsnedders: yeah","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254555000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Steve Faulkner has been working to try to erase that mismatch and get more interoperability for a11y APIs","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254650000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"he edits a related spec","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254678000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess some of the problem is that much of that is OS level","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451254820000,"senderName":"gsnedders","senderId":"gsnedders@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yup","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451255118000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but IMHO another problem is that the a11y tree is not exposed to Web content","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451255560000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"it's one of the cases where the browser is doing something important and useful but Web developers have no way to observe it or examine it from script","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451255598000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"IMHO we need an a11y abstraction above the platform APIs, that is exposed for scripts to observe","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451255751000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"what I mean is, if you look at http://rawgit.com/w3c/html-api-map/master/index.html#el-article","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451255884000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"it shows that, depending on the platform API, <article> gets mapped to some thing called either ROLE_SYSTEM_GROUPING or ROLE_SYSTEM_DOCUMENT or ATK_ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME or AXDocumentArticle","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451255951000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so we should just have one standard abstract defined thing/name that it gets mapped to, and that should be exposed to scripts","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451256020000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and the tree of such things that browser engines create should be exposed to scripts","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451256054000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"and anyway I think what this shares with this outline-algorithm issue is that in general when you have specs defining things or stating requirements that normal Web developers have no way to observe and test from there Web application code, we're gonna have problems","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1451256275000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
