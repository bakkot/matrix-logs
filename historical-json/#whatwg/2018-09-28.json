{"content":{"body":"The obvious reason is that it has a bizarre rendering.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1538176136000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But if we isolate that, I'm not sure - I *think* there's sufficient legacy issues to make it troublesome, but I'm not certain about that. It might be doable.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1538176160000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Yeah, my impression of zcorpan's work was that interop was all over the place on edge cases, so I was wondering what the observable effects of shadow DOM vs. magic CSS boxes was. Apparently it affects ::before/::after, but unsure what else.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1538176338000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(And maybe ::before/::after is enough of a reason, i.e. if that works interoperably currently in a way that's not compatible with shadow DOM, then maybe we couldn't change it.)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1538176374000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah, magic CSS boxes can do *whatever they want* re: ::before/::after. Shadow DOM has a single common way to do this. (Tho, uh, I think it's not actually specified...)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1538176398000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"The thing with fieldset::before is, I think, that it goes before all content *inside* the fieldset, but it's technically after the rendered legend (which got lifted up into the border).","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1538176476000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So whether that violates Shadow DOM's treatment or not depends on how much of the \"rendered legend\" behavior is CSS-layout magic, and how much is CSS-box-tree magic.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1538176514000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'd prefer to consider it a magical CSS `display` value that's not author-exposed, in which case the rendering *is* consistent with Shadow DOM, unless there's some weirder edge cases I'm not aware of.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1538176563000,"senderName":"TabAtkins","senderId":"TabAtkins@irc"},
