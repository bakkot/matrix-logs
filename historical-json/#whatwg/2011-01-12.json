{"content":{"body":"it don't :)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1294791900000,"senderName":"jamesr_","senderId":"jamesr_@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yup","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1294791902000,"senderName":"jamesr_","senderId":"jamesr_@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"in SVG, you have SVGElement.getCurrentTime() (i think it is), which gives the current document time","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1294792020000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(i.e. starting from 0s)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1294792021000,"senderName":"heycam","senderId":"heycam@irc"},
