{"content":{"body":"well, any app that wants to do non-browser things with HTML5 and wants to do so in a robust way could use an XML pipeline with an HTML5 parser on input and an HTML5 serializer on output","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1184834880000,"senderName":"hsivonen","senderId":"hsivonen@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"I'll see if I can turn that into some kind of flow chart, showing the authoring in (X)HTML, storing as XHTML, and serialising as HTML5 to the client","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1184834882000,"senderName":"Lachy","senderId":"Lachy@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Lachy: after all, all the XML toolchain stuff is pretty cool. it's just that the server-to-browser step doesn't work in IE and the ingestion step to the pipeline is brittle if using a real Draconian XML parser","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1184835840000,"senderName":"hsivonen","senderId":"hsivonen@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"Pardon for the probably very odd question; but what is the point in HTML5 being made if its less strict?

(these are very basic questions, being asked by a 16 year old interested in the web)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1184864160000,"senderName":"Navarr","senderId":"Navarr@irc"},
