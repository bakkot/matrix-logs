{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: not quite \"the web\", but WeasyPrint makes PDF from web pages and adds an \"outline\" which is metadata that PDF viewers often show in a sidebar","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557052000,"senderName":"SimonSapin","senderId":"SimonSapin@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"SimonSapin: thanks","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557097000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"there is also some demand to have a TOC automatically generated in the document","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557113000,"senderName":"SimonSapin","senderId":"SimonSapin@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah I was thinking about it in the context of people saying that no browsers have implemented the outline algorithm","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557147000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"which yeah none of them have, but then there's no feature in the spec yet that actually exposes the outline to Web content or to Web authors","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557221000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so browsers don't really have anything to implement","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557237000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"In WeasyPrint this is not based on the outline algorithm but on CSS bookmark-level http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-gcpm/#bookmarks which by default is <h1> ... <h6>","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557240000,"senderName":"SimonSapin","senderId":"SimonSapin@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah of course that works fine if you document doesn't use nested sections","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557280000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"ok","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557295000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so anyway I can imagine that authors might like to have a way to automatically include a generated outline in a document","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557339000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"including a ToC being the most common case","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557352000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yes, for printed stuff this is a big demand","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557377000,"senderName":"SimonSapin","senderId":"SimonSapin@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"for the web not as much I guess. But WeasyPrint/PrinceXML/Antenna House are tools for printing that happen to take HTML/CSS as input more than web browsers","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355557558000,"senderName":"SimonSapin","senderId":"SimonSapin@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"SimonSapin: I think for the non-Web case we don't need that feature as port of the browser engine","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355558377000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"because those are sorta really all post-processing tools","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355558413000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: eventually (ie. given infinite time to work on it) I’d want to have that in WeasyPrint’s engine, not in a separate processing step. Maybe something you can trigger with CSS","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1355559178000,"senderName":"SimonSapin","senderId":"SimonSapin@irc"},
