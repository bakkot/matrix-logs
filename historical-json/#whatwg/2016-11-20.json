{"content":{"body":"tobie: I think we should not have a dfn for the thing ending in type","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649007000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: well, it certainly makes things easier.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649089000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"tobie: in your example Foo would be marked up as Bikeshed dictionary I think","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649096000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"tobie: for xref purposes","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649108000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: oh.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649134000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: right.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649143000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"tobie: records would have that only through typedef I guess","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649146000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: that's the example TabAtkins mentioned, right?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649165000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"(pardon the absence of HTML escaping.)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649214000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"tobie: well, you can't really name a record other than through a typedef I think","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649265000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: I guess  I think of dictionary Foo when someone talks of a dictionary type. So I'm not sure what it means for records","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649267000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: to your point","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649286000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So you have records, dictionaries, sequences as concepts / IDL instances","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649381000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: I would say: {{Foo}} is a [=dictionary type=]. But record<DOMString, DOMString> is a [=record=].","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649391000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"They are also types in that you can distinguish them","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649412000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: mmm. true.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649458000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think both of those are types of sorts","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649460000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Since they are not instances","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649474000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"And I guess another aspect is that there is hierarchy of sorts","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649527000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"There is a general dictionary type, but also more specific variants such as Foo","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649559000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess that makes sense.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649595000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Though you can't type-test for Foo, so maybe there is only generic","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649596000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think what you're suggesting is there's no reason to distinguish in markup between: [=dictionary type=] and [=dictionary=] [=type=].","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649671000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(or even [=dictionary=] type)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649693000,"senderName":"tobie","senderId":"tobie@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Yeah, I'm leaning towards the latter myself","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649785000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"That is the convention the platform has used thus far","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649802000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"For \"concepts\"","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649818000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"We should maybe get more formal about types too though","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649843000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"\"Type(x) is URL\" might be interesting, but not sure and it has not been needed thus far","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479649891000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: how about we check the usage statistics of the doctype again in a few years?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479683342000,"senderName":"zcorpan","senderId":"zcorpan@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"MikeSmith: you would have annoyed 400 people in two days had you changed the validator already, right? :-)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479683496000,"senderName":"zcorpan","senderId":"zcorpan@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"zcorpan: yup","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479683579000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"thanks much for the data","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479683586000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Iâ€™ll keep the use counter on in the checker","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479683620000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"np","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479683628000,"senderName":"zcorpan","senderId":"zcorpan@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so yeah we can look again in few years but I suspect we are always going to have some number like that as long as we still have XSLT etc","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479683690000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"i guess so","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1479683927000,"senderName":"zcorpan","senderId":"zcorpan@irc"}
