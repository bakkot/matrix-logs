{"content":{"body":"if you consider what is on http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/ to be canonical, then the test should have different assertions. but it's kind of weird because the dcvs.w3.org page and the xhr.spec.whatwg.org are different, and even though the xhr.spec.whatwg.org draft is newer, I can't see in its history where it ever said TypeError","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1399693669000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"so that PR is all about matching what is in xhr.spec.whatwg.org, but one of the editors should make the call about that and maybe update the specs to match","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1399693728000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"I guess presumably if you want to care about dblclick events you need to defer action, and cancel if you get a dblclick event. that isn't very good, but it seems better than worrying about button numbering, since different user agents and configurations could assign different interactions to different buttons","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1399760532000,"senderName":"caitp","senderId":"caitp@irc"},
