{"content":{"body":"So I've been battling with this Safari 307 redirect error. I was able to get a 307 POST redirect working with another server with a bit different redirect request. The main difference seems to be that, with this other server, I get the headers \":authority:\", \":method:\", \":path:\" and \":scheme:\" into the redirect request, and they are not appearing in the one that isnt working.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1569397531000,"senderName":"cihanmbebek","senderId":"cihanmbebek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'm not at all sure how my browser is determining if to include them or not. I'm getting quite sure that this might be a bug in Safari.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1569397531000,"senderName":"cihanmbebek","senderId":"cihanmbebek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So what I'm doing is I'm comparing the requests on chrome to determine whats the difference, since I can't really get Safari to output any info about my failed request (the Safari devtools are horrible)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1569397605000,"senderName":"cihanmbebek","senderId":"cihanmbebek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"If anyone knows anything about those headers or why my 307 redirect might work on all other browsers except Safari, I'd reaaally appreciate any help :D","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1569397632000,"senderName":"cihanmbebek","senderId":"cihanmbebek@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"annevk I think it might actually be the other way around, that its broken on http1","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1569401268000,"senderName":"cihanmbebek","senderId":"cihanmbebek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"coz the request without the http2 headers seems to work","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1569401277000,"senderName":"cihanmbebek","senderId":"cihanmbebek@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but im unsure how my browser determines if the redirect should be done with or without the http2 headers, the request and response which returns the 307 look exactly alike as far as I can see","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1569401317000,"senderName":"cihanmbebek","senderId":"cihanmbebek@irc"},
