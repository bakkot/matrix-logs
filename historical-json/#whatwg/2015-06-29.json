{"content":{"body":"annevk: I guess that means you want some kind of priority between different kinds of audio","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435565768000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"you mean having labels that map to the three behaviors we have, but which also have something to do with priorities?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435565892000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ambient-solo doesn't sound right. Mute/pause telephone audio when going to background?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435565900000,"senderName":"davve","senderId":"davve@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yeah, oops","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435565946000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"we have talked about an ambient-solo which would be slightly different then","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435565959000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I see, my bad","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435565970000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"But yeah, maybe something like priorities is needed, I haven't really thought it through entirely","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566004000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"anyway, yeah, phone calls behave like transient-solo, but there would be no way to build a WebRTC app which can trump all other apps in the same way that I presume the built-in phone app can","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566011000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I don't think we want Phone > Skype though","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566046000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"actually on Android it doesn't seem like the phone app has special powers, but on iOS it probably does","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566063000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Though there should be some way to indicate to the user that while you're on Skype, someone is calling (either through Phone, or perhaps something else, like Hangouts)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566081000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"oh, you mean how to actually make the ringing sound without interrupting everyone else?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566118000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"So while you're on Skype, Hangouts tries to become active, but that fails and therefore it sends some other kind of notification?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566132000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"or whatever the sound is, you mentioned it could be different","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566133000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so on Android you can check if another app says it's playing music, or if the phone call is in progress (separate from the audio focus system) but I don't think there's a way for say the Android Skype and Viber apps to play entirely nicely together, knowing when the other is in a call","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566221000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"haven't investigated that specifically though, but that's my guess","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566246000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I suppose it's best to discuss specific changes in GitHub issues and involving those who have done the work on Firefox OS","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566484000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Hopefully baku will participate directly","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566522000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yeah, a big hangout to get everyone in sync would be nice","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435566755000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"philipj: how would you implement from script a pause invoked from the lock screen?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435570613000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: you'd have to keep track of all the media elements where you had assigned the session, and more importantly you'd need an event for when the lock screen pause button is pressed, and there isn't one yet","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435571131000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so multiple things missing :)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435571148000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"philipj: right, so I guess that's what I'm asking for","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435571190000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"philipj: you also want pause/play I think if you need to synchronize with non-media element stuff, such as an animation","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435571210000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"annevk: to merely synchronize, the smallest addition would be to expose when the session state goes from active to interrupted and back","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435571287000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"which we also don't have","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435571293000,"senderName":"philipj","senderId":"philipj@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"philipj: that's sort of the basic thing you need for telephony, with some extensions around service workers I guess...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435571519000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I‚Äôd like to propose <input type=time>‚Äôs max value to go beyond 23:59 e.g. 48:00 or 72:00. Any thoughts?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435572278000,"senderName":"mrflix","senderId":"mrflix@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"mrflix: yeah, except browser vendors are already not so great about implementing the existing input types. better to just roll your own custom element.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435573050000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"it'll be a lot faster than trying to convince all the vendors to implement your new input type","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1435573065000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
