It's just a thesis that not all software needs to automatically be able to figure out that gopher://foo is the same as gopher://foo:70.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582171654000,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"Domenic@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"Ideally there would be no automatic port mappings, and ports would always be specified explicitly, but that's not compatible with deployed software. We found that removing the gopher/70 mapping *was* compatible with a large deploy-base of software, so we did.
