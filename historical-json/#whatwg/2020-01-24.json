{"content":{"body":"eeeps: it's a preexisting issue, but we should maybe make it more visible if we end up doing this, e.g., by having a bit fat issue marker that says this algorithm is to be abstracted and reused by various other places, such as background-image, etc.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1579882991000,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"annevk@irc"},
