{"content":{"body":"s/modifies/modified/","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380716901000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"because of backwards compatibility","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380716994000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"yup","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717120000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I think it could work","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717124000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"default value of align would need to be \"middle,middle\" anyway","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717190000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but I think that we should pick the names and behavior that make the most sense in the long term","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717191000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"ok, that's fair enough","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717217000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"sticking with some css-likeness is also sensible","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717248000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess in CSS terms there's vertical-align and text-align","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717290000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"not really: vertical-align is with reference to a line whereas we are talking about the cue box","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717349000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"nessy, I'm just saying what properties actually exist in CSS, not that they map to what we want","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717371000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but text-align is definitely appropriate for alignment withing the box","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717374000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"right","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717383000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"then there's the (obsolete) align and valign attributes...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717385000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I'd try to avoid making false friends","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717412000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah, if they actually mean something completely different, I don't know in detail what these attributes do","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717481000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"we could have align and valign instead of a single align with two values, if you think that makes more sense","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717495000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"hmm, valign means vertical-align, which I guess makes it weird for vertical text","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717545000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but the align attribute in HTML used to mean more what text-align in CSS does, so we shouldn't really do that","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717556000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"nessy, davve tells me that align used to be something like floats","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717585000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"that's why I suggested cue-align - it has no history and less confusion","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717590000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"oh!","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717608000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yeah, but if we need to keep the existing align it needs to do *something*...","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717622000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"maybe a shorthand that sets both cue-align and text-align?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717636000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"foolip: it depends on the element (html's align)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717651000,"senderName":"zcorpan","senderId":"zcorpan@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"we have to set a cue alignment for the position direction and for the line direction, so we already need two values for that","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717693000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"foolip: are you suggesting to extend \"align\" to a triple value attribute, first the text-align within the cue, then the position direction cue align, then the line direction cue align?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717749000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"no, I don't have a finished solution that I think is sane, yet","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717810000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but we have an existing align that takes a single value, presumably we want to keep that and let it behave as close as possible to what it always has?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717838000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"yes","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717855000,"senderName":"nessy","senderId":"nessy@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"1. add new granular properties *-align and let their default values depend on the old align","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1380717906000,"senderName":"foolip","senderId":"foolip@irc"},
