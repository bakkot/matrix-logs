{"content":{"body":"Hey! HTML question - I want to move the image-specific Client Hints definitions away from the Client Hints IETF draft and into one of the web specs. IMO, the natural place for that would be the HTML spec. I want to see if: a) folks here agree? b) If so, where? somewhere in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#images? Or elsewhere?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1551959338000,"senderName":"yoav","senderId":"yoav@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"The actual setting would be in Fetch, but I want to define what those features are, and HTML's image section seems to me like the best fit.
