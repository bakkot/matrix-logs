{"content":{"body":"https://bitbucket.org/validator/validator/src/7625938e679a27265ae625e57b5ed33c063dfacb/schema/xhtml10/style.rnc?at=default#cl-44","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1385970812000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"oh wait maybe I see why","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1385970868000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"you added it to some other patterns","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1385970970000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"anyway, I ask above if you remember why you zapped it from style","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1385971039000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I assume it's probably because you intended that it be included in some other pattern that the style schema inclluded","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1385971121000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"but anyway at this point it doesn't, and the effect is that the validator flags any style element with an xml:space attribute as an error","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1385971240000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"which is especially a problem if you turn the \"load external entities\" option on, because the XHTML1 DTD makes xml:space #FIXED 'preserve' for style","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1385971401000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"so the XML parser adds it if it's not there already, and then the validator flags it as an error even though it's not even present in the input document (pre-parsing)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1385971477000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"the problem is that because the style.attlist pattern doesn't include Core.attrib, that has the effect of xml:space no longer being allowed for the style element","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1385971913000,"senderName":"MikeSmith","senderId":"MikeSmith@irc"},
