{"content":{"body":"aidansw: well i'm not sure it's *just* legacy. like i said, it'd likely make parsing much much harder for not much value","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1555132853000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"That is fair, but I don't exactly get how it would make parsing harder.  From what I have seen(I have never done parsing so I wouldn't know) it just ends all multiline comments when it sees */.  But } for example doesn't have the same effect.  Why would */ not hav been made to behave basically the same as } but for comments?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1555133211000,"senderName":"aidansw","senderId":"aidansw@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"not really sure. i assume that with comments it has to be greedy - consuming everything until it sees a stop token - but with braces it has all sorts of grammar rules to apply","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1555133382000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"you just need to keep a counter you increment on /* and decrement on */","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1555159057000,"senderName":"devsnek","senderId":"devsnek@irc"},
