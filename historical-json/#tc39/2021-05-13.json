{"content":{"body":"yeah, but I often want to explain why","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620921303000,"senderName":"jmdyck","senderId":"jmdyck@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"altho we can click the “force pushed” link and it’ll show the diff, which often covers it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620921427000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"not really; when the force push includes a rebase it tends to swamp any other changes included","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620923249000,"senderName":"Bakkot","senderId":"Bakkot@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"sure, but that tells you that the force push was to rebase. i'm not sure why it matters that the reason was to resolve conflicts, but if it's helpful for you, go for it","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620923591000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"my point is that sometimes a force push is just a rebase and sometimes it is both a rebase and additional changes, and you can't tell which it is just from the diff","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620923823000,"senderName":"Bakkot","senderId":"Bakkot@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"sure. but a comment \"to resolve conflicts\" doesn't tell you that either","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620923877000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I read such a comment to imply it did not include any changes other than those necessary to get the diff to land cleanly, which does tell me that it is just a rebase","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620923968000,"senderName":"Bakkot","senderId":"Bakkot@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"alrighty then","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620924011000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"(for me that's the default assumption, and i'd expect a comment only when there are changes beyond that, that also aren't already resolving an existing review comment)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620924048000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"I do not share this assumption","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620924102000,"senderName":"Bakkot","senderId":"Bakkot@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"wasn't trying to start an argument, i just figured the reason for the comments was a notification, which has been unnecessary for a year or more","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620924775000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},
{"content":{"body":"if the reason is to explain the changes, great, but i've not yet seen a comment from anyone that actually explains what changes were made, whether to resolve conflicts or existing comments","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620924806000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},

{"content":{"body":"(I guess you probably can get away with specifying a sufficiently well-specified PRNG by reference rather than writing down the algorithm, even in the final version, so \"implementation of xoroshiro goes here\" is probably fine even for the non-initial version)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1620947402000,"senderName":"Bakkot","senderId":"Bakkot@irc"},
