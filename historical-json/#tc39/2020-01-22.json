{"content":{"body":"i have a comment in es6-shim that mentions how Chrome 38 shipped Array keys/entries/Symbol.iterator, but not values. Chrome shipped it in later versions. I'm now checking on Chrome 38, however, and it seems that Array.prototype.values is there. Is it possible that Chrome wrapped it in a live-updating feature flag as far back as 2014, and that *all* versions of Chrome that have keys/entries/Symbol.iterator now also have values?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1579653266000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},
