{"content":{"body":"annevk: but what i don't see is the risk here. if i `import` from a URL, i have already given over control to that URL - if it changes from JSON to JS, that's no more risky than it changing from \"good JS\" to \"malicious JS\".","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1570551992000,"senderName":"ljharb","senderId":"ljharb@irc"},
