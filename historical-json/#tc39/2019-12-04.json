{"content":{"body":"Both of those proposals are syntactic sugar to declare objects of constants. The second proposal was a little more flexible, allow enumerators to be passed to constructor functions before definition. The idea I linked above is syntactic sugar for quickly constructing static fields/instances in a class.
