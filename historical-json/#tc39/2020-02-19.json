{"content":{"body":"(yeah I agree...which is why I'm surprised I said it just now. For WK, there's a metaphor in which revisions are \"rolled in and out\" of SVN trunk, as if it were a physical tree trunk built up from disc-shaped slices. It's annoying because it directly conflicts with the normal meaning of \"roll out\" in English, but I guess I've gotten used to it over the years)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1582075346000,"senderName":"rkirsling","senderId":"rkirsling@irc"},
