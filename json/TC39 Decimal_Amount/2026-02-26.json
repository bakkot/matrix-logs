You count 99, 100, 101. I shouldn't be forced to write \"1.00E2\" to make a 3-digit number. I consider a low-precision integer sufficiently uncommon that I'm okay if you need to write \"1E2\" in order to get it.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1772092569026,"senderName":"sffc","senderId":"@sffc:mozilla.org","id":"$bcSl0johVzqiyttccgijpbgeBrFxJ4E2jPufA2xeRtY"}
