{"content":{"body":"TL; DR: My partner and I started a DIY home renovation project over Christmas and our house has been chaos since then (kitchen unusable, eating out all the time, rooms disorganized, etc). Then, in January, my job situation changed and I had to start figuring out what I would be doing next, and that delayed finishing the project. Between those two things, I've had basically 0 cycles to put toward writing tests.\n\nI finally do have clarity on my job situation and am effectively between jobs at the moment, so I'm now back at full steam getting my house together. As soon as that's at a stopping point, my plan is to work on the tests. We still have 2.5 weeks until the plenary, and I expect to have time to work on the tests next week, so I do think I will be able to get a draft PR that is mostly complete up by the plenary.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1710945480188,"senderName":"pzuraq","senderId":"@pzura:matrix.org","id":"$ppnogBglJwEdJo8h5olvfYMamvk39huIhka0WBCYV3M"},
