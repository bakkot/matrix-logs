{"content":{"body":"After more digging, it looks like one of the dupes of this bug (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1487920) has been escalated to P0, thanks to Mathias Bynens.\n\nIt looks like the root cause was upgrading ICU from 72 to 73.1: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=14285. This V8 bug was reported back in August, it's a bummer that we didn't fix it then. Now lots of users are breaking.

{"content":{"body":"I don't know enough about the bug to know for sure, but looking at the symptoms it could be that ICU is not updating its internal timezone ID when the system timezone ID changes. This might explain why it wasn't reproduced in testing, because the bug would only show up when the system timezone changed, and only on MacOS 14.
