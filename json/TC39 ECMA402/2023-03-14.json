{"content":{"body":"Different topic: is there a rough timeline for when ICU4X (specifically the parts that power time zone APIs) will be included in V8?  Later this year? 2024? 2025?  A few things I'be been working on lately, including the proposal above, may rely on ICU changes. So trying to get a sense for how whether those ICU changes would be in ICU4C (which I assume is harder to justify change given ICU4X is right around the corner) or ICU4X (which I assume is somewhat more flexible).","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1678766403408,"senderName":"justingrant","senderId":"@justingrant:matrix.org","id":"$Hpvlb8fbWGZRblhi8X3mlK06-uL6ysCS6f0fsx3clLM"},
{"content":{"body":"The road to V8 running ICU4X is long. An example scenario is if we end 2023 with buy-in from all sides and then commit 2024 to doing migration and testing and roll something out in 2025.
