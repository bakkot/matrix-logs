{"content":{"body":"Different topic: is there a rough timeline for when ICU4X (specifically the parts that power time zone APIs) will be included in V8?  Later this year? 2024? 2025?  A few things I'be been working on lately, including the proposal above, may rely on ICU changes. So trying to get a sense for how whether those ICU changes would be in ICU4C (which I assume is harder to justify change given ICU4X is right around the corner) or ICU4X (which I assume is somewhat more flexible).","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1678766403408,"senderName":"justingrant","senderId":"@justingrant:matrix.org","id":"$Hpvlb8fbWGZRblhi8X3mlK06-uL6ysCS6f0fsx3clLM"},
{"content":{"body":"The road to V8 running ICU4X is long. An example scenario is if we end 2023 with buy-in from all sides and then commit 2024 to doing migration and testing and roll something out in 2025. But to be clear there is no such consensus or agreement at this point. A number of V8 people are amenable to the idea but there is no official roadmap yet","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1678772539353,"senderName":"sffc","senderId":"@sffc:mozilla.org","id":"$kGGAGN6Ei8hw9FWzLqYzCuJr4h23TwrGGU1v0qQx9qc"},
{"content":{"body":"Got it, 2025 sounds like a reasonable target. Thanks for sharing. So essentially no proposal in the next year or so should depend on ICU4X, but nor should any proposal put big new requirements on ICU4C either.
