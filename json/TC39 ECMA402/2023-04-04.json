{"content":{"body":"Richard Gibson and I opened an editorial PR (https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3035) for ECMA-262 to refactor how time zone identifiers are handled. Feedback welcome!\n\nThe goals of this PR are:\n\n- Clarify/simplify existing 262 text dealing with time zone identifiers (non-402 implementations can use IANA TZDB, so identifier-related text was already in 262).\n- Rationalize overlapping spec text between 262, 402, and Temporal. Doing this will simplify 402 now and also make it less disruptive to 262 and 402 spec text when Temporal is merged later.\n- Avoid the need for 402 to override 262 AOs relating to time zone identifiers.\n- Centralize implementation-defined logic in a smaller number of AOs.\n- Add optional recommendations to avoid TZDB footguns. In the future, these recommendations may be changed and/or strengthened as part of [proposal-canonical-tz](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-canonical-tz).\n- Make it easier to make changes to identifer-related logic in the future, like what Richard and I are working towards in proposal-canonical-tz. (Although changes in this PR are IMO helpful even if that proposal doesn't move fwd.)\n\nI'd particularly like feedback on a naming thing: Richard is concerned that the terms \"canonicalization\" and \"canonical identifier\" are too strong given that canonicalization can change over time in IANA TZDB and because other uses of \"canonical\" mostly refer to canonicalizing of upper/lower case. So in the PR we're using \"resolving\" and \"primary identifier\" instead.
