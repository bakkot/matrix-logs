{"content":{"body":"I'm very skeptical of the callingContext direction. I'm sorry that I missed the last AsyncContext call, but I think we should discuss this further among ourselves before making it the focus of the presentation next week. Let's focus on the things that are settled. We can briefly mention that we're working on the HTML integration, and this is one idea that's been floated, but it's still very early and we're just beginning to consider it.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1712152655840,"senderName":"littledan","senderId":"@littledan:matrix.org","id":"$hBMIYffRRhfMcU6-YbwHkoqFXuuoqu3as7yE6FCRP7k"},
