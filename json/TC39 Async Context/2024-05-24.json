{"content":{"body":"It's a spectrum. \"Never registration\" is one extreme end, and I don't think it's tenable. But for any _given_ API (e.g. events as a whole, or possibly split-out per event emitter/type) I'm very wary of a zalgoesque situation where the callback might run in one of two different contexts depending on unpredictable future conditions. I think that in the same way that it's important to know precisely whether a callback will run synchronously or not, it's similarly important to know ahead of time which context it will run in, and having a fallback muddies it and is (in my view) a worse trade-off than running in a \"useless\" context by default.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1716519746483,"senderName":"Steve Hicks","senderId":"@stephenhicks:matrix.org","id":"$1Vz8Atz0BJSsYX1qfZHPJGKQDbTsPhkMDXc6MbV3czw"},
