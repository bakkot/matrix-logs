{"content":{"body":"Great, thanks for writing slides, Justin, these look really good! Some notes:\n- IMPORTANT: right before Slide 2, insert a slide which quickly lists some use cases (including at least 2 client-side use cases, plus a third thing which is internal infrastructure within web standards [Yoav's thing]); hopefully this can also link to Andreu's more detailed description at the top of the README [The rest of these comments are nits, but the motivation is key.]\n- In Slide 4, note explicitly that this is what Promise .then, setTimeout, etc would do. [Or: Consider consolidating slides 3 and 4 into something which just shows the interface, saving the pseudocode implementation for a bonus slide. I am undecided on whether we should do this]\n- Write somewhere on the slides that we consider all of the questions raised to be things that we aim to resolve between Stage 2 and Stage 3. Emphasize this especially for the web platform integration and unhandled rejection context--these must be spelled out, and we plan to work with Yoav Weiss on this, who was already thinking in this direction for the previously mentioned internal use case.\n- The constructor parameters idea is really superficial; should it really be the first slide? Maybe we should start with the important issues. [Also IMO the parameter order should be reversed but that's a comment I should make in the issue]\n- The web platform doesn't have a lot of cases to consider because it's weird--this is just an inherent difficulty with AsyncContext wherever it's done. I think \"case by case\" might make it sound too bad--we'll have some organizing principles, we just don't have a proposal yet. The proposal here will be a precondition for Stage 3. (BTW: Avoid saying \"a Stage $n question\" because people use this term both to mean, a precondition to enter $n or something to discuss during $n)\n- Focus on explaining next steps towards resolution when presenting each of these slides.\n[More notes to come, have to go]","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<p>Great, thanks for writing slides, Justin, these look really good!
