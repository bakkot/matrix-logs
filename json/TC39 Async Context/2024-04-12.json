The RPC service has some middleware registered that gets a response of a certain type and then indexes all the cached ItemDetail models by their ID, retrieves the matching detail, and updates its votes.  The UI data binding then picks up this change and rerenders the component.  What I need to be able to do is thread a trace through that sequence of loosely coupled triggers.
