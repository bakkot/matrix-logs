{"content":{"body":"Apologies for the delay in sharing these docs. I needed to prune some company-specific bits and navigate our convoluted process for making Google Docs actually public. 😅\n\nThe first doc is a bunch of explanation on the problems we have with existing attempts at context management and some possible solutions we're iterating on to solve these problems in a more flexible way. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v8tMzV51Cuz32-60dhopoIMIxWfy_epOIRwoL5LmKVc/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe second doc is partly relevant in that it describes an integration between the Diagnostics Channel concept and context management for the purpose of providing control to users to decide in which ways they want to propagate context for their specific store around particular points defined by library code as possibly interesting. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTZ2C5BKsoVRnU_ihyi93blF3cxXIbqqcIaSYurhBRk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nI additionally have some slides from a recent internal talk I can also share which covers this overlap more briefly, and with specific examples. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jYO45MudKGPOtir5hK0_wB7XS0D_ksLe4j5NvC8YfTc/edit?usp=sharing","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1714996447602,"senderName":"Stephen Belanger","senderId":"@stephenbelanger:matrix.org","id":"$I4TuLWIO3X_nWD1Yp6-MWRdxOLCqOWtvT5h_zixrxrM"},
