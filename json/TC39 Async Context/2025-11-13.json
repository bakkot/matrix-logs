{"content":{"body":"I was discussing the Governor proposal with some folks and someone mentioned a question of how it worked with AsyncContext and the async iterator helpers.  In particular, my understanding (though I could be wrong) is that there's a slight mismatch between iterator helpers and hypothetical generator-based implementations of those helpers - in particular iter.map() runs the function in the same context that called next() whereas the trivial function* map() would run the mapper in the initial caller's context.  I would assume the async iterator helpers will be similar - are these assumptions/understandings correct?","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1763056833869,"senderName":"Steve Hicks","senderId":"@stephenhicks:matrix.org","id":"$Mu5AODHBD2MGEdjfRsCRwdRKtG88IMWczbYZp8iXqI4"},
