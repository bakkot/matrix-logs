{"content":{"body":"Hey Andreu Botella \n\nI've had a deeper read of the WEB-INTEGRATIONS document and especially at the Events section. I'm interested in the difference between the \"Browser-originated dispatches\" and \"Asynchronous dispatches\" and specifically what is meant by 'where the event originates from JS calling into some web API'.\n\nWhat constitutes a JS call into a web API here? Is it only explicit function calls, as given in the XHR examples? Or would it include events fired implicitly by the rendering of components.\n\nThe example I have in my mind is the following:\n\nWe have a component that renders something, and that component has an animation defined in css. Work is done after the transition is completed, via 'transitionend' event. That can obviously happen from a number of different paths.\n\nWould the context that scheduled the work be considered 'some web API'?","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<p>Hey <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@abotella:igalia.com\">Andreu Botella</a></p>\n<p>I've had a deeper read of the WEB-INTEGRATIONS document and especially at the Events section.
