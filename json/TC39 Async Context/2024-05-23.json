Imagine the parent is doing a fetch and creates an abort signal, then passes that same signal to the children to perform their fetches. They each setup their own fetch state otherwise, maybe logging.

If you pass the same signal to the children, then aborting them is exactly what I'd expect.  It should be a conscious choice which signal to pass, and reusing a signal indicates to me precisely that you want them all to abort together.","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<mx-reply><blockquote><a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/!eQuZUAhGqudVFPodUG:matrix.org/$qc4o6xAuLmMGSnqobU-1Kx7gEQxRCIkpOM4xpMz0YOk?via=matrix.org&via=mozilla.org&via=igalia.com\">In reply to</a> <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@jridgewell:matrix.org\">@jridgewell:matrix.org</a><br>I think we can extend this as well.
