{"content":{"body":"Is there a CSSWG type channel on Matrix? Someone here might know in any case. Has there ever been a discussion for allowing \"display: contents\" to appear invisible to CSS descendant combinators? I know that kind of goes against hierarchical way CSS works. I was thinking either a style on the element like display-contents: ignore.  Or an optional descendant like .foo > :display-contents > .bar that descends through any number of display: contents. Does the fact that display is computed make this impossible/difficult?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1692820032834,"senderName":"sirisian","senderId":"@sirisian:matrix.org","id":"$f5Xq5d7ZHm44rX-nmsaSstcNQZM_lXAYFGfHPD7FS88"}
