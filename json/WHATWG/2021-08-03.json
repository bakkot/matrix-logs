Here is an example:</p>\n<pre><code>https://google.com\\uFF03@evil.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>A parser would give the following results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>username: <code>google.com\\uFF03</code></li>\n<li>host: <code>evil.com</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But with its NFKC (where <code>\\uFF03</code> is normalized to <code>#</code>):</p>\n<pre><code>https://google.com#@evil.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>a parser would give these results instead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>host: <code>google.com</code></li>\n<li>fragment: <code>@evil.com</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, the string and one of its normal forms are both valid URL records, but with different structures. The discrepancies can be exploited in many IDNA-aware applications to fool users or even bypass security checking. This attack is known as HostSplit.</p>\n","msgtype":"m.text"},"m.relates_to":{"event_id":"$NUpr_UxqIi1FrZXYurCq16q16CgV5BP9uFCg-S9xPe8","rel_type":"m.replace"},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1628024916298,"senderName":"favonia","senderId":"@favonia:matrix.org","id":"$o8tEaFETcW9jcRe-yl3O58R6sc3CFzx7hYb8SakNSnM"},
