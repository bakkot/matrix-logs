{"content":{"body":"Hey gang - in last week's WHATNOT meeting (https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11801#top) I suggested cutting the AMER+APAC (4pm Pacific) meeting out of our rotation, and doing 3 AMER+EMEA and one EMEA+APAC in the rotation.  If anyone doesn't think this is a good idea, now would be a good time to discuss.  I'll raise it again at tomorrow's WHATNOT to confirm.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1761173427148,"senderName":"cwilso","senderId":"@cwilso:matrix.org","id":"$V5J8duCOEnXuoLYME0oP9h-crT14sxib1ZI88tkHFhI"}
