{"content":{"body":"Hi people, hope you are having a good day. I have a question, how would one unit test the correctness of an HTML parser, should I just find several malformed html pages and test against what Chrome or Mozilla parses in the browser, I'll also appreciate it there are links to test cases, e.g if you have so so so malformed structure, you get the following output, something like that.
