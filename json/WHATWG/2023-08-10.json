{"content":{"body":"The spec describes both classic async scripts and module async scripts as executing as soon as they are available. In reality, classic async scripts may execute a tiny bit later, but since the exact moment of network response finishing isn't exposed, the tiny bit later looks as if it was part of the network timing. However, for inline async scripts that have no external dependencies, \"as soon as they are available\" in principle has a well-defined point in time relative to the HTML parse. However, it seems bad to grant special guarantees to that case. Do I understand correctly that the spec doesn't mean to grant guarantees about that special case and it's OK for the parse to progress a bit before an inline async module script without external dependencies executes?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1691659788230,"senderName":"hsivonen","senderId":"@hsivonen:mozilla.org","id":"$HHzwCs9d3k7afK1KsY65s2IgnCdoescflr8JNqhMCH4"}
