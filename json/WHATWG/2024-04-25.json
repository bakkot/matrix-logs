{"content":{"body":"I wonder if GitHub would benefit from having the equivalent of (Mozilla) Bugzilla's needinfo feature. There's quite a few threads where someone is asked a question and there's no answer. Presumably because the person asked got busy and has lost track of their notifications. And although needinfo can get problematic as well, it might improve a bunch of these cases?","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1714050196700,"senderName":"annevk","senderId":"@annevk:matrix.org","id":"$rj7kgN27mWiLkVqgHqrclTa3NtFdkUoAwfA6mmroaFw"},
{"content":{"body":"I guess one imaginable way to hack around it in GitHub for now would be to add a label with the username of the needsinfo person. For some projects at least, the set of likely needsinfo people isnâ€™t very large. and you could just create the labels as you need them.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1714052002707,"senderName":"sideshowbarker","senderId":"@sideshowbarker:matrix.org","id":"$d0nUll_LuRcFiu_p74k3ZgWbYYk8ECc9tTGgqMfUoKg"},

{"content":{"body":"I guess the reality is that for some people and some projects, they may be in an almost constant state of getting so many GH notifications that they have stopped being able to pay attention to them.
