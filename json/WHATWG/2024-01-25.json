{"content":{"body":"I have one additional question about how the spec is written. In defining the dirty checkedness flag, it says: \"[the dirty checkedness flag] must be set to true whenever the user interacts with the control in a way that changes the checkedness\". However, elsewhere it states that setting the checked IDL attribute also sets the flag. Is this some special definition of \"user\" that the spec is using, including both human and script users? Or is it just incorrect/incomplete/ambiguous? The definition of the dirty value flag includes similar language but also says \"(It is also set to true when the value is programmatically changed, as described in the definition of the value IDL attribute.)\", which makes me think the answer is the latter?","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1706145429859,"senderName":"Ari Entlich","senderId":"@atrigent:matrix.org","id":"$MJ_NwnktNi1CoybZoaDTrFvJI5GET4u81phw0in_vko"}
