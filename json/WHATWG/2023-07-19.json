See https://github.com/whatwg/html/commits/main\n\nHTML 5 version released in 2014, past 9 years I did not heard about any new version? Why cant we add few features to handle backend API for web applications in HTML? That will make a lot more things more secure and address the data privacy concerns of users.\n\nAt the time of HTML 3 in 1997 there was technology limitations to handle new features. As of 2023 we have powerful processors and large size storage and memory with pretty good internet connections with good bandwidth.
