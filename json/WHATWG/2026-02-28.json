{"content":{"body":"…\nContext: For a change to a GH notifications-related feature in gh-dash https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash (a GH TUI tool I contribute to), I’m trying to figure out how long gh-dash should retain its own data about notifications you’ve marked as Done. We don’t want to keep the data around in your user environment any longer than necessary. Otherwise, the data store for it just grows unbounded over time.\n\n(And the reason gh-dash has to retain its own data about Done notifications to begin with is: The GH API doesn’t actually provide any way to know whether a particular notification has been marked as Done. So in order to emulate the Done-marking behavior the GitHub web UI provides, we need to have gh-dash store a record of Done-marked notification IDs and timestamps in your user environment.)","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1772322425947,"senderName":"sideshowbarker","senderId":"@sideshowbarker:matrix.org","id":"$gd25PaznqHzb7ACvSE68PU5yPyJtNxx_4SwFtOZjcB0"}
