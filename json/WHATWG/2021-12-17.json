{"content":{"body":"Hello! I would like to bring to the attention of people working on HTML5 team the issue of working with footnotes and also the issue of a 1.5 column layout (with footnotes as sidenotes/marginnotes).   I am convinced that it should be possible to write in Tufte Style (https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) seamlessly using clean, semantic HTML5 only, without any JS whatsoever. \n\nFor this purpose, it should be easily possible to have a 1.5 column layout. Furthermore, critically, footnotes as sidenotes should be easy to place in the margin at the appropriate height in the margin even in crowded margin situations (not flowing over other footnotes but elegantly positioned as close to the definition position as possible without any overlaps).\nSecond, there should be an easy way to number footnotes with two different numbering schemes, ie. arabic for sources and alphabetical (from [a] to [zzzzz] for notes). It should be also possible to add a note without any numbering (marginnote) in the margin space.\n\nPlease, please, please. Seamless support for footnotes in 1.5 column layout is absolutely essential for my use of semantic, clean HTML5. This is because footnotes are absolutely critical (I am not convinced by tooltips as they require an additional click and are not readily visible) and it's a design flaw to place them at the very, very end.\n\nIs there any hope that somebody will look into it?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1639737843971,"senderName":"m4themagic","senderId":"@m4themagic:matrix.org","id":"$FdCHduR2yUt5DI2eHe1XC9uROLFd21Fjw2WSds5MlSA"}
