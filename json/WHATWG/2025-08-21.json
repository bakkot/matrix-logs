{"content":{"body":"Hi WHATWG community, I wanted to let you know that I'll be retiring soon. My last day is Friday 2025-09-26.\n\nAlthough it's tempting to stay involved in web standards, I'll be doing my best to start a new life chapter and leave it all behind. I won't be at TPAC 2025, although I'm staying in Tokyo so if you're traveling that way before/after Kobe let me know if you want to meet up!\n\nI plan to continue participating full-time until the last week or so, and then unsubscribe from various repos, remove myself as editor, etc. If there's something you'd really like me to be sure to finish before leaving, let me know.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1755755306999,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"@domenicdenicola:matrix.org","id":"$PirkPuW0OqMppJO4LSLHpZUSzEZUYNzBWKm-BooQiuE"}
