{"content":{"body":"Hi, I have a question about the input element, specifically the behavior of min and max when they do not apply to the current type state. It says the behavior is defined in that section, but the section for min and max doesn't seem to specify that.

I assume this just means the algorithm doesn't return a number and thus there is no minimum or maximum, but I don't see where this is specified.
