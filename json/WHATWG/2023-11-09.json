As for the HTTP fetch vs HTTP-network fetch, I did misunderstand your previous comments (thought you were referring to why were modifying Main fetch). It looks like I can move the fallback handling to somewhere before step 23 of network-or-cache fetch (that is, before any cache handling is done). I'll look into doing that, if that makes sense.","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<mx-reply><blockquote><a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/!AGetWbsMpFPdSgUrbs:matrix.org/$42nIn-ePTuojH8bnahNk_D8SUkrn4gGHoxjF5m5ZJQ4?via=matrix.org&via=mozilla.org&via=igalia.com\">In reply to</a> <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@annevk:matrix.org\">@annevk:matrix.org</a><br><a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@meacer:matrix.org\">meacer</a>: happy to try review quickly if you also address the comments somewhat quickly</blockquote></mx-reply>Thank you.
