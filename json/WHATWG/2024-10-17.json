In this case, it will only allow for absolute URL in the href.\n\n--  \"domain\"-- means that the file is hosted on a Web Server of same-origin. In this case, it can allow for relative URL in the href.\n\n-- \"filesystem\"---- means that the file is hosted on a Laptop or Personal Computer(PC).\n\nThis should allow the Download Attribute to still download the file, using relative URL in the href.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nI am not able to download from my Local File system, not able to download within my PC with the Download Attribute, and I have raised it on Microsoft Forum -- https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/all/html5-download-attribute-is-not-working-at-all-on/6f0681ee-05b6-49f8-a0f2-9ef6b6e27460\n\nAnd also on W3Schools Forum --- https://w3schools.invisionzone.com/topic/63572-html5-download-attribute-is-not-working-at-all-on-all-browsers/\n\nMOVING FORWARD\nIf WHATWG can add parameters as specified, or parameters that they see fit, which can allow us use the Download Attribute to natively download files from the Local File System of my Laptop or PC, I will be the most glad and grateful to WHATWG.\n\nSpecial Regards, as I keenly await your positive response.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1729154787757,"senderName":"gamicord","senderId":"@gamicord:matrix.org","id":"$ZjiPHJZns_ggLWd0W_oA9Mmj6cp6SKTJyM8OkQj12SY"},
