{"content":{"body":"Very niche question about Web Components. (Not sure if there's a better channel). Has there ever been a discussion about a kind of :is() in CSS for targeting a custom element and all its derived custom elements? Say you define ui-a and derive ui-b and ui-c from that and need a global CSS rule that targets all of them, but you don't want to just :is() them as others might add more later without searching/modifying every rule.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1700367626318,"senderName":"sirisian","senderId":"@sirisian:matrix.org","id":"$3isv4Hng1lU04fwFdP2mJUhho-FlbJMGNu3qqCt6kVE"}
