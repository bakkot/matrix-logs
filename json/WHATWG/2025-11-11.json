{"content":{"body":"I fail to understand why whatwg is focusing on various API's in different browsers. I do protecting my API's to prevent fingerprinting. To me anything that needs the API to work is a threat and it must be contained with urgency. I hardly see any discussion about HTML here it's more like developing full applications that will use the browsers capabilities but completely disregarding the dangers of this. In my opinion anything that depends on specific API's in the browsers is a significant threat.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1762861103151,"senderName":"Zoltán Kondér","senderId":"@zoltan-konder:matrix.org","id":"$EimlNicMZCHOYCZ4KKKspU1xpHZm_lK9PcdudoZqAtA"},
