{"content":{"body":"Hello,\n\nI apologize in advance if this is the wrong place to ask a question. I am wondering why the comment exists in the specification in the section about dialog description (see attached). Because a dialog is a single element that serves as a perfect base for popups, menus, tooltips, and any other piece of content that should be displayed over anything else on the page. Avoiding the use of dialog elements may leads to using workarounds (e.g., adding content directly at the top of the body), which might break specific scenarios (e.g., walkthrough elements in the tree). Am I missing something? \nThanks.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1707097395398,"senderName":"Kostya Petridi","senderId":"@kpetridi:matrix.org","id":"$7q2BylFBbz2EoNgJGuMlznYeOdAjDnSyqPvBezMZ8ug"},
{"content":{"body":"One small example of the many problems that can occur from abusing dialog for a non-dialog is that a screen reader will announce your tooltip (or whatever) as a dialog to non-sighted users.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1707097478793,"senderName":"Domenic","senderId":"@domenicdenicola:matrix.org","id":"$WXqR59KsZLM6TuPXYYLHjgjH6FcDf5FUR_Ws-PgfYzo"}
