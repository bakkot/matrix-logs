{"content":{"body":"As some of you know, I am working on a list of tags and attributes going back to HTML 1.0. As I have been working on this it has occurred to me that I may be introducing some ambiguity that can lead to confusion to those whom read the list. It concerns attributes and when they first appear in a specification.\n\nLets use 'width' as the example. The width attribute first appears in HTML 1.0. As that specification didn't have global attributes (if you don't include %linkattributes), each element contains the definition for the attributes applied to it. The width attribute is applied to more than one element, so I have just been stating that the width attribute originates in the HTML 1.0 DTD. The same is true of each version up to 3.2. The 4,0 specification is the first to define global attributes, and width is not included among them. Neither is it included in the global attributes of the HTML 5 specification.\n\nI know this is common knowledge, but it brings me to the point of this post. I will use the forms elements button and input as the example here. The attributes name, type and value are common to both elements in 4.0. However, the button element didn't exist in 2.0 or 3.2. So, should I say that the name, type and value attributes first appeared in 2.0 for the button element, or should I say that they first existed in 4.0 for the button element?","msgtype":"m.text","org.matrix.msc1767.text":"As some of you know, I am working on a list of tags and attributes going back to HTML 1.0.
