{"content":{"body":"Hey all! I am curios about the intended behavior of disabled on link elements with rel=stylesheet. \n\nFrom reading here: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-link-disabled it would seem that this allows one to queue up some stylesheets that can then later be fetched and applied (perhaps using something like intersection observer to load some CSS only when a specific component is about to enter the viewport). However, it seems that all but Safari will still download the CSS on page load. \n\nNone of the browsers which fetches the CSS will apply it though.\n\nThe only browser I have seen that seems to behave as I would expect is Safari. In Safari the CSS file does not end up in the network panel on page load i.e. not fetched. When I dynamically set disabled to false, it then fetches and applies the CSS as per (my understanding) of the specification.\n\nHere is a super minimal example: https://fjw3dm.csb.app/","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1756818927471,"senderName":"Schalk Neethling","senderId":"@schalk_neethling:matrix.org","id":"$N8dOVAIGxATxE2SwGrHTW4jQk2bVEpAp2yfh0LwpUWE"},
