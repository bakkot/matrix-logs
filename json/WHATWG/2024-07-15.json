Only these entities have this property.\n\nI realized this while writing an HTML parser in C, using constant string views to parse a document with no allocations and no copies. It seems to me that, in UTF-8, these entities and the mandate to replace U+0000 with U+FFFD are the only things preventing me from decoding inline HTML text in-place by mutating the buffer. I punt the replacement of nul bytes to the user, but because of &nLt; and &nGt;, inline text is 20% longer in the worst case after expansion.\n\nAm I crazy, or is this a serious limitation? HTML is so close to being parseable in-place. I don't want to jump to the conclusion that these entities should be deprecated, but there would be a benefit.\n\nI'm tempted to ignore &nLt; and &nGt; just for this reason!","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1721031050193,"senderName":"lynko","senderId":"@lynko:matrix.org","id":"$ueLtfLcEHExO9nS_oMQXTDBiQ80Z6UU_YU2_kAhdwP4"},
