{"content":{"body":"Many base64 implementations are strict by default and less strict when being passed flags to change the behavior. Variants of forgiving behavior: allowing line breaks (only allowing CRLF is often an option, \"required\" for email), allowing whitespace, allowing arbitrary non-base64 \"characters\", allowing invalid padding (in all variants you can imagine). As someone working on email I wish every implementation would be strict by default. That way implementations generating input requiring forgiving decoders would be found and fixed quickly. Sadly, that's not the world we live in. The next best option is to use forgiving decoders, but warn users when non-conforming input is processed. Please don't be forgiving and silent by default.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1625740574374,"senderName":"cketti","senderId":"@cketti:int21.dev","id":"$enxUZs5lb0LALYi_WrT_uES6yQ8Tcs4Y2Cchtmwryww"}
