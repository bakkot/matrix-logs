{"content":{"body":"annevk: Hello, I have a question related to the reflecting of IDL attributes, specifically those related to ElementInternals.\n\nThe classic definition of reflection in the specification is: \"In general, this means that the IDL attribute getter returns the current value of the content attribute, and the setter changes the value of the content attribute to the given value.\" In other words, by changing one attribute, we see changes in the other directly.\n\nBut if we look at the IDL attributes within ElementInternals, we see that \"content attributes\" are the internal content attribute map.
