{"content":{"body":"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#creating-a-source-set-from-attributes step 4's wording is a bit odd: \"... source set does not contain an image source with a pixel density descriptor value of 1, and no image source with a width descriptor, ...\". Since the second half (after the \"and\") doesn't have a verb, it would normally inherit the verb phrase from the first half, but that would be \"does not contain no image source with a width descriptor\".
