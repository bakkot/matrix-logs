{"content":{"body":"Hi, Push Engineer here.\nSo, technically, a UserAgent could have as many subscriptions as there is numberspace in a UUID4. (Subscriptions are identified as \"Channel IDs\" or CHIDs). Push subscriptions are fairly cheap on the server side since at most they require adding a mostly empty row to a Bigtable database. The server then encrypts the UAID and CHID into the subscription URL and that's what you're getting back. Of course, having that many subscription updates will do frankly horrible things to the UA, which has to manage, decrypt, and process those subscriptions, so there's the very high likelihood that even if only a percentage of those subscriptions were active, you'd swamp the network and CPU for the UA.
