{"content":{"body":"Bit confused about `aria-labelledby` versus `aria-describedby` wrt `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`. reading MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Figure_Role), it says that `aria-describedby` is for long captions and `aria-labelledby` is for short captions, but we should use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` instead. If the figure caption is a wee bit long (say, >150 characters), does it switch from being a label to a description? Firefox's accessibility tree doesn't seem to indicate so, and neither did the HTML Living Standard when I checked.\nSome of my captions start with something like \"Code Snippet 4 (shell): ...\", and then comes a longer description. I'd ideally want to make everything before the colon the \"label\" and the full caption the description (or maybe just everything after the colon?).\nI hope I'm not being too \"clever\" by breaking the first rule of ARIA, but it seems like plain HTML really doesn't handle the distinction between labels and descriptions when using \"figure\" elements.","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<p>Bit confused about <code>aria-labelledby</code> versus <code>aria-describedby</code> wrt <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>. reading <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Figure_Role\">MDN</a>, it says that <code>aria-describedby</code> is for long captions and <code>aria-labelledby</code> is for short captions, but we should use <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> instead.
