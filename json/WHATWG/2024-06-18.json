{"content":{"body":"Hi folks,\n\nI'm not so much a developer myself as a media archaeologist. I'm currently writing a thesis on the history and development of web browsers and wanted to ask if there are any people here who were involved in the founding of the WHATWG, could put me in touch with such people or could simply tell me something about the history of the WHATWG themselves. It doesn't matter how small or subjective these stories are, but it would help me a lot and maybe it would help to organize the great history of the web and present it to other people. I would be very happy to hear from people.\nBest regards from LÃ¼neburg \nLeonard :)","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1718718513430,"senderName":"lustigerleo","senderId":"@lustigerleo:matrix.org","id":"$MsnMw3qJ4u-9_ElB61ymm3ocyAswPJjHsvgopfAv4dU"}
