{"content":{"body":"Hi everyone,\n\nMy name is Raviteja, and I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology at the International Institute of Information Technology Bhubaneswar. I've carefully reviewed the project details, code of conduct, and the project itself. I'm excited to start contributing to the WHATWG-HTML Standard with some good first issues. I have hands-on experience with web development ,So i guess it shouldn't be a big problem.\nI'm thrilled to be part of this community and hope to make meaningful contributions. I believe introducing myself is a good first step. I'm open to any suggestions and feedback you might have.\n\nThanks,\nRaviteja","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1706597957313,"senderName":"raviteja jupalli","senderId":"@ravitejarao:matrix.org","id":"$onl5CHldcfTyrD1Saqwck5Qir03Sn350dWYmOHH6wcA"},
