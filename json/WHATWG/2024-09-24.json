{"content":{"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nI've been waiting to hear from mfreed  and ntim  regarding their thoughts on the `<details>` element, specifically how it works with `ontoggle` and the `open` attribute, but haven't seen any updates from them since my [initial post](https://matrix.to/#/!AGetWbsMpFPdSgUrbs:matrix.org/$bdM29LAE55ZkQa9Q_h31_MKLF_XS6zNqdC-mjbvSW9I?via=matrix.org&via=mozilla.org&via=igalia.com).\n\nAt work we're potentially planning on modifying its behaviour (specifically we're considering preventing `ontoggle` from automatically firing if the `open` attribute is present) through a React component built on top of the `<details>` element.\nAfter discussing this with my team, it became clear that the current behaviour isn't intuitive for most developers, and this leaves a chance of introducing more bugs into our code base (a bug is what started this all).\nWhile I respect the WHATWG's decision on how they think things should work, if modifying behaviour prevents the likelihood of bugs in the codebase, and misunderstandings within my team, I’m willing to implement a change. That’s why we’re opting for a custom implementation to change how it works.\n\nI'm still very interested in the reasoning behind the current design choices, and if this is something that should be revisited.  A part of me wonders if I'm overthinking this, but I also worry how many devs in the future may misunderstand the behaviour of the `<details>` element, given how the `ontoggle` event handler works differently than how most (all?) other event handlers work.\n\nI noticed you guys have a few meetings, I'm not sure if that's the correct place for you to discuss further, or for me to DM the folks mentioned above, or we continue to wait for them.\n\nThanks and let me know if there's anything I can do to help.","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<p>Hey everyone,</p>\n<p>I've been waiting to hear from <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@mfreed:matrix.org\">mfreed</a>  and <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@ntim:mozilla.org\">ntim</a>  regarding their thoughts on the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element, specifically how it works with <code>ontoggle</code> and the <code>open</code> attribute, but haven't seen any updates from them since my <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/!AGetWbsMpFPdSgUrbs:matrix.org/$bdM29LAE55ZkQa9Q_h31_MKLF_XS6zNqdC-mjbvSW9I?via=matrix.org&amp;via=mozilla.org&amp;via=igalia.com\">initial post</a>.</p>\n<p>At work we're potentially planning on modifying its behaviour (specifically we're considering preventing <code>ontoggle</code> from automatically firing if the <code>open</code> attribute is present) through a React component built on top of the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element.<br>After discussing this with my team, it became clear that the current behaviour isn't intuitive for most developers, and this leaves a chance of introducing more bugs into our code base (a bug is what started this all).<br>While I respect the WHATWG's decision on how they think things should work, if modifying behaviour prevents the likelihood of bugs in the codebase, and misunderstandings within my team, I’m willing to implement a change.
