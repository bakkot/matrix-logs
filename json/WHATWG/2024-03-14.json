{"content":{"body":"> <@noamr:matrix.org> judge_sour_dough_bread: seems right, you need to have an `extends` option to make this into a customize built-in element.\n\nThank you, Noam. To give some context here, I may have understood Web components a bit wrong -- I originally wanted some subclass of specifically `HTMLElement` -- and not a known HTML element like `span`, `fieldset`, `button` etc -- because I wanted a \"mix-in\" component, one that can work regardless what element is upgraded to its functionality. Which is why I was trying to use the `is` attribute, but turns out that in practice (correct me if I am wrong about this, please) one either uses `is` attribute on a known HTML element, to upgrade to a custom element that specifies `extends`, or one that uses the custom element name (e.g. `foo-bar`) for a component that does _not_ use `extends`. So, in effect, \"mix-ins\", contrary to perhaps their general principle, cannot be used without `extends`?","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<mx-reply><blockquote><a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/!AGetWbsMpFPdSgUrbs:matrix.org/$tJY3GpDxZLCKraRzEw_yZ046l0-miNyTzeg6AEU6PSI?via=matrix.org\">In reply to</a> <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@noamr:matrix.org\">@noamr:matrix.org</a><br><a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@judge_sour_dough_bread:matrix.org\">judge_sour_dough_bread</a>: seems right, you need to have an <code>extends</code> option to make this into a customize built-in element.</blockquote></mx-reply>Thank you, Noam.
