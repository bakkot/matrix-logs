{"content":{"body":"annevk: I'm going through Ladybird failures on the scoped custom element registry tests, and passing a registry to `Document.importNode()` isn't making sense to me. I see that Safari passes all of custom-elements/registries/Document-importNode.html, so maybe the implementation doesn't match the spec there.
