I just don't really know when you would \"need\" a content attribute vs just stick with JS API design on the element's IDL interface. If someone says \"I want to introduce a new 'attribute' on this element\", then they've two options: (1) content attribute with automatic IDL reflection, vs (2) just IDL attribute, for a JS API. I'm not clear on how to provide guidance to select between those two. I would need to ask them a question relating to \"If you need/don't need a content attribute\" above. So I guess I'd ask \"Can this just be a JS API on the element's interface, or do you need it to also be a content attribute\". But to \"need a content attribute\" (i.e., an IDL attribute alone is insufficient) means your design desires to trigger the attribute's behavior without script... I think.. like just from HTML.\n\nYes, your last sentence is correct.","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<mx-reply><blockquote><a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/!AGetWbsMpFPdSgUrbs:matrix.org/$i00Z_ryFb71FkF6KqC9rUg7wDJpKrXe9O5XXl68cGco?via=matrix.org&via=mozilla.org&via=igalia.com\">In reply to</a> <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@domfarolino:matrix.org\">@domfarolino:matrix.org</a><br><blockquote>\n<p>If you don't need a content attribute then you are just doing normal JS API design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the part I'm curious about.
