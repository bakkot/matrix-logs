{"content":{"body":"I‚Äôm not part of WHATWG, but this is a topic I am interested in.\nHowever, note that there are many ways to do footnotes:\n\n1. As is most popular on the web, you can put footnote content at the very end of a page or section and link references to them in the main text.\n2. Using CSS Grid, you can make footnote content appear in a sidebar, Edward Tufte style (https://www.edwardtufte.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VE-Spread-Detail-2.jpg). This is my personal preferred way to do footnotes.\n3. Using HTML Popovers, you can put footnote content declaratively in a popover element, then add references to them in the main text using buttons. The buttons can declaratively make their respective popovers appear.\n\nFor all three methods, an `<aside>` element could contain the footnote content. But all of these are quite different semantically.\n\nThat‚Äôs the problem with trying to standardize ‚Äúfootnotes‚Äù. The semantics of what we call ‚Äúfootnotes‚Äù are diverse and may be quite specific to the document context that they appear in. Some people will want content at the very end; some people will want them in a sidebar near their references; some people will want popovers.\n\n(With that said, I‚Äôm a bit surprised nobody else has asked this question in the whatwg/html GitHub repository. But I know that this has been discussed many times in the past.)","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<p>I‚Äôm not part of WHATWG, but this is a topic I am interested in.<br>However, note that there are many ways to do footnotes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As is most popular on the web, you can put footnote content at the very end of a page or section and link references to them in the main text.</li>\n<li>Using CSS Grid, you can make footnote content appear in a sidebar, Edward Tufte style (https://www.edwardtufte.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VE-Spread-Detail-2.jpg).
