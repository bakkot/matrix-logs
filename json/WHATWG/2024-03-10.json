{"content":{"body":"Hello, does anyone know about the \"willful violation of RFC 5322\" note in section 4.10.5.1.5 Email state of the whatwg HTML spec? The comment raises some concern for me, since RFC-5322 is not the appropriate standard to find the syntax of email addresses as used on the public Internet today to route email. The correct standard is RFC-5321, which defines the SMTP protocol and includes a grammar for Mailbox which is what most people think of as an email address. This is what people sometimes call the \"envelope\" address.\n\nThe RFC-5322 document specifies the format of the email message content, not the protocol used to transport mail.\n\nSo, yeah: you should not follow RFC-5322, but you should follow RFC-5321.\n","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1710041317598,"senderName":"dean.highpower","senderId":"@dean.highpower:matrix.org","id":"$0Q66H6h7YzkyPOkIMUN04wjxqMBfcjB_W5JUgfJYa0k"},
