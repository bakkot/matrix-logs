{"content":{"body":"https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#signature-for-webm Hello, I've been trying to rewrite the webm sniffing algorithm to js and encountering some weirdness. My first question was if anyone here has already implemented this for something so I can see how other people are interpreting it, and second, does anyone else agree that the wording is unclear? Especially within the \"matching a padded sequence\" algo, the phrase \"...eventually preceded by bytes...\" doesn't quite make sense. Do they mean \"...evenly preceded by bytes\", or perhaps \"eventually followed by bytes\"?. Also, the variable \"end\"  in italics is mentioned nowhere else on the page. I'm assuming it's referring to the end of the sequence. Finally, I've been testing it and found that removing step 5 in the nested while loop (\"if iter < length - 4...\") will yield a correct result, but if that step is enabled, it will not detect some sample webm videos I've been testing it with","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1699933234908,"senderName":"zoya","senderId":"@ampersandampersand:matrix.org","id":"$mtUpSUTa6vSFRN-4b2BOD1_BYMKbZpOYBkn2yTgCigw"},
