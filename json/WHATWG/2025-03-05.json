{"content":{"body":"am I correct in thinking that it's weird https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#sec-extensions-performance-interface says \"Each ECMAScript global environment has ...\" followed by a bunch of buffer and integer properties? It links to https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#es-environment , which ... is not where I would expect anyone to be defining properties. I would expect them to be defined as belonging to an HTML Envrionment Settings Object, or a 'WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope' (or the new intermediary added by ShadowRealms). Or belonging to an Agent or Agent Cluster. Saying that the properties belong to \"the ES environment\" seems pretty vague","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1741197299705,"senderName":"akaster","senderId":"@akaster:serenityos.org","id":"$YyjB6lZO_VGa0u1Hj__nC7sZoDpaKVC8cfTD51vWB9I"}
