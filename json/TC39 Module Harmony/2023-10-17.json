{"content":{"body":"As discussed in the meeting today, one time would be preferable, but we still haven't got ideal cross-over with Asia while we also have daylight savings time changes coming up in a couple of weeks.\n\nI've created a new poll just for the best cross-over times, that also starts only after the daylight savings time changes and takes into account the timezones at that point.\n\nWe will be keeping the same meeting time for next week until we have agreed on the new time.\n\nPlease fill this out again when you can, thanks! - https://doodle.com/meeting/organize/id/eZWZvNJa","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1697563790863,"senderName":"guybedford","senderId":"@guybedford:matrix.org","id":"$jQg8YSzYbcYe5SY9oL3xjPQjLQPXmBlV0o3rKv0jfn8"}
