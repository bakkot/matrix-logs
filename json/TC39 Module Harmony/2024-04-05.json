{"content":{"body":"More or less, the issue with switching TS to ESM is that TypeScript has conditional support for Node; we check if we're in Node (or Node-ish), then `require` stuff from Node if possible. This is good because the same bundle can be used for any use case. But, we can't do this in ESM without top-level await because this code can't be asynchronous (besides during load of the module), defeating the awesome \"require ESM works\" case that would allow us to move to ESM-only without breaking downstream CJS users.
