{"content":{"body":"Regarding the intermediate design family for transferrable modules, I am warming up to the intermediate position, where a ModuleSource may share private state with the host module loader, not just for CSP, but to determine import hook behavior. I have been mulling the implications for host virtualization and so far conclude that the behavior is trivial to emulate with a side table or private field. For a module loader that is serving as both a host and guest, the module-in-the-middle is sufficiently empowered that it can implement its own emulation of CSP or deny the host behavior. In short, I’m running out of reasons to dislike this framing and I’ll bring this up at the SES meeting today to socialize it.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1698853556206,"senderName":"Kris Kowal","senderId":"@kriskowal:matrix.org","id":"$fpsdtQdfN6IbKPeo-2MdcgTq_YNg1MqnmGp9iqVa2-M"},

{"content":{"body":"Another possible design would allow for a module source to be directly imported, giving the host the option of creating a host-defined instance behavior or reusing an existing instance based on the privately shared origin data.
