The lexical grammar in the spec (ignoring oddities like regexps) eagerly consumes the tokens as long as they match, so <code>@in x</code> is tokenized as <code>@</code>,<code>in</code>,<code>x</code>. Then the syntactic grammar sees <code>@</code>,<code>in</code> and <code>x</code>, without any whitespace knowledge.</p>\n<p>There are only two places where witespaces matter:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in private identifiers, because <code>#foo</code> is parsed as a single token</li>\n<li>between an identifier and a keyword, because the tokenizer is eager and would parse it as a single identifier</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote></mx-reply>Yeah, I agree: I personally think <code>@in x</code> is fine. And if we go with the current (finalized?) grammar of decorators, that’s the way it’s going to be.","msgtype":"m.text"},"m.relates_to":{"event_id":"$fdTB6sEQCdmMSG8A3S4TWF-elF6DeVJnpbgQzrxg3bE","rel_type":"m.replace"},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1648765886222,"senderName":"jschoi","senderId":"@jschoi:matrix.org","id":"$3ukojuJjjKXm6D-FGXC68PXfyQ8V81vT5JZTj0LYuOo"},
