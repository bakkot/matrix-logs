{"content":{"body":"Hi there. I have two small questions: \n\nFirst one is regarding a need I had recently to get both quotient and remainder of an integer division at the same time.\n\nDidn't found anything doing it in JS, and felt a bit dumb needing to perform two distinct operations to do so.\n\nOk, it feels like micro optimization, and they are good chances that many JS engines optimize it transparently, but I just wanted to make sure I didn't missed anything about such a basic problematic ðŸ˜›","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1664020787058,"senderName":"lemmy","senderId":"@mumeii:matrix.org","id":"$GpjLtrLYaWerRBjfP6ozGoPfnvVvqWx1WwphRJuxHjo"},
{"content":{"body":"My second question is regarding a (maybe bad) code pattern I'm using often, which looks like : \n\nlet options = {}\n...\noptions = { ... options, extraParam }\n...\noptions = { anotherExtraParam, ...options }\n...\n\n","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1664021138807,"senderName":"lemmy","senderId":"@mumeii:matrix.org","id":"$wnWf7RRyQmsOGBfld7e98fiaPgJMIZqD3yYSbYlTIK8"},
{"content":{"body":"This pattern is making me feel like I'm adding fields to an object as if one would do :\n\ncount += 5\n\nExcept that there is no affectation operator to do it.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1664021265964,"senderName":"lemmy","senderId":"@mumeii:matrix.org","id":"$io7__n6gGLuPZst5RIeiJfbHM800nv3O2aZLCllNnKM"},
