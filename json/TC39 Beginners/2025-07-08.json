{"content":{"body":"Yes, that's a 20 hours long meeting :)\n\nThe \"total duration\" is how many topics there are  currently on the agenda. It will increase as we get closer to the meeting and people add topics.\n\nUsually a couple day before the meeting the chairs publish the meeting schedule, so you can see when each topic will be (the schedule can change if we go faster than expected, but it's usually a good point of reference).\n\nIf you are only available in some time slots, you can add \"schedule constraints\", saying when you are available. You can find them at the bottom of previous agendas.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1751985434217,"senderName":"nicolo-ribaudo","senderId":"@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org","id":"$MFqul7PPumqeKxbkXWC1GqrhlaVy1zikJEi_v0T9x-w"}
