{"content":{"body":"There is a lot of nuance here. For example, is writing in TypeScript with types being stripped by the runtime (e.g. node 23) or by a light transform (ts-blank-space) considered directly executing the code that was written? I personally consider such transforms to not really be a build process, at least not one comparable to transforms that change the part of the code meant to be JavaScript (as long as the intent of the author is clear, to avoid ambiguous TypeScript parsing such as https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33639)","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1730907769921,"senderName":"Mathieu Hofman","senderId":"@mhofman:matrix.org","id":"$klrB2LwuWVU4p0XCMjGnn8_5MkiuthAsF_5l57_wkNI"}
