The previous wiki system, while it made things easier for contributors with a very high level of JS domain knowledge to get their changes directly into MDN without anybody standing in their way — it also made things easy for contributors without very good JS domain knowledge to get a lot of suboptimal and outright-wrong changes directly into MDN without anybody standing in their way.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1629269346874,"senderName":"sideshowbarker","senderId":"@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org","id":"$mN_G_jCfEzeywYOEzubQ3bp-4o-YRFH6M6qMWjvc-fA"}
