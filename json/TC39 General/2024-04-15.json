{"content":{"body":"hi all! I hope it's ok to use this community to ask for a little help – I run the State of… (State of JS, CSS, HTML, etc.) surveys and we have a lot of freeform data that needs to be normalized. \n\nIn other words, the process of specifying that different phrasings such as e.g. \":has()\", \"has selector\", and \"css has\" all refer to the same has_selector item (which is done through a custom dashboard that we've built).\n\nWe have a bunch of datasets that could use some input from people with expertise in specific domains, such as forms, DOM manipulation, web components, accessibility, and mobile apps. \n\nIf you think you might be able to help please DM me for more info!","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1713143849652,"senderName":"sachag","senderId":"@sachag:matrix.org","id":"$cdkg1bA_uaMKOFyfhBXF8ioYtG2p0GpWDNgq24N2GCI"},
