{"content":{"body":"DataView constructor without an explicit byte length parameter calculates the byte length of a fixed length buffer -backed DataView and stores it in the ByteLength internal slot. For a resizable AB it stores the \"AUTO\" value instead.\n\nIs there actually any observable effect or safety concern if an engine chooses to not precalculate the byte length, and instead calculates it on the fly from the AB data during access, ie. does the same as \"AUTO\" does. I at least cannot see any issue since the fixed length AB's length cannot change, and the DataView's byte offset cannot change so the resulting byte length should be fully static, right?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1729215406763,"senderName":"Aapo Alasuutari","senderId":"@aapo.alasuutari:matrix.org","id":"$pKCukZtHLaJybCHbqOSMy7xUSoEC1ve5J5ux-R6sqbY"}
