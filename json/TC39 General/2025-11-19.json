I'm planning on just writing my implementation as a Futex syscall wrapper, and thus doing the \"fail-fast\" path outside of the critical section. Of course, the syscall will also perform the same read inside its critical section (presumably) so rather than moving anything, I'm just adding an extra read of the SAB to check if a syscall should be made or not.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1763532969476,"senderName":"Aapo Alasuutari","senderId":"@aapo.alasuutari:matrix.org","id":"$cbh9LcxaTgp4GPTub0EoxdOq8IQuvPLOOkFSgvK640k"}
