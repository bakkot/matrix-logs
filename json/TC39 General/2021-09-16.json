{"content":{"body":"Are there definite guidelines or criteria for when a proposal issue is “finished”—when we should close the issue?\nSometimes an issue asks for a concrete actionable change, and, if the change is added to the repository, then the issue is clearly “finished” and should be closed. \nBut oftentimes the issue doesn’t yield an actionable change, and it becomes a long discussion that goes in circles and repeats the same arguments. This can go on for months. If there’s nothing really actionable in the issue, but discussion is still occurring, then when is the issue “finished”? When is it appropriate to close it?\n(Background: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/pull/214#discussion_r709774469)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1631802679433,"senderName":"jschoi","senderId":"@jschoi:matrix.org","id":"$8dOaII7CipcwgxWJfDYousK5wmXzuE-odx8NxF4U5H8"}
