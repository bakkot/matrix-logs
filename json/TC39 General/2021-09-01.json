An issue I’m going to raise during my BigInt Math presentation is that of `max` (and `min` and `hypot`). The issue is that if we simply extend `Math.max` to accept BigInts, then `Math.max(…arrOfBigInts)` would unexpectedly return `+Infinity` whenever `arrOfBigInts` happens to be empty—this would basically be an unexpected implicit type conversion from an array of BigInts to a Number value. \n\nThe choices I see are to either add a separate `Math.bigMax` function (and `bigMin` and `bigHypot`)…or add a `BigInt.max` method (in which case…why don’t we have `Number.max`—and then what about the other `Math` functions, do they get copied to `Number` and `BigInt` too?).
