{"content":{"body":"Hi everyone! I don't sure it is a right place for that but I don't know another place for. Today I found functions parseInt and parseFloat is not locale aware. I mean a code parseFloat('1.2') with dot as decimal separator (North America style) returns 1.2 but parseFloat('1,2') (Eastern Europe style) return 1. Also parseInt('1_000_000') return 1 but the string 1_000_000 is correct string for numbers since ES6 (ES7?)
