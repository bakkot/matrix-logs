{"content":{"body":"What was/is the reasoning for https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/text-processing.html#table-nonbinary-unicode-properties only having those 3 nonbinary properties? I'm pretty sure all implementers that support unicode regex already use ICU for those 3 and the binary properties anyway, so having the remainder of the non-binary ones shouldn't be any hurdle from implementers side, so what other rationale is there to purposefully do this? I couldn't find any reasoning on the unicode regex related proposals that added the current properties.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1690536101556,"senderName":"voidhedron","senderId":"@voidhedron:matrix.org","id":"$eFfUEfXqwHyhaYgW4Md4Uc4kQPXBcPEU7I0mmhgi9PY"}
