{"content":{"body":"re: curentComputed in the Signals proposal -- what I was trying to get at earlier was that, with AsyncContext in the picture, each framework would be able to make their own variables for whatever dynamic stuff they needed. AFAIK the global accessibility isn't vital to anyone's use cases; well-behaved frameworks would only ever be asking \"is the Computed that's running one of mine?\" and then reading their own separate properties off of it from there.\n\n(currentComputed is one of a couple of things in the current proposal that are \"sufficient but not minimal\" for enabling certain use patterns; introspection is another. I think thinking about the security invariants is definitely a good way for us to search for better-behaved primitives for those uses.)","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1715193333320,"senderName":"shaylew","senderId":"@shaylew:matrix.org","id":"$93uvLKJvm3_97zz5vE0Vq-MRpc4F927ZBvN2dUOkcXg"}
