{"content":{"body":"One of my colleagues at Mozilla pointed out this site to me: https://test262.report/. He found it useful for tracking status across implementers. It was being maintained by bocoup, but they stopped last autumn due to some changes to services made by CircleCI that the site relied upon. I thought I would mention it here, in case someone was interested in taking over the maintenance or adding something similar to the tc39.es site.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1684861066649,"senderName":"dminor","senderId":"@dminor:mozilla.org","id":"$YVAaY7eCiaiaT9lR8cH2SO4eQf6eOBiaFnIaoxTJPuI"}
