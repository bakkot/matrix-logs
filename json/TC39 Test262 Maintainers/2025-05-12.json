{"content":{"body":"Explicit Resource Management is fairly close to Stage 4, with the only outstanding task being the review of the outstanding test PRs. I'm currently working through breaking down https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3866 into smaller chunks with the hopes that will help unblock reviewers. Please let me know if the more focused PRs are more manageable. Ideally, I'd like to ask for Stage 4 in the upcoming plenary, but I'm aware that reviewer's time is limited.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1747066893144,"senderName":"rbuckton","senderId":"@rbuckton:matrix.org","id":"$9rGlKskPDt-rl46CWwtNL5acYO25hFu832iWp524DyQ"}
