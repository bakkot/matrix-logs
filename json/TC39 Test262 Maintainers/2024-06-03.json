After some discussions with Yulia and the other implementers, I've come back around to wanting to upstream our `non262` tests to test262.

Based on this, I don't think `staging` is the correct place.\n\nThe benefit to us is that we can simplify our testing, and work towards writing new tests in `staging` as opposed to increasing our corpus of `non262` tests.
