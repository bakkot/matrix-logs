{"content":{"body":"Hi all, I just opened a PR to test Promise.prototype pollution combined with `import.defer` here https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4918. It still need to be discussed on plenary, but I'd like to get some early feedback from you regarding the way I'm testing `Promise.prototype.then` there, since I'm feeling it's a bit hacky right now. Since I'm polluting `.then`, If I do `import.defer(...).then(ns => { ... })`, this will cause the new defined `.then` function to be called and it will increase `thenCallCount`. Because of this, I took the direction to save built-in `Promise.prototype.then` to `originalThen` and use `originalThen.call` to chain promises. I can think in a couple of alternatives for it, like checking if `thenCount == 1` and keep using `.then`, or having a `Promise.prototype.originalThen`, to avoid `originalThen.call`. Do you have an opinion about it?","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"Hi all, I just opened a PR to test Promise.prototype pollution combined with <code>import.defer</code> here https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4918.
