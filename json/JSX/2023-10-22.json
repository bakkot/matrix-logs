{"content":{"body":"Right that argument is the one about verbosity of escaping that I mention. I would say the example given in that spec is biased because JSX has somewhat magical treatment of tags. I am not convinced that tag names should be dynamically bound to the surrounding context, which means they may not need to be escaped in the first place. And the note about syntax highlighting does not refer to an intrinsic limitation of tagged templates, tools could parse tagged templates litterals.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1697945696956,"senderName":"Mathieu Hofman","senderId":"@mhofman:matrix.org","id":"$9qNXf3tNh5z4maCsc401_XvL58b6foZytpeJMX0UYCQ"},
