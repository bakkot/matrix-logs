I'm not trying to create an `A` that creates a `B` that creates an `A`, etc. I'm just trying to hold a reference. `function` doesn't have this issue, but `class` does and `class` is the thing you more than likely want type information for. The fact that this is even akin to a cycle is a problem with the design of JS and the choices we made to design classes.
