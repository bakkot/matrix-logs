{"content":{"body":"During the last plenary session, Shu expressed some concern about the perf cost of iterator destructuring for extractors. I know this is a known concern we've discussed before, which is why we've potentially considered using index/length instead.\ndanielrosenwasser pointed out to me that in https://peps.python.org/pep-0622/#custom-matching-protocol, Python decided against full-blown custom matchers in favor of a far more limited approach using `__match_args__`, where something like `case Point(1, 2)` only tests whether the subject is an instance of `Point`, and then reads `Point.__match_args__` which returns an array containing ordered keys like `[\"x\", \"y\"]`, which in turn is used to extract the named properties of the subject to match for those positions.\nI admit, I'm not a fan of adopting that approach as it severely limits the value proposition for extractors, but there is something to be said for the possible performance implications.
