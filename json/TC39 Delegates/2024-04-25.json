{"content":{"body":"I am seeing both stories represented in this chat (“stage 0 is not an actual thing that makes sense to think about criteria for” vs “stage 0 is when we have a real potential proposal, eg with a champion lined up”). There isn’t an agreed-on answer, even if your own interpretation seems obviously correct to you. I think we should make a shared decision on which interpretation we all take. A third option is to discourage the use of the term.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1714014180068,"senderName":"littledan","senderId":"@littledan:matrix.org","id":"$Mf84QrrSAJjPf41qRM6qRRW31UdT4fbITvU75CAPRAY"},
{"content":{"body":"This is just a random one of several process points we have where there are multiple interpretations going around among long-time delegates. “Can IEs block” has long been another.

{"content":{"body":"Right it was complicated and slow to build consensus around that, and the result is not 100% unambiguous even now. I think the currently reality is slightly more like, Stage 3 plus some intangible confidence is when things ship; I hope we can move more towards building up that confidence so it’s there right when something becomes Stage 3, and the recent 2.7 addition helps towards that goal.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1714015021583,"senderName":"littledan","senderId":"@littledan:matrix.org","id":"$GVYGr4nxNy1PUEL-o9lDtmCBFBPUYSMJCBtrmbcPVlQ"}
