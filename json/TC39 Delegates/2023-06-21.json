I'm asking because we're hoping to ask for Stage 3 for proposal-canonical-tz at the July TC39 meeting.\n \nFor Stage 3 reviewers, I've been creating issues like https://github.com/tc39/proposal-canonical-tz/issues/33 and https://github.com/tc39/proposal-canonical-tz/issues/35. \n\nShould I do the same for each of the ECMA-262 editors? Should I open one issue and tag @tc39/ecma262-editors?  Something else?","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1687331448497,"senderName":"justingrant","senderId":"@justingrant:matrix.org","id":"$r8t7kwxztK11IeMRTYfoWewl-GQXE201nVlB3atRlVQ"},

If a lot of stuff gets added just before the deadline for advancement, it can get pretty hard to get reviews in on time.
