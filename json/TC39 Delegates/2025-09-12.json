{"content":{"body":"We are not going to signal any cancellation of sessions until and unless we are absolutely certain that we won't need the time. There are several days remaining for folks to add topics and constraints, but you're right -- as of now the agenda is looking relatively light.\n\nIn the recent past when we have signaled that we MIGHT be ending early, some folks interpreted that as a strong signal and made their plans accordingly. This resulted in the absence of some folks during part of plenary -- a situation we are keen to avoid in the future.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1757704543763,"senderName":"Chris de Almeida","senderId":"@softwarechris:matrix.org","id":"$wab2OF8mRPS8lzzM2fNbo0ZT7zIWsZ8cEtvuxitTPm4"}
