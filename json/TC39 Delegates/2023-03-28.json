If you try to parse that string today (after we know about Brazil's stopping DST in 2019) using `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from`  then you'll get a RangeError because there's a conflict between the offset -02:00 and the time zone ID America/Sao_Paulo.\n\nFor developers who know what behavior they want in cases like that, there's an `offset` option that can be used to choose how to resolve conflicts. https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/zoneddatetime.html#from https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/ambiguity.html#examples-offset-option\n\nThis won't help cases like Lebanon's which have minimal (or negative!) advance notice, but should help developers find and recover from changes like Brazil's where changes are announced a few months in advance: long enough for IANA Time Zone Database updates to be rolled out into ECMAScript implementations.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk. ⏰","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<p>It amazes me how governments—repeatedly—make last-minute changes to DST and then are shocked, just shocked, about the tech turmoil that inevitably ensues.
