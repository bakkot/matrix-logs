{"content":{"body":"I believe the motivation is to avoid using a big try-catch scope to catch errors for multiple statements. Rather, it encourages to handle error for each function call that may throw, comparing to the \"typed\" catch blocks. Such syntax also presents in languages like Swift (https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/errorhandling/#Converting-Errors-to-Optional-Values). However, Swift has a stronger enforcement that the error can not be easily discarded with this syntax.","m.mentions":{"user_ids":["@littledan:matrix.org","@robpalme:matrix.org"]},"m.relates_to":{"m.in_reply_to":{"event_id":"$DHwXtDIMa5Uvx5g9T_jgZgF5csx7XYFu7ynKCc6drTE"}},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1740480466003,"senderName":"Chengzhong Wu","senderId":"@legendecas:matrix.org","id":"$cKXK4X1LJsGlLPNA0AAric1g6BpPZlJ2wgy8dAhKJqg"},
