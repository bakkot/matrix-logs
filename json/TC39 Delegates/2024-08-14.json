{"content":{"body":"At the last plenary we discussed https://github.com/tc39/proposal-upsert a bit, in particular, that it's planned as an implementation project for students at Bergen, but the current champion is no longer active in committee. Since I'm planning to mentor an implementation in SpiderMonkey, I'd like to put my name forward to take over as a champion for the proposal. If there's no objections, I can put an update on the agenda for the next plenary and we can discuss it further then.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1723654326795,"senderName":"dminor","senderId":"@dminor:mozilla.org","id":"$YrrWdr07x_o2fOiZlM006CAHPHxg7ycKWxXc46p3YGI"}
