{"content":{"body":"> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> it's so strange to me that IETF would explicitly *not* want to support sub-minute offsets\n\n(catching up) Here's more context around IETF's reasoning, and more generally why restricting offset time zones to minutes seems OK to me:\n\nExisting RFC3339 timestamp strings (which the new IETF spec, aka \"IXDTF\", extends) only support HH:MM in the offset, e.g. `2023-07-12T14:06-07:00`. You can't use `07:00:01` or even `07:00:00` because parsers wouldn't recognize it. JS Date has the same same limit, BTW. \n\nIn the new IETF spec, they didn't want to change anything about the RFC3339 portion of the IXDTF timestamp, only the stuff in brackets after the timestamp is what's new.  Otherwise, existing RFC3339 parsers would break for the before-brackets portion. Of course, that's not necessarily related to what's in brackets. We could have different precision for the in-brackets portion because there's no legacy.\n\nBut with IXDTF, the rule is that the RFC3339 offset must match the offset of the time zone in brackets.  So `2020-01-01T00:00-05:00[America /Los_Angeles]` is considered an error because the offset doesn't match the time zone.\n\nFor named time zones that have sub-minute precision, the new IETF spec handles it by being flexible about what \"match\" means: if the bracketed time zone's offset, when rounded to HH:MM, matches the offset in the RFC3339 portion of the string, then there's no error produced. \n\nSo `1970-01-01T00:00-00:45[Africa/Monrovia]` is considered valid, even though Liberia's offset in 1970 was -00:44:30. The rounding hack simply tells the receiver not to throw an error in that case; it doesn't change the actual instant that the string represents. The instant described by \"midnight on Jan 1 1970 in Liberia\" is still 44:30 away from UNIX epoch: \n```js\nTemporal.ZonedDateTime.from('1970-01-01T00:00-00:45[Africa/Monrovia]').toInstant();\n// => 1970-01-01T00:44:30Z\n```\n\nTemporal does the same thing in reverse in `ZonedDateTime.p.toString()`: it formats the instant by rounding the offset to the nearest minute.\n\nAnyway, that's how it works for named time zones. But what about offset time zones? \n\nBecause the offset in the RFC3339 portion of the string is constrained to HH:MM, the IETF folks felt that it'd be better to also limit the bracketed time zone to HH:MM too. There's nothing preventing us from extending the format in the future if there's customer demand, using the same rounding hack used for named time zones, so that `1970-01-01T00:00-00:45[-00:44:30]` would also be allowed.\n\nBut it's not clear (to me at least) that this customer demand will ever materialize. Offset time zones were really only added to Temporal and IXDTF for backwards compatibility with Java. It's not clear how much usage of offset time zones there will be in Temporal. Partly this is because all IANA time zones today are on 15-minute boundaries. Sub-minute offsets haven't been official in any country since the 1970s, and even then it was rare. And offset time zones intentionally dispense with the main value of time zones in Temporal: the ability to automatically adjust timestamps for DST and other time zone weirdness.\n\nAlso, there's a storage advantage. If offset time zones are limited to minutes, then a Temporal.TimeZone can fit in a 16-bit union: 12 bits for offset time zones (±24h at minute-precision), 10 bits for the index into ~600 named time zones, and one bit to choose between them. Sub-minute offsets would require 50% more bytes to support a use case with questionable demand.\n\nFinally, any user who really needs an offset time zone with sub-minute precision can create a custom time zone with granularity down to nanoseconds. Which they'd have to do anyways for time zones like TAI which don't have constant offsets (thanks leap seconds!) so you can't use an offset time zone anyways. AFAICT, there has never been a real-world time zone that has had a non-minute-aligned offset whose offset has never changed.  So I'm kinda skeptical that \"offset time zones at sub-minute precision\" are real things.\n\nP.S. - one concern raised was how RFC 5545 (aka iCalendar) supports [second-precision offsets](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.14). But AFAICT, those offsets are never actually used for time zone identifiers. Rather, they're used to define the offsets of named time zones. And Temporal is already permissive with timestamp offset inputs, so we'll accept strings like `1970-01-01T00:00-00:44:30` which AFAICT is what RFC5545 needs. \n\nSummary: restricting to minutes for built-in offset time zones seems like a safe initial bet that we can always extend later if needed. \n\nThanks for coming to my obscure TED talk.
