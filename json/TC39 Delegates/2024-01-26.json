{"content":{"body":"I think 90 minutes is too long for a Stage 1 advancement topic. I appreciate the amount of work that has gone into the presentation and the proposals, but advancement to Stage 1 is about agreement that the problem is worth investigating, and a 90 minute timebox to me sounds like we're getting into too many details about how to solve the problem. I would prefer a shorter Stage 1 advancement presentation, followed by a Stage 1 update at the next plenary. I think that splitting this way could help keep the discussion more focused, by separating the \"should this be part of JavaScript\" from \"how should we do this\" into separate discussions.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1706279781267,"senderName":"dminor","senderId":"@dminor:mozilla.org","id":"$0QsYr_gkCukOtPwPfg3brxCpke-DXybyajWnbKMH4oQ"}
