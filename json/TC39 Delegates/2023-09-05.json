{"content":{"body":"Is Daniel Minor (Mozilla) in this channel?\n\nI've seen the agenda item proposing demotion of ShadowRealms to Stage 2. I'd love if we can link that agenda item to an open (new?) thread in the ShadowRealms repo.\n\nConsidering the facts, I'd have to agree with the arguments and recognize there's an amount of work for HTML integration I initially underestimated.\n\nSaying that, we have work with Igalia restarting on this in October 1st. This update is as fresh as today. The budget cut happened initially along the mass layoffs and we are putting it back to order to continue the work here.\n\nEven if the demotion is unavoidable, I'd love we can set a plan for the next steps for what would be expected for re-requesting Stage 3.\n\nHaving a thread linked to this agenda item, we can have pre-discussions and champions might be able to draw some estimates as well.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1693948768859,"senderName":"leobalter","senderId":"@leobalter:matrix.org","id":"$tXKbfR3iTPoeklLYz3DYmypm03TwJMsEesawX5ReSnM"},
