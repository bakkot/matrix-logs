I intended to propose them for Stage 1, but did not have the time to make individual repos/slide decks for each feature prior to the agenda deadline. I am aware they could be rejected purely on this basis, but if we have the time to spare I can finishing breaking them down tomorrow and add them to the agenda.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1634289711402,"senderName":"rbuckton","senderId":"@rbuckton:matrix.org","id":"$o4dVOFARBTBO0cleE_VSXOTDkTkzvUAOJzVJAAP8Hag"},

All other points use the term \"added\" which, given the distinction for PRs in (1), seems to indicate they must be part of the actual agenda by the deadline. If merely having the PR by the deadline is acceptable, I suggest we change the wording in the agenda topic rules.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1634327657455,"senderName":"rbuckton","senderId":"@rbuckton:matrix.org","id":"$71s1lbP3w8IUOOiSb66ohQ-f4O0h9KwgX-q8A8U0sjY"}
