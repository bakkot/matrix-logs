{"content":{"body":"From my point of view Ron was just considering a related problem - how to make sure developers are nudged toward using the resource management features he's defining - and then coming up with a possible solution to this. He presented it as a possible follow-on proposal. DE seemed at first to be saying that this problem is important enough to force changes to the existing stage 3 proposal, but I think he's backed down from this. I think the conclusion is not to include such a feature in the current proposal.","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1689156896838,"senderName":"Bradford Smith","senderId":"@bradfordcsmith:matrix.org","id":"$-J0lcMlu8wr_coG1El2eWD7vqmnlBN_aHhOqryXc5-U"},
