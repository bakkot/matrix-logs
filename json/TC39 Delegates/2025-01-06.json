When people refer to Stage 0, I think of it as a semi-joke, just a statement of it not being at a stage in committee. It can still be useful to link to those in the proposals repo, sometimes, and I'm fine with applying those criteria for this list.","m.mentions":{"user_ids":["@ljharb:matrix.org"]},"m.relates_to":{"m.in_reply_to":{"event_id":"$FdUOqm2-cPWix8JaMLLTRhXhq9m1Aa01MWiRvCMThlo"}},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1736178794191,"senderName":"littledan","senderId":"@littledan:matrix.org","id":"$4epJWn-ynk3apPsCLU4NtE4nDE1D4uEHZQjJYxv8o78"},
