{"content":{"body":"What's the right process to get consensus on it from TG1 in Helsinki for normative PRs to ECMA-402? Do I add it as a standalone agenda item?  As part of a standing agenda item for 402 changes?  Something else? PR is https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/877\n\nThis is mostly a \"web reality\" change that aligns the spec with how V8 and JSC already behave by tightening under-specified parts of the spec. It also adds forward-looking guidance to handle future issues that may crop up with time zone identifiers.\n\nIdeally I would have asked this question yesterday before the deadline, but I mistakenly believed that all TG2-approved PRs would magically make it into the agenda. Oops. Anyway, I'll add this as a late submission.
