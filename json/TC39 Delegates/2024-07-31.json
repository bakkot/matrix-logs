{"content":{"body":"there's a conservative way through, which is to make your own wrapper around strings that doesn't have any functionality and holds a decimal but makes it so that it doesn't randomly get cast to a number. That doesn't take much package size, but it's even more frustrating to use, and might not be so broadly adopted. We use this strategy in some parts of Bloomberg.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1722447517317,"senderName":"littledan","senderId":"@littledan:matrix.org","id":"$Y5ZfqouxA0J1Gh0XBAZlACAbM4Ow9oIwyxpc6etm-9U"}
