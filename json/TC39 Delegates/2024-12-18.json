{"content":{"body":"On the Melanesian islands, many years ago, we found that people created Doodle invites ahead of each TC39 plenary meeting.  And so we keep that tradition going.  Folk sign up to show they are going to attend ahead of time.  And the cargo dutifully arrives, i.e. those people happily attend the meeting.  Everyone is happy and we repeat the cycle next time.\n\nThis practice was established way before we introduced Interest Surveys and accepted scheduling constraints onto the agenda.  And probably at a time when Doodles had fewer banner ads.\n\nI'm interested in finding out if the Doodle has value today, or if you think we should introduce an alternative system. Or maybe we just stop doing them?","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1734481833182,"senderName":"Rob Palmer","senderId":"@robpalme:matrix.org","id":"$JhCuEjj-iX71O-P9DwmxgPJsQUp9OHzXBRj9k5mLzhM"}
