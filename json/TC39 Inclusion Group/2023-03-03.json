{"content":{"body":"alright, so for the folks who weren't at our meeting yesterday, one of the concerns/objections raised about the NVC training was the connection to 'spirituality'.\n\nobjection to the training on those grounds is totally valid.  moreover, I would be surprised if there was a plurality of folks who would support the training if there was a religious component to it.\n\nAFAICT, they (NVC and its minions) define spirituality in very loose terms -- namely, referring just to life and human relationships, and there is nothing about spirituality/religious influence substantively in the book.  it does talk about NVC as a way to resolve conflict amongst people living closely and observing disparate religions.\n\nso, I think NVC is still viable, but only if we can get assurance (and assure our colleagues) that there is no religious angle","msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1677868465266,"senderName":"Chris de Almeida","senderId":"@softwarechris:matrix.org","id":"$5IgOqW19CqJu3PFnuIZb6obs6n-I4K_Lm5yMaOF-qR8"},
