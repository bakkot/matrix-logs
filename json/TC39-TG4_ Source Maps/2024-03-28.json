{"content":{"body":"> <@atakikawa:igalia.com> Hi folks, I had a question about a part of the spec that isn't currently very precise. In the [terminology](https://tc39.es/source-map/#terminology) section, it's mentioned that `the VLQ Base64 encoded are limited to 32-bit quantities`. Should we refine \"limited\" here to mean VLQs exceeding 32-bits are invalid, or some other semantics? (e.g., it's clamped to 32-bit, or say it's invalid but some implementations may accept them anyway, etc.) I believe Firefox [considers it invalid](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/blob/master/wasm-mappings/src/lib.rs#L592) while WebKit & Chrome don't enforce the limit [1](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WebInspectorUI/UserInterface/Models/SourceMap.js#L240), [2](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/core/sdk/SourceMap.ts;l=814) IIUC.\n\nI filed an issue for this if anyone has further thoughts https://github.com/tc39/source-map/issues/80","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<mx-reply><blockquote><a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/!GURLmrBmuNjUaqboWr:matrix.org/$zto3E5cZlYdmKiISCsj8COl5OlBEveLaV1IUNHWqcTI?via=matrix.org&via=igalia.com&via=mozilla.org\">In reply to</a> <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@atakikawa:igalia.com\">@atakikawa:igalia.com</a><br>Hi folks, I had a question about a part of the spec that isn't currently very precise.
