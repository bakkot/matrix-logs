{"content":{"body":"Loading speed somewhat matters for huge source maps because the larger the source map, the longer developers have to wait for original source files to show up in DevTools (for setting breakpoints or translating stack traces). Tooling normally uses custom internal data structures anyway for decoded mapping/scopes and throw away the encoded strings anyway, so the ungzipped size doesn't really matter that much (the tooling specific data structures for decoded mappings/scopes take up a magnitude more heap space than the encoded strings)","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1732082003146,"senderName":"Simon Zünd","senderId":"@szuend:matrix.org","id":"$i--LoME0TCWYlUXt2RjGWgBXEQApIsicNu7KhrNj2mU"},
