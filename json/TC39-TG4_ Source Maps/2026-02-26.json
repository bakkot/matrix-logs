{"content":{"body":"Hey all, I'm taking a look into inlining and scopes for generated code, and I got a bit confused with this example: https://github.com/hbenl/tc39-proposal-scope-mapping/blob/master/test/getOriginalFrames/inline-into-function.test.ts. There we have a call chain of toplevel -> outer -> inner -> log. My confusion is that with the ranges we are using for the scope in this test, we skip inner fully. Which means that if we place a bp on line 3 (first line of log), the stack will have something like log <-outer<-toplevel. Was it intentional to skip inner there?","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1772112666751,"senderName":"Caio Lima","senderId":"@caiolima:igalia.com","id":"$jnJZsH3F2BQQJk72Qrl6nDbjkvxhekOg6Xrot3bh2n4"}
