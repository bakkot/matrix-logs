{"content":{"body":"I prepared some slides for the \"Scopes\" meeting later. 1) I'm proposing some minor additions to the \"Scopes\" proposal to enable stack trace processing, and 2) I'm spelling out the (more or less) exact algorithm how to actually apply the scope info to stack traces. I think this would be a great addition to the spec (non-normative) since it's very easy to do it wrong.
