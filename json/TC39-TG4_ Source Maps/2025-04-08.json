The sourceMappingURL is allowed to be cross-origin.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of are artifact servers for cloud providers. E.g. MS Azure allows you to host source maps (and original source files) for you behind some OAuth, so you can securely debug an app without making the source/source maps publicly available (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/javascript/consume-source-maps-from-azure).\n\nAFAIK there is no package registry purely for source maps yet.","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1744085900169,"senderName":"Simon Zünd","senderId":"@szuend:matrix.org","id":"$VH7TqhANGDLJjCwJI2QZ4DHHaUu845JpHUHc6hvelYk"},
