Analogously for SetUnsafe.\n- Reflect.getUnsafe/setUnsafe expose these ops\n- inside of an unsafe {} block, all direct property access is interpreted as GetUnsafe/SetUnsafe\n- Get and Set on shared structs are missing their own data properties. Those props don’t show up for any other MOP things either. But the thread-local prototype is present (it isn’t unsafe; a method might call an unsafe thing as an implementation detail though)\n- Atomics are always unsafe (that’s literally the point) so they are just overloaded for shared struct properties regardless of where they come from.\n- if we were doing SAB today, we might also consider this same unsafe restriction, but what’s done is done.
