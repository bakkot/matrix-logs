So I fail to see how the complexity for this JS feature would already be there.\n\nFor WASM shared objects to be remotely usable from JS, you need to be able to interact with them _somehow_. If they are opaque, that only means that interactions must go through a wrapper/Proxy, as littledan said, and also likely need to be valid `WeakMap` keys so that such proxies work. As a result, opaque WASM shared objects are not inherently safer, just slower due to indirection and FFI marshaling. When I brought up having WASM shared objects be opaque entities in a prior structs meeting, the main purpose was to discuss a _worst case_ fallback position if we don't have a comprehensive story for JS shared objects. If WASM shared objects were to be introduced as ordinary JS objects and we were to want to later introduce JS shared structs with unique semantics around field reads and writes (such as what I discussed above re `unsafe`), then mutable WASM shared objects couldn't align with that approach without breaking existing consumers. Whether WASM shared objects are opaque or not has nothing to do with thread safety, only runtime semantic consistency. Thread safety is still a split responsibility between the shared object implementer and shared object consumer based on the needs of any given use case.","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"<mx-reply><blockquote><a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/!fmLqwwrfASaCrzNjAk:matrix.org/$wllYXk-jUy0Oo4sFihClkgGkZi6_1BUx-tSp5EOpiIY?via=matrix.org&via=igalia.com&via=mozilla.org\">In reply to</a> <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/@mhofman:matrix.org\">@mhofman:matrix.org</a><br>For wasm shared objects, one approach is for them to be opaque obects in JS, without any fields.
