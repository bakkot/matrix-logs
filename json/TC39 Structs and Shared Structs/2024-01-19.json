{"content":{"body":"As a result, the actual specified grammar for `struct` and `shared struct` will be fairly minimal as it will mostly borrow from _ClassDeclaration_. There are a few things we need a clear position on:\n- Will there be such a thing as a _StructExpression_, akin to _ClassExpression_? For non-shared structs, it could possibly be supported, but I don't think its viable for shared structs if we are to go the path+position route for cross-thread correlation.\n- Are we restricting _StructDeclaration_ to only be allowed at the top level of a _Script_ or _Module_? If they can be used inside of a function body, that also would break path+position for cross-thread correlation.\n- Would a _StructDeclaration_ be allowed inside of an `if` or `switch` at the top level? That would not break path+position correlation.\n- What about `for`, `while`, `do`? They could conceivably be run zero or one times, but evaluating them multiple times would break path+position correlation.\n- Would shared struct fields be allowed to have Symbol-named properties?
