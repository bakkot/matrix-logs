{"content":{"body":"for unsafe {}, mark is also happy with \"all shared struct fields always private\", then we don't need unsafe {}, because the idea is the public API must be written by the developer, which should be threadsafe\n\nthe implementation constraint for me with that world is that we must be able to compile #-names in shared structs just as normal property slots. because of the \"#-names have different identities depending on the evaluation of the class declaration\" thing, they are wildly inefficient in engines. this problem might not exist at all if we have the restriction that struct decls are top-level only and thus can't be reevaluated anyways\n\nso that sounds like a promising thing for us to explore","m.mentions":{},"msgtype":"m.text"},"ts":1728602327637,"senderName":"shu","senderId":"@shuyuguo:matrix.org","id":"$7JwPed5zxSVPN3-azCmGxtxB6P858zkxYlR2GXQb1Ys"}
