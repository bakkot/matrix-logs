I was taking a walk with my neighbor Malte Ubl who mentioned Vercel had hired Justin and that he was excited to push AsyncContext. My first thought was that our friendship might not endure that tension, but I arranged for Mark and Justin to talk thru how the design addresses OCap concerns over four or so meetings and we’re good now.</td></tr>

A library or user code can use AsyncContext all it wants. The spec could use an AsyncContext variable as long as it doesn't make it observable, which is roughly the same as saying it cannot. It's the same as saying user code can freely create global mutable variables, but the spec only can if it doesn't make them observable.</td></tr>

That's the prerogative of the host, as long as it doesn't affect 262 behavior. One problem with the above is that it affects module resolution.</td></tr>
