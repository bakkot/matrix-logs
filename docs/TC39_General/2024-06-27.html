Great seeing TC39 being an open and collaborative space!<br>I joined here to express the problems and possible solutions over JSON serialization when it comes to <code>BigInt</code> type.</p>
<p>I originally come from Web3 where we are dealing with <code>uint256</code> – 32byte unsigned integer values and folks from Web3 space used to align on third party libraries to support numbers that big (<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi">https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi</a>) until the official support for <code>BigInt</code>s came live in 2020!<br>There have been many editions of ECMA-262 published since 1999, and to my belief it needs an upgrade to handle <code>BigInt</code> types.</p>
<p>I will be honest I did not spend that much time to research the efforts of handling such but I've seen many discussions evolving around somehow "smartly" detecting wether a number value should be parsed as a <code>BigInt</code> or <code>Number</code>. I don't believe that those are correct nor backwards compatible.</p>
<p>What if JSON as a whole could retrieve an upgrade to support BigInt literals ending with "n", as it does now in JS?</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "value": 1337n
}
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to hear your thoughts wether you think if this possible and if so, what kind of backwards incompatibility issues this might have!<br>Regarding the latter I don't think this will introduce any issues as this addition doesn't change the serialization behavior of fields of other types – but instead introduces a new one.<br>I understand that making an addition like this is gonna introduce chain of changes of parsing JSON in different programming languages, but I believe this needs a review.</p>

<p><span class="nick-4">Aapo Alasuutari</span>, I totally get the concern of version decision negotiation dillema.</p>
<p>At the same time, the way BigInt's are handled now is via specific serializers other than native JSON (<code>superjson</code> i.e.).</p>
<p>Saying if you have a backend and you provide API services to your clients, supporting an "updated" JSON would most likely be served via different endpoint.</p>

what do you think of introducing JSON/2 with support of bigints and other "major" differences?

</blockquote></mx-reply>JSON would not need to change as a format to support BigInt; the root issue is that numbers in JSON.parse always parses numbers as Number (ie IEEE 754 doubles). perhaps u could work on this by passing a reviver function</td></tr>
