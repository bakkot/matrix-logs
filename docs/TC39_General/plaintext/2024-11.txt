follow up on this: what if we split this in two questions, one asking about Stage 3+2.7 features, and one asking about Stage 2 features, while limiting both lists to the top 10 items that are relevant to the broadest section of the JS community?

I know this is a subjective metric, but otherwise that's probably too many items to ask respondents to scan through

the idea behind splitting things between Stage 3/2.7 and 2 is that it offers an opportunity to educate people on what the stages mean as part of the question prompt
