follow up on this: what if we split this in two questions, one asking about Stage 3+2.7 features, and one asking about Stage 2 features, while limiting both lists to the top 10 items that are relevant to the broadest section of the JS community?

[22:03:58.0418] <Sacha Greif>
I know this is a subjective metric, but otherwise that's probably too many items to ask respondents to scan through

[22:04:43.0672] <Sacha Greif>
the idea behind splitting things between Stage 3/2.7 and 2 is that it offers an opportunity to educate people on what the stages mean as part of the question prompt

[22:07:14.0609] <Sacha Greif>
so, to recap, I see three ways to formulate the question:

1. a somewhat arbitrary list of the top ~15 features among stage 3/2.7/2 that seem the most promising
2. two somewhat arbitrary lists of the "top" ~10 features split by stage
3. just list the current 15 Stage 3 features

Sacha Greif: we would ask that you not cover stage 0, 1, or 2 things at all.  2.7+ is fine

 * Sacha Greif: we would ask that you not cover stage 0, 1, or 2 proposals at all.  2.7+ is fine

is it ok if I pick a subset of "most interesting" features myself, or is that introducing too much bias?

[19:47:04.0490] <littledan>
I think some human judgement is needed. Why don't you suggest a list here for review?

[19:47:04.0644] <Sacha Greif>
(in other words taking out features that seem too niche)

[19:47:21.0737] <Sacha Greif>
ok I'll do that

[19:48:16.0730] <Sacha Greif>
also is there an "official" definition of what Stage 3 and Stage 2.7 mean?

[19:48:28.0755] <Sacha Greif>
or should I maybe not mention Stage 2.7 to keep things simple?

[19:49:14.0845] <littledan>
there's an official definition in https://tc39.es/process-document/ , you can just link to that. I would avoid a detailed definition inline, but you can say early vs advanced features

[19:50:11.0483] <Sacha Greif>
ok I'll keep things generic then

I'll also add descriptions for each item

I had an idea for another question to help get perspective on the JS0/JSSugar thing without asking about it directly

[16:44:42.0746] <Sacha Greif>
I suspect that the answers will skew very much to the right but we'll see!
