follow up on this: what if we split this in two questions, one asking about Stage 3+2.7 features, and one asking about Stage 2 features, while limiting both lists to the top 10 items that are relevant to the broadest section of the JS community?

I know this is a subjective metric, but otherwise that's probably too many items to ask respondents to scan through

the idea behind splitting things between Stage 3/2.7 and 2 is that it offers an opportunity to educate people on what the stages mean as part of the question prompt

[22:07:14.0609] <Sacha Greif>
so, to recap, I see three ways to formulate the question:

1. a somewhat arbitrary list of the top ~15 features among stage 3/2.7/2 that seem the most promising
2. two somewhat arbitrary lists of the "top" ~10 features split by stage
3. just list the current 15 Stage 3 features

Sacha Greif: we would ask that you not cover stage 0, 1, or 2 things at all.  2.7+ is fine

 * Sacha Greif: we would ask that you not cover stage 0, 1, or 2 proposals at all.  2.7+ is fine
