By chance, would anyone here happen to know where this is specified in the ES4 spec? The link provided is broken, but [here's the Wayback Machine's backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20161006100721/http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=spec:spec) if anyone knows where to look (it's pretty extensive).

3rd section of the [Core language](https://web.archive.org/web/20160802002701/http://wiki.ecmascript.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?id=spec%3Aspec&cache=cache&media=spec:core-language-d2.html) document seems like what that was referring to so maybe never mind? (much of that notation looks unfamiliar even having used Closure myself for several years)
