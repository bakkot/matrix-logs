By chance, would anyone here happen to know where this is specified in the ES4 spec? The link provided is broken, but [here's the Wayback Machine's backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20161006100721/http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=spec:spec) if anyone knows where to look (it's pretty extensive).

3rd section of the [Core language](https://web.archive.org/web/20160802002701/http://wiki.ecmascript.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?id=spec%3Aspec&cache=cache&media=spec:core-language-d2.html) document seems like what that was referring to so maybe never mind? (much of that notation looks unfamiliar even having used Closure myself for several years)

Okay, makes sense now; more modern Closure (and TS) annotations don't look like this due to the syntax for parametric type application using the dot now being deprecated (at least by Closure)

ah thanks â€” I hadnâ€™t realized it was you who raised it

Iâ€™m confused about why we have an article at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/GeneratorFunction in MDN for a `GeneratorFunction()` constructor and global object when there is no such constructor and object in th spec

[20:18:51.0868] <sideshowbarker>
but then I look in the spec at https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/control-abstraction-objects.html#sec-generatorfunction-constructor and I see a whole section on **The GeneratorFunction Constructor**â€¦

[20:19:33.0455] <sideshowbarker>
ah I see the spec defines it as an intrinsic

[20:23:25.0438] <bakkot>
it exists it's just not a property of the global object

[20:27:56.0944] <sideshowbarker>
bakkot: so in looking at the spec, how can I tell that itâ€™s not a property of the global object?

[20:28:31.0320] <sideshowbarker>
and does not being a property of the global object mean itâ€™s not callable at all from user JavaScript code?

[20:28:37.0814] <sideshowbarker>
not even observable?

[20:32:13.0244] <jmdyck>
You can tell it's not a property of the global object because it's not listed as such in section 19.

[20:34:27.0346] <jmdyck>
and also because 27.3.1 "The GeneratorFunction Constructor" doesn't have a bullet saying `is the initial value of the "Foo" property of the global object`

[20:36:43.0312] <jmdyck>
But you can't tell by looking at https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/control-abstraction-objects.html#sec-generatorfunction, which is maybe unfortunate.

[20:37:00.0540] <sideshowbarker>
yeah

[21:02:41.0819] <bakkot>
for the non-global-property ones we could reasonably add a bullet saying "Is not exposed as a property of the global object", I suppose

[21:04:27.0502] <jmdyck>
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-%typedarray%-intrinsic-object says "does not have a global name or appear as a property of the global object", but it's the only one.

[14:25:07.0977] <ljharb>
we could also just â€¦ start exposing it


2022-04-09
[04:43:27.0656] <jmdyck>
Wasn't there some reason for not exposing it?

[14:34:05.0995] <ptomato>
if we have a bunch of string options that come off of user-provided options bags, is it preferable to convert them to `~tilde enums~` when used internally? examples of what I'm talking about are the _disambiguation_ and _offsetOption_ parameters of this abstract operation: https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/#sec-temporal-interpretisodatetimeoffset

[14:34:42.0200] <ptomato>
(the _offsetBehaviour_ parameter doesn't originate from a user-provided options bag, so that's why it's already got tilde values)

[14:35:24.0054] <ptomato>
ecma402 uses the string values (e.g. https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-initializedatetimeformat) but there isn't much precedent yet for options bags in ecma262

[07:47:10.0138] <Jack Works>
No, because the private field is on the import promise, not on the module object

[08:13:10.0150] <Ashley Claymore>
only using spec features? Or special stuff like node async-hooks?
