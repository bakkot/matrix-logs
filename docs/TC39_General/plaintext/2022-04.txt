By chance, would anyone here happen to know where this is specified in the ES4 spec? The link provided is broken, but [here's the Wayback Machine's backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20161006100721/http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=spec:spec) if anyone knows where to look (it's pretty extensive).
