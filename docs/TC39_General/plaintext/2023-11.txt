is human display for durations a solved problem anywhere? especially normalizing the units... 

[20:55:50.0847] <snek>
the more i think about this the more complex it gets and the less i am sure that it could be generally solved

snek welcome to my world

the current version of the DurationFormat proposal can represent durations in mostly all forms that applications need

does it support normalizing units? like if I just have a large quantity of seconds can it turn that into hours or weeks or whatever

weeeeell

[07:58:24.0233] <ryzokuken>
it can do that for subsecond units because those could be expressed as a fraction

[07:58:45.0618] <ryzokuken>
it could in the future do it up to hours

[07:59:41.0285] <ryzokuken>
but since a day may not have a set number of hours, it couldn't do further without a point of reference
