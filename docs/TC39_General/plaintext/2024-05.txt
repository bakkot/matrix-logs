I noticed that in the spec that ExtendedPatternCharacter has the list of emu-t outside of the emu-gmod by mistake. Which project would I report such a typo to?

[19:44:02.0680] <jmdyck>
That's not a typo per se, but rather (the result of) what appears to be a bug in the program that converts the spec's source file into nice HTML. (In the source file, the corresponding production doesn't have that problem.) You could raise an issue in https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup

[19:45:46.0527] <jmdyck>
Or actually, I wonder if that part of the conversion happens in grammarkdown. @bakkot would know.
