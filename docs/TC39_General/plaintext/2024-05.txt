I noticed that in the spec that ExtendedPatternCharacter has the list of emu-t outside of the emu-gmod by mistake. Which project would I report such a typo to?

[19:44:02.0680] <jmdyck>
That's not a typo per se, but rather (the result of) what appears to be a bug in the program that converts the spec's source file into nice HTML. (In the source file, the corresponding production doesn't have that problem.) You could raise an issue in https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup

[19:45:46.0527] <jmdyck>
Or actually, I wonder if that part of the conversion happens in grammarkdown. @bakkot would know.

also just in passing: I'm always open to feedback/suggestions/etc. so if you want to be involved in the design process for the 2024 edition of this survey (or any other one) definitely do let me know!

I noticed an interoperability issue between Firefox and Chrome when it comes to Array sort(), in particular, the presence of an undefined/NaN can not only affect the positin of the NaN but the order of all other items which seems problematic?

Firefox: `0, 1, undefined, -10, -9`
Chrome: `-10, -9, 0, 1, undefined`
