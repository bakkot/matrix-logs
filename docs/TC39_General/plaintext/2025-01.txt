Now here's a spec question: Can GetBindingValue of Module Environment Record call user code?

Inside the GetBindingValue AO when an indirect binding is accessed, the website thinks that the GetBindingValue call to get the value can call UC but the [[Get]] method of Module Namespace Exotic Objects does not think GetBindingValue can call UC.
