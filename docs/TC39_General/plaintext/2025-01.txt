Now here's a spec question: Can GetBindingValue of Module Environment Record call user code?

Inside the GetBindingValue AO when an indirect binding is accessed, the website thinks that the GetBindingValue call to get the value can call UC but the [[Get]] method of Module Namespace Exotic Objects does not think GetBindingValue can call UC.

[07:35:34.0480] <bakkot>
I don't believe so; that's probably a bug from when we were doing manual annotations

[07:37:29.0196] <bakkot>
GetBindingValue does sometimes invoke user code (because it can trigger getters) but in this case it's actually always invoking another module environment's GetBindingValue

So in effect, neither should have UC on them. Can I open a PR somewhere to fix that?

Unrelated question: I'm kind of wondering about OrdinarySetWithOwnDescriptor's AO step 2.e.i: We've just called GetOwnProperty on Receiver for property P, and if we get undefined from that then we assert that Receiver does not have a property P: What is this for specifically?

sure, you just need to remove the `<emu-meta effects="user-code">` in the GetBindingValue definition for module environment records. note that sending any PR, even trivial ones, currently requires signing https://tc39.es/agreements/contributor/

[21:00:20.0724] <bakkot>
the repo is https://github.com/tc39/ecma262

[21:02:07.0007] <bakkot>
I don't understand the question, sorry. what do you mean by "what is this for"? It's for... informing the reader that getting `undefined` here implies that Receiver does not currently have a property P.

[21:02:51.0249] <bakkot>
all asserts are for informing the reader of something which it is helpful to know and is not necessarily obvious from the immediate context

[13:22:51.0637] <Francisco Tolmasky>
Is there a term for "non-callable objects" (in other words, objects that *don't* have anything in the [[Call]] slot, and thus return "object" from typeof)? I don't see anything in the ECMAScript spec that gives such objects a definitive name (such as "plain object" or "non-callable object" etc)

[13:24:24.0413] <Francisco Tolmasky>
I see "ordinary object", "exotic object", "standard object", and "built-in object", all of which could be callable or non-callable

[13:30:20.0887] <jmdyck>
I'm pretty sure there isn't such a term. You might say "an object that isn't a function [object]", but I don't think the spec even does that.

[13:34:14.0509] <Francisco Tolmasky>
unfortunate

“Non-callable object” seems pretty straightforward tho

[21:54:33.0841] <Eli Grey>
is it possible to decorate the call slot of document.all?

[03:34:28.0180] <jmdyck>
What do you mean by "decorate a slot"? The ES spec doesn't use the term "decorate". The HTML spec does, but only when talking about Web IDL interfaces, not objects.

[12:03:20.0919] <Michael Ficarra>
I think the question might have been "can I use an HTMLDDA Object as the target of a Proxy whose handler implements `apply`?" and the answer to that is yes, you can

[12:44:13.0772] <bakkot>
technically you can but morally you should not

[13:26:06.0417] <snek>
when has that stopped us before

Is there anywhere the spells out the choice of when to use the term "instantiate" vs. "construct" vs. "create" vs. "make". From what I can tell they follow that "call order", with make being the lowest level "allocate", but its not clear to me when a construct should be an instantiate

[17:45:00.0083] <jmdyck>
You mean in operation names?

[17:46:42.0247] <Francisco Tolmasky>
Right

[17:47:56.0095] <jmdyck>
I don't think so.

[17:48:09.0381] <Francisco Tolmasky>
InstantiateOrdinaryFunction calls CreateOrdinaryFunction for example

[17:48:31.0886] <Francisco Tolmasky>
errr OrdinaryFunctionCreate*

[17:49:20.0454] <Francisco Tolmasky>
(There's also that weird Verb prefix/suffix tension, the Construct and Create like to be suffixes, Make and Instantiate like to be prefixes)
