will someone tell me why `structuredClone` is in HTML and not ECMAScript?

[10:49:46.0317] <Michael Ficarra>
this kinda thing is going to keep happening https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10425

[10:50:20.0862] <littledan>
ask Mark Miller, he has repeated his stance recently that structured clone is somehow bad and shouldn't be moved to ECMAScript. (I don't actually know the reason.)

[10:53:33.0275] <shu>
we got consensus to move it already

[10:53:43.0019] <littledan>
when was that?

[10:53:47.0252] <shu>
it keeps getting deprioritized for me though, probably need some help to work on it

[10:54:07.0599] <shu>
mark's hang up was about making proxies more transparent which i think was fine

[10:54:25.0448] <shu>
but that was planned to be sequenced after the behavior-preserving thing of moving the existing spec into ES

[10:54:27.0223] <shu>
let me dig up notes

[10:54:31.0960] <littledan>
ah OK perfect

[10:54:42.0257] <littledan>
I'm glad I'm wrong

[10:56:46.0933] <shu>
would love to actually get started on this, but yeah, probably won't have cycles in the near future either

[11:03:39.0925] <littledan>
great, I'm glad Michael Ficarra is volunteering for this work!

speaking of relayering, here's a writeup of some of my thoughts about next steps for AbortSignal/AbortController: https://gist.github.com/littledan/47b4fe9cf9196abdcd53abee940e92df

[11:06:31.0248] <littledan>
I got plenty of feedback at the last TC39 meeting that we shouldn't have a separate parallel API, so this is moving in the direction of just slightly evolving the current one, as well as ensuring that it can be used from 262, without duplicating it

[11:08:26.0433] <littledan>
(if the implicit propagation section doesn't make sense because I didn't include usage examples yet, just ignore it)

no

[11:10:06.0570] <littledan>
aww, I thought that might work

[11:10:12.0307] <littledan>

[11:10:22.0750] <Michael Ficarra>
I know your tricks @littledan:matrix.org

[11:12:53.0537] <Andreu Botella>
I wonder if just calling a host hook if the value is an object, and then check the internal fields if it returns `EMPTY`, would just work well enough

[11:14:30.0099] <Andreu Botella>
IIUC, none of the internal slots the algorithm checks can be in a platform object other than [[ErrorData]] (for `DOMException`, and that is handled before the regular error handling)

> It is critical to use `addEventListener` rather than `abortSignal.onabort = abortAction` because the latter code would overwrite any other reaction registered on the same `AbortSignal`.

wait, really? I assumed it was a setter

[11:23:59.0500] <littledan>
definitely is a setter, but I may have misunderstood the semantics

[11:27:03.0463] <littledan>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-handler-idl-attributes

[11:37:18.0180] <littledan>
the value (single thing to be overwritten) vs listener list (for addEventListener) seems to be how this is specified. The setter sets the value, so it overwrites. A quick test script confirms that behavior is implemented.

[11:37:54.0241] <littledan>
anyway who knows if anyone makes the error in practice of setting .onabort rather than using addEventListener; presumably everyone knows that the setter strategy is deprecated, right?

for what?

[11:42:44.0750] <Andreu Botella>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> for what?

in terms of separating the web platform parts of the structured clone algorithm from the JS parts

[11:43:33.0930] <Andreu Botella>
looking at it some more, that could work, but it would need host hook requirements

[11:43:56.0945] <Andreu Botella>
things like, make sure to add an entry to `memory` before calling back into the 262 AO

[11:44:29.0218] <littledan>
yes, there definitely need to be host hooks for structured clone. Generally, I don't think test262 needs to have its hooks correspond to the spec hook structure, though, right?

[11:46:19.0067] <Andreu Botella>
right, I was kind of thinking out loud of a way to do that that would only require one host hook, since the current algorithm has a couple places where it goes from dealing with JS stuff to web platform stuff and back again

could WeakRef have something like an `is(obj) -> bool` api? i feel like that's safe since `obj` has to be held strongly and any other mismatch is false.

[21:31:15.0209] <snek>
 * could WeakRef have something like an `is(obj) -> bool` method? i feel like that's safe since `obj` has to be held strongly and any other mismatch is false.

[21:53:58.0403] <bakkot>
would that be different from `.deref() == obj`?

[21:54:22.0387] <bakkot>
if not it doesn't seem necessary, unless I'm missing something

[21:54:35.0718] <bakkot>
 * would that be different from `.deref() === obj`?

[00:07:45.0211] <Ashley Claymore>
Would it still `AddToKeptObjects`?

[00:45:46.0426] <Ashley Claymore>
I presume the idea is that it could skip that? But then I think that means this is possible:

```
ref.is(obj); // true
obj = null;
ref.deref(); // undefined, we observed sync GC
```

[09:48:45.0826] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Does the explicit resource management proposal have any tests? I see that there is a feature flag for it in test262, but I cannot find anywhere where it's used

[09:51:32.0761] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm trying to validate the Babel implementation

[09:52:30.0975] <littledan>
huh, I thought rbuckton said last meeting that he had some tests

[09:52:35.0301] <littledan>
but I can't find a PR for them

[09:53:47.0486] <rbuckton>
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3866

[09:54:31.0214] <rbuckton>
Though I need to update the tests with some of the recent needs consensus changes.

it could add `obj` to kept objects i guess. 

[18:07:55.0479] <snek>
the goal is to avoid adding the other thing it holds

[18:08:11.0434] <snek>
 * the goal is to avoid adding whatever it contains if its not `obj`

[19:48:03.0198] <Ashley Claymore>
That makes sense. Only add to kept objects if it returns true should solve the observable GC issue.

[23:11:06.0626] <Mathieu Hofman>
I'm curious about the use case tho. When does one need to test if a weakref contains a certain object. In my experience  if I have a weakref, it's because I don't hold the target. 

[23:13:22.0537] <Mathieu Hofman>
It sounds like one is trying to iterate a set or map of weakref, which is most likely the wrong thing to do in the first place, and sounds like weakmap and weakset should have been used

[15:04:18.0907] <snek>
i was just exploring some ways to implement async context stuff. i think you're right that it's probably not needed. you could give each variable a unique id and compare the ids instead of comparing the contents of the weakrefs

> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> the longer answer is that in order to get some flavor of `sleep()`, you would have to add various other things in the language first in order to support it

well, we already have timers in the spec, in the Atomics.

[20:20:40.0816] <Jack Works>
> <@sirisian:matrix.org> Maybe I'm blanking since I forget proposals. Has anyone suggested an operator like f??.() that is equivalent to `typeof f === 'function' ? f() : f` ?

rather than this, I have a lot of code doing things like `expr ? f(expr) : undefined`

[20:27:00.0445] <Jack Works>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> Are there particular design mistakes we might make with scheduler?

since `.wait` is not available for now, I don't think `await scheduler.postTask(() => {}, { delay: time })` is better in any sense than `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, time))` in this use case. The old classic one is even shorter.

```js
await scheduler.postTask(() => {}, { delay: time })
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, time))
await scheduler.wait(time) // but it is not here yet!
```

[20:32:45.0813] <Jack Works>
> <@shaylew:matrix.org> I wonder how far just pattern matching gets you in that domain. (might be asking a lot from the type inference)

a lot, but we may not get all the features mentioned below (since the committee think it contains too much things)

```js
match (userData) {
    when { type: 'a', field: Number and > 0 and < 100 }: ...
    default: ...
}

JSON numbers don't have a limit on numbers, you can already represent bigint numbers. you just need a special serializer.

```js
JSON.stringify({ x: 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999n }, (key, val) => typeof val === 'bigint' ?

you could establish a convention like serializing bigints with an `e-0` suffix, which is highly unlikely to occur in nature; most serializers probably wouldn't include a zero exponent at all, or else they'd use `e+0`. Not to mention, typical numeric formatters using the exponent output in scientific notation, which includes a decimal point and thus is syntactically distinguishable from `JSON.stringify(15n) === "15e-0"`.

[17:27:21.0219] <snek>
is it reasonable for implementations to throw an error for `Array.prototype.sort.call({length: Infinity})`? currently jsc and quickjs get stuck in an infinite loop, spidermonkey and xs raise an error, and v8 and engine262 hard crash. i assume the two that get stuck in an infinite loop will eventually throw or crash either way.

[17:28:34.0836] <bakkot>
we currently underspecify resource limits in general; in practice most resource limits eventually hit a RangeError or something similar

[17:28:57.0035] <bakkot>
or a panic, in some cases

[17:29:07.0811] <bakkot>
so, yes, it's reasonable although not strictly allowed by the specification

[22:02:46.0165] <Michael Ficarra>
it would be nice if we stopped pretending implementations have infinite resources some day

[22:57:50.0804] <Meghan Denny>
i think its less about pretending limits dont exist and more about letting those limits be implementation defined

[22:58:55.0733] <Meghan Denny>
or host/environment defined

[23:25:03.0003] <Meghan Denny>
saying more about what happens when those limits are reached could still be useful tho, if thats what u mean

[23:25:07.0553] <Meghan Denny>
read it back again

[01:41:45.0887] <littledan>
I think we do currently let them be implementation-defined, and the main questions are:
- Do we want to define always throwing an exception, or always crashing, when they are reached? (I vote crash if it is web compatible)
- Do we want to define some of the limits? Wasm does, and it seems to work well for them. https://webassembly.github.io/spec/js-api/index.html#limits

crashing is web compatible? lol

[07:23:34.0254] <snek>
* crashing can be web compatible? lol

[07:24:18.0382] <annevk>
Should have made `new ArrayBuffer(too-large)` crash rather than throw.

[07:25:15.0419] <snek>
are we using crash with a different meaning than I'm used to
