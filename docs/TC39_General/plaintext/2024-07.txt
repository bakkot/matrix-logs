will someone tell me why `structuredClone` is in HTML and not ECMAScript?

[10:49:46.0317] <Michael Ficarra>
this kinda thing is going to keep happening https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10425

[10:50:20.0862] <littledan>
ask Mark Miller, he has repeated his stance recently that structured clone is somehow bad and shouldn't be moved to ECMAScript. (I don't actually know the reason.)

[10:53:33.0275] <shu>
we got consensus to move it already

[10:53:43.0019] <littledan>
when was that?

[10:53:47.0252] <shu>
it keeps getting deprioritized for me though, probably need some help to work on it

[10:54:07.0599] <shu>
mark's hang up was about making proxies more transparent which i think was fine

[10:54:25.0448] <shu>
but that was planned to be sequenced after the behavior-preserving thing of moving the existing spec into ES

[10:54:27.0223] <shu>
let me dig up notes

[10:54:31.0960] <littledan>
ah OK perfect

[10:54:42.0257] <littledan>
I'm glad I'm wrong

[10:56:46.0933] <shu>
would love to actually get started on this, but yeah, probably won't have cycles in the near future either

[11:03:39.0925] <littledan>
great, I'm glad Michael Ficarra is volunteering for this work!

speaking of relayering, here's a writeup of some of my thoughts about next steps for AbortSignal/AbortController: https://gist.github.com/littledan/47b4fe9cf9196abdcd53abee940e92df

[11:06:31.0248] <littledan>
I got plenty of feedback at the last TC39 meeting that we shouldn't have a separate parallel API, so this is moving in the direction of just slightly evolving the current one, as well as ensuring that it can be used from 262, without duplicating it

[11:08:26.0433] <littledan>
(if the implicit propagation section doesn't make sense because I didn't include usage examples yet, just ignore it)

he is?

[11:09:55.0963] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> he is?

no

[11:10:06.0570] <littledan>
aww, I thought that might work

[11:10:12.0307] <littledan>
was joking

[11:10:22.0750] <Michael Ficarra>
I know your tricks @littledan:matrix.org

[11:12:53.0537] <Andreu Botella>
I wonder if just calling a host hook if the value is an object, and then check the internal fields if it returns `EMPTY`, would just work well enough

[11:14:30.0099] <Andreu Botella>
IIUC, none of the internal slots the algorithm checks can be in a platform object other than [[ErrorData]] (for `DOMException`, and that is handled before the regular error handling)

> It is critical to use `addEventListener` rather than `abortSignal.onabort = abortAction` because the latter code would overwrite any other reaction registered on the same `AbortSignal`.

wait, really? I assumed it was a setter
