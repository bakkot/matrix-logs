Working on implementing Atomics.waitAsync: the spec text doesn't appear to say anything about what happens to a WaiterRecord if the agent that called waitAsync to create it terminates before it is notified. My initial expectation is that it would be removed from the WaiterList, but testing Chrome's implementation seems to indicate that there's still an entry

(Methodology: create two workers, each of which calls Atomics.waitAsync on the same location, then terminate the first one. Atomics.notify has to be called twice to resolve the promise in the second worker, implying that the first worker's WaiterRecord is still hanging around)

Is this the intended behaviour?

yes, this is unfortunately a known leak

i think there's some kind of lazy sweeping

as for what the specified semantics are, i think it is currently underspecified. ecma262 doesn't really have a concept of "agent terminated"
