I know https://test262.report/ wasn't properly maintained for a while, but it seems to be fully dead now - does anyone know who to ping to look into that?

i wish they'd just port all the code and infra for it to some public repo, then we could just take some tc39 budget to pay for ci or whatever and call it a day

it really is an uncomfortable situation, yeah

I can talk to them about it if folks want, but I guess the status is the same as before (they no longer work on any TC39 stuff anymore and don't have the resources to maintain it any further).

Not sure if they're open to this idea but I'll float it to them.
