I know https://test262.report/ wasn't properly maintained for a while, but it seems to be fully dead now - does anyone know who to ping to look into that?

i wish they'd just port all the code and infra for it to some public repo, then we could just take some tc39 budget to pay for ci or whatever and call it a day

[20:06:47.0615] <rkirsling>
it really is an uncomfortable situation, yeah

it belongs to Bocoup

[07:47:56.0760] <ryzokuken>
I can talk to them about it if folks want, but I guess the status is the same as before (they no longer work on any TC39 stuff anymore and don't have the resources to maintain it any further).

Not sure if they're open to this idea but I'll float it to them.

last time i asked they were not

[07:49:48.0894] <snek>
maybe the website being fully down is the kick they need though

same

dunno, hard to predict but maybe it'd be a better idea to build something new from the ground up without some of the pitfalls

[07:52:09.0695] <ryzokuken>
we could consult leobalter about this, they seemed open to the idea

[07:53:04.0619] <snek>
i mean if someone wants to write all that css, more power to em i guess lol

sorry, it's been an action item in the test262 maintainers meeting to try to get ECMA resources for test262.report, but we haven't worked on it recently

Is this Ecma resources for hosting it, or to compensate Bocoup for them making it open source? Do we have an idea of the expected cost?

[08:43:30.0087] <ptomato>
no info beyond "we need to talk to people and find these things out"

[08:44:09.0114] <ryzokuken>
in light of this discussion, it might be good to talk to them on behalf of TC39 instead of Igalia?

[08:45:00.0921] <ptomato>
yes, that's the plan

So in the latest round of JS-is-missing-features discourse, one request that stands out is for Jack Works â€˜s Number.range/BigInt.range. I am wondering, how can we move that forward? Is it blocked on anything?

[18:24:14.0590] <littledan>
I remember we had some kind of debate around how exactly arguments should work but everyone was positive about it IIRC
