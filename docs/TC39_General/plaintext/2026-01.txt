I noticed that the MDN page on the Error stack property says

> Different engines set this value at different times. Most modern engines set it when the Error object is created.

in my testing, *all* mainstream browsers set it on creation

so i'm curious if this was different in the past, or if there were niche engines that didn't

When I used to use QT 5.5 the browser there would only set it when the error was thrown. So we had code that would throw and immediately catch when wanted to get the stack

double checking my reading of something: revoked proxies, if [[Call]]'d, always throw TypeErrors created from the caller's realm regardless of which realm the proxy was created in, because only function objects remember their creation realm in [[Realm]], and since the revocation error is thrown from within Proxy exotic objects' of [[Call]], no Realm switching has been done yet. is that right?

That matches my reading
