I’m working on [#3581](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3581) (Array.fromAsync).
 I’m figuring out the last two esmeta errors in [this job](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/actions/runs/14781083646/job/41499977134?pr=3581). 

It looks like Array.from’s iteration machinery has changed a lot since I last checked. Now Array.from uses a new IteratorStepValue operation. 

There’s no analogous AsyncIteratorStepValue operation yet, is there?
