I’m working on [#3581](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3581) (Array.fromAsync).
 I’m figuring out the last two esmeta errors in [this job](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/actions/runs/14781083646/job/41499977134?pr=3581). 

It looks like Array.from’s iteration machinery has changed a lot since I last checked. Now Array.from uses a new IteratorStepValue operation. 

There’s no analogous AsyncIteratorStepValue operation yet, is there?

[12:03:49.0924] <bakkot>
Correct

[12:03:55.0128] <jschoi>
Would it be worth for the Array.fromAsync pull request to define new AsyncIteratorStepValue, AsyncIteratorStep, and AsyncIteratorNext operations?

[12:04:07.0239] <bakkot>
No, probably not until there's more stuff which uses it

[12:04:09.0220] <jschoi>
* Would it be worth for the Array.fromAsync pull request to define new AsyncIteratorStepValue, AsyncIteratorStep, and AsyncIteratorNext operations, to match Array.from’s algorithm?

[12:05:53.0805] <bakkot>
You can use the underlying operations, though

[12:06:32.0107] <bakkot>
IteratorNext works fine on async iterators I think

[12:06:57.0067] <bakkot>
and then after awaiting the result you can use IteratorComplete and IteratorValue

[12:08:23.0861] <bakkot>
which I guess is pretty much what you're doing already, except manually calling .next instead of using IteratorNext, which is fine

[12:08:47.0583] <bakkot>
don't worry too much about esmeta errors; if they don't look like actual errors you can ignore them

[12:09:24.0650] <bakkot>
it isn't capable of handling everything in the spec and there's a file we can use to mark things as expected errors if we decide it's an esmeta bug

[12:10:28.0991] <bakkot>
in this specific case, yes, it looks like it's because of not recognizing the new IfAbruptCloseAsyncIterator macro, which makes sense; macros are hard to typecheck and we don't have any explicit marking for them

[12:29:07.0148] <jschoi>
Thank you very much for your great help.

Is the content I added implicitly given somewhere? Or is it a mistake? (CompileAtom is not explicitly defined for production `Atom :: \ AtomEscape`, but is defined for `AtomEscape`)

[10:27:00.0937] <nicolo-ribaudo>
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-algorithm-conventions-syntax-directed-operations

> Unless explicitly specified otherwise, all chain productions have an implicit definition for every operation that might be applied to that production's left-hand side nonterminal. The implicit definition simply reapplies the same operation with the same parameters, if any, to the chain production's sole right-hand side nonterminal and then returns the result.

Is this correct? For RegExp: `/[\p{Hex}]/u`:

https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-compiletocharset

For production ` UnicodePropertyValueExpression :: LoneUnicodePropertyNameOrValue`, `s` is `Hex`, in step 2 it calls `UnicodeMatchPropertyValue(General_Category, s)`

UnicodeMatchPropertyValue (https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-unicodematchpropertyvalue-p-v)
2. Assert: v (in this case, `Hex`) is a property value or property value alias for the Unicode property p (in this case, General_Category) listed in PropertyValueAliases.txt.

https://unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropertyValueAliases.txt

And in https://unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropertyValueAliases.txt, there is no entry starts with `gc ; Hex` so this assert should fail.

Did I miss something? Thanks!

With regards to the Stage 4 criterion “pull request has been sent to tc39/ecma262 or tc39/ecma402, as appropriate, with the integrated spec text”, is Stage 4 for Array.fromAsync blocked by [#2942](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2942) merging into main because its pull request ([#3581](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3581)) is based on #2942?

This is assuming that the editors sign off on #3581, which is blocking both Stage 3 and Stage 4.

[13:20:33.0703] <bakkot>
No

[13:20:53.0503] <bakkot>
Or rather, to be precise, it is blocked from merging into main, but that's fine

Excellent, thank you. It sounds like I can request Stage 4 for Array.fromAsync at this month’s plenary, assuming that #3581 gets editor sign-off.

[13:22:44.0437] <bakkot>
Yes, and also you should add it to the agenda when you're ready without first waiting for the editors; editors generally prioritize reviewing things which are on the agenda

In the spec, `+UnicodeSetsMode` only occurs in conjunction with `+UnicodeMode`. (i.e., roughly, `USM` implies `+UM`, or `+USM` is a subset of `+UM`), so any RHS guarded by `[+UM]` 'succeeds' for all cases of `+USM`.

I want to proposal a method for finding the item in an iterable which has the largest value according to some function, for example "find the person with the largest age" or whatever. This comes up a lot IME, enough to be worth having in the standard library even though it's like a four or five lines to do with a loop or `.reduce`.

There's two natural ways to do this: either take a function from input items to a number, or take a comparator. both work, first is often more convenient, second is strictly more general.

Thoughts? We could in principle support both. (Even in the same function, just by switching on `callback.length === 1`, but... not that option).

[10:28:13.0403] <bakkot>
I suppose one way to solve the dilemma is to have a function which lifts a `T -> number` mapper to a `(T, T) -> { -1, 0, 1 }` comparator, and expect people to use that, as in `people.maxByComparator(Compare.by(person -> person.age))`.

[10:28:23.0027] <bakkot>
(java calls the latter operation `Comparator.comparing`)

[10:35:55.0695] <Michael Ficarra>
Isn't this the same API design question we had with `uniqueBy`? You can either give a mapper or a comparator, and we probably just want both.

[10:36:23.0108] <Michael Ficarra>
wouldn't this be less efficient?

[10:36:55.0073] <bakkot>
Pretty similar, yeah, although the "comparator" for uniqueBy is not a comparator in the sense of "a function which can be passed to `.sort`", whereas it is here

[10:37:43.0416] <bakkot>
same big-O, but requires computing 2x as many calls of the `T -> number` function, yes

[10:39:58.0017] <bakkot>
I actually am kind of coming around to the idea of switching on the `.length` of the callback

[11:07:59.0209] <Ashley Claymore>
A comparator for unique has to compare against all previous unique values. O(N^2)
A comparator for largest only has to compare against the current winner. O(N)

[11:08:47.0338] <Ashley Claymore>
This does sound useful. I currently reach for `.sort(c).at(-1)` when in a pinch 

[11:10:15.0541] <eemeli>
Effectively, this would be sugar for something like this, yes?
```
people.reduce((acc, p) => p.age > acc.age ? p : acc)
```

[11:23:00.0146] <bakkot>
I mean, isn't a for loop good enough for this use case?

[11:23:17.0823] <Ashley Claymore>
Reduce has the "empty list" exception which is annoying IMO

[11:23:39.0017] <Ashley Claymore>
for a winner like method I'd rather an empty set returns undefined as the winner 

[11:25:26.0155] <bakkot>
`reduce` is basically the same kind of hammer as a for loop. Personally I like it when the language provides common, simple operations even when they're already achievable with the language's existing general purpose tools.

[11:25:41.0578] <bakkot>
ehhhhh no I was definitely planning on proposing this where it's an exception if you call it on an empty list

[11:28:54.0922] <Ashley Claymore>
Passing an initial value to reduce to avoid the throw is annoying because you can't easily pass `undefined` as that will get passed as an argument, so now need to handle that extra case on the comparator 

[11:29:06.0643] <eemeli>
You can avoid this by passing a sentinel value as the second argument, e.g. `{ age: -Infinity }` in the example case.

[11:29:32.0529] <Ashley Claymore>
Sure, now do that with a complex type with more than one prop :)

[11:31:06.0673] <Ashley Claymore>
Returning undefined I can always `?? error()` to get back to the exception behavior. Going from exception to undefined is more work 

[11:32:11.0687] <eemeli>
```
people.reduce((acc, person) => person.age > acc?.age ?? -Infinity ? person : acc, null)
```

[11:32:47.0121] <bakkot>
python's `max` has an optional `default` argument to use in case of empty list, and throws if the list is empty and no default is provided

[11:32:51.0212] <bakkot>
which seems pretty reasonable

[11:33:27.0120] <bakkot>
other languages return fancy maybe types

[11:34:30.0248] <Ashley Claymore>
a default that is only used for empty sounds good, that isn't passed to the comparator 

[11:35:31.0253] <Michael Ficarra>
god this language could've been so much better if we had a built-in Maybe in the early days

[11:35:55.0174] <eemeli>

So Rust has both `max` and `max_by` methods on iterators where the later takes a comparator function and the former only works with values that implement “Order”, so mainly numbers etc 

In Rust’s case they return an Option type then None if the list is empty, so `undefined` in the js equivalent.

[13:23:59.0270] <bakkot>
`max` and `max_by` are the right names but rust has them exactly backwards :(

[13:24:35.0119] <bakkot>
`sort` takes a comparator, `sortBy` would take a `T -> number`

[13:24:39.0775] <bakkot>

[13:24:55.0682] <bakkot>

[13:25:10.0054] <bakkot>
I guess the `T -> number` one is called `max_by_key`

* I guess the `T -> number` one is called `max_by_key` in rust

[13:26:09.0163] <bakkot>
but yeah I think the natural naming is `max` taking an optional comparator and `maxBy` taking a mandatory `T -> number`

[15:41:38.0096] <TabAtkins>
This is it, yes. Both variants are needed, and this is the right naming/assignment.

[15:46:36.0516] <Michael Ficarra>
@bakkot:matrix.org throwing or returning a special value for empty iterators?

[16:02:01.0696] <bakkot>
Michael Ficarra throwing but with an optional second `default` argument to return in that case, like python does

[16:03:06.0568] <bakkot>
though I guess that's annoying in the specific case that you want to use the default comparator but provide a default

[16:03:10.0822] <bakkot>
oh well I guess

[16:03:18.0628] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah I think that's what I would do as well

[16:03:33.0694] <Michael Ficarra>
still not 100% convinced it's needed, but if we do have it, that's how I would do it

[16:08:41.0037] <bakkot>

[16:09:08.0618] <bakkot>
just kind of weird to have an iterator that uses O(all previous items) memory

[16:31:24.0875] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah that was the feedback I got at the last presentation

[16:31:38.0806] <Michael Ficarra>
it's weird but I don't think it's *surprising* if you consider for even a second what it's doing

and I don't think that's fatal to the proposal

there's https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-white-space / https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-WhiteSpace

[20:47:06.0746] <Domenic>
Yeah, not ASCII-restricted though

[21:31:57.0678] <ljharb>
i would assume that anything that `/\s/` matches is considered whitespace. any other definition would be very surprising

[21:47:39.0840] <Richard Gibson>
well, the behavior of `\s` is based on General Category "Space_Separator" plus select additions and _not_ on property White_Space—as a result, U+0085 NEXT LINE (which has property White_Space) is not matched by it (regardless of flags), while U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE (which does not have property White_Space) _is_ matched by it. See also https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3303 , which was unfortunately closed

[21:54:31.0389] <ljharb>
i'm just saying that "\s" literally means "whitespace", so regardless of specs or standards or web reality, it'll be surprising if that doesn't hold

[21:54:44.0809] <ljharb>
unicode nonsense doesn't change that either way :-)

[21:54:49.0843] <Domenic>
ASCII whitespace is a useful thing to have in specs when attempting to parse data formats, etc. JSON has its own definition (which does not match JS's `\s` or `White_Space`).

[21:55:33.0979] <ljharb>
sure, JSON is its own unique thing. we changed JS a number of years ago to include 2 more newline characters so it'd match JSON, as i recall

[21:56:03.0594] <ljharb>
i think that regardless of what the current reality is, we should be striving to make there be a single definition of "whitespace", and for all things to match it

[21:57:10.0504] <ljharb>
in particular, at least, i hope nobody would ever add an *additional* definition of "whitespace" :-)

[21:57:11.0793] <Domenic>
I don't agree; I think it's useful for there to be separate definitions for whitespace and ASCII whitespace.

[21:57:29.0792] <Domenic>
This is similar to how both lowercasing and ASCII lowercasing are useful operations, for example.

[21:57:37.0272] <ljharb>
if the latter is a subset of the former, it might be fine, sure

[21:58:12.0925] <ljharb>
i'm saying the ideal is one definition; more than one is fine, but we should be striving to minimize that. if we end up with two that's pretty decent.

[22:00:45.0610] <bakkot>
the base64 proposal is the first place to my knowledge that introduces "ASCII whitespace" to JS https://tc39.es/proposal-arraybuffer-base64/spec/#sec-skipasciiwhitespace

[22:01:02.0822] <bakkot>
it does not include vertical tab

[22:01:49.0619] <bakkot>
it does include form feed

[22:02:46.0625] <bakkot>
this matches the infra definition, which is probably where I copied it from

[22:07:17.0111] <bakkot>
ah, yes, because that's what btoa uses https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#forgiving-base64-decode

[22:08:20.0509] <bakkot>
including excluding vertical tab https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-base64/issues/5#issuecomment-1783929861

what ever happened to comprehensions?

[21:18:22.0784] <Michael Ficarra>
everything else in Brendan's slide here made it in

[21:30:38.0887] <shu>
the story i heard was, dherman wrote on the whiteboard, side by side, nested comprehensions and nested for loops

[21:30:48.0006] <shu>
everyone was so viscerally disgusted by the comprehensions the feature was dropped

[21:31:11.0042] <shu>
which seems fine to me

[21:41:33.0883] <shu>
having tried to understand a few python programs with nested comprehensions, i don't disagree

[21:52:06.0374] <bakkot>
... incomprehensions

[09:09:47.0920] <TabAtkins>
If you nest a comprehension, Python actually calls your work and gets you fired.

[09:11:18.0151] <TabAtkins>
chained comprehensions (`[y for x in xs for y in x.ys]`) is on thin ice

[23:54:28.0060] <rkirsling>
"this is so not zen"

[01:03:43.0871] <Domenic>
The version I heard was that the comparison was between comprehensions and arrow functions, and people felt comprehensions didn't really add much once you had arrow functions and map/filter/etc.

[01:04:24.0916] <Domenic>
I think it was https://github.com/dherman/sudoku

[01:40:01.0070] <rkirsling>
that would make sense

[01:40:11.0953] <rkirsling>
Python picked a weird horse in that race

[06:02:28.0782] <TabAtkins>
Given the limited power of lambdas in Python, I think they made the right one for them

[07:27:57.0880] <rkirsling>
ah I'd always viewed it as "they made lambdas intentionally cumbersome such that comprehensions would become 'the one obvious way to do it'"

[07:28:16.0490] <rkirsling>
not sure if that's a post-hoc rationalization though

[07:28:53.0860] <rkirsling>
* ah I'd always viewed it as "they made lambdas intentionally cumbersome such that comprehensions would be 'the one obvious way to do it'"

[07:29:35.0441] <jmdyck>
I think Python lambdas long predate comprehensions.

[07:32:44.0358] <rkirsling>
I think either not existing must be prior to Python's popularity but I don't see a justification for making lambdas deliberately hard to use otherwise

[07:32:54.0307] <jmdyck>
lambdas were 1.0, comprehensions were 2.0

[07:33:03.0142] <annevk>
Whenever I write Python I tend to avoid lambdas and comprehensions, though I won't rewrite them away after some copypasta. Certainly aspects of the language I like less. (Though the 2 to 3 switch I still dislike the most of all things Python ever did.)

[09:16:03.0578] <James M Snell>
Hey all... trying to decide if a new proposal is worthwhile... Node.js recently received a request to add APIs to the `Buffer` interface that would allow a `Buffer` to maintain an internal position for relative writes.. for instance, the following code:

```
const buf = Buffer.alloc(10);
let pos = 0;
buf.writeInt8(1, pos++);
buf.writeInt8(2, pos++);
// ..
```

would become

```
const buf = Buffer.alloc(10);
buf.writeInt8(1);
buf.writeInt8(2);
// ..
```

Or something similar, with the `pos` identifying the offset being held by an internal slot.

There is, however, a preference within Node.js to avoid adding further to the `Buffer` API and we would instead prefer to see a mechanism added to the standard `DataView` for this purpose. The proposal would be to add a new `[[WriteOffset]]` internal slot and variations on the `setXXXXX` and `getXXXX` APIs that make use of it... for instance:

```
const dv = new DataView(new ArrayBuffer(10));
dv.writeInt8(1);
dv.writeInt8(2);
// ...
```



[09:16:34.0913] <James M Snell>
This idea is that by building this into `DataView`, user code could avoid potentially buggy bookkeeping around the position

[09:16:54.0280] <James M Snell>
But it's certainly not clear if there's enough motivation to formulate a full proposal

[09:30:24.0249] <ljharb>
i don't think it would be a good idea to add statefulness anywhere, personally

[09:30:32.0880] <ljharb>
the `pos++` code seems pretty simple as it is

[09:32:43.0845] <James M Snell>
it becomes a bit awkward and error prone when writing multiple values of different sizes but I share the concern about the statefulness. 

[09:34:49.0408] <James M Snell>
fwiw, here's the relevant issue in Node.js https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/58348

[10:17:03.0943] <Michael Ficarra>
I was just gonna say "this sounds like they were inspired by Java's ByteBuffer", then I open the issue and that's exactly what they said

[10:23:11.0708] <Michael Ficarra>
I'd say they should use DataView and if they're concerned about the bookkeeping being messy, they should separate their business logic from the code that's responsible for serialisation to a bytestring so they're not interleaved

[10:28:46.0317] <Aapo Alasuutari>
This seems like it'd be awkward to fit onto the DataView API; either you'd have new APIs that move the cursor, or have some mode that makes the cursor move when the existing write APIs are called... At index 0? No, I guess new APIs are the only choice.

[10:30:07.0012] <Aapo Alasuutari>
8 bytes more memory on DataView isn't too horrible, it's a rare object after all, but I guess the non-interaction between the cursor and the existing APIs would be somewhat weird.

[10:36:19.0320] <nicolo-ribaudo>
That seems similar to how RegExp has .lastIndex, do we consider it something good or a mistake?

[10:39:02.0716] <bakkot>
I definitely consider it a mistake

[10:39:22.0832] <bakkot>
but a wrapper class which took a regexp and also kept an index would be fine

[10:40:08.0553] <bakkot>
similarly, I don't think DataView should have an offset, but I would be fine with having a different class which kept an offset

[10:41:09.0758] <shu>
we shouldn't retrofit DataView

[10:41:17.0761] <bakkot>
> Claude, please write me a wrapper for DataView in JS which keeps an internal offset which is updated when calling read/write methods, like Java's ByteBuffer. Also add a method for reading/writing TypedArrays (writing should use a wrapper TypedArray, with appropriate offsets, so that you can `.set`  the entire argument instead of needing to write individual values).

https://gist.github.com/bakkot/6726adcf9ed361790d1063b41dbf4148

[10:41:30.0512] <shu>
this seems perfectly fine to be done in userland?

[10:41:39.0979] <shu>
not sure why it warrants a built-in

[10:41:43.0641] <bakkot>
that said I don't think this is worth adding to the language; the current state of things is fine and it's not hard to do

[10:43:12.0319] <shu>
not even done in userland, actually, Node can ship a thing if it thinks it's useful

[10:43:28.0013] <shu>
(unless it also doesn't want to do so unilaterally anymore due to other server runtimes. not sure what the situation is)

[11:21:31.0858] <kriskowal>
DataViewWithCursor is certainly useful and I’ve written one at least twice, for whichever methods the format demanded, most notably Zip. Same taste as bakkot for read/write methods, plus `seek` to rhyme with files. Agree with shu it’s not particularly important for it to be in the language. Not particularly important that it be omitted. There’s an async analogue (`File`) if it’s backed by I/O.

[11:26:52.0503] <James M Snell>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> (unless it also doesn't want to do so unilaterally anymore due to other server runtimes. not sure what the situation is)

The preference is to avoid new node specific apis when they likely overlap with standard options. We have been slowly trying to deemphasize use of Buffer, for instance

[11:27:34.0703] <James M Snell>
This could also be a web platform API consideration

[11:27:52.0166] <James M Snell>
That is, we could ask whatwg to consider a standard API here

[11:29:03.0068] <shu>
it also doesn't feel like a web api

[11:30:12.0129] <James M Snell>
Ok, I'll take this as a sign that a proposal is unlikely to advance ;-) ... appreciate the feedback all

[11:30:29.0849] <shu>
yeah, my read on the feedback for "overlap with standard options" you're getting in this room is "unlikely to overlap, because people don't think it's worth adding to the language"


2025-05-20
[22:51:23.0771] <Stephen Belanger>
Maybe a new wrapper type specifically for writing, which holds the cursor data internally? The ArrayBuffer family of things already makes use of wrapper types, so it seems natural to me. 🤔


2025-05-21
[19:20:54.0201] <Michael Ficarra>
I made this slide for a talk, explaining our process in a simplified way. Sharing in case somebody else would find it useful.
