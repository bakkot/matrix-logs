I'm trying to use `using` declarations in a real project -- I like the feature but oh I hate so much that we decided to require a binding name

```js
        using _1 = this.withState("inType", true);
        // Temporarily remove a JSX parsing context, which makes us scan different tokens.
        using _2 = this.withState("context", this.state.context.slice(0, 1));
```

I haven't had to use `using _3` yet :)

You could `using stack = new DisposableStack();` and then `stack.use` multiple times without needing to name them  

[10:32:49.0357] <Ashley Claymore>
did the proposal have anonymous `using` before and the we removed it? Or am I hallucinating that like a LLM

Yes, it had using void

[15:45:53.0781] <littledan>
IMO we should figure out how to make _ work well for this purpose. Nicolo had some good ideas about semantics.

[12:27:42.0516] <TabAtkins>
We've been considering `void` as a no-binding matcher in Pattern Matching; that might work here? `using void = ...;`

[12:27:55.0667] <TabAtkins>
Oh lol littledan just said that

[12:42:41.0691] <littledan>
I am anti-void for this purpose for the record

[12:42:54.0124] <littledan>
And anti making it pattern matching only

[12:43:31.0978] <littledan>
* I think void would be a little funny for this purpose given that it’s an operator

[12:43:52.0806] <littledan>
* And this case shows it would be nice to be accessible outside of pattern matching 

[13:07:01.0605] <bakkot>
crazy thought: `_` as an identifier can be redeclared as long as it's never referred to (and there's no direct `eval`s in scope, I guess?)

> <@bakkot:matrix.org> crazy thought: `_` as an identifier can be redeclared as long as it's never referred to (and there's no direct `eval`s in scope, I guess?)

That was Nicolo’s idea, except that if you do refer to it, you get a runtime error 

[15:10:20.0545] <littledan>
And I guess we don’t enforce in the old sloppy constructs 

[15:10:22.0795] <bakkot>
don't love the idea of a local binding which throws when referenced

[15:10:33.0404] <bakkot>
reading local bindings should not be side-effecting

[15:10:37.0774] <littledan>
Why? We already have TDZ

[15:10:43.0378] <bakkot>
hm, I guess

[15:10:47.0570] <littledan>
It would literally be in TDZ 

[15:10:49.0137] <bakkot>
for now, anyway

[15:11:01.0429] <littledan>
Ah!

[15:11:14.0826] <bakkot>
I would prefer a static error but runtime is also ok I guess


2024-01-17
[23:14:07.0777] <ljharb>
are you suggesting your crazy thought be a change in the lang, making `_` special?

[23:28:54.0698] <Andreu Botella>
I wonder if having an optional form without an identifier would be possible, from a parsing standpoint
```js
using ident = expression(1);
using expression(2);
```

[06:29:23.0352] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> are you suggesting your crazy thought be a change in the lang, making `_` special?

yes

Aside from not solving the more general problem, this faces the syntactic misfortune of not working if the expression that you're using begins with (

[08:04:24.0272] <ljharb>
ah, well that's certainly a nonstarter then

See https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-void-binding, which I plan to discuss at an upcoming TC39 meeting. This was originally part of the `using` proposal and was pulled out to serve as a broader independent proposal.

working on simple Go To Definition functionality

[01:44:21.0986] <Domenic>
The proposal-void-binding is compelling in how it lists lots of cases where this would be moderately useful. Still, for the original case of `using`, `using void = new UniqueLock(mutex)` feels sadly lame, compared to `using new UniqueLock(mutex)`. I think because, unlike cases such as parameter bindings or destructuring, I'm not trying to express "don't put anything in this slot"; I'm actually trying to avoid the "slot" (binding) concept at all, and just say "I am using this resource".

[01:46:47.0675] <Domenic>
So to me it feels like a tradeoff between trying to create a generally useful void-binding concept, versus making the using-a-resource case more idiomatic with specialized syntax like `using! expression` or something else. Since it's maybe not possible to create something both unambiguous and not-super-weird-looking, I guess `using void =` is probably the best place to end up. Still sad.


2024-01-21
[17:03:32.0830] <littledan>
Yeah, I am sympathetic to a form that doesn’t look like binding. But outside of that, Domenic do you have an opinion on void vs _ ?

[17:04:50.0906] <Domenic>
Not really, void seems kind of cute

[21:10:49.0101] <Kris Kowal>
I favor void over _. It’s a keyword, albeit a lost keyword, and this use is analogous.


2024-01-22
[05:56:23.0833] <littledan>
yeah I guess I'm probably over-indexing on the operator syntax of void in my skepticism of void. "lost" is a good characterization. But still, _ has recognition from other languages.

[06:29:28.0507] <Jan Olaf Martin>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> yeah I guess I'm probably over-indexing on the operator syntax of void in my skepticism of void. "lost" is a good characterization. But still, _ has recognition from other languages.

I'm not sure if the recognition from other languages outweighs the established use(s) of `_` in the JS ecosystem. I assume most JS devs would associate it with "bag of utility functions", not necessarily with "unused".

[07:06:29.0898] <littledan>
Yeah, that's fair. At least the _ is *locally* unambiguous/compatible

[07:06:50.0440] <littledan>
really, `void` for this purpose is even somehow more apt than `void` for C, isn't it

[07:10:53.0307] <Kris Kowal>
Use of _ I’ve encountered is not as a black hole (void) but as a readable reference to the last thing bound. 

[07:11:39.0356] <littledan>
oh yeah I guess overloading both of those in the same thing is weird

[08:09:57.0843] <snek>
I feel like _ is off the table since it's already a valid identifier 

[08:12:24.0394] <littledan>
> <@devsnek:matrix.org> I feel like _ is off the table since it's already a valid identifier

the idea is to stay with its current semantics wherever valid, and just introduce a TDZ or syntax error when bound in an invalid duplicate way (eg strict mode parameters)

[09:32:44.0671] <ljharb>
i don’t think moving towards scala’s “21 different meanings for _” would be an improvement

[09:47:24.0660] <littledan>
OK I'm convinced. So who's bringing the void proposal to committee?

[09:47:39.0880] <littledan>
We can do it separately from pattern matching, right? it'd just compose well

[09:48:22.0973] <bakkot>
> So who's bringing the void proposal to committee

per https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/main/2024/02.md, rbuckton 

[09:50:38.0038] <bakkot>
I also like the "ignore a parameter to a callback" use case

[09:50:42.0744] <rbuckton>
I would prefer `_`, but picked `void` due to concern's like ljharb's. At the very least, `void` in this sense has a similar semantic meaning. A `void` expression _discards_ a result, while a `void` binding _discards_ the binding.

yeah, the complexity is that extractors/pattern matching may introduce expressions in the LHS

[09:51:48.0675] <rbuckton>
Callback parameters, excluding things from `...`, explicit Elision (i.e., `const [a, void] = iter` vs `const [a, , ] = iter` due to trailing `,`), all seem good to me :)

[09:52:25.0660] <rbuckton>
I plan to handle `void` vs `void expression` in things like destructuring via a cover grammar.

[09:52:39.0499] <bakkot>
yeah `void` instead of holes in array destructuring is a definite improvement also

[09:52:49.0862] <rbuckton>
So this is designed to dovetail with pattern matching and extractors, which are specifically called out in the explainer.

[09:54:41.0119] <rbuckton>
I'm debating on `void` for explicit elision in array literals as well, since `[0, ,]` and `[a, void 0]` are subtly different.

[09:56:06.0141] <rbuckton>
```js
var ar1 = [0, , ];
var ar2 = [0, void 0];
ar1.length; // 2;
ar2.length; // 2;
ar1[1]; // undefined
ar2[1]; // undefined
1 in ar1; // false <---
1 in ar2; // true
```

[09:57:10.0462] <bakkot>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> I plan to handle `void` vs `void expression` in things like destructuring via a cover grammar.

I suspect you can just update the existing cover grammar; it already has to deal with stuff like `[ { m } ]` being legal only in expression position and `[{ a = 0 }]` only being legal in binding/assignment target position

I have a rough outline of that in the explainer under the Grammar heading.

[09:59:34.0208] <bakkot>
ah, nice

[10:03:02.0111] <bakkot>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> I'm debating on `void` for explicit elision in array literals as well, since `[0, ,]` and `[a, void 0]` are subtly different.

my answer to this would be no: no one should be writing array holes on purpose, so we shouldn't provide new syntax to help them

[10:03:14.0674] <bakkot>
I'm not dead set against it, I just don't want it

[10:37:55.0245] <rbuckton>
I agree that no one should write them on purpose, but people can and do. I would only consider supporting it if full parity for explicit _Elision_ is necessary for advancement. i.e., if to have `[a, void, b] = [1, , 3]` I must also have `[1, void, 3]`, then I believe the `void` in `[1, void, 3]` *must* be equivalent to `[1, , 3]`, else it is not truly an in-place replacement for _Elision_.

[10:38:42.0565] <rbuckton>
But I'm fine with not having it if there isn't a hard requirement for it from other delegates.

[11:15:00.0062] <littledan>
yes, I agree that we shouldn't make `void` in certain expression context another way to say `void 0`.

[11:15:13.0133] <littledan>
that seems complicated and unmotivated

[11:16:15.0782] <bakkot>
if I have understood correctly the idea would be an _elision_, not `undefined`; those are different

[11:16:24.0459] <bakkot>
 * if I have understood correctly the idea would be an _elision_ (i.e. a hole), not `undefined`; those are different

[11:31:25.0915] <littledan>
yes, so I agree with Ron that it shouldn't do `undefined`. This seems to be a sort of strawperson that no one is arguing for.

[11:31:52.0299] <littledan>
but having another way to type holes also seems not so motivated

[18:19:34.0856] <jmdyck>
Does anyone know why ScriptEvaluation asserts that the execution context stack (on exit and presumably entry) isn't empty?

[18:20:22.0652] <jmdyck>
I can understand why HTML might want it to be the case, but that's HTML's problem.

[18:21:04.0894] <jmdyck>
Why does EcmaScript care whether it's empty or not?

[18:35:00.0238] <bakkot>
I would guess it is just there as a consistency check: every time a context is added, it is later removed

[18:37:20.0147] <snek>
i think the spec assumes you have an outer execution context that is kept with the realm

[18:37:33.0577] <snek>
but

[18:37:48.0761] <snek>
i don't think its really necessary 

[18:38:36.0268] <jmdyck>
@bakkot: Hm, asserting non-empty on exit isn't a very good way to achieve that consistency check.

[18:39:05.0985] <snek>
we already have that consistency check built into the stack operation itself

[18:40:07.0839] <snek>
> Suspend scriptContext and remove it from the execution context stack.

presumably if this is a stack, there's only one thing you can remove 

[18:41:31.0591] <jmdyck>
I don't think there was a suggestion of ambiguity as to what to remove

[18:42:44.0298] <jmdyck>
It would be useful to assert, e.g. that ScriptEvaluation leaves the EC stack the way it found it.

[18:43:19.0991] <snek>
idk if it would be more useful than any other op that modifies the stack

[18:43:46.0543] <snek>
(which is not to say it wouldn't be useful)

[18:44:35.0950] <jmdyck>
Some stack-manipulating AOs do this by grabbing the running execution context before pushing, then after popping, saying that the pop restores the former running EC.

[18:44:54.0456] <jmdyck>
But that's not what ScriptEvaluation does.

[18:45:57.0678] <jmdyck>
Merely asserting a non-empty stack on exit doesn't achieve that at all.

[18:46:14.0491] <snek>
can i just say how much i love that SS and RS are grouped together now

[18:47:24.0067] <snek>
i think "Resume the context that is now on the top of the execution context stack as the running execution context." is pretty standard

[18:47:50.0356] <snek>
the assertion is not though

[18:50:41.0351] <jmdyck>
There are 7 occurrences of "Remove _X_ from the EC stack and restore _Y_ as the running EC."

[18:51:29.0497] <snek>
"restore" 🤔

[18:53:49.0828] <jmdyck>
(Actually, they're all literally `Remove _calleeContext_ from the execution context stack and restore _callerContext_ as the running execution context.`)

[18:57:29.0641] <jmdyck>
There's 3 occurrences of `Resume the context that is now on the top of the execution context stack as the running execution context.`

[18:59:43.0448] <snek>
yeah

[19:00:28.0287] <snek>
do we ever define what it means to suspend and resume contexts

[19:00:33.0498] <snek>
"restore" aside

[19:01:34.0615] <jmdyck>
We don't.

[19:03:53.0600] <jmdyck>
But see https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2962, which gets rid of "suspend" and "resume" as applied to ECs.

[19:04:19.0335] <jmdyck>
(Also, its first commit gets rid of "restore".)
