we're moving progressively further in that direction with our internal tooling and it's been basically fine

[17:00:34.0404] <bakkot>
you need to do some basic conservative type analysis but at least in the code I've been working with that type analysis is feasible

[17:01:30.0942] <Justin Ridgewell>
I absolutely don’t agree. Even with a full type system, the difficulty of banning `Nodelist.p.forEach` had lead to bugs for us.

[17:02:05.0437] <Justin Ridgewell>
As soon as you cast to avoid a typecheck, we get ambiguities that let it slip back in

[17:02:46.0763] <Justin Ridgewell>
Even with a type system and full typing, it’s a difficult problem

[17:03:34.0053] <Justin Ridgewell>
Requiring us to rewrite tooling infra on top of another’s type system seems bad.

Devirtualized methods are simple, tiny, fast, and extremely easy to tree shake statically

rkirsling: actually pun was not intended!

Concerning proposed Partial Function Application, should partially applying `import()`work?

[21:42:06.0211] <TabAtkins>
The import() function is just an ordinary function, yeah? Nothing special syntactically?

[21:42:18.0554] <TabAtkins>
Assuming that's true, then yeah

[21:56:11.0629] <bakkot>
no, it is a special syntactic form, not a function

[21:56:29.0805] <bakkot>
(it has to be, since it's module-relative - it's not something you could coherently pass around)

jschoi: maybe the readme could say how it differs from the `::` bind proposal? Unless maybe it is already obvious and I am just being slow
