your logs look good - for some reason Chrome offers to translate from Albanian

[02:39:57.0546] <sideshowbarker>
adding a `lang` attribute to the `html` would probably make Chrome not do that
```html
<html lang=en>
```

I'm hesitant to do this because the bot does not know what languages the channels it's scraping are in. it happens to be the case that the current set is english, but that's not a guarantee

Ah yeah that makes sense

[08:26:30.0090] <ryzokuken>
I suppose Google's auto-detection would work better once there's more content...

[08:30:40.0574] <sideshowbarker>
yeah in general language guessers arenâ€™t reliable when thereâ€™s only a small amount of content

[08:32:18.0188] <sideshowbarker>
in the W3C HTML checker I have a language-guessing library integrated in, to try to catch cases where a document has the wrong `lang` value

[08:33:15.0442] <sideshowbarker>
and the error message that guesser emits includes a link to the bug tracker, for people to report cases where itâ€™s misidentified the language of document

[08:33:19.0728] <sideshowbarker>
https://github.com/validator/validator/search?q=language+misidentified+is%3Aissue&type=issues

[08:34:02.0259] <sideshowbarker>
most of the reports are for documents with very little text content â€” things like online product catalogues

[08:35:40.0536] <sideshowbarker>
anyway, the reason that guesser was added to the HTML checker is that we know there are a significant number of documents with `lang=en` attributes that arenâ€™t in English

[08:37:18.0044] <sideshowbarker>
â€¦because of a cargo-cult copy/pasting that goes on â€” some developers donâ€™t know what`lang=en` is, but they see it in another document, so so they just copy it as-is into their document, even if itâ€™s not in English

[08:38:06.0492] <ryzokuken>
perhaps also has something to do with poorly made templates and such?

[08:38:19.0655] <sideshowbarker>
the biggest problem that causes in practice is for non-English screen-reader users

[08:38:35.0354] <sideshowbarker>
> <@usharma:igalia.com> perhaps also has something to do with poorly made templates and such?

yeah stuff like that too


[08:38:45.0523] <ryzokuken>
"my wordpress theme comes with `lang=en` set"

[08:38:52.0421] <sideshowbarker>
bingo

[08:38:57.0247] <ryzokuken>
 * "my free wordpress theme comes with `lang=en` set"

[08:39:32.0257] <sideshowbarker>
so anyway, a document having no `lang` at all is better for screen-reader users than a document have the wrong `lang` value

Was the pipeline operator proposal integrated into the ES spec itself already?

[21:25:55.0880] <sideshowbarker>
nevermind, of course not â€” I see itâ€™s only at stage 1 still

[21:39:16.0144] <sideshowbarker>
OK yeah, FYI weâ€™re dropping all info about the pipeline operator from MDN and from [BCD](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-
data)

Removing pipe operatorâ€™s documentation until itâ€™s settled seems appropriate, given its high flux, but did something happen regarding the pipe operator at the May TC39 meeting?

Nothing I know of. But as far as implementations, Firefox backed out what it had implemented for it

[23:54:43.0623] <jschoi>
Oh yeah; also seems like a good idea.

How would I go about teaching the TC39 Delegates channel that I'm a delegate?

[09:11:05.0044] <ptomato>
pinging one of the admins to add you

[09:11:40.0965] <Jack Works>
lol

[09:47:29.0639] <leobalter>
hober: do you need/want access to the TC39 Delegates channel or extended access to the Reflector repo in the TC39's GH org?

For the TC39 Delegates channel, I'd ping Aki Rob Palmer yulia, for the extended access you'd need a point of contact from your org to register a new delegate in the TC39's Admin-and-Business repo. I believe that's probably done at this point?

[09:48:16.0758] <leobalter>
I tried but I can't invite hober 

[09:52:49.0159] <Rob Palmer>
hober: you are now privileged

[09:53:07.0165] <hober>
I think I already have access to things on GitHub.

[09:53:10.0186] <hober>
Thanks!

[14:55:13.0374] <bakkot>
jmdyck: I'd like to get back to #545 now that fields have landed; but it needs a rebase, do you think you'll get a chance sometime?

[15:16:20.0947] <ljharb>
DerekNonGeneric: the stacks proposal is perfectly viable and in no way withdrawn

[15:16:49.0405] <ljharb>
DerekNonGeneric: in general, it's not necessarily appropriate for a reference implementation to exist for any pre-stage-3 proposal.

[15:19:42.0294] <ljharb>
DerekNonGeneric: also "SystemJS" has nothing to do with it - that the namespace is called "System" is the reason SystemJS named itself that, but the System namespace predates both SystemJS and the stacks proposal

[15:20:26.0521] <ljharb>
DerekNonGeneric: happy to chat more about it but the matrix interface is weird for me; i'd prefer irc :-)

[15:25:10.0345] <DerekNonGeneric>
crystal clear now, thanks ljharb

[15:50:48.0577] <jmdyck>
bakkot: 545 needs a few things more than a rebase; I should be able to get back to it soon.

oooh, looks like someone mentioned this channel somewhere

[01:00:35.0962] <ryzokuken>
the voyager bot is here...

[08:03:58.0178] <shu>
is there a way to auto-accept DM requests?

[08:04:56.0452] <littledan>
in practice, the DM request thing isn't much of a bother for me, since people can send messages before the DM request is accepted, and also because you end up having an open DM with many of the people you want to talk to
