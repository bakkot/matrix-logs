your logs look good - for some reason Chrome offers to translate from Albanian

[02:39:57.0546] <sideshowbarker>
adding a `lang` attribute to the `html` would probably make Chrome not do that
```html
<html lang=en>
```

I'm hesitant to do this because the bot does not know what languages the channels it's scraping are in. it happens to be the case that the current set is english, but that's not a guarantee

Ah yeah that makes sense

[08:26:30.0090] <ryzokuken>
I suppose Google's auto-detection would work better once there's more content...

[08:30:40.0574] <sideshowbarker>
yeah in general language guessers arenâ€™t reliable when thereâ€™s only a small amount of content

[08:32:18.0188] <sideshowbarker>
in the W3C HTML checker I have a language-guessing library integrated in, to try to catch cases where a document has the wrong `lang` value

[08:33:15.0442] <sideshowbarker>
and the error message that guesser emits includes a link to the bug tracker, for people to report cases where itâ€™s misidentified the language of document

[08:33:19.0728] <sideshowbarker>
https://github.com/validator/validator/search?q=language+misidentified+is%3Aissue&type=issues

[08:34:02.0259] <sideshowbarker>
most of the reports are for documents with very little text content â€” things like online product catalogues

[08:35:40.0536] <sideshowbarker>
anyway, the reason that guesser was added to the HTML checker is that we know there are a significant number of documents with `lang=en` attributes that arenâ€™t in English

[08:37:18.0044] <sideshowbarker>
â€¦because of a cargo-cult copy/pasting that goes on â€” some developers donâ€™t know what`lang=en` is, but they see it in another document, so so they just copy it as-is into their document, even if itâ€™s not in English

[08:38:06.0492] <ryzokuken>
perhaps also has something to do with poorly made templates and such?

[08:38:19.0655] <sideshowbarker>
the biggest problem that causes in practice is for non-English screen-reader users

[08:38:35.0354] <sideshowbarker>

yeah stuff like that too


[08:38:45.0523] <ryzokuken>
"my wordpress theme comes with `lang=en` set"

[08:38:52.0421] <sideshowbarker>
bingo

[08:38:57.0247] <ryzokuken>
 * "my free wordpress theme comes with `lang=en` set"

[08:39:32.0257] <sideshowbarker>
so anyway, a document having no `lang` at all is better for screen-reader users than a document have the wrong `lang` value

Was the pipeline operator proposal integrated into the ES spec itself already?

[21:25:55.0880] <sideshowbarker>
nevermind, of course not â€” I see itâ€™s only at stage 1 still
