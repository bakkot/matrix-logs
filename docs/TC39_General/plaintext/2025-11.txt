i wonder if we might be having too many technical discussions in the delegates channel instead of here 😄

Maybe so.

I don't envy the work done by delegates. But I am a little jealous of the trip to Japan. It sounds like a lot of fun and I think I saw something about karaoke the other day..

When less busy I should seek guidance again regarding my proposal.
