i wonder if we might be having too many technical discussions in the delegates channel instead of here 😄

Maybe so.

I don't envy the work done by delegates. But I am a little jealous of the trip to Japan. It sounds like a lot of fun and I think I saw something about karaoke the other day..

When less busy I should seek guidance again regarding my proposal.

[04:35:19.0254] <Aapo Alasuutari>
Question regarding Atomics wait/waitAsync and notify: are these intended to be just fronts for a futex API, possibly backed by the OS, or is the WL locking supposed to give some guarantees on top?

There's an atomic read inside the critical section of DoWait that makes sense to me if it is intended to model the OS futex APIs possibly never suspending a thread if the futexword comparison with value fails immediately. But is that the intention, or am I completely lost?

[06:40:56.0970] <Aapo Alasuutari>
In effect what I guess I am asking is: is the critical section supposed to protect the buffer value / reading somehow as well? Looking at normal futex APIs it seems reasonable to implement the APIs using a native futex with the exception of the "fail-fast" path for waitAsync: using just futexes, the fail-fast read has to either be a separate atomic load before calling into a futex syscall, in which case it isn't done within the futex's critical section of course, or the main thread needs to spawn a separate thread for calling the syscall and then that thread needs to ... No, I guess it's just not really possible at all.

[06:42:36.0101] <Aapo Alasuutari>
Nevermind: it's possible with a parking lot futex but as far as I can tell, the futex still needs to be locked on a separate thread and the main thread would need to block until the futex thread confirms that it is going to sleep. That hardly seems like a "fail-fast" path.

Anyone have any idea regarding the wait(Async)/notify thing above? I'm planning on just writing my implementation as a Futex syscall wrapper, and thus doing the "fail-fast" path outside of the critical section. Of course, the syscall will also perform the same read inside its critical section (presumably) so rather than moving anything, I'm just adding an extra read of the SAB to check if a syscall should be made or not.

[12:54:43.0528] <Aapo Alasuutari>
Uhh, am I crazy or is the `DoWait`'s timeout handling text just plain wrong? This is the text:

> 8. Let q be ? ToNumber(timeout).
> 9. If q is either NaN or +∞𝔽, let t be +∞; else if q is -∞𝔽, let t be 0; else let t be max(ℝ(q), 0).

But then there's a bunch of tests testing that passing `undefined` as `timeout` coerces to 0. `ToNumber(undefined)` returns `NaN` so we should go into the first branch and set t as +∞.

[12:55:06.0625] <Aapo Alasuutari>
But presumably the tests are the correct source here.

[13:00:05.0396] <Aapo Alasuutari>
I guess it's just the few tests that are wrong after all.

Aapo Alasuutari: It looks to me like the tests are correct except for the description comment. Note that the text you quote is also summarized in the tests (eg [here](https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/test/built-ins/Atomics/wait/undefined-for-timeout.js#L11-L14)). If the last argument is undefined, the intended behaviour is to not set a timeout; that's what's being tested.

[15:20:08.0348] <iain>
So basically I think the only problem is that [this line](https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/test/built-ins/Atomics/waitAsync/bigint/undefined-for-timeout.js#L6) should say "Undefined timeout arg coerced to +∞", or maybe "Undefined timeout arg should not set timeout"

Mmyup, I indeed just had a bug in my code and got quite confused about the incorrect description comment.

[23:12:58.0689] <Aapo Alasuutari>
On a related note, the `INTERPRETING.md` is a little out of date, eg. broadcast doesn't take or pass two parameters but instead just takes and passes a single SharedArrayBuffer between agents.

Also the document is seemingly missing a note about `setTimeout` which seems to be a requirement for a whopping three `waitAsync` tests. `atomicsHelper.js` does set up a custom `setTimeout` function if none exist in the global but that function is based on just `Promise.resolve().then(cb)`'ing recursively. That exercises the microtask queue until timeout, which means that the `Atomics.waitAsync` timeouts that the test is exercising do not get a chance to run (best as I can tell anyway). eg. Running the test in Node with the custom `setTimeout` function used unconditionally fails from a timeout.
