Anyone want to help back me up on https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/36746 ? The perennial confusion about the vague spec language like "For each own property key P of O"

Domenic: I think I agree with your conclusion, unless `OrdinaryOwnPropertyKeys` actually does something with the hook we do override, there's no reason to expect there would be additional own properties.

(Now whether that's good or bad, ...)

I'm looking into the Array.fromAsync proposal and have a question about what people's understanding of "Zalgo" is (to explain the [jargon](https://blog.izs.me/2013/08/designing-apis-for-asynchrony/), Zalgo is a reference to a meme, that is used as shorthand for the situation where an async operation sometimes calls a callback and sometimes doesn't)

[10:39:11.0388] <ptomato>
is throwing an error immediately, on bad input, Zalgo?
