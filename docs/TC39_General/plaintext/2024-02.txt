idea that popped into my head a few minutes ago while looking at some debugging tooling that someone made... what if you could attach metadata to stack traces to identify specific function invocations?
for example lets say you have something like an event emitter, you could do something like
```js
class Emitter {
  emit(name, data) {
    System.setStackMetadata(name);
    // ...
  }
}
```
and then in a stack trace, it would be identified as `emit (event name)` instead of just `emit`

I've wanted that for some stuff too!

I think web platform folks asked for the ocean to be boiled

[16:29:01.0893] <ljharb>
i wanted to specify just the format, and leave the contents for a follow-on, and i was blocked until i can specify the contents too

the contents as in the stringification?

[16:50:36.0460] <snek>
isn't the point of the proposal to provide structured data so that stringification doesn't need to be relied on ðŸ¤”

[17:08:43.0825] <ljharb>
yes.

[17:09:14.0575] <ljharb>
as in the exact wording of the stack trace. Which i guess would have to be in English despite the spec not specifying prose messaging.

[17:09:56.0215] <ljharb>
it certainly felt unreasonable and demotivating :-) . if folks feel like i could still come back and specify structure only, then Iâ€™d be happy to do that.

My sincerest apologies.

seems to be limited to devtools though, doesn't modify the actual stack trace

[10:09:22.0861] <annevk>
ljharb: that doesn't seem like web platform folks asking for boiling an ocean?

[10:10:44.0070] <ljharb>
i was explicitly asked to specify the exact text content of all stack traces

[10:11:02.0267] <ljharb>
what the proposal already had at that point was 100% specifying the format/structure, without locking down the contents

[10:11:42.0828] <annevk>
Maybe we have a different definition of "web platform folks"

[10:12:42.0475] <littledan>
I guess the two people in that conversation were Mathias Bynens and Till Schneidereit, who were working in JS engines at the time (but neither has that role today, so it's worth checking in with the current people)

[10:14:10.0449] <littledan>
but I would have expected browsers to ask for flexibility in how the stack trace is presented (e.g., to enable async stack traces, as Mathias mentioned)

[10:14:45.0440] <ljharb>
maybe i linked the wrong notes; as i recall it was DD and folks from v8/chrome that had the primary block

[10:15:26.0210] <littledan>
oh I see, he was there

[10:15:35.0859] <ljharb>
but the history isn't quite as important; what i stated that was agreed with was `1) do the legwork to figure out what browsers do in terms of the contents of the stack. 2) explicitly enumerate the similarities and the differences. 3) to attempt to write a spec algorithm that can allow them all and mandate one of them. 4) potentially Create a brand new structure including a preferred output. 5) ask browsers and engines that would need to make changes, what changes they may need to make.`

[10:15:41.0857] <ljharb>
and that list is definitely boiling an ocean

[10:16:08.0783] <ljharb>
whereas if i were able to standardize the structure, the way would be paved for someone more motivated than i to do that list

[10:16:38.0190] <littledan>
what would standardizing the structure mean?

[10:17:38.0677] <Chris de Almeida>
apologies if I mischaracterized or misattributed any positions re: ocean boiling

[10:19:31.0581] <annevk>
To be fair, those five points do make a lot of sense. There is often a desire to replace the old with the new, but as the old has to be maintained forever understanding it fully is essential.

[10:22:10.0035] <ljharb>
oh sure

[10:22:29.0015] <ljharb>
i think that's the right path forward overall. i just think the best way to get there is iteratively, and instead i was told "all or nothing"

[10:22:55.0855] <ljharb>
i would vastly prefer to return to the iterative approach and unblock work on those 5 points


2024-02-03
[22:27:40.0677] <Domenic>
If "the iterative approach" means "do one of those steps at a time", then that's good. If "the iterative approach" means "spec something new nobody is doing, possibly with a new API nobody ships currently", then that's bad.

[00:03:08.0983] <ljharb>
the structure i've had in the proposal since 2019 is exactly what everyone's already doing. it does add some new APIs nobody ships as well (whose implementation basically matches what everyone's already doing), but i'm not sure why that would be bad, that's just what almost every proposal is.

[00:03:13.0338] <ljharb>

[00:09:49.0993] <littledan>
Yeah I agree that it would be good to start this project with finding what JS implementations put in their stack traces and comparing them. Just doing that without the subsequent steps would be an interesting and meaningful report, helping any future stack trace API effort

[08:14:58.0975] <snek>
i think all of the error stringification should be removed from this proposal

[08:15:53.0981] <snek>
or at *most*, say that `Error.prototype.stack` and `"string"` are both the result of some implementer defined AO 

[12:51:34.0086] <ljharb>
that wouldn't constrain the format/structure tho, so what would be the value


2024-02-04
[17:36:30.0376] <snek>
wdym? do you think there's some value in .stack matching in all impls? I feel like it only needs to match if it's the only way to get data, but if there's a whole array of data, there's no reason to care about the strkng.

[17:40:43.0756] <snek>
* wdym? do you think there's some value in .stack matching in all impls? I feel like it only needs to match if it's the only way to get data, but if there's a whole array of data, there's no reason to care about the string.

[19:39:55.0007] <ljharb>
the string part would just be to lock down whatâ€™s there. Certainly nobody should be using the string once the structure is available.

[19:40:20.0872] <ljharb>
.stack canâ€™t ever not be a string tho, that wouldnâ€™t be web compat


2024-02-05
[19:20:13.0985] <littledan>
Two things can be true at once: it may be that any API which unifies implementations is new (Mozillaâ€™s experience makes this very likely, if I understand it correctly), but it could also be necessary to have a very detailed understanding of the current state of the world to be able to formulate such a unified API.

[19:22:10.0516] <littledan>
Starting with developing the understanding helps keep our feet on the ground. Design of a new API can be an important part of the process without being able to proceed on its own. (IMO it isnâ€™t bad to jump the gun and sketch out something early, as long as the next steps are well-understood)

[19:24:20.0223] <littledan>
(I mean, as long as it is understood that the implementation research is next)

2 years later I remembered to type this up. Was thinking someone else was going to. Is there any issues with adding optional chaining to the LHS for statements as presented here: https://github.com/sirisian/optional-operators It does take up a lot of syntax so I kind of get why it wasn't considered early on. I'll make a post on es discourse if there's nothing obvious like parsing ambiguities.

Thereâ€™s a Stage 1 proposal for that: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining-assignment

I told myself to go check the stage 1 and figured there wasn't one. That's awesome to see.

I feel very excited about function decorators. It can improve DX when I write React.

I used to write components like this (because function declaration has no evaluation step in the debugger) `export function C() {}`, but when I need to `memo` it, I had to rewrite it to `export const C = () => {}`.

If we have this, I can attach `@memo` before the declaration and all things done

nicolo-ribaudo: When you were working on the LHS optional chaining did having optional operators come up? (As a separate proposal). a.b ?+= 1 behavior where if b is undefined or null the nothing happens.

Can you elaborate on why this is better?

[14:48:48.0410] <Ashley Claymore>
One thing that is annoying with currently needing to do `export const Button = React.memo((props => { ... });` is that the function becomes anonymous.

being able to do

```
@React.memo
export function Button(props) { ... }
```

is easier to keep the name, and didn't need to rearrange the code to add the wrapper 

[15:09:27.0901] <nicolo-ribaudo>
No, the optionality was only ever for property access

[15:25:00.0017] <Jack Works>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> Can you elaborate on why this is better?

I can add @memo directly, without having to convert function declaration into lexical declaration + function expression manually

[15:26:36.0753] <Jack Works>
(although I can do `C = memo(C)` but typescript won't be happy, I think `export function C` should not be reassigned)

[16:18:47.0914] <ptomato>
is there generally accepted JS jargon for what I've been calling "user code calls"? that is, when some innocuous-looking JS code that doesn't obviously call a function, does actually call a function that may be defined somewhere else in the code (like `+value` may end up calling `value[Symbol.toPrimitive]()`, etc.)
