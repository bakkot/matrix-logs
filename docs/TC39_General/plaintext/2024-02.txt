idea that popped into my head a few minutes ago while looking at some debugging tooling that someone made... what if you could attach metadata to stack traces to identify specific function invocations?
for example lets say you have something like an event emitter, you could do something like
```js
class Emitter {
  emit(name, data) {
    System.setStackMetadata(name);
    // ...
  }
}
```
and then in a stack trace, it would be identified as `emit (event name)` instead of just `emit`
