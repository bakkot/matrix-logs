idea that popped into my head a few minutes ago while looking at some debugging tooling that someone made... what if you could attach metadata to stack traces to identify specific function invocations?
for example lets say you have something like an event emitter, you could do something like
```js
class Emitter {
  emit(name, data) {
    System.setStackMetadata(name);
    // ...
  }
}
```
and then in a stack trace, it would be identified as `emit (event name)` instead of just `emit`

I've wanted that for some stuff too!

error stacks proposal would be nice

I think web platform folks asked for the ocean to be boiled

i wanted to specify just the format, and leave the contents for a follow-on, and i was blocked until i can specify the contents too
