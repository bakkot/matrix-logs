Is there a way to view a rendered version of pull requests to ECMA-262, preferably with marked-up deltas? For example, reading a rendered version of https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2942/files.

jschoi: at the bottom, click "show all checks", then scroll down to "Begin.com build preview â€” Preview ready!" and click the "details" button

[09:52:32.0590] <bakkot>
for rendered _diffs_, you can use https://arai-a.github.io/ecma262-compare/

[09:52:51.0651] <bakkot>
e.g. https://arai-a.github.io/ecma262-compare/?pr=2942

html should just queue tasks until either the module is done evaluating or until a listener is added

 * html should just queue events until either the module is done evaluating or until a listener is added, or just not support modules as a serviceworker entrypoint

"just"... I think SW had module support before TLA.
