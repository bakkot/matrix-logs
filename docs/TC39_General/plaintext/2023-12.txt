Is there a way to view a rendered version of pull requests to ECMA-262, preferably with marked-up deltas? For example, reading a rendered version of https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2942/files.

jschoi: at the bottom, click "show all checks", then scroll down to "Begin.com build preview â€” Preview ready!" and click the "details" button

for rendered _diffs_, you can use https://arai-a.github.io/ecma262-compare/

[09:52:51.0651] <bakkot>
e.g. https://arai-a.github.io/ecma262-compare/?pr=2942
