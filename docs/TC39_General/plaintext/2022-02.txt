jmdyck: FYI, I made further changes based on review comments from other MDN writers. If/when you have time to take a look at the current text, that’d be much welcome.

sideshowbarker: I think the "For example" para has a problem where it says `and you change that to {"list":["oil","flour","sugar"]}`, because it depends on how one imagines accomplishing that change. I read it as (say) `copy[1] = {"list": ...}`, but I'm guessing you meant it as `copy[1].list = ["oil"...]`. The first isn't 'visible' to the original, the second is.

Ah yes, thanks, I'll fix that
