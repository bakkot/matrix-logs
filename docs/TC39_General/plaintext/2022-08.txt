For a Pattern ({ a: b }), is Assignment ( pattern = expr ) and ForIn/ForOf ( for (pattern of) ) the only case that can change "b" instead of declare a new "b"?

they do appear to be the only two places that reference AssignmentPattern in the spec, other references are for early errors

Did github get rid of the "suggest a change" button (when reviewing  a PR)? Or has it moved somewhere?
