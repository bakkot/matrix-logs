For a Pattern ({ a: b }), is Assignment ( pattern = expr ) and ForIn/ForOf ( for (pattern of) ) the only case that can change "b" instead of declare a new "b"?

[05:37:33.0833] <Ashley Claymore>
they do appear to be the only two places that reference AssignmentPattern in the spec, other references are for early errors

does anyone know any tools to catch inconsistent sort functions in codebases? like some sort of linting

[10:33:16.0853] <snek>
my top idea right now is if development, override Array.prototype.sort with a custom function that checks and yells at you

What do you mean by inconsistent sorts? 

[05:59:12.0913] <Ashley Claymore>
`(a, b) => Math.random() > 0.5 ? -1 : 1`

[06:00:51.0049] <Ashley Claymore>
I could swear some browsers do (or used to) throw if they detected an inconsistent sort while running their algo

[06:12:41.0256] <Jack Works>
Enforced PartialOrd 🤔

[06:30:59.0462] <Ashley Claymore>
In ES5 said "If comparefn [..] is not a consistent comparison function [...] the behaviour of sort is implementation-defined." - which would have allowed an engine to throw if it detected it

[06:31:46.0063] <Ashley Claymore>
now we seem to only say that the "SortOrder" is implementation defined. So I _think_ throwing would no longer be spec compliant

[06:32:07.0425] <Ashley Claymore>
 * now we seem to only say that the "SortOrder" is implementation defined. So I _think_ throwing would no longer be spec compliant

[06:56:43.0823] <jmdyck>
ES6 (draft 27) changed "the behaviour of sort is implementation-defined" to "the sort order is implementation-defined" in that sentence.

i just fixed a change someone made with a sort function inconsistent to the point that it displayed somewhat normally but still weird on chrome, reversed on firefox, and random order in hermes

[10:14:13.0659] <snek>
nothing threw thankfully :)

[10:15:26.0849] <Ashley Claymore>

[10:15:32.0170] <snek>

yes

[10:16:47.0127] <Ashley Claymore>
it sounds more like an esoteric JS quiz question

[10:17:10.0097] <snek>
yeah we need more implementation defined behavior

[10:17:22.0167] <snek>
like those funny c programs 

[10:17:39.0201] <Ashley Claymore>
`evalAsYouLike(...)`

[10:18:13.0001] <snek>
technically `eval('debugger')` returns an implementation defined value

[10:18:27.0932] <snek>
i don't think anyone does anything interesting with it

[10:19:05.0763] <snek>
we should specify that to return undefined lol

i legit tried searching for this the other day, with lots of keywords, and i am surprised to not even find any bad statups advertising this?

[13:38:09.0721] <bakkot>
there's just not that much implementation-defined behavior

[13:38:40.0012] <bakkot>
and a majority of it is stuff like the precision of math operations and number parsing, which no one wants to audit

[13:39:03.0776] <bakkot>

eslint has some of those checks, as does typescript

[13:40:49.0014] <bakkot>
but they're static, yes

[13:41:46.0536] <snek>
maybe a good one would have been catching the `__proto__` bugs that every json handling http library has

[13:42:20.0737] <bakkot>
by adding a check at every single computed property assignment?

[13:42:39.0709] <bakkot>
I mean... I guess? but you'd still need to actually run into the bad code for it to be triggered

[13:42:46.0076] <bakkot>
that one seems like a better use case for a fuzzer

[13:42:53.0128] <bakkot>
 * that one seems like a better use case for a fuzzer

[13:43:09.0973] <snek>

or letting it loose on your users 😄

[13:43:34.0971] <bakkot>
ah, sure

[13:43:50.0725] <bakkot>
a ubsan designed to be used with a fuzzer would be valuable, for sure

[13:44:08.0635] <snek>
at discord we have a system that scans for a11y problems as users use the app and reports them 

[13:44:43.0756] <snek>
its an interesting concept

[13:47:48.0507] <bakkot>
>by adding a check at every single computed property assignment?

on further consideration you'd do this by overriding `Object.prototype.__proto__` and friends, of course

which means `for (const a of b) { eval("debugger") }` might be able to break the for loop?

function calls are not allowed to return break or continue completions 

[20:34:18.0341] <snek>
if someone cares we should add the same restriction to debugger 

[20:34:29.0938] <snek>
or just remove the return entirely 

[20:36:02.0387] <snek>
actually I wonder.... direct eval may not have that assert cuz it forks evaluatecall

Oh then `for (x in b) debugger` 😂

I’m looking forward to the proposal that adds `forAwaitEach` to the iterator and async iterator prototypes.

[12:45:24.0555] <Kris Kowal>
> <@kriskowal:matrix.org> I’m looking forward to the proposal that adds `forAwaitEach` to the iterator and async iterator prototypes.

Such that it returns a promise for the final value https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/issues/217

[12:50:23.0821] <bakkot>
hmm, really the async `forEach` should be returning a promise already

[12:50:30.0596] <bakkot>
so you can tell if it's done / catch errors

[12:50:43.0925] <Kris Kowal>
Yes

[12:51:01.0814] <bakkot>
I am less sold on the `return` value, mostly because I've never encountered a compelling use case

[12:52:26.0153] <Kris Kowal>
Came up because a member of Agoric’s dev community needed the final value from one of our async iterators https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/discussions/5924#discussioncomment-3378600

[12:53:32.0171] <Kris Kowal>
In this case, the final iteration value is a timestamp that marks the time the sequence stopped.

[16:43:46.0801] <snek>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> hmm, really the async `forEach` should be returning a promise already

was this not already the case?

[16:53:37.0300] <Kris Kowal>
I can imagine there being a concern if `AsyncIterator.prototype.forEach` returns a promise where folks expect `forEach` generally to not return a promise. A pretty easy solution to that would be to have `Iterator.prototype.forEach`, `Iterator.prototype.forAwaitEach`, and `AsyncIterator.prototype.forAwaitEach`, but no `AsyncIterator.prototype.forEach`.

[16:53:48.0915] <Kris Kowal>

Where `forEach` returns the final value and `forAwaitEach` returns a promise for the final value.


2022-08-12
[17:26:43.0599] <Kris Kowal>
I see `toAsync` and how it avoids a {,Async} method name doubling so please disregard forAwaitEach and just assume I mean the behavior of AsyncIterator.protoype.forEach, which I think should return a promise for the done value

Are there tests somewhere for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-legacy-features/ ?

I’m looking in https://github.com/tc39/test262 and not finding anything — but maybe I’m not looking in the right place.

e.g., looking in https://github.com/tc39/test262/tree/main/test/built-ins/RegExp I’d naïvely expect to find some test for `RegExp.input`…

[23:54:08.0701] <Domenic>
sideshowbarker: the cursed annex B division strikes again, https://github.com/tc39/test262/tree/main/test/annexB/built-ins/RegExp/legacy-accessors

[23:54:33.0036] <sideshowbarker>
/me looks

[23:54:57.0526] <Domenic>
There, uh, appear to be no actual tests of the functionality...

[23:55:12.0373] <Domenic>
Just tests that it *doesn't* work in some situations

[23:55:25.0061] <Domenic>
Possibly that's why it's stuck at stage 3

[23:56:00.0095] <littledan>
yeah tests and implementation priority (I guess it goes both ways)

[23:56:25.0759] <littledan>
I mean, engines implement legacy accessors, but I don't know if they implement the cleanups proposed

[23:56:44.0770] <Domenic>
Not sure how up to date https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-legacy-features/blob/master/changes.md is

[23:57:09.0187] <littledan>
ES6 made some limits on how bad the legacy accessors could possibly be, and the proposal spells things out in an even "cleaner" way than that

[23:57:42.0421] <littledan>
yeah I don't know either, I haven't been following browser changes here

[23:58:03.0875] <littledan>
so, yeah, if someone wants a project, that's up for grabs and there's a clear way forward

[23:58:41.0601] <littledan>
namely, write the tests, assess which browsers already do those semantics, and maybe implement in a browser and convince them to ship

[03:59:48.0093] <sideshowbarker>

JSON and AJAX popped into existence around the same time. The X in AJAX became J some time between the original blog and when someone read the blog.
