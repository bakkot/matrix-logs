Question. Possibly I'm not searching the right terms, but when async/await was added to ECMAScript, why was threading never pulled into the core language away from Web Workers? (As others I've done the blob thing for years with workers when doing heavily threaded things). I kind of expected that one would be able to just call an async function and have it execute on another thread by now with intuitive shared state, but that was never proposed. Why not?
