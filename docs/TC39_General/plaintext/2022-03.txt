danielrosenwasser / rbuckton: The new What's Changed Since RC/Beta in the TS release notes are üëç

Question. Possibly I'm not searching the right terms, but when async/await was added to ECMAScript, why was threading never pulled into the core language away from Web Workers? (As others I've done the blob thing for years with workers when doing heavily threaded things). I kind of expected that one would be able to just call an async function and have it execute on another thread by now with intuitive shared state, but that was never proposed. Why not?

[17:55:08.0758] <bakkot>
"intuitive shared state" is a contradiction in terms

[17:55:51.0018] <bakkot>
the thing you're proposing would be incredibly complicated to specify or implement, and we're just now getting to the point where we're fleshing out the building blocks which might let us get there someday

or, well, not there precisely, but somewhere like it

we're on the route of that. ü§î
search for those proposals:
- struct (shared struct section)
- module block
