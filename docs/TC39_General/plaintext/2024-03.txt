(I donâ€™t have a real position one way or the other on undefined/null; was not trying to make a particular argument about which should be used where)

interesting feedback on observables from the W3C TAG:  https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/902#issuecomment-1942576159

[14:39:51.0337] <littledan>
Is anyone interested in discussing Observables in TC39, as Lea recommends?

[14:59:00.0815] <bakkot>
ljharb was definitely interested in seeing it go through TC39 IIRC

[14:59:36.0996] <littledan>
(I'm neutral on venue in theory, but it'd be good to have *a* venue where discussions can take place.)

[14:59:53.0654] <shu>
i'd like to first be convinced that a discussion would be productive

[15:00:45.0722] <shu>
it is a thing we have already discussed in the past

[15:00:58.0673] <littledan>
literally no one has brought it to committee since 2016

[15:01:25.0973] <shu>
wasn't abortcontroller the sticking point back then too?

[15:01:37.0258] <littledan>
It was very much not shot down at that time

[15:01:47.0963] <shu>
i see

[15:01:50.0314] <littledan>
a version was created which was based on the concurrent TC39 cancellation version

[15:01:57.0099] <littledan>
which was also not shot down, just withdrawn by the champion

[15:02:43.0349] <shu>
i am not opposed to discussion provided that we first agree on goals, since the champion in this case already chose to not bring this to tc39

[15:02:46.0997] <littledan>
I think we have had significant cultural problems that led to this demotivation, and we're not perfect, but I'd say it was definitely worse in 2016

[15:03:23.0451] <shu>
given that we cannot force it to be under tc39 purview, what is the goal of the discussion? is it design feedback? is it like a resolution to try to convince the champion to bring it to tc39?

[15:04:54.0859] <littledan>
well, the purpose of me raising it in this current discussion was, "hey, we care about the TAG thinks, they had a recommendation for us, what should we do"
