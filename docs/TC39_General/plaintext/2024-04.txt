Did anyone ever discuss import attribute preprocessors? Like the ability to register a "type" preprocessor that runs over imports matching  a type or condition? (I can only think of questionable use cases, but I'm still curious).

We’ve been thinking about this as a potential “loader” hook. Probably the folks in the TC39 module harmony chat would have further thoughts.

Oh right "loader". I see a few issues now mentioning that.

littledan: Is that a public room?

Hello! I'm with the signals group!

Wanted to share what library code could look like without effects https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/signal-utils

Is there a specific channel/venue for discussing the pending signals proposal? Or is this the place? :)

[09:04:59.0952] <littledan>
For now we just have the discord and the proposal repo. We discussed signals a bunch in #tc39-delegates:matrix.org during the meeting and a bit afterwards.

[09:05:32.0968] <littledan>
Would folks be interested in having a Matrix-side channel for Signals? Would that make it easier for people here, if you want to keep discussing it? (Please emoji-react if you're interested in joining such a channel)

ideally all TC39-related chat channels/rooms would be colocated (in matrix). we also have an obligation to ensure all technical discussion is public and matrix is where we have the archiving capability so that helps with that

I would go further and say that it would be ideal to have the main chatroom on signals be a matrix room, I feel that a discord server is overkill for this and not as inclusive.

For context, we did originally try Matrix last year when we were getting an idea on who was interested in the idea of this (this was very early on). There were a number of folks who found Matrix (or maybe Elements) buggy at the time and hard to follow with threads, so engagement went down until we moved to Discord.

I feel that revisiting this might be worthwhile though.

[10:13:59.0250] <littledan>
Yeah we just weren’t able to engage the stakeholders on Matrix. I tried. We’ll make a Signals chat here, but I won’t close the other ones.

[10:14:31.0110] <littledan>
I got lots of people to make Matrix accounts but they just didn’t make themselves as accessible.
