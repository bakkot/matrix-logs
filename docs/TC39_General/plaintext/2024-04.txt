Did anyone ever discuss import attribute preprocessors? Like the ability to register a "type" preprocessor that runs over imports matching  a type or condition? (I can only think of questionable use cases, but I'm still curious).

We’ve been thinking about this as a potential “loader” hook. Probably the folks in the TC39 module harmony chat would have further thoughts.

Oh right "loader". I see a few issues now mentioning that.
