Did anyone ever discuss import attribute preprocessors? Like the ability to register a "type" preprocessor that runs over imports matching  a type or condition? (I can only think of questionable use cases, but I'm still curious).

We’ve been thinking about this as a potential “loader” hook. Probably the folks in the TC39 module harmony chat would have further thoughts.

Oh right "loader". I see a few issues now mentioning that.

littledan: Is that a public room?

Hello! I'm with the signals group!

Wanted to share what library code could look like without effects https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/signal-utils

Is there a specific channel/venue for discussing the pending signals proposal? Or is this the place? :)

[09:04:59.0952] <littledan>
For now we just have the discord and the proposal repo. We discussed signals a bunch in #tc39-delegates:matrix.org during the meeting and a bit afterwards.

Would folks be interested in having a Matrix-side channel for Signals? Would that make it easier for people here, if you want to keep discussing it? (Please emoji-react if you're interested in joining such a channel)
