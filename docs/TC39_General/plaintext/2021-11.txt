what if we added toml to the stdlib

[10:09:22.0318] <bakkot>
i feel like it does not have a good place in JS

[10:09:51.0259] <bakkot>
it's intended as a human-readable config language, which makes sense for server-side apps but not really for any other JS users

https://github.com/kaist-plrg/jiset is neat

[14:12:29.0026] <ljharb>
browser-side users need to configure things too

@bakkot: yeah, it looks like they're doing something similar to my ecmaspeak project

[14:53:34.0445] <jmdyck>

would be cool if one of these spec evaluators can replace engine262 one day

it looks like jiset was for some sort of university study
