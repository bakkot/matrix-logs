what if we added toml to the stdlib

[10:09:22.0318] <bakkot>
i feel like it does not have a good place in JS

[10:09:51.0259] <bakkot>
it's intended as a human-readable config language, which makes sense for server-side apps but not really for any other JS users

[13:40:29.0456] <bakkot>
https://github.com/kaist-plrg/jiset is neat

[13:40:50.0533] <bakkot>
(jmdyck I imagine you might be particularly interested)

[14:12:29.0026] <ljharb>
browser-side users need to configure things too

[14:39:49.0110] <jmdyck>
@bakkot: yeah, it looks like they're doing something similar to my ecmaspeak project

[14:53:34.0445] <jmdyck>

Can anyone give me an example of an observable effect of what is explained in the second pagraph of the first note of https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-weakref-execution? I initially came up with this:
```
let obj = { x: 1 };
let ref = new WeakRef(obj);
await null; // I think we need to wait to allow WeakRefs to be emptied
console.log(ref.deref(), obj.x);
```

which I though might log `undefined, 1` because it doesn't observe the _identity_ of `obj`.

However, an _hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious execution_ (as defined in "9.10.2 - Liveness") might be `obj === obj`, which observes the identity of `obj` and thus makes it "live" and non-collectable, so `ref.deref()` must return `obj`.

it's saying "if your code could be evaluated with defef() always returning null and still observe the identity of the object, the object is live"

[06:43:55.0791] <devsnek>

FYI, the releasing of kept objects is a host defined operation, so it may not happen at a promise job boundary. In particular, AFAIK most engines only clear kept objects when the promise queue is drained.

[10:41:41.0154] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@devsnek:matrix.org> it's saying "if your code could be evaluated with defef() always returning null and still observe the identity of the object, the object is live"

Correct. Here is the PR that introduced the weak-ref oblivious execution: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-weakrefs/pull/142
I don't know how @syg came up with it, but it was very clever!

[10:46:21.0717] <devsnek>
yeah everything in the spec here is sort of "outer limits" on what engines must do. in practice they are not perfect at removing dead objects and cannot run gc immediately every time the job queue is empty, etc.

[10:49:07.0063] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Thanks everyone!

[11:00:26.0965] <shu>
yeah, the spec only says when it is allowed to empty a WeakRef, so that you can reason about WeakRefs which _must not_ be emptied according to the spec

[11:00:41.0696] <shu>
conversely, an implementation that never empties WeakRefs, or never GCs at all, is always compliant

[11:00:44.0270] <shu>
not that anyone really does that

[11:01:35.0709] <shu>
IOW you cannot write interoperable tests that test for "this WeakRef must be empty now", only "this WeakRef must not be empty now"

[11:04:01.0652] <shu>
you _can_ write tests that test implications, though, like "if this WeakRef is now empty, then these other properties must hold"

[11:04:05.0689] <shu>
test262 have tests of that shape

[11:04:13.0447] <devsnek>
shu now you need to write a turbofan pass that inlines `obj.x`

[11:04:32.0678] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> test262 have tests of that shape

They're actually broken, I have on my todo to fix them

[11:04:40.0370] <shu>
oh yeah?

[11:06:10.0402] <Mathieu Hofman>
The hooks and most tests still use `cleanupSome`.

[11:06:17.0825] <shu>
oh lol

[11:06:25.0909] <devsnek>
i miss cleanupSome 

[11:06:31.0161] <Mathieu Hofman>
I rewrote the hooks locally already, I need to fix all the tests

[11:06:43.0336] <shu>
excellent, than kyou

[11:07:33.0201] <devsnek>
is cleanupSome just waiting on the champions at this point

[11:08:40.0421] <Mathieu Hofman>
Would be neat to have a flag to the test262 execution that says "this implementation supports GC and has all host hooks implemented, so these tests must collect as expected"

[11:09:38.0068] <shu>
devsnek: more than that was my understanding; Apple already rejected the wasm use case as compelling enough to add cleanupSome, and i don't know that a more compelling argument has been presented

[11:09:39.0952] <devsnek>
are you saying people provide no-op hooks? :O

[11:10:39.0988] <Mathieu Hofman>
Correct the current gc hooks are not, afaik, provided by the different implementations, so it's relying on a fallback, which is not working right.

[11:11:43.0705] <devsnek>
its weird that apple cares about the aesthetics of cleanupSome but not of Atomics, both being designed to be used in weird non-idiomatic-js cases

[11:11:48.0748] <Mathieu Hofman>
I'm talking about the `clearKeptObjects` and "cleanupFinalizationRegistries" which is not a currently requested hook but should be

[11:13:08.0300] <devsnek>
hmm why don't i implement clearKeptObjects ü§î

[11:13:47.0302] <devsnek>
does $262.clearKeptObjects just call ClearKeptObjects

[11:13:49.0820] <devsnek>
 * does $262.clearKeptObjects just call ClearKeptObjects

[11:13:57.0590] <devsnek>
its not in INTERPRETING.md

[11:15:19.0187] <Mathieu Hofman>
FYI, here is the async-gc harness fixed to not rely on `cleanupSome` and one test fixed: https://github.com/mhofman/test262/commit/a4ae8c8102586a29e06292556bc565776d19b045
Haven't gotten around on fixing the rest

[11:26:09.0532] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@devsnek:matrix.org> hmm why don't i implement clearKeptObjects ü§î

Yeah I remember engine262 didn't expose the hooks, and the built-in fallbacks didn't work, so I couldn't check it worked there. The fallbacks I wrote cover at least JSC, SM, v8 and XS

[11:26:55.0589] <Mathieu Hofman>
I also found some weird behaviors in engine262 which claimed some things get cleaned up when they shouldn't. That was a separate and much more involved test, and I didn't have time to dig in

[11:27:56.0381] <devsnek>
stuff should be pretty easy to impl in engine262 when you're testing

[11:28:28.0806] <devsnek>

anyone doing any work with JS CSTs lately? I‚Äôve been doing a lot of codegen/codemod work lately and the idea of rolling my own sounds like a lot of work 

[15:10:56.0863] <bakkot>
define "doing any work with"

[15:11:32.0903] <bakkot>
I have been in the process of updating our AST (shift), which supports location information and comment although I wouldn't exactly call it a CST

[15:11:57.0042] <bakkot>
what sort of thing are you looking for?

[15:24:58.0564] <rickbutton>
yeah I guess I should clarify I'm not actually looking for a "true" CST from like grammar rules but an AST with additional metadata for comments/semicolons/etc that doesn't fit into a standard estree AST. for context, I've skimmed the various convos on estree/parser repos on this, but the convo seems to have stopped, im wondering if anyone has found a good way to do it

[15:25:01.0269] <rickbutton>
i should look at shift

[15:31:54.0855] <bakkot>
shift just has side tables for comments and location data

[15:32:11.0353] <bakkot>
not really any fancier than you'd get from babel's parser or any other, really

[15:33:00.0438] <bakkot>
the usual approach, or at least my approach, is to slice out input source text using the location data, and inspect that for whatever you're interested in

[15:38:40.0572] <rickbutton>
i see

I think your understanding is correct. Though there isn‚Äôt necessarily a need for a ‚Äúseparate JS-closures-memory-space‚Äù. Closures can be objects that live on the same JS heap as the other JS objects. And host-integrations can keep references to JS objects that will be compatible with the JS garbage collector.

yea, later i realized this might be more natural

[06:04:22.0081] <vrafaeli>
The only difference is that these objects are not referenced from JS "context" but from outside of the context

Does anyone have insight into why Generator and AsyncFunction were made separate types from Function? 

[12:53:20.0793] <bakkot>
what does "separate types" mean

[12:54:31.0157] <bakkot>
if you just mean "exist as separate objects", Generator objects need to inherit from the Generator prototype to have `.next`, which should not be on regular functions

[12:55:25.0210] <bakkot>
also, they allow you to dynamically construct a generator or async function from source text, although doing so is ev[ai]l and should be shunned

[13:06:56.0418] <jschoi>
Ah, yeah, right‚Äî`.next`. And yeah, that‚Äôs what I meant.
Was AsyncFunction separated as a separate type from Function just to parallel Generator?

Hi guys wondering if there is an existing proposal for the non-null assertion operator?

e.g.

```

No proposal for it as I know

[03:34:42.0934] <David Alberto Adler>

assert(foo, 'missing foo')
```

Using `eval` to try and disable all optimisations would be cheating right?..

[13:15:47.0401] <bakkot>
`new WeakRef(obj)` actually is a liveness fence, by my reading

[13:16:10.0606] <bakkot>
since it adds `obj` to `KeptAlive`

[13:22:52.0745] <shu>
well, for one turn

[13:23:14.0570] <shu>
oh, like, constantly creating new WeakRefs?

[13:23:25.0004] <shu>
in practice i agree that is a fence

[13:23:44.0023] <shu>
but we hung all of this on observability which we also agreed to be too hard to pin down

[13:24:08.0445] <shu>
if the `new WeakRef(obj)` itself is unobservable, i'd imagine its effects to also be up for as-if DCE

[13:24:18.0665] <shu>
(though in practice of course nobody does that)

[13:28:48.0507] <shu>
i guess it's not that the `new WeakRef(obj)` would be unobservable, but whether the [[KeptAlive]] addition is unobservable

[13:33:42.0698] <bakkot>
right, and it is in fact observable, because addition to [[KeptAlive]] prevents collecting on the current turn

[13:34:08.0118] <bakkot>
 * right, and it is in fact observable, because addition to [[KeptAlive]] prevents collecting on the current turn

[13:34:41.0838] <shu>
i think there are cases that could be unobservable, but only theoretically

[13:35:51.0946] <shu>
like, if you have no `FinalizationRegistry`s or if the finalizer functions themselves are unobservable

[13:36:48.0260] <shu>
cause, like, are `malloc` and `free` observable? with an oracle i could stack allocate it

[13:37:04.0222] <bakkot>
well, sure, but then you can't tell it's _not_ acting as a fence

[13:37:05.0978] <bakkot>
by definition

[13:37:43.0658] <shu>
you can, because there's always an observability gap between the debugging tools and the optimizer

[13:38:07.0579] <shu>
debugging tool (looking at RSS size or whatever) has the assumption all memory in a process is observable

[13:38:11.0709] <shu>
the optimizer obviously does not have that assumption

[13:38:14.0531] <shu>
if there is no gap, then i'd agree

[13:38:34.0727] <shu>
again this is academic, in practice it is a universal fence because we'll never be that optimized

[13:38:44.0923] <bakkot>
well, ok, ignoring the debugger

[13:39:02.0057] <shu>
but how else do you observe that your finalizers are firing?

[13:39:07.0947] <shu>
like practically speaking

[13:39:10.0248] <bakkot>
they have side effects?

[13:39:21.0082] <shu>
yeah, they consider freeing up memory or a resource a side effect

[13:39:38.0140] <bakkot>
no, I mean, you can have a finalizer which has side effects

[13:39:39.0484] <bakkot>
in javascript

[13:39:53.0150] <shu>
right

[13:39:58.0089] <bakkot>
like, actual program-level side effects, not just freeing memory or whatever

[13:39:59.0556] <shu>
i'm saying, _if_ the finalizer is observable

[13:40:07.0300] <shu>
then [[KeptAlive]] is observable

[13:40:16.0452] <shu>
if it is not, i see it as fair game to optimize away too

[13:40:22.0731] <bakkot>
right, sure

[13:40:31.0014] <bakkot>
because it's not observable that you did that

[13:40:39.0701] <bakkot>
 * because it's not observable that you did that

[13:40:50.0957] <shu>
and the tricky thing is, whether we should consider a finalizer to be observable

[13:40:53.0233] <bakkot>
(without using the debugger or looking at memory usage)

[13:41:03.0264] <shu>
because if you ask most practitioners, do you think `free` is observable

[13:41:04.0754] <shu>
they'd say yes

[13:41:13.0262] <shu>
if you ask a POPL author

[13:41:17.0025] <shu>
then shrug

[13:41:51.0532] <bakkot>
I think JS programmers generally aren't thinking about memory usage, at least not as a property of their program rather than of a particular implementation

[13:41:55.0415] <shu>
maybe the right answer here is, ignore my PL semantics rambling and just use [[KeptAlive]]

[13:42:04.0919] <shu>
let me say that

[13:44:29.0658] <shu>
okay, back to the real world where liveness is just simple reachability of a particular implementation

in practice this kind of code already exists in wasm libraries

[16:11:02.0631] <devsnek>
also do any implementations even *attempt* to perform scalar replacement across function boundaries? i would be very surprised if any did

[17:53:04.0835] <Jack Works>
As I know the usage of decorator doesn't change so much. The underlying semantics changed so if you're not aimed to teach someone to write their own decorators, old tutorial might work too. 

[07:34:49.0459] <iain>
devsnek: SM does scalar replacement post-inlining, so it's technically across function boundaries, but we're quite conservative. In particular, we don't reason about individual fields; either an object is completely scalar-replaced, or it escapes and we do nothing. `this` escapes in the linked example, so we would not do scalar-replacement in this case.

By my reading, there is no mathematical value "-0", only "0", and "negative zero" can only be expressed with a Number value "-0ùîΩ". Can anyone confirm that?

[13:14:00.0521] <bakkot>
jugglinmike: yup, that's correct

[13:15:07.0713] <jugglinmike>
Thanks, bakkot ! And if I'd been just a little more patient, I might have answered this for myself from 262: "The mathematical value of +0ùîΩ and -0ùîΩ is the mathematical value 0."

`"".prop = 1` // throws
`Object("").prop = 1` OK

[16:29:21.0673] <bakkot>
Ashley Claymore: only in strict mode!

[16:30:22.0362] <bakkot>
jschoi: I would encourage telling beginners to only ever write or think about strict mode code, and to avoid telling them things which are only relevant to sloppy mode

[16:30:33.0741] <Ashley Claymore>
Right, if set returns false it only throws in strict.

[16:30:52.0722] <Ashley Claymore>
What I mean is you get a different behaviour between auto-box and explicit box 

[16:31:35.0533] <Ashley Claymore>
the auto-box acts like it‚Äôs non-extensible, but the actual box is extensible 

[16:33:34.0966] <bakkot>
it's... actually weirder than that

[16:34:09.0324] <jugglinmike>
Can ECMA262 have a tagline?

[16:35:21.0614] <bakkot>
`'use strict'; Object.defineProperty(Number.prototype, 'x', { set: () => { console.log(this) } }); (3).x = 2; // works!`

[16:36:25.0263] <bakkot>
it's not that the auto-box acts like it's non-extensible, it's that in strict mode the [[Set]] sees the target as the primitive, rather than as the box, which is observable with setters

[16:36:36.0720] <Mathieu Hofman>
In sloppy mode `this` gets converted to object, so `PutValue` operates on the boxed version, and ToObject simply returns the already boxed value
In strict mode, the value stays a primitive, ToObject boxes it, so `set` is given the primitive as receiver, which it checks, and throws
