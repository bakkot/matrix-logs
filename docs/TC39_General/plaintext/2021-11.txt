what if we added toml to the stdlib

[10:09:22.0318] <bakkot>
i feel like it does not have a good place in JS

[10:09:51.0259] <bakkot>
it's intended as a human-readable config language, which makes sense for server-side apps but not really for any other JS users

[13:40:29.0456] <bakkot>
https://github.com/kaist-plrg/jiset is neat

[13:40:50.0533] <bakkot>
(jmdyck I imagine you might be particularly interested)

[14:12:29.0026] <ljharb>
browser-side users need to configure things too

[14:39:49.0110] <jmdyck>
@bakkot: yeah, it looks like they're doing something similar to my ecmaspeak project

[14:53:34.0445] <jmdyck>
Except, when I look at their code, nothing seems familiar.

would be cool if one of these spec evaluators can replace engine262 one day

[16:42:45.0718] <devsnek>
it looks like jiset was for some sort of university study

PSA here is the incubator call doodle for pattern matching: https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/407 it wasn't clear if there were interested non-champion delegates. if you are, please sign up for a time *before Nov 9*!

okay so if we're champs no need to answer the doodle, or shoudl we do so to kick off time planning?

[19:11:44.0747] <jmdyck>
devsnek: I'm working on it, but progress is slow.

Can anyone give me an example of an observable effect of what is explained in the second pagraph of the first note of https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-weakref-execution? I initially came up with this:
```
let obj = { x: 1 };
let ref = new WeakRef(obj);
await null; // I think we need to wait to allow WeakRefs to be emptied
console.log(ref.deref(), obj.x);
```

which I though might log `undefined, 1` because it doesn't observe the _identity_ of `obj`.

However, an _hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious execution_ (as defined in "9.10.2 - Liveness") might be `obj === obj`, which observes the identity of `obj` and thus makes it "live" and non-collectable, so `ref.deref()` must return `obj`.

Maybe my question is "is an _hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious execution_ any possible execution of any possible code, or just any possible execution flow in my code?"

It's still weird that I don't have much idea what happened after the latest meeting. I understand that it takes a while to get the complete notes, but I really wish someone made an summary that has a sentence or two for each agenda item soon after a meeting.

[04:57:43.0990] <pokute>

pokute Justin Ridgewell has been doing an awesome job reporting the conclusion of each important topic at https://github.com/babel/proposals/issues/77

Oh, I didn't know about that. Thank you!

[05:05:02.0813] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Note that it should not be considered an "official source" (only the notes are official), but it's a good approximation

it's saying "if your code could be evaluated with defef() always returning null and still observe the identity of the object, the object is live"

[06:43:55.0791] <devsnek>
your example is correct afaict, assuming the engine optimized that

[06:44:56.0346] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok thanks üëç

FYI, the releasing of kept objects is a host defined operation, so it may not happen at a promise job boundary. In particular, AFAIK most engines only clear kept objects when the promise queue is drained.

Correct. Here is the PR that introduced the weak-ref oblivious execution: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-weakrefs/pull/142
I don't know how @syg came up with it, but it was very clever!

[10:46:21.0717] <devsnek>
yeah everything in the spec here is sort of "outer limits" on what engines must do. in practice they are not perfect at removing dead objects and cannot run gc immediately every time the job queue is empty, etc.

[10:49:07.0063] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Thanks everyone!

[11:00:26.0965] <shu>
yeah, the spec only says when it is allowed to empty a WeakRef, so that you can reason about WeakRefs which _must not_ be emptied according to the spec

[11:00:41.0696] <shu>
conversely, an implementation that never empties WeakRefs, or never GCs at all, is always compliant

[11:00:44.0270] <shu>
not that anyone really does that

[11:01:35.0709] <shu>
IOW you cannot write interoperable tests that test for "this WeakRef must be empty now", only "this WeakRef must not be empty now"

[11:04:01.0652] <shu>
you _can_ write tests that test implications, though, like "if this WeakRef is now empty, then these other properties must hold"

[11:04:05.0689] <shu>
test262 have tests of that shape

[11:04:13.0447] <devsnek>
shu now you need to write a turbofan pass that inlines `obj.x`

[11:04:32.0678] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> test262 have tests of that shape

They're actually broken, I have on my todo to fix them

[11:04:40.0370] <shu>
oh yeah?

[11:06:10.0402] <Mathieu Hofman>
The hooks and most tests still use `cleanupSome`.

[11:06:17.0825] <shu>
oh lol

[11:06:25.0909] <devsnek>
i miss cleanupSome 

[11:06:31.0161] <Mathieu Hofman>
I rewrote the hooks locally already, I need to fix all the tests

[11:06:43.0336] <shu>
excellent, than kyou

[11:07:33.0201] <devsnek>
is cleanupSome just waiting on the champions at this point

[11:08:40.0421] <Mathieu Hofman>
Would be neat to have a flag to the test262 execution that says "this implementation supports GC and has all host hooks implemented, so these tests must collect as expected"

[11:09:38.0068] <shu>
devsnek: more than that was my understanding; Apple already rejected the wasm use case as compelling enough to add cleanupSome, and i don't know that a more compelling argument has been presented

[11:09:39.0952] <devsnek>
are you saying people provide no-op hooks? :O
