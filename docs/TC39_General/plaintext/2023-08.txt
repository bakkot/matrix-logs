re question in Delegates room: Originally, it was "... to link, instantiate, and evaluate the module". Then PR #1312 changed occurrences of "instantiate" to "link", and didn't notice what that did to that sentence.

Thank you for your answer, but it is difficult to distinguish the difference between "to link" and "link" in the description. Should "to link" be changed to the concrete method LoadRequestedModules to represent the previous stage

kai: seems like changing it to "to load" would fit the sentence better.

Hey there! üëã 
I had an idea for a long time related to static variables inside the functions like how it's implemented in other low-level languages like C++ and I finally and I finally decided to start describing the document. Unfortunately, I have not yet figured out exactly how to describe it correctly and where I should publish it, but I found this chat in the CONTRIBUTING document of the ecma262 repo.

Here is my proposal: https://github.com/yehoryatskevych/proposal-function-static-variables
Please correct me if I'm wrong somewhere and I'm open for the discussion.
Thanks! üôè

```javascript
function func() {
    static let isFirstCall = true;
    static let counter = 0;

    if (isFirstCall) {
        isFirstCall = false;
        console.log('Static variables initialized!');
    }

    console.log("Counter:", counter);

    counter++;
}

func(); // OUT: "Static variables initialized!", "Counter: 0"
func(); // OUT: "Counter: 1"
func(); // OUT: "Counter: 2"
```

Yehor Yatskevych the most important part of any proposal is to explain what problem you're solving, compared to what you'd currently do.

[15:08:48.0762] <ljharb>
What's the problem this is solving? How would this work better than:
```
let isFirstCall = true;
let counter = 0;
function func() {
  ‚Ä¶
```
?

[15:08:48.0878] <bakkot>
Right now the thing you'd do is use a closure, and hoist the `static` variables out of the closure. How is your suggestion better than that?
