re question in Delegates room: Originally, it was "... to link, instantiate, and evaluate the module". Then PR #1312 changed occurrences of "instantiate" to "link", and didn't notice what that did to that sentence.

Thank you for your answer, but it is difficult to distinguish the difference between "to link" and "link" in the description. Should "to link" be changed to the concrete method LoadRequestedModules to represent the previous stage

kai: seems like changing it to "to load" would fit the sentence better.
