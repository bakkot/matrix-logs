Thank you for your answer, but it is difficult to distinguish the difference between "to link" and "link" in the description. Should "to link" be changed to the concrete method LoadRequestedModules to represent the previous stage

[10:11:50.0989] <jmdyck>
kai: seems like changing it to "to load" would fit the sentence better.

Hey there! üëã 
I had an idea for a long time related to static variables inside the functions like how it's implemented in other low-level languages like C++ and I finally and I finally decided to start describing the document. Unfortunately, I have not yet figured out exactly how to describe it correctly and where I should publish it, but I found this chat in the CONTRIBUTING document of the ecma262 repo.

Here is my proposal: https://github.com/yehoryatskevych/proposal-function-static-variables
Please correct me if I'm wrong somewhere and I'm open for the discussion.
Thanks! üôè

```javascript
function func() {
    static let isFirstCall = true;
    static let counter = 0;

    if (isFirstCall) {
        isFirstCall = false;
        console.log('Static variables initialized!');
    }

    console.log("Counter:", counter);

    counter++;
}

func(); // OUT: "Static variables initialized!", "Counter: 0"
func(); // OUT: "Counter: 1"
func(); // OUT: "Counter: 2"
```

Yehor Yatskevych the most important part of any proposal is to explain what problem you're solving, compared to what you'd currently do.

[15:08:48.0762] <ljharb>
What's the problem this is solving? How would this work better than:
```
let isFirstCall = true;
let counter = 0;
function func() {

```
?

[15:08:48.0878] <bakkot>
Right now the thing you'd do is use a closure, and hoist the `static` variables out of the closure. How is your suggestion better than that?

[15:13:13.0187] <bakkot>
(also the main place suggestions go is the discourse; in this case this exact thing was proposed a few years ago; you may find the discussion helpful though it's pretty brief https://es.discourse.group/t/c-style-static-variables/511 )

Better, because functions can have their own state independently from the global context and remove the problem with naming variables and name conflicts, also the function can be easily refactored and moved to another file without wasting time on finding all variables the function depends on.

[15:19:30.0883] <bakkot>
If it's just about encapsulation, you can do that pretty easily:

```
let fn = (() => {
  let isFirstCall = true;
  let counter = 0;
  return function fn() {...};
})();
```

[15:19:58.0578] <bakkot>
That would get even simpler with https://github.com/tc39/proposal-do-expressions/, if that ends up happening

of course, that's how you can do it right now, but that's dirty code and it is already problematic to use this in methods. At the moment I'm looking for solutions and I'm trying to create a concept in which JS can be used as scripting engine for the gamedev and static variables is extremely useful for "update" and other functions which should be called every frame.

I don't think it's especially dirty code? And it works fine for methods, not sure what you mean there.

[15:41:23.0095] <bakkot>
Yeah, I don't think that difference is significant enough to warrant new syntax. In practice, in almost all code, you'd just put the "static" variable immediately before the function, which has the advantage of having completely unambiguous semantics (for example: with `static`, what happens if you have multiple such declarations and one of them throws the first time you call the function?). In the rare cases where putting your variables before the function doesn't work, the IIFE pattern is not really that bad.

[15:42:26.0790] <bakkot>
That is to say, in practice, what you'd write is usually

```
let velocity = new Vec3();
function onServerFrame() {
    for (player of getPlayers()) {
        const dir = player.getAngles().toVector();
        velocity.set(0, 0, 0).addScaled(dir, 200);
        player.setVelocity(velocity);
    }
}

just an example, but at least it not allocate object every frame which save time, function can be called thousand times per second and for example logic can be moved to separate function then complexity will be `playersNum * serverFps`

game script usually contains a huge number of functions and every of this function may have their own "velocity" variable, moving it to global context is not a solution, in case you need to somehow read previous state you should create the same variable for each function in global context with different names.

Hoisting variables to the outer scope is in fact a solution. I agree that there are cases where that means you will need to spend slightly more effort naming things, or otherwise have some awkwardness, but I don't think this is bad enough to warrant new syntax.

in practice how the process works is that you identify the problem first, before proposing a solution - this proposed solution moves a feature from C into JS which brings its own problems along. for example, the cognitive load for learning it due to most JS developers not being familiar with C; even in C, the feature is named confusingly, because `static` means two different things, 3 in C++. so during the early stages of such a proposal, there'd be a search through the solution space for a more "JavaScript-y" solution

[15:59:19.0228] <ptomato>
(& I think bakkot's point is that such a "JavaScript-y" solution already exists)

[16:00:13.0891] <ptomato>

```js
GameEvents.subscribe('frame', () => {
    let {velocity} = this;

        velocity.set(0, 0, 0).addScaled(dir, 200);
        player.setVelocity(velocity);
    }
}.bind({
});
```

I think any proposal is almost always about effort and time, that's why there are many syntax stuff proposals and why programmers love new syntax updates especially updates that improve development speed and the ability to make prototypes in minutes. JS is currently one of the best language to prototype something. The problem I want to solve is somewhat deeper than what I described here and I'll think how to describe it better.

[16:03:41.0731] <bakkot>
I don't think I would say without qualification that programmers love new syntax updates.

[16:04:49.0184] <bakkot>
If we added all the syntax people have proposed which would solve a problem they had, without considering the cost of new syntax, the language would be completely unusable. So we have to think carefully about how bad the problem is, and how costly the solution would be.

[16:05:08.0542] <bakkot>
In this case I think the problem is not all that bad, and the proposed solution is very costly (mostly because of the potential for confusion).

> <@bakkot:matrix.org> If we added all the syntax people have proposed which would solve a problem they had, without considering the cost of new syntax, the language would be completely unusable. So we have to think carefully about how bad the problem is, and how costly the solution would be.

sure, you are right, let me make more investigation and try to describe the problem better and also advantages of this propose.

 * sure, you are right, let me make more investigation and try to describe the problem better and also advantages of this propose. I think functions with their own states can bring many new possibilities, not only for optimization proposals.

I mean binding context to arrow function plus operation priority

With static syntax to avoid unwanted allocations:
```javascript
function testWithoutAllocation(i) {
    static let vec = new Vector(0, 0, 0);
    vec.set(i + 1.13, i + 5.231, i + 7.1247);
}
