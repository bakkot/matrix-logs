Apparently CLDR is not stable enough for the web: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/41760. This needs some attention from Intl folks I think. littledan can you help me out finding the relevant people?

Yeah this is sort of a long known, and to some extent it even provides back pressure on cldr to not change too much (which is extremely unfortunate)

I remember there being a W3C document giving style guidelines for DOM API design saying, e.g., “Abbreviations like HTML should be capitalized in functions’ and classes’ names.” Does this sound familiar to anyone?
