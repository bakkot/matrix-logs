I just noticed thanks to https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3027 that we list abstract operations as "spec values without identity". Does the spec ever compare abstract operations, or ever use them as first-class values?

I don't think so, no

I don't see anywhere that we compare abstract operations. As for treating them as first-class values,
- https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-applystringornumericbinaryoperator step 7 has `Let _operation_ be the abstract operation associated with _opText_ and Type(_lnum_) in the following table:`
- https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-numerictorawbytes step 3.b has `Let _convOp_ be the abstract operation named in the Conversion Operation column ...`

Thank you!
