Does anyone have any background on why `Math` got so many functions like `abs` that might have gotten put in `Number`? Having trouble finding in the meeting notes; I think this might predate them.

The Math object goes back to ES1

Right, and as far as I can tell, post-ES1 mathematical functions were subsequently added to Math rather than Number simply to be consistent with that status quo. Is that correct?

For example, in the notes, I see some old talk of making clz32 an instance method on Number.prototype, and later it got switched to a “static” method, presumably to avoid boxing primitive numbers. But I can’t really find any explicit reasoning why Math was chosen as its home instead of Number.

Looks like Number.{isInteger,isSafeInterger} and Math.{sign,trunc,log10,hypot} were added in ES6

Those homes seem logical, at least to me.
