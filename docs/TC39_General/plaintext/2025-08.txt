Hello, nice to meet you. I joined here to ask how to correct a (minor) editorial mistake in ECMA-262.
I suspect that the `linked` should actually be `~linked~` in "such that _A_.[[Status]] = _B_.[[Status]] = _C_.[[Status]] = linked" at https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2905/files#diff-181371b08d71216599b0acccbaabd03c306da6de142ea6275c2135810999805aR26630.
