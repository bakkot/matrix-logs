Regarding https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-hostgrowsharedarraybuffer and equality definition of Data Blocks:

>  Two data blocks are equal only if the sets of the locations they contain are equal; otherwise, they are not equal and the intersection of the sets of locations they contain is empty.

What is the intention vis a vis empty DataBlocks? Their sets of locations are equal (no locations), and likewise the intersection of their sets of locations is empty. The first sentence quite clearly states that they should be equal to one another, while the second sentence kind of implies that maybe they should not be.

I suspect this means that two data blocks can either refer to the exact memory locations, or they must be disjoint

[08:05:15.0819] <Andreu Botella>
they shouldn't partially overlap

[08:25:42.0314] <Richard Gibson>
I agree. Note also that the immutable ArrayBuffer is already restricting that check to Shared Data Blocks: https://tc39.es/proposal-immutable-arraybuffer/

An empty Shared Data Block should not be equal to any other Shared Data Block, and given the basis for equality testing, would not even be equal to itself (which awkwardly breaks reflexivity but is not actually problematic AFAICT). I guess the text could be something like
> Two Shared Data Blocks that both contain any one location must contain exactly the same set of locations and are equal to each other. All other pairs of Shared Data Blocks must contain respectively disjoint locations and are not equal to each other. Note that an empty Shared Data Block is thus not even equal to itself.

In terms of the C++/Rust memory model, SharedArrayBuffer's UNORDERED ordering is just an ordinary read or write, right? (Assuming the platform doesn't need locks to write a value of that size in a single operation.) And not Relaxed.

[02:58:11.0684] <Andreu Botella>
my understanding is that in the C++/Rust memory model, "ordinary" reads and writes to a shared buffer, even if fine by the platform, can lead to compiler optimizations that might still mess things up

[02:58:33.0885] <Andreu Botella>
I think relaxed will do the right thing

[03:01:54.0706] <Andreu Botella>
or rather, "ordinary" reads and writes to the same memory across threads are a data race, with is UB in C++ and Rust

[03:02:02.0860] <Andreu Botella>
* or in other words, "ordinary" reads and writes to the same memory across threads are a data race, with is UB in C++ and Rust

[03:02:27.0243] <Andreu Botella>
* or in other words, "ordinary" reads and writes to the same memory across threads without any other kind of synchronization, are a data race, with is UB in C++ and Rust

[03:04:09.0689] <Andreu Botella>
relaxed is a stronger constraint than the spec requires

[03:05:17.0445] <Aapo Alasuutari>
Yeah, the spec just kindly asks devs to refrain from writing data races, so Relaxed seems to be the "right but wrong" thing.

[03:05:42.0570] <Aapo Alasuutari>
It's right by C++/Rust standards, but it's wrong by spec standards.

[03:06:33.0868] <Andreu Botella>
I'm pretty sure that the spec only defines minimum constraints, and relaxed is stronger than that minimum constraint, so it's fine

[03:06:43.0750] <Aapo Alasuutari>
But the P word!

[03:06:46.0473] <Andreu Botella>
but it's been a long time since I've looked at this
