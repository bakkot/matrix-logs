Regarding https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-hostgrowsharedarraybuffer and equality definition of Data Blocks:

>  Two data blocks are equal only if the sets of the locations they contain are equal; otherwise, they are not equal and the intersection of the sets of locations they contain is empty.

What is the intention vis a vis empty DataBlocks? Their sets of locations are equal (no locations), and likewise the intersection of their sets of locations is empty. The first sentence quite clearly states that they should be equal to one another, while the second sentence kind of implies that maybe they should not be.

I suspect this means that two data blocks can either refer to the exact memory locations, or they must be disjoint

[08:05:15.0819] <Andreu Botella>
they shouldn't partially overlap
