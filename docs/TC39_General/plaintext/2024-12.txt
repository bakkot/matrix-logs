Anyone know how to update this site? https://tc39.es/proposal-decorators/ data seems behind

[19:52:36.0275] <bakkot>
nullvoxpopuli: all of the `tc39.es/proposal-whatever` sites are served from github pages from the corresponding github repo, in this case https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators

[19:52:39.0259] <bakkot>
so you could open an issue there

[19:53:33.0814] <bakkot>
or just send a PR to the gh-pages branch which replaces it with a meta redirect to the spec PR, I guess https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2417
