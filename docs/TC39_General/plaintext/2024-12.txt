Anyone know how to update this site? https://tc39.es/proposal-decorators/ data seems behind

[19:52:36.0275] <bakkot>
nullvoxpopuli: all of the `tc39.es/proposal-whatever` sites are served from github pages from the corresponding github repo, in this case https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators

[19:52:39.0259] <bakkot>
so you could open an issue there

[19:53:33.0814] <bakkot>
or just send a PR to the gh-pages branch which replaces it with a meta redirect to the spec PR, I guess https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2417

Hi all, new guy here! 

I'm entertaining the idea of opening a proposal but wanted to get a feeling on how the community feels about the concept before I commit a weekend to writing it out - haha. 

Generally, it's the concept of the incorporation of Rust-inspired callable macros

```javascript
// Parse tokens and generate React.createElement() calls
const Foo = () => jsx!(<div>Hello World</div>)

// Create a getter/setter for a property
class Bar {
  #[observe(push)]
  baz = undefined
}
```

While I know ECMAScript is not a compiled language, there are interesting use cases like;
- Enabling support for jsx/other templating languages without an external preprocessor/eval
- Macro annotations that facilitate more ergonomic mutation observability leading to more ergonomic syntax for frameworks like Vue/Angular 
- A reduced need for custom compilers (ngc, .vue, .svelte)
- More ergonomic usage for tools like protobuf
- etc

This would also lead to support in preprocessors like TypeScript which _could_ statically compile macros - offering an interesting/novel hybrid macro system.

Any thoughts on the concept?

For the "create a getter/setter" example, that looks like it can be accomplished via a decorator https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators

Yes, I do agree that this idea shares utility with decorators however, due to the static nature of macros (accept tokens, return ecmascript), it expands the concept in various ways, like;
- Opening a path for preprocessors (like TypeScript, swc) to do AoT compilation leading to applications being faster at runtime
- Incorporating the annotatability of variable assignments as well as class properties
- Runtime (and AoT) transformation of tokens which allows parsing (and LSP support) for jsx, templating languages and even data formats like yaml, protobuf, etc

```javascript
const vueComponent = {
  template: vue!(<div>Hello {data.world}</div>),
  data: () => ({ world: 'World' })
}

const contents = yaml!(foo: 'bar')

I am curious how things like auto-complete and refactoring work within Rust macros. These both sound easier for tooling to implement when the language extension is concrete, instead of being defined as a macro.

[22:21:11.0512] <David Alsh>
For autocomplete, the LSP expands the macro and uses the output
```javascript
const foo = add!(1, 1)
```
Would expand into
```javascript
const foo = 2
```
So consumers see it as a `number` rather than a macro. It simply replaces itself with the transformed result.

As for refactoring; when someone implements a macro, they parse "tokens" which they move around into the equivalent valid language syntax. 

The editor can unwind that to determine what to update - though there are some macros that are too complex and refactoring tools bail out.

Implementers can also throw during parsing, which bubbles up to the editor, showing errors in the correct place in the macro

For auto-complete, when the macro is expanded, how is the IDE cursor position preserved?

[22:32:36.0884] <Ashley Claymore>
the position could expand to a much larger block of code 

[22:34:29.0276] <Ashley Claymore>
the expanded code would also lack type annotations, meaning TypeScript would only be able to infer what might be a correct auto complete 

[22:38:06.0853] <David Alsh>
> These both sound easier for tooling to implement when the language extension is concrete

Macros are more of a preprocessing step rather than dynamic functionality (like decorators) - but there's a chicken and egg problem. 

The best supported illustration of macros in tooling is the built-in transformation of jsx in TypeScript. There are many GitHub issues requesting to expand this to offer custom programmatic macros however it's has been deemed out of scope.

Attempts by other toolmakers to implement the functionality that macros offer have resulted in fragmented, brittle implementations (.vue files and .svelte files - custom tooling, editor plugins and poor support for test runners, linters, formatters, etc). 

Decorators also feel like an attempt at addressing the same problem albeit at runtime.

After spending some time in the Rust world, I personally feel that there is evidence that ES world shows a need for this type of functionality
