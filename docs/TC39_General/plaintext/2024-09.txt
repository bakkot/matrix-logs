In 6.1, they acknowledge the distinction between main-body and annex B regexes, but don't explicitly say which they're mechanizing (as far as I could see). I'm pretty sure it's just main-body.

Do the two modes have different _features_, or just different parsing rules?

> These grammars do not agree on all inputs:
for instance, the standard grammar rejects ], whereas the legacy grammar allows it and treats it as
a valid regex matching the character ‘]’. Given this, we left parsing out of our mechanization.
