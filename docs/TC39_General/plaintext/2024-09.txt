In 6.1, they acknowledge the distinction between main-body and annex B regexes, but don't explicitly say which they're mechanizing (as far as I could see). I'm pretty sure it's just main-body.

[13:10:29.0623] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Do the two modes have different _features_, or just different parsing rules?

[13:10:41.0004] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> These grammars do not agree on all inputs:
for instance, the standard grammar rejects ], whereas the legacy grammar allows it and treats it as
a valid regex matching the character ‘]’. Given this, we left parsing out of our mechanization.

[13:42:02.0343] <jmdyck>
It's mostly syntax, but it isn't *just* syntax, some of the pseudocode is different too, so it makes a difference (to the resulting mechanization) which you pick.

just different parsing rules AFAICT, but the interpretation of various `\c…` in various possible locations gets _really_ intricate

[13:44:02.0848] <jmdyck>
For research purposes, it makes sense for them to stick to the main-body, but I think it's at least worth saying so.

i experimented a bit with an nfa vm for engine262 for verifying optimizations, cool to see this approach as well

[15:58:32.0950] <bakkot>
I kind of want to propose a `Math.argmax(it, fn)` which is like `(it, fn) => Iterator.from(it).reduce((a, b) => f(a) > f(b) ? a : b)`, but apparently Python's (rather numpy's) `argmax` gives you the index of the maximum item rather actually taking a function.

[15:59:26.0210] <bakkot>
possible alternatives:
- the `fn` arg is optional, and it just gives you the index if omitted (which is useless if the argument isn't indexable, but whatever)
- call it `maxBy`, which is a natural enough name (and also apparently already exists in lodash, neat)

[16:00:50.0428] <bakkot>
also, I want to suggest that both this and a hypothetical `sortBy` would allow the function to return any of { number, bigint, string }, and do the natural comparison within each type, but throw if the function ever returns two different types

what's up with the requirement that if the target is not extensible, proxy ownKeys can't return a different set of keys?

[12:38:14.0611] <snek>
like if i define the other traps to behave consistently, shouldn't it be fine

[12:45:30.0000] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I guess it's because otherwise there is no way to guarantee that it behaves as not extensible 

[12:53:43.0340] <bakkot>
how could it know that the other traps behave consistently without calling them?

[12:54:03.0691] <bakkot>
or remembering their results, I suppose

[12:56:15.0036] <bakkot>
you should understand the target as serving as a _witness_, a proof-by-example that the behavior you are representing is consistent with the essential invariants. and one of the behaviors is, if something is reported to be not-extensible, then it will never get new keys. the way this is enforced is, a proxy can only report being not-extensible if its target is not-extensible, and if the target is not-extensible then it must report having the same keys as the target. if either of these properties was not enforced then you could have behavior which is not consistent with the essential invariants.
