I'm translating the Map/Set prototype methods over to WebIDL-ese (so we can define maplikes and setlikes in terms of Infra maps and sets, rather than doing weird and fraught indirections to actual ES Maps and Sets), and I noticed that while the @@iterator for them records the initial length and only iterates to that length at max (can stop earlier if things are deleted so it hits the end before that point), the `forEach` methods just visit every entry "live" and can potentially run forever if the callback keeps adding entries.

[12:37:21.0583] <TabAtkins>
Is this behavior difference intentional?

[12:43:30.0619] <bakkot>
uh

[12:43:35.0503] <bakkot>
that's probably a bug from when we refactored those

[12:43:44.0682] <bakkot>
 * that's probably a bug from when we refactored those

[12:44:01.0233] <bakkot>
oh, wait, no it's not

[12:44:04.0055] <bakkot>
you missed a step:

[12:44:21.0127] <bakkot>
CreateMapIterator step 2.d.iii.6: Set numEntries to the number of elements of entries.

[12:44:36.0312] <TabAtkins>
Right, I mentioned that.

[12:44:50.0553] <bakkot>
no, that's in the loop

[12:45:03.0292] <bakkot>
it updates numEntries within the loop

[12:45:12.0743] <bakkot>
or I am not understanding your question

[12:45:53.0217] <TabAtkins>
Oh dang you're right, I *did* miss/misunderstand that.

[12:48:01.0968] <TabAtkins>
Hm then, the two methods can both run infinitely, ok. Is there a particular reason why the two have their iteration written significantly differently, or is that intended to just be an editorial detail? (Iterator goes over the entries by index and makes no mention of "empty" values; forEach iterates the entries list directly and explicitly jumps over "empty" values. (I note that "empty" is supposed to be a spec convenience for deleted entries and not an actual author-exposed thing.))

[12:50:51.0374] <bakkot>
Iterator does handle empty values, it seems to me?
> iii. If e.[[Key]] is not empty, then

[12:51:02.0926] <bakkot>
They actually look pretty similar to me, all told

[12:51:25.0009] <TabAtkins>
Sigh, I'm blind.

[12:51:50.0207] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, so it's just the explicit index-based vs just looping over the List directly, I guess

[12:52:10.0389] <bakkot>
yeah, and that one... I think it's a path-dependence thing

[12:53:22.0659] <bakkot>
in earlier editions iterators were specified in terms of explicitly keeping all of the state on internal slots, but in https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2045 we made it possible to specify a "spec generator" which is more similar to how you'd write it in JS

[12:53:54.0921] <bakkot>
prior to that, the iterator _needed_ to be specified in terms of an index so it could store the index on an internal slot, as in https://tc39.es/ecma262/2016/#sec-%mapiteratorprototype%.next

[12:54:09.0318] <bakkot>
with the refactoring that's no longer strictly necessary but the refactoring was written as a delta from what was originally there

[12:54:35.0519] <TabAtkins>
Ahhhhh, ok, thanks for the history, that makes sense.

[13:16:34.0426] <TabAtkins>
Okay, more questions in this regard: `Array`'s `forEach`_does_ compute the length once at the beginning and then doesn't go past it <https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.foreach>, so you can't infinite-loop yourself by pushing to the array in the callback. Is the behavior difference between arr.forEach and map.forEach intentional or accidental? (And which should we copy for general web-platform purposes when we define iteration better for Infra types in https://github.com/whatwg/infra/issues/396?)

[13:18:07.0875] <bakkot>
That one is before my time, so someone else will have to give the actual answer

[13:18:36.0181] <bakkot>
but I do note that looking up the length of an array is observable, whereas looking up the length of a Map's internal list is not, so it's possible that's the reason for the difference?

[13:18:48.0985] <TabAtkins>
Hm, but Array's @@iterator *does* allow infinite-loops, so I guess that might just be a legacy detail we got stuck with

[13:18:56.0869] <bakkot>
ah, yeah, in that case probably

[13:22:22.0394] <bakkot>
that does seem to be the consensus in other languages also

[13:22:30.0038] <TabAtkins>
Excellent, thanks. Looks like we just need to add some details to Infra to make it clear how mid-iteration changes to the collection should work; we can match JS and define it in terms of an internal index that advances until it's past the (current) end.

[13:22:54.0585] <TabAtkins>
And that'll mean I get to simplify some of my text in WebIDL that's doing this by hand, which is nice.

Domenic: do you happen to remember why `new Promise(res => res(thenable))` calls `thenable.then()` on the next tick rather than synchronously, in defiance of the A+ spec? cf https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/2770#issuecomment-1121612732

[12:05:40.0239] <bakkot>
or bterlson or anyone else who was involved in the details of specifying async/await

[12:06:12.0428] <bterlson>
I don't recall sorry :(

[12:13:02.0540] <shu>
thenable delenda est :(

[12:15:12.0251] <bakkot>
happens when `thenable` is a native promise too, to be clear

[12:22:03.0547] <bakkot>
I guess this actually dates back to promises in ES6, which I always forget predate async/await

[12:41:31.0847] <bakkot>
aha, finally dug up previous discussion: https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping/issues/105

[12:59:28.0757] <Mathieu Hofman>
So basically the problem is that `new Promise(res => res(thenable))` is not a clean stack but`Promise.resolve().then(() => thenable)` is a clean stack. As I mentioned earlier, I do believe that there would be a lot less code that will break if only the second case is made synchronous, since it'd be after a return, and thus I believe unlikely that any code would be relying on a new tick

[13:01:25.0272] <bakkot>
the actual issue Justin Ridgewell was worried about arises from the first case, though

[13:01:56.0809] <Mathieu Hofman>
does it? My understanding was the adoption of a return promise

[13:02:43.0181] <Justin Ridgewell>
It falls out of the first case

[13:03:17.0877] <Justin Ridgewell>
The async functions implicit promise wrapper calls resolve with the return value

[13:03:51.0631] <Justin Ridgewell>
* The async functions implicit promise wrapper calls resolve with the return value

[13:05:33.0653] <bakkot>
when the function returns, `res(retv)` is called with the (raw, not boxed) return value of the function, and when `retv` is already a thenable, it waits a tick before invoking `retv.then`

[13:06:04.0897] <bakkot>
we could just add a fast-path to `res` when the `then` from `thenable` is the actual `Promise.prototype.then`, I suppose

[13:09:06.0552] <Mathieu Hofman>
Oh yeah right, if we had `(async () => thenable)()` technically that would call the `.then` synchronously at that point, and not on a clean stack. Ugh

[13:09:59.0447] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> we could just add a fast-path to `res` when the `then` from `thenable` is the actual `Promise.prototype.then`, I suppose

Now we're getting into realms complexities.

[13:10:12.0974] <bakkot>
we already have those with the fast-path in Promise.resolve

[13:10:19.0218] <Mathieu Hofman>
Should the spec be allowed to recognize `Promise.prototype.then` form other realms ?

[13:10:32.0517] <Justin Ridgewell>
We have a similar  fast path for await

[13:10:57.0907] <bakkot>
specifically PromiseResolve does SameValue, which fails cross-realm

[13:11:04.0244] <bakkot>
and it's fine

[14:56:57.0256] <shu>
i can imagine that might be a problem for shadowrealms which have different Promise prototypes but the same microtask queue

[14:57:01.0021] <shu>
 * i can imagine that might be a problem for shadowrealms which have different Promise prototypes but the same microtask queue

[14:57:24.0032] <shu>
i say this, i want to be very clear here, having zero concerns with having it just do `SameValue`

[15:14:52.0216] <bakkot>
you can't pass a promise across the shadowrealm boundary anyway

[15:51:04.0983] <Domenic>
The more you can simplify this mess the better

[15:51:22.0660] <Domenic>
I'm not sure if adding a fast-path is really simplifying, but I guess it's making things faster, which is also good

[15:52:00.0688] <Domenic>
But if you can just get rid of all the extra microtasks and "untrusted" code guards and stuff... that was all really misguided.

[15:53:02.0418] <Domenic>
Thenable support in general, was probably still important, but less important than I thought it would be, and we could have gotten away with something simpler I'm sure.

[16:31:10.0263] <bakkot>
Yeah, fast-path would be the "we're adding a back-compat hack to make the common case less gross" option: not an actual reduction in complexity when you understand the full machinery in detail but probably a reduction in complexity in practice because the common case ends up cleaner

[16:32:05.0281] <bakkot>
Mathieu Hofman: this is off topic for the PR thread, but how would having a built-in `IsPromise` help your use case? `IsPromise` holds for instances of Promise subclasses, but those can have custom `then` which the spec will dutifully call (as long as the subclass instances don't reset their `.constructor` to the native Promise).

[16:37:00.0414] <Mathieu Hofman>
`const isSafePromise = (p) => Promise.isPromise(p) && Reflect.getPrototypeOf(p) === Promise.prototype && !Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(p, 'then') && !Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(p, 'constructor')` (Given frozen instrinsics)

[16:39:06.0816] <Mathieu Hofman>
Or whatever Promise subclass the user chooses to trust

[16:41:24.0454] <Mathieu Hofman>
The problem is that right now the only way to guard against evil thenables is to take a tick hit on every objects values, including unaltered native promises.

[16:43:30.0227] <Mathieu Hofman>
 * `const isSafePromise = (p) => Promise.isPromise(p) && !Reflect.isExtensible(p) && Reflect.getPrototypeOf(p) === Promise.prototype && !Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(p, 'then') && !Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(p, 'constructor')` (Given frozen instrinsics)

[16:51:53.0512] <bakkot>
what do you mean by "guard against" here?

[16:55:13.0391] <Mathieu Hofman>
Making sure the untrusted value will not be able to trigger any synchronous execution when doing `val.then()` or `Promise.resolve(val)`

[16:56:59.0897] <Mathieu Hofman>
The only safe way right now is basically something like `val !== null && typeof val === 'object' ? Promise.resolve().then(() => val) : Promise.resolve(val)`


2022-05-11
[17:02:12.0150] <bakkot>
ah

[17:02:33.0721] <bakkot>
the problem specifically being that Promise.prototype.then does the SpeciesConstructor stuff, I suppose

[17:03:49.0244] <bakkot>
otherwise you could just use `Promise.prototype.then.call(val)` as your test

[17:03:52.0530] <Mathieu Hofman>
and Promise.resolve, yes

[17:05:14.0686] <Mathieu Hofman>
There is no place in the spec that does `IsPromise` without also poking at `.constructor` or `.then` on the object.

[17:06:05.0971] <bakkot>
perhaps we will manage to remove Symbol.species instead

[17:06:56.0900] <Mathieu Hofman>
I don't think it'll help. `.constructor` based species is not slated for removal from what I recall

[17:09:13.0314] <bakkot>
that's Type II in the taxonomy in the proposal, and it is proposed to be removed per https://github.com/tc39/proposal-rm-builtin-subclassing#proposed-new-old-semantics

[17:09:22.0128] <bakkot>
I don't think we'll actually manage it but I live in hope

[17:10:25.0969] <Mathieu Hofman>
I'm curious if there would be any opposition to basically have a `Promise.isPromise(x)` which basically does `IsPromise(x)`. I know it'd solve my problem

[17:11:51.0197] <bakkot>
I think there would need to be more motivation than your very narrow use case

[17:12:21.0079] <bakkot>
and I'd be hard pressed to come up with such motivation given that the actual thing one usually cares about is "is thenable"

[17:13:52.0050] <Mathieu Hofman>
The thing is that it's impossible to workaround currently, and I fail to see how exposing something that already exists as a new namespaced API has much complexity.

[17:15:17.0758] <Mathieu Hofman>
I am sure ljharb would love a clean way to brand check a promise for his libraries ;)

[17:15:32.0434] <bakkot>
People would use it instead of "is thenable" and be confused

[17:16:32.0554] <bakkot>
"is promise" is almost never the test anyone actually wants; you and ljharb have extremely unusual use cases

[17:16:58.0968] <bakkot>
but it _looks_ like a thing you might want, so people will use it in other cases, and that's bad

[17:19:13.0557] <Mathieu Hofman>
Do you have any suggestion to make it more obvious what this does, or less likely to be misused?

[17:19:14.0494] <Kris Kowal>
I’m sure there’s a way to express the brand-check that would be clear and sufficiently out of reach.

[17:21:24.0660] <Kris Kowal>
I agree that there’s potential for confusion for any particular behavior for `Promise.isPromise(thenable)`.

[17:22:35.0315] <Kris Kowal>
And I also agree we need to be able to check whether a value is a native promise without reentering any of its API.

[17:24:27.0916] <Kris Kowal>
Though, `Promise.isPromise(thenable) === false` isn’t _that_ weird of an answer. It’s not a `Promise` _yet_, even if it’s a promise with a little P.

[17:26:03.0404] <Kris Kowal>
The notion that `Promise.isPromise(X) === true` only for X that can _become_ a promise invites the possibility that `"hello"` is a promise.
