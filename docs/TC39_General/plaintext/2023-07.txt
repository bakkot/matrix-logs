```js
Symbol.dispose ??= Symbol("Symbol.dispose");
Symbol.asyncDispose ??= Symbol("Symbol.asyncDispose");
```

rather than this, I'd suggest using Symbol.for for cross-realm, and use Object.defineProperty instead of `??=`

Well known symbols are unfortunately not registered. Unfortunately a shim /app that cares about spec compliance and cross realm values matching would have to arrange using the same unique symbol value.

are there no unhandled rejection tests, in either test262 or WPT?
