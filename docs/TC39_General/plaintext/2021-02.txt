oo autocomplete doesn't go on return key XD

[07:00:22.0778] <bradleymeck>
littledan: 

[07:00:28.0031] <bradleymeck>
hah, it works

[07:00:53.0952] <littledan>
you don't even need the @ to get autocomplete to work, just tab at the end

Somehow I get "You do not have permission to post to this room" in the delegate room. Can anyone help?

[12:43:13.0339] <littledan>
smorimoto: I gave you delegate permissions there

[12:56:19.0154] <smorimoto>
littledan: Thanks

Is there a way to only `delete` at the ownProperty level?

[06:57:07.0718] <bradleymeck>
maybe my brain is frazzled in spec too much

[06:57:15.0193] <bradleymeck>
I don't think it cascades normally?
