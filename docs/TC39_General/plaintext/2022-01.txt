Symbols aren’t cross-realm

[10:58:44.0918] <ljharb>
well-known symbols are, and registry symbols are, but normal symbols aren’t

The existing statement _“Function expressions in JavaScript are not hoisted”_ in MDN is correct, right?

[11:46:23.0535] <Ashley Claymore>
correct.

```
console.log(foo) // ReferenceError
void function foo() {}
```

Functions expressions do not need to be hosted because their binding is only visible inside their body, and no code can run before that binding initialization.

I dislike @[Ashley Claymore]'s example, because swapping the two statements doesn't remove the error

[11:50:11.0612] <bakkot>
yeah it's more precise to say that 'hoisting' is not a thing which applies to expressions

[11:50:13.0512] <Ashley Claymore>
fair 🙂 I was going for a minimal way to write a function expression 

[11:51:08.0132] <Ashley Claymore>
💯 agree that showing that there is no external binding at all is the more important core

Looking at this PR, it looks like the contributor confuses the function expression with the variable declaration. It's not that function expressions are hosited like var declarations: it's just the variable which is hoisted.

[11:54:53.0328] <Ashley Claymore>
Yeah, maybe it’s not clear to them that only the RHS is considered the function expression. Maybe an ast-explorer link would help
