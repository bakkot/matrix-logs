If non match, it rethrows

i can't imagine it working any other way

“Rethrows” sometimes could act differently from “doesn’t catch” with respect to things like dev tools (with the latter being more useful). This is actually a potential advantage of a built in catch guard construct, but could also add significant implementation complexity 

[09:53:25.0478] <littledan>
(The complexity comes when you need to evaluate JS to determine whether the guard hits, but then go back and “don’t catch” as if that didn’t happen)

oh true, good point. in that case i'd expect it to mean "doesn't catch", but the desugaring would be basically rethrowing

[13:40:57.0827] <ljharb>
to runtime JS i don't think there'd be a difference, only to dev tools/engines?
