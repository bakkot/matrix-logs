If non match, it rethrows

 * If none match, it rethrows

[23:11:52.0670] <ljharb>
i can't imagine it working any other way

[09:52:27.0609] <littledan>
‚ÄúRethrows‚Äù sometimes could act differently from ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt catch‚Äù with respect to things like dev tools (with the latter being more useful). This is actually a potential advantage of a built in catch guard construct, but could also add significant implementation complexity 

[09:53:25.0478] <littledan>
(The complexity comes when you need to evaluate JS to determine whether the guard hits, but then go back and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt catch‚Äù as if that didn‚Äôt happen)

[13:40:36.0449] <ljharb>
oh true, good point. in that case i'd expect it to mean "doesn't catch", but the desugaring would be basically rethrowing

[13:40:57.0827] <ljharb>
to runtime JS i don't think there'd be a difference, only to dev tools/engines?

[13:45:19.0002] <littledan>
Right

What does `MV` stand for in https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-string-literals-static-semantics-mv? _M-escape Value_?

 * What does `MV` stand for in https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-string-literals-static-semantics-mv? _Mescape Value_?

[04:22:19.0059] <Andreu Botella>
I think mathematical value? It's computing the escape code point number

[04:38:46.0701] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ohh it makes sense, probably

[05:28:52.0731] <jmdyck>
The spec used to have phrasing like "are interpreted as having a mathematical value (MV), as described below" until PR #2451 was merged.

[05:30:41.0448] <littledan>
maybe it'd be helpful to expand this acronym in an editorial PR?

[05:30:47.0170] <littledan>
(^ good first PR?)

[05:34:36.0485] <jmdyck>
Do you mean add a sentence that gives the expansion, or change the SDO name to something longer?

[05:35:19.0489] <littledan>
change the SDO name to something longer

[05:35:46.0367] <littledan>
(more sentences of explanation are good too but I was suggesting the latter)

[05:47:40.0679] <jmdyck>
One wrinkle is that if you simply expand "MV" to "MathematicalValue", then you have 2 terms ("MathematicalValue" and "mathematical value") which denote distinct ideas, but only differ by capitalization+spacing, which is probably not good. (Which was sort of the point of #2451, but from a different angle.)

[05:48:30.0081] <jmdyck>
So if we did rename the SDO, an appropriate name might be something like NumericLiteralValue.

[05:54:10.0956] <jmdyck>
Similarly, SV -> StringLiteralValue, TV -> TemplateLiteralValue, TRV -> TemplateLiteralRawValue ? I don't know, I think I prefer the current names.

[05:55:43.0111] <jmdyck>
But I agree that some kind of clarification would be good.

Anyone have a pointer to some place where "bindings in `if()` heads" was discussed in the past?

[13:39:16.0568] <littledan>
that would've been during ES6 when `let` was being decided on... not sure where/whether that's reflected in the notes. I'd ask dherman

[13:43:09.0871] <bakkot>
there was a proposal for it later

[13:43:13.0975] <shu>
keith miller has wanted to add that in the past

[13:43:26.0287] <shu>
yes, that must be what i'm thinking of

It's been 2 weeks since the TC39 meeting; time for notes to be published?
