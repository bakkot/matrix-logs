[RegExpBuiltinExec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regexpbuiltinexec) is of the opinion that reading and writing the "lastIndex" property of a native RegExp object can trigger user-code, but is that really the case? I at least cannot figure out a case for that: The property is an unconfigurable own property of each RegExp object; it is writable, but it shouldn't be possible to turn it into an accessor property or unset its [[Value]] so as to make the property lookup go into the prototype chain.

Is there some other case that I'm missing here?
