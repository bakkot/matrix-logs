[RegExpBuiltinExec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regexpbuiltinexec) is of the opinion that reading and writing the "lastIndex" property of a native RegExp object can trigger user-code, but is that really the case? I at least cannot figure out a case for that: The property is an unconfigurable own property of each RegExp object; it is writable, but it shouldn't be possible to turn it into an accessor property or unset its [[Value]] so as to make the property lookup go into the prototype chain.

Is there some other case that I'm missing here?

The usercode warnings are pessimistic, spec text needs to opt-out. So maybe just that

Yeah, I'm wondering if this is a case where I should open an editorial PR to add the opt-outs.

(Well, that and also I'm wondering if in my engine code I need to be aware of possible GC points there.)
