littledan: I think https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9042 might be of interest to you

[10:01:09.0230] <ptomato>
is there an existing idiom in ECMA-262 spec language for removing duplicates from a List?

[10:01:48.0659] <bakkot>
don't think so

[10:01:58.0423] <bakkot>
for Sets etc we just avoid putting duplicates in the list in the first place

[10:02:53.0304] <bakkot>
the usual idiom for which is like "If `list` does not contain `item`, add `item` to `list`"

[10:03:34.0080] <bakkot>
(Set.prototype.add is written in a slightly different style for... reasons)

[10:04:29.0312] <ptomato>
thanks!

[10:05:02.0071] <shu>
if possible, doing deduplication up front is better yeah

[10:05:13.0354] <shu>
i think it's probably fine to say "remove duplicates from `list`" if you need to do it after the fact, but we'd need to add a bit in the identity section about that language using "is" for comparison

[15:49:36.0220] <ptomato>
we don't have an existing idiom for break/continue in spec language loops either, right?

[16:06:09.0930] <ljharb>
not that i know of

[16:06:18.0327] <ljharb>
usually that would be in an AO that early-returns

We have the idiom in Infra, but not in ES-ese.

[11:16:54.0650] <Michael Ficarra>
ptomato: try to avoid it if you can

```
function f(){}
let sym = Symbol();
f[Symbol.toPrimitive] = () => sym;
let o = { [sym]: 0 };
console.log(o[f]) // 0
```
... hm

[11:13:08.0679] <bakkot>
keying objects by functions

[11:13:09.0878] <bakkot>
kinda fun

[11:13:20.0443] <shu>
cursed

[11:27:20.0748] <bakkot>
```
let functorMapSymbol = Symbol('Functor.map');
let Functor = {};
Functor.map = function(rec, ...args){ return rec[functorMapSymbol](...args); };
Functor.map[Symbol.toPrimitive] = () => functorMapSymbol;

let o = {
  [Functor.map](arg) {
    console.log(arg);
  },
};

// usage:
o[Functor.map]('hi');

// alternative usage:
Functor.map(o, 'hi');
```

I actually do something similar to that all the time. Also use it to "carry" information in properties, something like { [property `my-prop` ({ enumerable: false })]: 10 }

[11:30:44.0792] <Francisco Tolmasky>
dont know how to nest backticks, but you get the idea, you can have a function that creates metadata, then creates a custom symbol on the fly, associates the metadata to the custom symbol in a weakmap, then returns the custom symbol, then on the other end you can use it to retrieve the metadata

[11:32:15.0246] <Francisco Tolmasky>
for example like `Schema({ [property 'whatever'.readonly]: 10 })` (Schema then knows how to retrieve the metadata and construct the property descriptor from it to create the property on itself

is anybody interested in maintaining the queue tool that we use (TCQ)? https://github.com/bterlson/tcq

[11:22:53.0805] <Michael Ficarra>
it's a pretty simple, self-contained Vue app

[11:23:07.0293] <shu>
is brian stepping away?

[11:23:16.0637] <Michael Ficarra>
the committee is *highly* dependent on it

[11:23:45.0053] <Michael Ficarra>
shu: Brian hasn't always been available to maintain it

[11:23:49.0334] <Michael Ficarra>
Yulia took it up for a while

[11:24:18.0048] <Michael Ficarra>
but there's a decent list of issues and feature requests that I'd love to see some progress on: https://github.com/bterlson/tcq/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc

[11:24:49.0067] <Michael Ficarra>
if someone from the community is looking for a way that they could contribute, tackling some of these would be very much appreciated

[11:27:31.0332] <Luca Casonato>
I tried contributing to it a few months back, and got stuck on a bunch of Azure dependencies

[11:28:41.0811] <Michael Ficarra>
well, having it support other cloud environments would be a great contribution then 🙂

[11:29:17.0164] <Luca Casonato>
I’ll give it another shot

[11:32:59.0744] <Michael Ficarra>
anything to make it easier to maintain or contribute to, including documentation, would be a great force multiplier

[11:33:18.0567] <Chris de Almeida>
I also tried to fiddle with it some time back -- even something that explains how to run it would be helpful

I was thinking whether “just” switching the backend to some SQLite db and plopping it onto a VPS somewhere might make it all a bit less complex

https://tc39.es/proposal-array-grouping/#sec-array.prototype.group and https://tc39.es/proposal-array-grouping/#sec-array.prototype.grouptomap seem to have been removed from the Array Grouping proposal?

yes, now they’re Object.groupBy and Map.groupBy

[20:27:08.0217] <ljharb>
also it’d stage 2 now. Hoping to go back to stage 3 next meeting.

Thanks — I’ll update the URLs in MDN

[03:38:16.0076] <littledan>

It might make sense for MDN to wait on including these docs until it’s at stage 3 and/or some browser ships it

[10:13:08.0688] <shu>
i would wait at least until stage 3
