> <@ljharb:matrix.org> Promise has the brand checks but no non-side-effect way to check it; and error sadly has no way to do the brand check, yes. Yet.

We did discuss this on matrix a [few months ago](https://matrixlogs.bakkot.com/TC39_General/2022-05-11#L9). The inability to brand check a promise without side effects (in particular triggering proxy traps) is a major pain for us, and I would very much would like to find a way to make this possible. But a lot of people expressed concerns with revealing such a power, mostly about users doing conditional work based on the result type (promise or not, aka releasing Zalgo)
