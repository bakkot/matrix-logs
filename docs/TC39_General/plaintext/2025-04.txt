I believe citgm is the nearest to what you’re looking for https://github.com/nodejs/citgm tagging ulises.gascon

I’ve not seen it run on nightlies, but it’s used to qualify v8 version bumps.

[19:50:14.0107] <ljharb>
there's a node nightly build, but it won't have an unmerged v8 in it

kriskowal: thanks

[20:09:32.0286] <shu>
yeah i'm not looking for node nightly, but rather node with v8 nightly

[20:10:03.0009] <shu>
wait, doy, what am i saying, v8 ci has one...

[00:59:37.0264] <Mathieu Hofman>
I believe https://github.com/nodejs/node-v8 is what you're looking for

[01:01:45.0838] <Mathieu Hofman>
Well I guess technically that node nightly with v8 lkgr. Not sure if there is a node current + v8 lkgr

[01:03:23.0357] <Mathieu Hofman>
Also every now and then it gets stuck when something breaks, like now, it hasn't been updated since March 5th

[01:05:56.0771] <James M Snell>
Yeah that typically lags just a bit. And I'm not sure exactly how often the lkgr is updated there. It's the closest we have. V8's own testing with node might be closer but I'm not as familiar with that

The February TC39 meeting was 6 weeks ago. Shouldn't the notes be posted by now?

[10:49:58.0162] <Chris de Almeida>
there is a PR for it, with unresolved comments

is there any motivation to pick back up this PR? <https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2193> ? It seems like it's pretty clear that a 'web reality' change is needed, especially given that it's a 0.08%-er on <https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/1764>. It looks like SpiderMonkey had some tests added that reflected the web reality, but they were reverted in test262?

yes, this would definitely be good to do, IMO

[23:08:20.0533] <Aapo Alasuutari>
I noticed a probably-known implementation inconsistency with Float64Array sorting regarding NaNs: According to spec, any call to Float64Array should canonicalise all NaNs in the TA's viewed buffer since it copies data from the buffer into a list of Values (canonicalising all NaNs here), performs sorting on that list and then writes the sorted items back into the buffer.

On FF, a sort without a comparator seems to sort NaNs according to "absolute value" (uint64) while on Chrome they are left where they were. With a comparator (returning -1 or 1 randomly), on FF they NaNs become canonicalised while on Chrome they get sorted according to the comparator's wishes without canonicalisation.

The spec seems fairly clear to me on this whole issue; canonicalisation happens on every sort call, but the lived reality is different. Should this be accepted, or is this something to file a bug to implementors about (if not already existent)? Or should this be a case where the spec is loosened to allow for implementation defined behaviour?
