I believe citgm is the nearest to what you’re looking for https://github.com/nodejs/citgm tagging ulises.gascon

I’ve not seen it run on nightlies, but it’s used to qualify v8 version bumps.

[19:50:14.0107] <ljharb>
there's a node nightly build, but it won't have an unmerged v8 in it

kriskowal: thanks

[20:09:32.0286] <shu>
yeah i'm not looking for node nightly, but rather node with v8 nightly

[20:10:03.0009] <shu>
wait, doy, what am i saying, v8 ci has one...

I believe https://github.com/nodejs/node-v8 is what you're looking for

[01:01:45.0838] <Mathieu Hofman>
Well I guess technically that node nightly with v8 lkgr. Not sure if there is a node current + v8 lkgr

[01:03:23.0357] <Mathieu Hofman>
Also every now and then it gets stuck when something breaks, like now, it hasn't been updated since March 5th

[01:05:56.0771] <James M Snell>
Yeah that typically lags just a bit. And I'm not sure exactly how often the lkgr is updated there. It's the closest we have. V8's own testing with node might be closer but I'm not as familiar with that
