<p>One thought I had was that maybe we could retitle the page <em>“Operator precedence and order of evaluation”</em> , though I’m not sure even that would be enough to cover the non-operator cases that people have opened issues about.</p>

I think we’ve discussed it a couple times here too; I remember raising it.<br>
For what it’s worth, it is my opinion that =&gt; is an operator in every way that = is an operator, and it is completely appropriate to include <code>=&gt;</code> in a “table of operators” if <code>=</code> is in there too. There’s hardly any difference of worth between them.</td></tr>

But most everybody else seems to feel otherwise.</p>
<p>Anyway, my perspective on this is that every good intro-to-this-programming-language book I’ve ever read has a section for operator precedence that only includes actual operators — and then some separate discussion about order of evaluation.</p>
<p>I don’t think the MDN JavaScript docs should be less precise or less rigorous about details like this than a well-written book would be. So that’s why I think, if we’re going to include things on that page that are not strictly operators according to the rules of the language, then we minimally should at least re-title the page — and beyond that, make it very clear which things are strictly operators and which are not.</p>

And it certainly would be consistent to exclude both = and =&gt; from being operators.<br>
I don’t know if there’s any rigorous-but-still-useful definition of “operator” that would exclude =, though. I think that you could rigorously define a JavaScript operator as a “syntactic token(s) that create an expression but which is not a literal”, where an “expression” is a “syntax phrase that evaluates into a value at runtime”. So yield is a nullary-or-prefix operator (with side effects). + is a prefix-or-binary operator. import() probably should be called a circumflex operator (I forgot if it’s in the MDN table). And = and =&gt;, I think, can reasonably be rigorously called operators, too. They’re certainly not literals or statements, heh.</td></tr>
