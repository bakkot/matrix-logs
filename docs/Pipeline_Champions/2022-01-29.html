TC39 has not only talking about the pipe operator. We focused on many other proposals in the dataflow meetings on Wednesday and Thursday meetings. </td></tr>

And some people want to prioritize the pipe operator. But we’re still talking about the other proposals on their own merits.

In the specific case of the overlap between pipe operator and bind-this/call-this, we all resolved on Thursday that the overlap between the two is not excessively bad, and nobody would block either based on the overlap. (Though I know at least one representative who wasn’t present at the time who might be skeptical of this conclusion…) The same goes for the pipe operator versus Function.pipe.

In the case of the other proposals, like Extensions and PFA syntax, we’re taking it on a case-by-case basis.</td></tr>
