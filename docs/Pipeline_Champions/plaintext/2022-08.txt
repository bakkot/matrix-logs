Hoo boy, I have to say, Kyle's "dynamic-composition-flow" examples look extraordinarily bad to me, as a reader. I assume he's deep enough in pointfree FP stuff that this makes sense to him, but every single function here would be vastly more readable if written as some plain functions that execute statements.

And dynamic-composition-pipeline is quite bad too - why does he want to pass around an *array* named "getCustomerName"? That's clearly indicating a function, and is *used* as one; keeping it as an array just makes the code less readable.

`getCustomerName` doesn't seem to be an array. isn't it a function that returns an array?
