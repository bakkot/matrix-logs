Hoo boy, I have to say, Kyle's "dynamic-composition-flow" examples look extraordinarily bad to me, as a reader. I assume he's deep enough in pointfree FP stuff that this makes sense to him, but every single function here would be vastly more readable if written as some plain functions that execute statements.
