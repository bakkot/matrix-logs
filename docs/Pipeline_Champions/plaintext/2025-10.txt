var _;

const result = (
  _ = ar,
  _ = _.map(x => ...),
  _ = _.filter(x => ...),

Oooof that looks nasty, it relies on side-effecting every Symbol.toPrimitive call. I *think* you can't even do multiple pipes one after the other; you have to `.run()` the first before the second or else they'll combine into a single big pipeline.
