ljharb: With regard to https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/310#issuecomment-2696324408, is there an actual “Tennent’s correspondence principle” of PL design that we’re trying not to break? 

The best answer I can find defining that phrase is https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/116395/what-is-the-good-explanation-of-tennents-correspondence-principle, which seems to be some descriptive advice regarding correspondence between variable definitions and producer parameters.

Right now, under https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/wiki/Bikeshedding-the-Hack-topic-token#disqualified-tokens, variable identifiers are disqualified because variable tokens “may unexpectedly shadow outer variables”. Which is true. 

(I do agree that we should do our best to avoid any variables, for what it’s worth.)

but yeah it's a deep cut that seems to lack a primary source(??) yet https://fanf.livejournal.com/118421.html gives a clear sentence of "the meaning of an expression or statement should not change when an extra level of block structure is added around it"

[22:36:04.0505] <jschoi>
It's a pretty good goal. Even if it doesn't seem to actually have been named by Tennent—at least according to Crockford. We might want to give it a better name…

[22:36:39.0687] <jschoi>
In general, the goal should be to reduce modality and contextuality of code as much as possible, which imposes cognitive burden.

It’s been a long time, and yet I’m realizing now that nobody seems to have proposed `..` as the topic reference. 

```js
x = grunt.config('uglify.all.files') |> Object.keys(..)[0];
x = pkgs[0] |> npa(..).escapedName |> await npmFetch.json(.., opts);
x = cb(predicate) |> _.negate(..) |> _.filter(obj, .., context);
Object.keys(envars)
  .map(envar => `${envar}=${envars[envar]}`)
  .join(' ')
  |> `$ ${..}`
  |> chalk.dim(.., 'node', args.join(' '))
  |> console.log(..);
context
  |> (.. && (..).nodeType ? (..).ownerDocument || .. : document)
  |> jQuery.parseHTML(match[1], .., true)
  |> jQuery.merge(..);
```

`..` as the topic doesn’t seem bad. It only really clashes with property accesses—which are already postfix, so you would rarely use pipe on them anyway. And spread syntax, I guess, but doing that on the topic would probably be even rarer. 

`..` is even more visually lightweight than `^^`, and it’s easier to type than `^^` and `%%`.
Plus, `..` usually gets its own typographic ligatures in fancy code fonts, for those who are into those.

[16:48:05.0977] <ljharb>
why would it be rare to have an iterable topic?

Yeah, I’ll acquiesce that flattening into Math.max and min does happen. Though I’d be a bit surprised if such calls exceeded 0.1%, let alone 1%, of all JS function calls. 
And just a space separating `...` and `..` should work, without parentheses, right?

I'm still of the opinion that F#-style pipes would have been better. `arr |> (x) => Math.min(0, ...x)` means no special topic is needed, PFA or no PFA.

that's a nonstarter tho based on browser feedback

personally i think `..` is way worse than `^^` or `&&`

[23:22:23.0144] <rkirsling>
I mostly like the `..` except that I think there are so many cases where parens would be needed (at least from a lint perspective) that one would almost need to consider it a four-character thing `(..)`

F# was stalled due to browser feedback about too many closures? Couldn't we define something that looks 100% like an arrow but doesn't actually introduce a function, it just binds some local variable) the "parameters" evaluates its body? Since it's an iife anyway

[01:48:23.0513] <Ashley Claymore>
Something that looks exactly like a function but isn't a function sounds not great 

[02:00:22.0290] <Ashley Claymore>
the main advantage for the reader of f# is that it probably wouldn't be arrow functions, and would instead be curried functions - so looks almost like method calls. If every f# pipe was an arrow that sounds verbose

```
getData() |> _ => Object.entries(_) |> _ => handleEntries(_) |> _ => Object.fromEntries(_);
```

vs

```
getData() |> Object.entries(^^) |> handleEntries(^^) |> Object.fromEntries(^^);
```


[02:01:34.0022] <Ashley Claymore>
if we can't find a token, then maybe the pseudo arrow is a good compromise

[02:03:53.0830] <Nic>
I mean, either an arrow-like thing to give a name, or an expression that just gets called, with a cover grammar 

[02:04:16.0793] <Nic>
If it starts with `( identifier ) =>` it's one, otherwise its the other

[02:05:11.0600] <Nic>
> <@aclaymore:matrix.org> Something that looks exactly like a function but isn't a function sounds not great 

You wouldn't really be able to observe that other than the restriction in the parameters, because you can't get a reference to it (since it's basically an iife)

[07:16:19.0006] <Richard Gibson>
there have been suggestions to embed an identifier inside the pipe syntax like e.g. `getData() ~x> Object.entries(x) ~a> handleEntries(a) ~a> Object.fromEntries(a)` (_although I think they were `|identifier>`, which wouldn't work because `getData() |x> Object.entries(x) |a> handleEntries(a) |a> Object.fromEntries(a)` already has a valid parse_)

[07:29:18.0948] <rkirsling>

(I mean l do find `|x>` amusing à la bra-ket notation...but also that's not what this is)

[07:32:15.0744] <jschoi>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> I can't say I'm thrilled with how `...x` looks for property access. 

For what it’s worth, `...x` would always tokenize as spread-x and never topic-member-x, and `a |> ...x` would always be a syntax error (no topic in pipe body). 
And you would nearly always want to do `a.x` instead of `a |> .. .x` anyway…

> <@gibson042:matrix.org> there have been suggestions to embed an identifier inside the pipe syntax like e.g. `getData() ~x> Object.entries(x) ~a> handleEntries(a) ~a> Object.fromEntries(a)` (_although I think they were `|identifier>`, which wouldn't work because `getData() |x> Object.entries(x) |a> handleEntries(a) |a> Object.fromEntries(a)` already has a valid parse_)

Speaking of `~`, I don’t think `~~` as topic has been proposed either. It’s not bad either, maybe more of a pain to type. 

[07:34:43.0447] <jschoi>
Though it may be a problem with `~~~`…

[07:35:32.0899] <nicolo-ribaudo>

```
x |> ~~
f()
```
is bad though 

[07:35:32.0951] <jschoi>
* Though it may be a problem with XOR in ~~~…

[07:47:27.0736] <rkirsling>
took me a sec to decipher what you meant but oof yeah that's a non-starter

[09:46:56.0507] <TabAtkins>
yeah i think that makes the syntax a non-starter, fwiw

[09:48:06.0435] <TabAtkins>
We've avoided unary operators for the ASI reasons Nicolo just brought up. If we're using an existing operator it has to be binary, so them being adjacent is impossible.

[10:23:59.0472] <jschoi>
The committee temperature for `..` seems quite cold, alas. I suppose it’s understandable. I’ll add `..` and `~~` to the wiki table of rejected topic tokens later with reasons. 
I also need to post an update in #232 saying basically that the champions have been busy proposing lower-hanging fruit over the past two years.

[10:29:54.0187] <jschoi>
There *was* some talk at the last plenary’s TG5 about maybe doing another pipe usability study, sparked by a suggestion from Michael Ficarra. At the time, there was some surprising new positive enthusiasm about Hack pipe from Mark Miller, too.
If a new TG5 study demonstrates usability benefits from the pipe operator, when compared to deeply nested expressions or temporary variables, then other committee members may become more amenable to pipe. The study could also evaluate the usability of the remaining candidate topic tokens.
(The TG5 meeting notes aren’t up yet. If anyone knows how best to contact Mikbar Barash, I’d like to ask him to let me look at the meeting notes before he posts them.)
