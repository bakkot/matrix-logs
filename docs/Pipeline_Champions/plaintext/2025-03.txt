ljharb: With regard to https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/310#issuecomment-2696324408, is there an actual “Tennent’s correspondence principle” of PL design that we’re trying not to break? 

The best answer I can find defining that phrase is https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/116395/what-is-the-good-explanation-of-tennents-correspondence-principle, which seems to be some descriptive advice regarding correspondence between variable definitions and producer parameters.

Right now, under https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/wiki/Bikeshedding-the-Hack-topic-token#disqualified-tokens, variable identifiers are disqualified because variable tokens “may unexpectedly shadow outer variables”. Which is true. 

(I do agree that we should do our best to avoid any variables, for what it’s worth.)

it's a TODO item in the terminology doc https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/main/terminology.md#todo-considerations

rkirsling: Nice, thanks for pointing me there. It's been a while.

[22:34:13.0517] <rkirsling>
but yeah it's a deep cut that seems to lack a primary source(??) yet https://fanf.livejournal.com/118421.html gives a clear sentence of "the meaning of an expression or statement should not change when an extra level of block structure is added around it"

[22:36:04.0505] <jschoi>
It's a pretty good goal. Even if it doesn't seem to actually have been named by Tennent—at least according to Crockford. We might want to give it a better name…

[22:36:39.0687] <jschoi>
In general, the goal should be to reduce modality and contextuality of code as much as possible, which imposes cognitive burden. 

[22:36:41.0240] <rkirsling>
honestly agree

just give it our own name and relay credit for the idea where it's due

it’s been on tc39 bingo for a long time :-p

[23:30:38.0295] <rkirsling>
yeah but not like, in a continuous way

[23:31:17.0026] <rkirsling>
it's one of those "you had to be there, otherwise for years you're just like _what's the deal with that_ anytime it comes up" phrases

[23:32:25.0700] <rkirsling>
like it always looks like a misspelling of David Tennant's name and I'm like, what's Dr. Who got to do with it

[00:03:17.0478] <jschoi>
It really does need a better name than a false eponym. Like “block-wrapped equivalence” or “in-block identity”.
