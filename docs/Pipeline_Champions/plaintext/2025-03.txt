ljharb: With regard to https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/310#issuecomment-2696324408, is there an actual ‚ÄúTennent‚Äôs correspondence principle‚Äù of PL design that we‚Äôre trying not to break? 

The best answer I can find defining that phrase is https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/116395/what-is-the-good-explanation-of-tennents-correspondence-principle, which seems to be some descriptive advice regarding correspondence between variable definitions and producer parameters.

Right now, under https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/wiki/Bikeshedding-the-Hack-topic-token#disqualified-tokens, variable identifiers are disqualified because variable tokens ‚Äúmay unexpectedly shadow outer variables‚Äù. Which is true. 

(I do agree that we should do our best to avoid any variables, for what it‚Äôs worth.)

it's a TODO item in the terminology doc https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/main/terminology.md#todo-considerations

rkirsling: Nice, thanks for pointing me there. It's been a while.

[22:34:13.0517] <rkirsling>
but yeah it's a deep cut that seems to lack a primary source(??) yet https://fanf.livejournal.com/118421.html gives a clear sentence of "the meaning of an expression or statement should not change when an extra level of block structure is added around it"

[22:36:04.0505] <jschoi>
It's a pretty good goal. Even if it doesn't seem to actually have been named by Tennent‚Äîat least according to Crockford. We might want to give it a better name‚Ä¶

In general, the goal should be to reduce modality and contextuality of code as much as possible, which imposes cognitive burden.

honestly agree

* It's a manifestation of the general goal to reduce modality and contextuality of code as much as possible, which imposes cognitive burden.

just give it our own name and relay credit for the idea where it's due
