ljharb: With regard to https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/310#issuecomment-2696324408, is there an actual “Tennent’s correspondence principle” of PL design that we’re trying not to break? 

The best answer I can find defining that phrase is https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/116395/what-is-the-good-explanation-of-tennents-correspondence-principle, which seems to be some descriptive advice regarding correspondence between variable definitions and producer parameters.

Right now, under https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/wiki/Bikeshedding-the-Hack-topic-token#disqualified-tokens, variable identifiers are disqualified because variable tokens “may unexpectedly shadow outer variables”. Which is true. 

(I do agree that we should do our best to avoid any variables, for what it’s worth.)

it's a TODO item in the terminology doc https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/main/terminology.md#todo-considerations

rkirsling: Nice, thanks for pointing me there. It's been a while.

but yeah it's a deep cut that seems to lack a primary source(??) yet https://fanf.livejournal.com/118421.html gives a clear sentence of "the meaning of an expression or statement should not change when an extra level of block structure is added around it"
