hi everyone! new here, sorry if my question has been discussed. I did try and failed to find where it's been covered.
Basically, if you remember the "real world chalk example":
```js
  // async is omitted for brevity, see below
  const pipeline = (initial, ...lambdas) =>
      lambdas.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), initial)
  
  pipeline(
    Object.keys(envars)
      .map(envar => `${envar}=${envars[envar]}`)
      .join(' '),
    $ => `$ ${$}`,
    $ => chalk.dim($, 'node', args.join(' ')),
    $ => console.log($),  
  )
```

This works in today's chrome.

`$ => console.log($ * $)` if you liked jQuery, `_ => console.log(_ * _)` if it gives you goosebumps.

The proposal includes comparison with different existing solutions (method chaining, deep nesting, temp vars), but not this one. I think it should mention it to help committee (and random bystanders like me) understand the rationale

Hi Ashley Claymore, no I haven't seen that one. thanks for extra context. Most interesting bit I learned from that story is "TC39 standardized binary ** even when Math.pow existed"
