jschoi: Oh man, this diagram is great.

Hmm, I wonder if Extensions has a way to handle the syntax ambiguity of its trinary form - is `x?y::z:f()` equal to `x ? (y::z:f())` or `x ? (y::z) : f()`? Does it depend on whether there's a trailing `: elseVal` afterwards?

According to Hax’s slides, the trinary form is type-polymorphic depending on whether the middle operand evaluates into a constructor or not.

I'm talking at a higher level of parsing, before evaluation occurs.

[10:04:43.0781] <jschoi>
Oh wait I see. 

[10:04:50.0854] <jschoi>
Yeah, I see.

The ?: trinary really poisons single-colon usage.
