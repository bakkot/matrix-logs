At the next plenary, I am planning to present the results of the dataflow ad-hoc meeting (as well as the results of the recent function-helpers incubator meeting), with an eye towards future advancement of the pipe operator and a bind/call-this operator. Hopefully that sounds good to everyone. 

[09:54:17.0603] <jschoi>
I also plan to ask for time to bikeshed both the topic reference and the syntax of bind/call-this.

I’ll try to have slides for these by March 18.

Yes, that matches what I was expecting. So just to be clear - we're asking the committee to help decide the topic reference this meeting, but *not* asking for Stage 2 yet, right? That'll be next meeting, assuming the bikeshedding concludes satisfactorily?

Yeah, just updates, no advancement.

There are cross-cutting concerns between the pipe operator and bind/call-this for Jordan, so I want to try to have them not stay too far apart in process.

Also, Tab, did you mean Stage 3 for pipe in the following plenary?

[10:53:02.0908] <TabAtkins>
yes

[10:53:07.0893] <TabAtkins>
the next stage

[10:53:14.0624] <TabAtkins>

(Please update https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/main/2022/03.md#schedule-constraints if you have schedule constraints and don’t want to miss the topic-reference bikeshedding, the bind-this syntax bikeshedding, or the holistic dataflow redux. ljharb, you have some constraints, so you might want to do so.)
