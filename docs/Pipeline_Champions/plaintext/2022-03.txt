At the next plenary, I am planning to present the results of the dataflow ad-hoc meeting (as well as the results of the recent function-helpers incubator meeting), with an eye towards future advancement of the pipe operator and a bind/call-this operator. Hopefully that sounds good to everyone.

I also plan to ask for time to bikeshed both the topic reference and the syntax of bind/call-this.

Iâ€™ll try to have slides for these by March 18.
