At the next plenary, I am planning to present the results of the dataflow ad-hoc meeting (as well as the results of the recent function-helpers incubator meeting), with an eye towards future advancement of the pipe operator and a bind/call-this operator. Hopefully that sounds good to everyone. 

[09:54:17.0603] <jschoi>
I also plan to ask for time to bikeshed both the topic reference and the syntax of bind/call-this. 

[09:55:00.0726] <jschoi>
I’ll try to have slides for these by March 18. 

[10:25:11.0635] <TabAtkins>
Yes, that matches what I was expecting. So just to be clear - we're asking the committee to help decide the topic reference this meeting, but *not* asking for Stage 2 yet, right? That'll be next meeting, assuming the bikeshedding concludes satisfactorily?

Yeah, just updates, no advancement. 

[10:52:42.0113] <jschoi>
There are cross-cutting concerns between the pipe operator and bind/call-this for Jordan, so I want to try to have them not stay too far apart in process. 

[10:52:57.0047] <jschoi>
Also, Tab, did you mean Stage 3 for pipe in the following plenary?

[10:53:02.0908] <TabAtkins>
yes

[10:53:07.0893] <TabAtkins>
the next stage

[10:53:14.0624] <TabAtkins>
whichever

(Please update https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/main/2022/03.md#schedule-constraints if you have schedule constraints and don’t want to miss the topic-reference bikeshedding, the bind-this syntax bikeshedding, or the holistic dataflow redux. ljharb, you have some constraints, so you might want to do so.)

[19:49:26.0108] <ljharb>
thanks, will do

[19:49:44.0712] <ljharb>
I’ll land your PR shortly also

Just also made a community update: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/232#issuecomment-1071995811

I’ve come around to `#` as the topic reference again, even if tuple literals go with `#[]`.

Requiring separation between topic and property access isn’t too bad: `x |> (#)[0]`…since dynamically accessing the property of a topic is going to be strictly less common than using the topic reference itself. And it’s not really a “special case”…or at least it’s as much as a special case as requiring separation between `(^^)^y` or `(%%)%y`.

Our candidates right now are `#`, `^^`, `%%`, `@@`, and `##`.

in that case you'd do `(#)[x]` but `#.x` and `#?.[x]`?

[10:30:58.0834] <jschoi>
Yes.

[10:31:18.0549] <ljharb>
so it's only non-optional bracketed access that would need parens

[10:31:19.0832] <jschoi>
Leaving the `#[` token to be reserved for tuple literals.

[10:31:21.0251] <jschoi>
Yes.

[10:31:34.0422] <ljharb>
while in practice that's probably fine, that is an odd inconsistency

[10:32:32.0225] <ljharb>
i assume in Records, `#\n{` wouldn't be allowed

[10:32:46.0728] <jschoi>
Yes, I believe they are making `#[` and `#{` their own lexical tokens.
