There are vague future plans for object-literal decorators like `@(d) { x: 0 }`. So:
```js
x |> @(d)
{ x: 0 }
```
…also needs to be future proofed with an early error. We presumably should do the same with array literals. (And tuple/record literals when they come.)

Blocks are fine.
```js
x |> @(d)
{ 0 }
```
…only has one reasonable interpretation (as `x |> @(d); { 0 }`).

I don’t think there’s anything else on the expression level that might get decorated…Maybe identifiers? Right now there are only plans for parameter identifiers so maybe we also ban this too:

```js
x |> @(d)
y
```

So the plan is to use a cover grammar ShortCircuitExpression `|>` CoverPipeBodyOrDecoratedExpression. PipeBody is the usual. DecoratedExpression is something like DecoratorList Expression. It’s an early error if DecoratedExpression covers CoverPipeBodyOrDecoratedExpression.

I have heard about obejct property decorators, but never about decorators for the whole object. It can just be a function call?

Since (if?) we’re going with `@` as the topic reference, I think it’s reasonable to try to future proof against any potential future conflict with future decorator extensions.

I don’t think we have to be careful about future non-identifier infix operators. It’s future infix operators that have to be careful of pipe (or specifically of the `@` topic). And those future proposals will be able to use some simple lookahead rules when they get proposed (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/91#issuecomment-1085006912), and it should be fine.

I wish we could just ban ASI after pipes

[08:08:34.0200] <nicolo-ribaudo>

[08:09:09.0392] <jschoi>
I’ll think about if we can do that instead.

[08:10:04.0608] <jschoi>
But the problem isn’t that ASI is happening. It’s that developers might expect ASI to happen when it wouldn’t.


[08:10:59.0271] <jschoi>
```js

Here, ASI would *not* happen. It would be equivalent to:

[08:12:11.0478] <jschoi>

  ShortCircuitExpression `|>` [lookahead ∉ {`class`}] DecoratorList Expression
```
It is a Syntax Error if PipeBody covers DecoratorList `class` BindingIdentifier? ClassTail.

[08:17:20.0003] <jschoi>
> <@pokute:matrix.org> That's always a pipe token, never decorator (missing parens I think)

It is currently two statements because PipeBody will only parse up to a valid expression, and `@d { a: 0 }` is not a valid expression…until, in the future, they add object-literal decorators. Then `@d { a: 0 }` suddenly becomes a valid expression.

Aren't decorators illegal in pipe body unless inside parens?

[08:19:17.0339] <pokute>
Or did I just mess up everything in my mind? :-)

[08:20:23.0015] <jschoi>
> <@pokute:matrix.org> Aren't decorators illegal in pipe body unless inside parens?

Right now, the plan is:
```js
x |> @(foo) class { x = @ }
```
…is illegal.
```js
x |> (@(foo) class { x = @ })
```
…is legal.
```js
x |> (() => @(foo) class { x = @ })
```
…is legal.
```js
x |> do { @(foo) class { x = @ }; }
```
…is legal.


[08:20:57.0680] <jschoi>
The plan is that, if PipeBody covers a decorated class, then it is an early error.

[08:21:43.0594] <jschoi>
But we also need to cover for future cases that are not yet covered by PipeBody because they are not yet valid expressions (like `@(foo) function () {}` or `@(foo) { a: 0 }`).

[08:21:59.0925] <jschoi>
* > <@pokute:matrix.org> Aren't decorators illegal in pipe body unless inside parens?

That would also be valid.

Parens aren't really needed since you shouldn't ever use expressions as infix operators (IMO)

> <@pokute:matrix.org> Could we expect that infix operators to always be in `x infixOp y` form and never in `x (infixOp) y`?

Even if we added an `infixOp` (where `infixOp` is already a valid identifier), then we could just ban `@ infixOp operand`.

[08:27:46.0231] <jschoi>
Or, rather, we would make `@ infixOp operand` always mean a decorated operand, not “topic `infixOp` operand”.

Maybe `Date |> dateDecorator(@)` is

[08:42:58.0475] <jschoi>
Because `@dateDecorator(Date)` is not an expression; it is a decorator.

Definitely want functions to work in the future. We spent multiple plenary meetings discussing the possibility of decorating many other things as well. I'd rather not have pipeline derail decorators, and I'm more and more concerned that using `@` is a very future hostile hazard considering the very valid use cases for decorated functions, structs, and enums (assuming the latter two also end up with expression forms), plus any other future syntax. 

[09:57:37.0961] <rbuckton (OOF thru Apr. 1st)>

[10:01:03.0294] <pokute>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> `@dec` and `@dec()` aren't synonymous. The 1st is a decorator, the 2nd is a decorator factory

The latter example, `decoratorfun(<thing>)` was missing `@` deliberately. Admittedly I'm not sure if it would work the same during runtime for all those examples (object literals, functions) and whether engine implementors want to be sure that nothing can touch the intermediary form.

[10:01:05.0672] <jschoi>

For every imaginable hazard, we can list them and see if they can be mitigated. If they're all mitigated, then they wouldn't be hazards any more.

For this reason, I think the proponents of `@` as a topic should try their best to discover those hazards, as with any proposal. For this, checking out every possible proposal / idea for conflicts that result in hazards is important. I don't think unpublished ideas/proposals nor unimaginable hazards should influence the decision - no proposal would advance with that kind of burden.
