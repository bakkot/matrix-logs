Yeah, TabAtkins, thanks for continuing to engage with him and others—I’ve been really busy myself, so I haven’t been able to work much on outreach or updates myself. 😔

[13:25:11.0750] <TabAtkins>
And now I'm back to just closing issue threads because the participants refuse to stay on topic and instead keep relitigating the core question. :/

[13:26:02.0737] <TabAtkins>
Should have done that one weeks ago, but I know Kevin personally and wanted to keep things friendly, but good *lord* I do not have time nor interest to engage in dueling essays where every point was brought up and addressed last year.

[13:29:00.0837] <TabAtkins>
(if he has made novel points I missed them in the screenfuls of text that each post of his produces)

[13:29:32.0997] <jschoi>
Insofar that we have already addressed many points of argument that people keep perseverating over, we should add an FAQ section or an FAQ document that summarizes positions, so we could simply point to them every time something gets brought up again. I’ve meant to do this for a year now, but I just haven’t had time. My apologies about this—maybe if I had done so earlier, we would have had you deal with a few less circular threads. 

[13:29:45.0390] <TabAtkins>
I doubt it. ^_^

[14:20:27.0031] <rkirsling>
this has truly been a depressing proposal, sociologically speaking

[14:22:39.0842] <TabAtkins>
huh, for some reason I can't hide Kevin's latest response in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/238#issuecomment-1178231937 (but could hide his earlier ones)

[15:09:32.0938] <ljharb>
TabAtkins: sometimes i see no "hide" link present, especially when the anchor link points to that specific comment - i usually click the timestamp of another comment and hard-refresh

[15:11:32.0129] <TabAtkins>
Ah, that was indeed the problem. How confusing. Thanks!

Have we ever tried to quantify how much of the ecosystem prefers Hack-style vs. F#-style? It's unfortunate that much of the early negative response was so vitrolic, but I still wonder if Hack-style was the right direction. This proposal constantly feels like it's being pushed uphill.

For what it’s worth, I view reconciliation with call-this syntax to be a much greater obstacle to pipe operator compared to its syntax particulars like Hack/F#—or the choice of the topic, for that matter. (That is, Jordan’s prior condition to pipe’s advancement to Stage 2 that a this-binding-or-calling syntax also “eventually” advance, and the fact that we have some strong opposition to any such this-binding/calling syntax.) This is one of the two topics that the pipe incubator was chartered to discuss, and we might have some time this plenary to discuss it. But if pipe fails to ever reach Stage 4, it’s going to be because of that critical issue.

Strongly imposed to Elixir style implicit parameter injection, it just adds more confusion over JS's existing implicit `this`. 

[15:58:26.0183] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
At least both Hack-style and F#-style are explicit. Hack-style with a topic, F#-style with `x |> F` meaning `F(x)` (plus PFA explicit placeholders). 

[16:00:08.0272] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
And I still feel if you're using `|>` to do simple expressions like `a + b`, you're holding it wrong. Its the wrong tool for the job.

Yeah, I agree about Elixir style. Anyways, all of these things are different ways to deal with the dichotomy between unary functional languages and n-ary functional languages. Something like a unary–n-ary functional impedance mismatch, to varying degrees.

i suspect pipeline is the right tool for the job any time you have something complex to pass into a function, or a function call's return value to pass into a function.

That's exactly my point. Piping through functions is the right use. The contrived `x |> % + 1` examples are the ones I think are a poor use.

[16:05:07.0864] <ljharb>
sure. but i don't think those are at all the only ones that support hack

[16:05:45.0586] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
I'd much rather have `do {}` or a `let..in` syntax for those cases.

[16:06:03.0177] <ljharb>
personally i have a bunch of examples that would work equally well in either style, and a bunch of examples where hack avoids creating a bunch of extra arrow functions, and close to zero examples (but nonzero) where F# is simpler

[16:10:46.0703] <jschoi>
I think `complexExpr |> % + 1` is contrived insofar that you could always replace it with `complexExpr + 1`. It’s because `+` is a fairly loose operator. In contrast, `complexExpr |> % ** 2` may not be so contrived, since otherwise it probably would have to be `(complexExpr) ** 2` with parentheses—and now imagine tacking on more and more (syntactically tight) operations…

[16:17:18.0363] <jschoi>
Function calls are a very syntactically tight operation, involving circumflex operators. It is for that reason that it is quite inconvenient to write and to read deeply nested function calls. But this is also generalizable to deeply nested “syntactically tight operations”, of which function calls are a subset. + expressions don’t fit as well in that set, but there are other ones that do.
(And there’s also prefix operations like await and -—even though they are syntactically loose, they also mess with writing and reading when applied to deeply nested expressions due to reading order switching between LTR and RTL.)
*Both* F# pipes and Hack pipes try to solve *all* these problems, in their own ways (e.g., `veryDeeplyNestedExpression |> negate` vs. `veryDeeplyNestedExpression |> -%`.

Every time someone says "non-function use-cases are contrived" I look back at all the times I've gone "fuck, I wish I had pipeline right now, this is kinda annoying to write" and how they're a pretty substantial mix of functions and operators and just go.... really?

[19:39:14.0940] <TabAtkins>
I fundamentally do not understand how this assertion can be made when I know for a fact how many times I, personally, want non-functions.

Yes, this is my experience precisely. I often want to pipe into functions (sometimes unary, sometimes not; PFA would address the latter cases), but I also often want to linearize other things (mostly math stuff, calling methods on something complex, and of course `await` every. single. fucking. time). 

[10:04:45.0583] <Richard Gibson>
I frequently want to construct e.g. a Map or Set, which currently requires `new` (as in `… |> (entries => new Map(entries))` if tacit/point-free or `… |> (new Map(^))` if not)

[10:24:07.0653] <jschoi>
Did we ever consider `*` as a topic token? `f() |> g({ x: * })`. I don’t remember why `*` was disqualified, if it was at all.

(Otherwise, the top runner is `^^`, given `@`’s recent problems found by WH.)

[10:24:30.0254] <jschoi>
Is it because of yield *? (This is such a rare case that we could require it to be `yield (*)`.)

[10:51:22.0305] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
There was an interesting discussion in the last TC39/JavaScript Tools meeting about how pipeline was more statically analyzable by bundlers as a means of inlining and optimizing. I do wonder about the statements from implementers that F#-style couldn't be optimized. I definitely believe that F#+PFA could have been optimized to reduce actual function allocations. i.e., `x |> f~(?)` would have had no more overhead than `x |> f(%)`. 


2022-07-11
[18:44:54.0303] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
Could we, perhaps, appease the functional programming folks by using `|>` for Hack pipes, `||>` for F# pipes, and `|||>` for function composition? i.e., 
- `x |> expr` - First-order pipelining, i.e. evaluating expressions (i.e., "evaluate pipeline" or "expression pipeline"). Has a topic.
- `x ||> F` - Second-order pipelining, i.e. calling unary functions (i.e., "call pipeline" or "function pipeline"). Does not have a topic.
- `F |||> G` - Third-order pipelining, i.e. composition of unary functions (i.e., "compose pipeline"). Does not have a topic.

This makes some sense as far as first-order vs. higher-order pipeline:

```
// first-order
x |> F(%) |> G(%) 

// second-order
x ||> F ||> G

// third-order
// NOTE: this is backwards from f . g === g(f(x)), but perhaps we 
//       could introduce a "back pipe" `<|||` as a true point/compose operator
x ||> (F |||> G)
x |> (F |||> G)(%)
```

[18:46:25.0044] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
That would not only cover the FP crowd but also the data science crowd.

[18:48:34.0886] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
And if we wanted true point/compose, we could pair it with "back pipes" like in F#:
```
G(%) <| F(%) <| x // trickier to parse though
G <|| F <|| x
(G <||| F) <|| x
```

[18:50:06.0930] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
The back-pipe variant has similarities to decorator application as well:
```
class C {
  @F
  @G
  method() {}
}
 
F <||
G <||
function () {}
```

[19:04:03.0598] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
Then there's something for everyone, and while there might be some that ask "But can't we use `|>` for the F# case?" we could say that `|>` means "first-order", `||>` means "second-order" and `|||>` means "third-order" as a heuristic roughly based in first-order vs. higher-order logic.

[19:13:37.0483] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
For example, suppose we had my [functional operators](https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-functional-operators) and PFA proposals:

```
a * b + c
a {*} b {+} c 
plus(times(a, b), c)

// first-order
a |> % * b |> % + c
a |> % {*} b |> % {+} c
a |> times(a, b) |> plus(%, c)
 
// second-order
a ||> {*} b ||> {+} c
a ||> times~(?, b) ||> plus~(?, c)
 
// third-order
a ||> ({*} b |||> {+} c)
a ||> (times~(?, b) |||> plus~(?, c))
```

Binary operators are all problematic, and common ones like `*` are bad separately bc it's not unlikely that authors will multiply the topic by something.

[19:44:12.0145] <TabAtkins>
But yeah, `*` vs `**` and `yield*` all make `*` even worse, specifically.

[19:50:45.0138] <TabAtkins>
rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16): Putting aside that I'm very confident a second pipe won't make it thru committee (the majority of the benefit of pipeline is already granted by the first one), I've no problem with pursuing tacit pipes in the future, so long as they don't block *this* proposal (either by trying to claim syntax, or by getting bundled into this proposal as a package).

[19:56:04.0541] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
It might have more credence if its promoted as a compromise for FP/Data Science, and that it may have less impact on performance if a first-order `|>` already exists, i.e.: The folks that need it will use it, as they would have been using unary functions anyways (so perf impact would be equivalent), but general use cases could lean on `|>` instead. Linters could, in theory, point users to using `|>` over `||>` (or `|||>`) when their usage would benefit from simplification.

[19:57:11.0709] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
And it would help to include, rather than alienate, existing FP libraries in the ecosystem.

while any empirical data would obviously confirm that `*` is more widely used than `^`, I will never not hate that `^^` is in the running just because we consider `^` uncommon in practice

[20:05:50.0065] <rkirsling>
I've said that here before but I guess I should say it more publicly/formally

[20:18:01.0120] <TabAtkins>
Like I said, I've no problem with it *so long as it doesn't do anything to block this one*; promoting it as a compromise solution implies that it's a package with the current pipeline and will only hurt our chances of getting either thru.

Yeah, agreed, but I think that requiring separation between the topic and binary `*`/`**` might not be a big cost. 

I suspect maybe >90% of uses of pipe will be with function calls or object/array literals `f() |> g([*], 0), and it may be worth optimizing for those cases, rather than for `f() |> * ** 2`. And even `f() |> * ** 2` isn’t that unreadable. 
It’s worth at least considering, since it probably is basically the only single-character token left.

(I’ve added a breakout session for topic tokens to the plenary although we might not have time.)

The key is whether an example is going to be common enough to be a concern. 
Frequency × impact per occurrence = expected impact.

[06:56:58.0348] <jschoi>
It’s true that the frequency of binary `*` and `**` > the frequency of prefix `~`…

[06:57:47.0789] <jschoi>
…Will the frequency of calling-a-topic-as-a-function be comparable to the frequency of binary `*` and `**`? It is tough to say.

[07:47:18.0353] <TabAtkins>
Right, my big concern is that multiplication is pretty common (and I've wanted to use pipe in precisely a spot where I'd multiply the topic). Xoring the topic, or calling as a function, are both way less common, yeah. (And outside of lambda calculus, calling the topic as a function *and* using the topic as an argument would be incredibly rare, so avoiding the early error will be super uncommon.)

[07:47:50.0291] <TabAtkins>
I also don't feel good about the `yield*` case

[07:48:51.0429] <jschoi>
Sounds reasonable! I think I agree. I will add these opinions to the wiki table when I can.

[07:50:52.0447] <jschoi>
 * Sounds reasonable! I think I agree that topic `~` is probably better than topic `*`. I will add these opinions to the wiki table when I can.

[07:52:01.0016] <jschoi>
 * Sounds reasonable! I think I agree that topic `~` is probably better than topic `*`. (And it should still work with PFA syntax: `f() |> g~(~, 0)`.) I will add these opinions to the wiki table when I can.

[07:55:40.0163] <TabAtkins>

[14:17:06.0511] <rkirsling>
yeah, I think I'd feel less bad about `~`

[14:17:54.0454] <rkirsling>
to be clear, I'm not blocking wrt `^^`, it just makes me slightly sad (...which is ironic when viewed as kaomoji lol)

[14:24:50.0809] <rkirsling>
I say "slightly" because re-noticing in the wiki table that empirical rarity is _not_ the only justification for `^^` makes me feel less awful 

[14:30:11.0561] <jschoi>
I’m not sure why I thought `*` would be any different from `% ` and `^`, which Shu and others are against because they would require InputElementDiv/InputElementRegExp–style contextuality in the lexer. `*` is not different from `%` and `^`; it suffers from the same problem, and so `*` is out.
I don’t think `~` suffers from the same problem? I left a comment with some examples but I’m not 100% sure.

Isn't `~~(n) ` still valid JS? I don't think doubling is a solution. 

[09:04:52.0641] <jschoi>
You’re right; no doubled prefixes allowed.

[09:54:24.0847] <TabAtkins>
Yeah double binaries is good, double unaries isn't.

[10:41:18.0623] <rkirsling>
`#~` though? ;)

[11:26:29.0970] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
Not even sure double binaries is good. What if we'd had pipeline before `**`, would we have excluded `**` from the list of potential topics? What are the chances we might want to leverage a double binary for some other related math operation in the future?

I was tempted to suggest `@it` and banning `it` in a decorator (though you could still potentially do `@(it)`), except I'm fairly certain decorator test frameworks (or decorator support in existing frameworks) will pop up when decorators is finalized.

 * presumably 'banning' unary `~` in a pipe body is a very unpopular opinion. (I'm a ^^ fan, but just curious)

[12:16:25.0516] <rkirsling>
what's interesting about unaries though is that they don't warrant a separate pipe

[12:16:51.0084] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
Yes. TS compiler wants to use pipes and we internally use bitmasks, so we would be strongly against banning `~` or `^` inside a pipe

[12:17:20.0837] <rkirsling>
i.e. you can do `~~x |> foo(#)` or `y |> ~~bar(#)`, there's no need for `|> ~~#`

Inside the TS compiler, our `binarySearch` function returns the twos-complement of the greatest lower bound when a match isn't found, so `result >= 0` equals an exact match, and `~result` indicates an potential insert location. I could potentially see a case where someone could leverage `~` in a pipe such that:
```js
binarySearch(array, value) |> ~ >= 0 ? array[~] : array[~~]; // greatest lower bound
binarySearch(array, value) |> ~ >= 0 ? array[~] : array[~~ + 1]; // least upper bound
```
As you can see, this wouldn't work with `~` or `~~` (or any arbitrary length of `~`).


[12:29:12.0832] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
I much prefer the readability of an identifier here:
```js
binarySearch(array, value) |> it >= 0 ? array[it] : array[~it]; // greatest lower bound
binarySearch(array, value) |> it >= 0 ? array[it] : array[~it + 1]; // least upper bound
```

[12:32:39.0928] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
Though we're much more likely to see the topic used with `~` in less ambiguous cases such as in the call to `setEmitFlags` below:
```js
return factory.createBinaryExpression(...)
  |> setOriginalNode(~, node)
  |> setSourceMapRange(~, { pos: ..., end: ... })
  |> setEmitFlags(~, getEmitFlags(node) & ~EmitFlags.NoComments);
```

[12:40:19.0606] <jschoi>
For what it’s worth, I am slowly coming around to using an identifier.
But I think that it really ought to be considered a contextual keyword like `await` and `yield`.
The keyword would be something that, from now on, we would discourage developers from using as an ordinary variable, just like how developers should not use `await` and `yield` as ordinary variables.

[12:42:02.0015] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
If that's the case, I'd go for something like `$_` or `$$`. I've seen `__` used too often for unused parameters, i.e. `f((_, __, x) => { ... })`

[12:42:03.0802] <jschoi>

Right, that makes sense.

[12:43:23.0725] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
I generally prefer `$_` over `$$` despite it being a bit tricker to type, since `_` often indicates a placeholder in multiple languages, and there's precedent in many shell scripts and some languages for `$_`.

[12:45:47.0348] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
Plus editors can easily offer a completion for `$_` on the right of a `|>`, so its more likely someone just does `$<tab>`

[12:51:01.0995] <rkirsling>
yeah I've expressed before that something with `_` would feel the most "obvious" to me

[12:51:04.0695] <jschoi>
I mildly prefer `$$` to `$_` because: `$_` is already being used in some contexts like browser inspectors (although admittedly this is a niche case; there might be other extant uses), `$$` is indeed easier to type, and `$_` is uglier to me than `$$`. As you know, `$_` is valid syntax for variables in Bash/Perl/Ruby but `$$` is not. But this is a mild preference.

[12:51:11.0009] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
If the completion case is strong enough, a longer keyword like `topic` is potentially just as viable since an editor could rank it higher in a completion list.

`$_` in dev tools is a power-user corner case that isn't used in any actual code and is fairly fragile anyways. I'm not as concerned about running into issues there.

The most important thing for me is if `$_` really is not being already used by libraries and such. The same would be with `$$`; common usage of `$$` would make it much less attractive to me.

Yeah, that seems to be the case. There are only three exact matches for `$_` and they are either `var $_ = ` or `window.$_ = `, and the `window.$_ = ` case reports a deprecation warning.

`yield` though ran into a case where Mozilla shipped generators unflagged prior to ES2015 without a `*` marker on the function, so that may have curtailed use somewhat.

I wonder why they use `$_`, hmm. I guess it’s still true that `$$` is still often (?) used to mean `document.querySelectorAll`, probably as an adjunct to jQuery or whatever.

[13:19:32.0412] <jschoi>
I would support an identifier as the topic reference only if the idea is that we would be blessing a new (contextual) keyword, and that, , from now on, developers should never use the keyword as an ordinary variable. Just like `await` and `yield`. This is why I don’t think `it` is acceptable.
