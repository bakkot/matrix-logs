Yeah, TabAtkins, thanks for continuing to engage with him and others—I’ve been really busy myself, so I haven’t been able to work much on outreach or updates myself. 😔

And now I'm back to just closing issue threads because the participants refuse to stay on topic and instead keep relitigating the core question. :/

Should have done that one weeks ago, but I know Kevin personally and wanted to keep things friendly, but good *lord* I do not have time nor interest to engage in dueling essays where every point was brought up and addressed last year.

(if he has made novel points I missed them in the screenfuls of text that each post of his produces)

Insofar that we have already addressed many points of argument that people keep perseverating over, we should add an FAQ section or an FAQ document that summarizes positions, so we could simply point to them every time something gets brought up again. I’ve meant to do this for a year now, but I just haven’t had time. My apologies about this—maybe if I had done so earlier, we would have had you deal with a few less circular threads.

I doubt it. ^_^
