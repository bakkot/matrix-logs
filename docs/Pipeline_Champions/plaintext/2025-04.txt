It’s been nearly three years since the last pipe update to the community in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/232. I drafted a [new update covering the past few years in a private Gist](https://gist.github.com/js-choi/b626c180e0e15f3e8b7f7fded693962f).

Let me know if you have any feedback. I plan to post this in about one week. I will update [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/blob/main/HISTORY.md) with it too.

This looks good!

FYI, I plan to post that (non-)announcement post from the Gist tonight. I also made some adjustments to it:

* I added references to the JSSugar proposal as an example of how complicated proposing new syntax has become. 
* I also added, in a second file in the Gist, an updated version of the “TC39 does not want to encourage tacit programming” #221 issue.

I also am actually pretty excited about potentially getting `#` back from tuples, if we start considering [syntaxes other than `#[0]` for ordinal composite literals](https://github.com/acutmore/proposal-composites/issues/7). I plan to make a comment on the topic bikeshedding thread about that too.

fwiw `#` already means private fields so it's not necessarily a home run

[17:14:52.0760] <jschoi>
That is true. Of course, that problem is shared with `#`-based composite literals, too. 

And every choice of pipe topic left (`^^`, `@@`, `#_`, etc.) also has problems with visual association. I suppose one could argue that binary `^` is relatively rare.

I still think the [formulae in the wiki](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/wiki/Bikeshedding-the-Hack-topic-token#criteria-for-choosing-the-token) are pretty good heuristics.

[14:18:27.0122] <TabAtkins>
I still think we want to allow for # to be a metacharacter, since we're *nearly* out of ASCII syntax, so we'd want `##` for the topic.

[14:45:25.0564] <jschoi>
It’s true that we’re almost out of symbols. 
`@` is also there as a metacharacter, to a limited extent.
I was against `##` in that [November 2021 incubator call](https://github.com/tc39/incubator-agendas/blob/main/notes/2021/11-15.md), but I’m less negative toward it now.
I still want `#` most. The brevity would be so nice.
But `##` (and `^^` aren’t) terrible. I like `#_`, `@@`, and `%%` less.
