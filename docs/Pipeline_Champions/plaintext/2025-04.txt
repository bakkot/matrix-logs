It’s been nearly three years since the last pipe update to the community in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/232. I drafted a [new update covering the past few years in a private Gist](https://gist.github.com/js-choi/b626c180e0e15f3e8b7f7fded693962f).

Let me know if you have any feedback. I plan to post this in about one week. I will update [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/blob/main/HISTORY.md) with it too.

This looks good!

FYI, I plan to post that (non-)announcement post from the Gist tonight. I also made some adjustments to it:

* I added references to the JSSugar proposal as an example of how complicated proposing new syntax has become. 
* I also added, in a second file in the Gist, an updated version of the “TC39 does not want to encourage tacit programming” #221 issue.
