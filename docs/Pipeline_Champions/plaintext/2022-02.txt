It feels like it would be appropriate to do a presentation at the March meeting to get the committee's temperature again, and finally resolve the topic token issue, in anticipation of asking for Stage 3 at probably the following meeting after that. Does this sound good to everyone, or do we still have concerns?

Were the adhoc meeting notes published?

I recall that they were planned to be released when the plenary meeting notes are published.

I have not published them yet. I was planning to do them soon, before plenary, but I wasnâ€™t sure whether someone else wanted to wait until plenary notes got published.

A Babel contributor has opened a pull request for adding an optional pipe operator spelled as `?>` to Babel. https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/14255

only a little shame we can't do this:`if (val ?> true) { ... `,  need to `if (val != null)` but some projects force always strict equality checks so then have to do `if ((val ?? null) !== null)`

Note that we won't accept it until it's at least stage 1

I'm on record as thinking an optional pipe would be worthwhile; pipe fills the same syntax role as method chaining and `.?()` is useful.

(But I'm more than happy to keep it on the back burner as a follow-on proposal.)
