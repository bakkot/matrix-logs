It feels like it would be appropriate to do a presentation at the March meeting to get the committee's temperature again, and finally resolve the topic token issue, in anticipation of asking for Stage 3 at probably the following meeting after that. Does this sound good to everyone, or do we still have concerns?

Were the adhoc meeting notes published?

I recall that they were planned to be released when the plenary meeting notes are published.

I have not published them yet. I was planning to do them soon, before plenary, but I wasnâ€™t sure whether someone else wanted to wait until plenary notes got published.
