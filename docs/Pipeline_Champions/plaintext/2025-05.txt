Hi everyone, I came here after reading the [very helpful April update](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/232), thanks for everyone's work an attention on this. Since it's an uphill battle convincing folks that this should be implemented, I came here to drop my info in case I can be helpful in any way. I come at it from the data journalism world (I'm a [journalist](https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-h-keller) at NY Times and also [an open-source developer/maintainer](https://github.com/mhkeller/)). I think the pipeline operator would be tremendously helpful in our field. Happy to provide any kind of testimonial or participate in a user survey of some kind. Thanks again for the work.
