I'm assuming the terrible thing they're referring to is that they don't have papyrus installed on their computer

[10:09:26.0733] <shu>
how is it possible someone doesn't have papyrus

[10:09:28.0298] <shu>
isn't it defualt

[10:09:32.0838] <shu>
* isn't it default

[10:14:53.0005] <Michael Ficarra>
probably Linux

[10:15:32.0042] <shu>
this is why the year of linux on the desktop will never come

[10:15:54.0810] <shu>
papyrus has been around for 5000 years

how would y'all feel about introduction of a Mapping specification type (*analogous to the language values produced by `new Map()`, but no need for key/value/entry enumeration AFAICT*) for replacing ECMA-402 _record_.[[\<_var_>]] abuse of the Record type?

[14:03:32.0275] <bakkot>
positively

[14:09:55.0960] <Richard Gibson>
and followup: preferences for such a type being defined in ECMA-262 vs. ECMA-402?

[15:35:06.0525] <bakkot>
I would leave it in 402 until such time as there's use for it in 262
