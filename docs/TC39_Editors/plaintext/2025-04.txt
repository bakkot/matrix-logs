I'm assuming the terrible thing they're referring to is that they don't have papyrus installed on their computer

[10:09:26.0733] <shu>
how is it possible someone doesn't have papyrus

[10:09:28.0298] <shu>
isn't it defualt

[10:09:32.0838] <shu>
* isn't it default

[10:14:53.0005] <Michael Ficarra>
probably Linux

[10:15:32.0042] <shu>
this is why the year of linux on the desktop will never come

[10:15:54.0810] <shu>
papyrus has been around for 5000 years

[13:53:56.0499] <Richard Gibson>
how would y'all feel about introduction of a Mapping specification type (*analogous to the language values produced by `new Map()`, but no need for key/value/entry enumeration AFAICT*) for replacing ECMA-402 _record_.[[\<_var_>]] abuse of the Record type?
https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/984#discussion_r2021261469

[14:03:32.0275] <bakkot>
positively

[14:09:55.0960] <Richard Gibson>
and followup: preferences for such a type being defined in ECMA-262 vs. ECMA-402?

[15:35:06.0525] <bakkot>
I would leave it in 402 until such time as there's use for it in 262

[15:36:25.0000] <bakkot>
Temporal is using the same thing so we could pull it in to 262 as part of landing Temporal

[15:36:37.0979] <bakkot>
generally we don't like to have stuff in 262 that isn't being used within the document itself

totally forgot about the meeting today

[17:27:08.0936] <bakkot>

KG is down for 5m 262 report tomorrow.  lmk if delta


2025-04-14
[18:02:12.0114] <shu>
"if delta"?

[18:04:59.0637] <bakkot>
i.e. if we expect a different amount of time

[18:05:00.0718] <bakkot>
but we do not

[20:16:01.0233] <Chris de Almeida>
or a different presenter

[07:50:02.0495] <Michael Ficarra>
I would really love to see another editor review of https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2952.

[07:50:30.0011] <Michael Ficarra>
I don't want any other Annex B things to land without following those conventions.

ljharb https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3559 and https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3566 should both get backported to es2025

[14:55:46.0807] <bakkot>
I can do it but I assume you have a process

[15:01:46.0545] <ljharb>
yup

[15:02:35.0937] <ljharb>
is it ok to pull in the meta and editorial changes that have landed since the cut as well?

[15:04:24.0061] <ljharb>
* is it ok to pull in the meta and editorial changes that have landed since the cut as well? (normally i pull in everything except unnecessary normative changes, when updating a candidate)

[16:15:40.0429] <Michael Ficarra>
@ljharb:matrix.org we'd rather not, just those 2 please

[16:26:50.0726] <ljharb>
alrighty. why not?

[16:53:33.0454] <Michael Ficarra>
there's plenty of things we *could* pull in, but we shouldn't make changes after the opt-out period starts unless they're really vital

[16:53:57.0430] <Michael Ficarra>
in theory, we should probably be notifying committee about every cherry-picked commits at plenary

[16:54:26.0602] <ljharb>
the attitude for all the editors in the past was that only normative ones fell into that category, editorial was just a nice to have and within the editors' purview

[16:54:32.0536] <Michael Ficarra>
@bakkot:matrix.org @shuyuguo:matrix.org 402 issue tracking `<emu-normative-optional>`: https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/998

[16:55:40.0054] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm not personally against that policy, though I don't feel particularly compelled to pull in the editorial changes either

[16:56:13.0190] <ljharb>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ up to yall, this'll just be the first time we didn't eagerly pull all non-normatives in

[16:56:16.0218] <ljharb>

[10:09:35.0739] <Michael Ficarra>
does anyone know where we last discussed this convention? https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3571/files#r2058891137

[10:09:50.0230] <Michael Ficarra>
also, nobody objects to me adding it to the editorial conventions doc, right?

[10:10:44.0985] <Michael Ficarra>
I'll just add it for now and we can remove it if someone objects
