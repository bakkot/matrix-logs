is there an editors call today? Calendar says so, but you don't usually have one the week of a plenary.

[12:59:33.0173] <bakkot>
jmdyck: no, sorry for not removing

also it's a US holiday

[07:16:29.0892] <bakkot>
Michael Ficarra: do you want to review my extra commits to https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/pull/666`

[07:16:54.0585] <bakkot>
not a request, you are welcome to not

[07:23:01.0175] <Michael Ficarra>
LGTM

[08:57:38.0390] <bakkot>
so, this PR requires abstract method names to be globally unique. right now, certain environment records have a GetThisBinding, and others do not, which cannot be specified

[08:57:58.0163] <bakkot>
I guess I will just make all of them have it and the ones which currently don't will simply assert that they are not called?

there's a few cases where we're invoking an abstract method on a type which is statically knowable

[09:50:51.0621] <bakkot>
it would be nice if there were a way to make the generated link go to the correct concrete definition without just writing it out manually (which breaks the "references" machinery) but I can't think of one offhand so I'm not going to worry about it for now

[10:10:19.0693] <Michael Ficarra>
explicitly `emu-xref` the abstract method with an attribute that describes the concrete implementer?

[10:12:57.0753] <bakkot>
I think that breaks the "references" thing? but actually maybe not, I'll have to check

[10:13:30.0237] <Michael Ficarra>
no I think explicit `emu-xref`s show up in references

[11:22:26.0757] <bakkot>
should we auto-generate `id`s for the `tr`s in the table? alternative is to hand-write them

[11:22:37.0989] <bakkot>
I want links to go to the relevant row rather than the whole table

[11:41:39.0001] <Michael Ficarra>
hand write them

[11:46:20.0777] <bakkot>
most AOs end up being like `sec-methodname` but `sec` is mostly for clauses; thoughts on `abstract-methodname` here? with "abstract-" as a prefix for all of them

[11:46:37.0704] <bakkot>
gonna go with that for now

[12:07:02.0778] <Michael Ficarra>
You know I don't care about IDs. They just have to have some kind of vague relation to the thing so that if you see two spec URLs with fragments and you know the two places they're supposed to go, you can usually tell which one is associated with which place without clicking. That is the only requirement.

whoops, forgot about the meeting

[15:03:28.0487] <Michael Ficarra>
it was a good one, too!

[15:04:05.0863] <Michael Ficarra>
I thought about pinging you after you didn't show up ~5 minutes in, but I wasn't sure if you were just choosing not to go or not

[15:04:13.0623] <Michael Ficarra>
do you want me to ping you next time you forget?

[15:14:17.0877] <Michael Ficarra>
oh @bakkot:matrix.org if you have time, could you take a look at https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3733?

[15:14:39.0274] <Michael Ficarra>
I'd rather not let that one go stale, as the rebase could be a real pain

[15:16:16.0438] <bakkot>
will put it on the top of the queue

[15:18:07.0144] <bakkot>
updated https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3745 with the search fix; I think it's ready if you want to stamp it Michael Ficarra

Michael Ficarra: You're welcome to ping me, though it's unlikely to help: if I'm not at the meeting, I'm probably away from my computer.
