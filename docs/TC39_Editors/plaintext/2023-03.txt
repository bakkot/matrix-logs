thanks, I responded

[21:59:42.0867] <ljharb>
any thoughts on https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/3020#issuecomment-1441743282 ?

[09:57:21.0034] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah I think they're right and the solution is indeed to move the step into the derived path

[11:25:01.0383] <ljharb>
that was what i was suspecting but i find it hard to believe nobody would have noticed that while implementing class fields

[11:30:46.0508] <shu>
why is that hard to believe? ðŸ™ƒ

[13:29:01.0785] <Rob Palmer>
Is it possible that implementations are inefficient today due to the double init? 

[13:30:11.0568] <shu>
no, looks like no implementations do double init

[13:30:23.0740] <shu>
purely a spec bug

[14:32:18.0333] <jmdyck>
Is there a meeting?

[14:33:21.0393] <Michael Ficarra>
yes

[14:35:19.0930] <jmdyck>
"Sorry, we encountered a problem joining this video call."

[14:38:04.0737] <jmdyck>
The URL is the one that ends in pcz?

[14:41:35.0698] <ljharb>
yes

[14:42:40.0869] <jmdyck>
then I guess google just doesn't like me any more.

[15:00:27.0564] <ljharb>
that's very strange. are you logged in to the google account on the invite?

[15:00:41.0206] <ljharb>
(i'd still expect you to be able to get to it if not, to be clear)

[15:01:07.0491] <jmdyck>
I don't think I ever got an invite

[15:06:53.0942] <jmdyck>
Apparently, being logged into google made the difference.

[15:07:36.0994] <jmdyck>
But I'm pretty sure it hasn't been necessary in the past.

[15:14:38.0578] <ljharb>
yeah it shouldn't be

[15:25:00.0482] <Michael Ficarra>
I was logged out when I initially attempted to join, and it let me put a name in and ask to join (I didn't, I logged in, but it would have let me)

[15:25:30.0018] <jmdyck>
That's normally what I get.

I can't stop thinking about identity ðŸ˜©

[20:12:11.0832] <shu>
go on a bike ride

[20:12:13.0692] <shu>
live in the moment

[20:12:17.0817] <shu>
your identity is your own

be grateful nobody's trying to abbreviate it in the spec and figure out the capitalization :-p
