ljharb: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2819 should be ready to go - it's shipping in Chrome and FF, and that's all we were waiting for. that's the "Normative: avoid mostly-redundant await in async `yield*`" PR which doesn't load because dependabot backreferences broke it. branch is `async-generator-yield-await-2`

firefox bug is https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commit/fd2dc3acb62f1e19a306031536a99a08b5234347, v8 bug is https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=13275
