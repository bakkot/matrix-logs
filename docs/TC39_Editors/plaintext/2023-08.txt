shu: oh, the other reason I care about things being in TC39 instead of WHATWG is that WHATWG has an IMO completely batshit policy of restricting all new things to secure contexts

this rendered randomUUID completely unusable, for example

ljharb: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/actions/runs/5664165524/job/15603200826?pr=3131 fails the IPR check, but I think only because it needs to be rebased

[14:03:42.0992] <bakkot>
it is otherwise ready

[14:05:17.0821] <shu>
bakkot: we are getting ready to ship to set methods proposal. test262 would be nice, else we'll upload our tests to staging

[14:24:03.0949] <bakkot>
shu: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3816 is all I've got for you

[14:24:24.0142] <bakkot>
not yet updated for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods/pull/101 and https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods/pull/88 though

[14:25:23.0090] <bakkot>
if you are writing your own tests, https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/3738 lists the cases I thought of

[14:25:38.0221] <bakkot>
I will try to get time to get test262 tests for the rest of the methods soon

Thanks, Iâ€™ll do a sweep in the next 24 hours or so

bakkot: sgtm, we'll wait 2 weeks or so for fuzzing anyhow

I just noticed that my PR #3063 un-defined ids like "thisbooleanvalue" (which have been around since the merge of #2103, about 3 years ago). Would you like me to file a PR to reinstate them as oldids on "sec-thisbooleanvalue" etc?
