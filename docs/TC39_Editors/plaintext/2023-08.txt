shu: oh, the other reason I care about things being in TC39 instead of WHATWG is that WHATWG has an IMO completely batshit policy of restricting all new things to secure contexts

[15:44:37.0666] <bakkot>
this rendered randomUUID completely unusable, for example

[15:45:39.0463] <shu>

ljharb: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/actions/runs/5664165524/job/15603200826?pr=3131 fails the IPR check, but I think only because it needs to be rebased

[14:03:42.0992] <bakkot>
it is otherwise ready

[14:05:17.0821] <shu>
bakkot: we are getting ready to ship to set methods proposal. test262 would be nice, else we'll upload our tests to staging

[14:24:03.0949] <bakkot>
shu: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3816 is all I've got for you

[14:24:24.0142] <bakkot>
not yet updated for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods/pull/101 and https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods/pull/88 though

[14:25:23.0090] <bakkot>
if you are writing your own tests, https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/3738 lists the cases I thought of

[14:25:38.0221] <bakkot>
I will try to get time to get test262 tests for the rest of the methods soon

Thanks, I‚Äôll do a sweep in the next 24 hours or so

[14:58:57.0399] <shu>
bakkot: sgtm, we'll wait 2 weeks or so for fuzzing anyhow

I just noticed that my PR #3063 un-defined ids like "thisbooleanvalue" (which have been around since the merge of #2103, about 3 years ago). Would you like me to file a PR to reinstate them as oldids on "sec-thisbooleanvalue" etc?


2023-08-07
[16:22:24.0659] <Michael Ficarra>
jmdyck: sure, that would be nice

bakkot shu for your consideration: https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/pull/542

[18:06:58.0153] <bakkot>
does that work for every kind of thing which can be referenced?

[09:11:36.0796] <Michael Ficarra>
I think so?

[09:22:19.0739] <Michael Ficarra>
bakkot: it does now: https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/blob/ed43098ecc208aab3d5866f831d688419de9541a/js/menu.js#L232-L255

[09:55:38.0262] <shu>
sure why not

[09:56:06.0758] <shu>
i don't think i really look at that name in any case but this is better than the id

[09:59:57.0189] <Michael Ficarra>
thoughts on changing the text selection colour to something more ECMA-y?

[10:00:28.0587] <bakkot>
oh god no

[10:00:42.0393] <Michael Ficarra>
lol k

[10:00:45.0800] <bakkot>
please never mess with text selection color unless you've also messed with background color

[10:00:58.0108] <bakkot>
also don't mess with background color in this instance

[10:01:26.0736] <shu>
"make things more ECMA-y" is not a sentence i want to hear

[15:00:18.0202] <bakkot>
ljharb: do you know what these lines in package.json are about? https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/c316ec72f6e227d88d4ef67a3e16b486c5ca356d/package.json#L8-L10

[15:00:24.0739] <bakkot>
we haven't used travis in a long long time, have we?

[15:01:13.0052] <ljharb>
yeah i just kept the scripts

[15:01:35.0581] <ljharb>
i think we can remove them at this point since we have other ways of testing the build

[15:01:53.0021] <bakkot>
ok cool

[15:02:07.0506] <bakkot>
I ask mostly because they're still using the old `--js` flag to ecmarkup, which I am maybe going to rip out

[16:40:54.0797] <Michael Ficarra>
JS ‚áí üóëÔ∏è

[14:57:34.0373] <jmdyck>
re Delegates room: Maybe the process I used to convert 262 to ecmarkup would work on 404.


2023-08-13
[15:06:30.0239] <ljharb>
that'd be great

[15:06:47.0269] <ljharb>
it's not hard, it's just a bunch of manual tedious work, so i haven't made time for it


2023-08-16
[15:41:53.0866] <bakkot>
https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3140 is also ready to go if someone wants to stamp it

[15:41:59.0008] <bakkot>

[15:48:15.0529] <Michael Ficarra>
I still don't love the choice of alias names, butsure


2023-08-29
[13:35:38.0818] <Michael Ficarra>
we need an editor call label for ecmarkup


2023-08-30
[18:24:49.0742] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm all caught up on my editor reviews

[18:24:58.0100] <Michael Ficarra>
if you think something else needs my review, let me know
