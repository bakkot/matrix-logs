Rob Palmer: we can discuss our plans in the editor call today, but even if there are no changes to the editor group, it may still be a good idea to have a vote of confidence and give an opportunity for committee feedback on our modus operandi

Thanks Michael.  In the past, there has been committee feedback for us to spend less plenary time on meta issues such as elections.  So unless there is a specific need for an Editor election, I would suggest not initiating one.  How about raising a Reflector request-for-feedback issue for the Editors?
