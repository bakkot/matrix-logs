Rob Palmer: we can discuss our plans in the editor call today, but even if there are no changes to the editor group, it may still be a good idea to have a vote of confidence and give an opportunity for committee feedback on our modus operandi

Thanks Michael.  In the past, there has been committee feedback for us to spend less plenary time on meta issues such as elections.  So unless there is a specific need for an Editor election, I would suggest not initiating one.  How about raising a Reflector request-for-feedback issue for the Editors?

[11:59:01.0360] <shu>
i agree with the request for comments async approach. we can announce the issue in the next editor updates

[11:59:20.0374] <shu>
or better yet, an anonymized feedback form

[11:59:33.0112] <shu>
i'd rather not put folks on the spot if they have criticisms, especially in plenary

[12:03:06.0140] <shu>
instead they should all be given 3 incense sticks that give off distinct colored smoke that represent how pleased they are, they will be asked to form a circle with their backs turned to each other when lighting the incense of their choice

[12:03:19.0235] <shu>
then we will judge what color the mixed smoke cloud is

[13:06:20.0773] <Michael Ficarra>
Rob Palmer: I'm fine with that

[15:43:14.0767] <Michael Ficarra>
Rob Palmer: We'd all like to stay on for another year. Can you create an anonymous feedback submission form for us?
