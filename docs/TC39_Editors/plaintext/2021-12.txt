ljharb: ping on https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2484 btw

[18:27:58.0161] <ljharb>
Oh thanks, Iâ€™ll clear the queue tonight

[14:24:16.0772] <ljharb>
i'm going to merge through the deploy preview not finishing, since it's broken due to AWS downtime today

[14:25:40.0654] <ljharb>
 * i'm going to merge through the deploy preview not finishing, since it's broken due to AWS downtime today, assuming that

[14:25:42.0401] <ljharb>
 * i'm going to merge through the deploy preview not finishing, since it's broken due to AWS downtime today, assuming that's fine

[15:02:14.0581] <bakkot>
yeah if it's stamped go for it

bakkot: oops, had dumb bug in the AC PR: https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/pull/383

[09:24:22.0854] <shu>
that bug in `CreateMappedArgumentsObject` is weird

[10:27:08.0136] <bakkot>
it's because xrefs look for surrounding emu-meta tags

[10:27:18.0810] <bakkot>
I am pretty sure, anyway

[10:28:00.0739] <bakkot>
yeah: https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/blob/90438c13e442a2303830bd75d28a663e0e1fe12e/src/Xref.ts#L43-L69

[10:28:22.0819] <bakkot>
the xref sees its parent element is an emu-meta tag, adopts its effects, and deletes it from the list of tags to render

[10:28:52.0404] <bakkot>
easy fix is to say the xref also has to be the first child of the tag, I guess?

[13:45:47.0453] <shu>
yeah that sounds right

shu: I pulled in your ecmarkup PR to your 262 branch; be sure to pull before making other changes

[11:08:12.0482] <shu>
will do

[11:20:31.0268] <shu>
a suggestion i got internally is to have the [UC] marker be in the AO heading as well (with the section number)

[11:20:34.0661] <shu>
seems like a fine idea to me

[11:37:49.0600] <ljharb>
Would that show up in copy/pasting of the section?

[11:38:19.0250] <bakkot>
Depends on how it was implemented

[11:38:56.0937] <shu>
the current CSS is that none of the markers show up in copy/paste

[11:39:02.0517] <shu>
they're :before i think

[11:39:03.0642] <bakkot>
shu: do you think it should also go in the ToC? that would be maybe a bit cluttered

[11:39:12.0337] <shu>
i don't think it should go into the ToC, no

[13:59:39.0850] <bakkot>
there is no `set.from`, at the moment

[13:59:46.0011] <bakkot>
it like many things is blocked on symbol.species

[14:00:14.0515] <ljharb>
given that the new array by copy methods omit species on purpose, it seems like there'll be precedent to omit species on Set.from also

[14:00:31.0412] <bakkot>
probably yeah
