lmao there's a bug in the spell checking script

[10:25:24.0475] <bakkot>
huh

[10:40:35.0564] <Michael Ficarra>
the way it works is aspell notifies it of the misspellings but not the line/column numbers so it just greps for occurrences of the misspelling in the most naïve way possible

[10:40:54.0040] <Michael Ficarra>
which surprisingly worked well up until now

[10:42:02.0656] <Michael Ficarra>
maybe there's a way for aspell to report position info, but we should probably just prune for changed lines, since this only needs to work in PRs

[10:43:27.0013] <Michael Ficarra>
that would still have a chance of the same issue, but it should be good enough
