why are we even ecma

[08:40:47.0903] <shu>
 * why are we even under ecma

[08:53:46.0540] <Michael Ficarra>
jmdyck: One thing of consequence to you is that we decided for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes/pull/133 to allow "Deprecated" to apply not just to clauses but also individual steps. That's something you may want to take advantage of in https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2952.

[08:54:24.0588] <Michael Ficarra>
Btw what's the status of #2952? Is it ready for review? I'd like to review and merge if it's ready.

a humble request to not use threads

[11:14:14.0236] <shu>
i hate the notifications

[11:14:25.0736] <shu>
 * i hate the unread notifications

[11:20:42.0048] <Michael Ficarra>
strange, I think my client works the opposite way

[11:20:54.0919] <Michael Ficarra>
I never see things that happen in threads because it doesn't notify me

[11:21:32.0821] <shu>
also seems like a good reason to not use threads
