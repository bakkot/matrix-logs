why are we even ecma

jmdyck: One thing of consequence to you is that we decided for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes/pull/133 to allow "Deprecated" to apply not just to clauses but also individual steps. That's something you may want to take advantage of in https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2952.

[08:54:24.0588] <Michael Ficarra>
Btw what's the status of #2952? Is it ready for review? I'd like to review and merge if it's ready.

[09:12:41.0842] <bakkot>
I gotta update ecmarkup to support labelling individual steps, for both of those

a humble request to not use threads

[11:14:14.0236] <shu>
i hate the notifications

[11:14:25.0736] <shu>
 * i hate the unread notifications

[11:20:42.0048] <Michael Ficarra>
strange, I think my client works the opposite way

[11:20:54.0919] <Michael Ficarra>
I never see things that happen in threads because it doesn't notify me

[11:21:32.0821] <shu>
also seems like a good reason to not use threads

[16:10:20.0993] <ljharb>

[16:10:28.0146] <ljharb>

Michael Ficarra: re 2952: once ecma262's rendering task can handle "normative-optional" as a step-attribute, I'll push up some tweaks to use that. But those will be pretty minor changes, so it's basically reviewable now.

(Really, it's been reviewable since I posted it.)

not sure how important method ordering in the String.prototype section is, so I've added the well-formed strings methods in alphabetical order even though it splits them up and also splits up indexOf/lastIndexOf (which happened to both be adjacent and be in alphabetical order): https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3039

[09:06:27.0962] <Michael Ficarra>
shu: bakkot: let me know if you'd prefer to keep them adjacent and break alphabetical order instead

[10:50:26.0011] <Michael Ficarra>
jmdyck: you can bump ecmarkup to 16.2.0 in your PR and use the step markers now https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/releases/tag/v16.2.0
