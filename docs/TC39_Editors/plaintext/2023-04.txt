why are we even ecma

jmdyck: One thing of consequence to you is that we decided for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes/pull/133 to allow "Deprecated" to apply not just to clauses but also individual steps. That's something you may want to take advantage of in https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2952.

[08:54:24.0588] <Michael Ficarra>
Btw what's the status of #2952? Is it ready for review? I'd like to review and merge if it's ready.

[09:12:41.0842] <bakkot>
I gotta update ecmarkup to support labelling individual steps, for both of those

where was this seen?

a humble request to not use threads

[11:14:14.0236] <shu>
i hate the notifications

[11:14:25.0736] <shu>
 * i hate the unread notifications

[11:20:42.0048] <Michael Ficarra>
strange, I think my client works the opposite way

[11:20:54.0919] <Michael Ficarra>
I never see things that happen in threads because it doesn't notify me

[11:21:32.0821] <shu>
also seems like a good reason to not use threads

lol. i posted the issue on the 2nd and all the delegates were informed in plenary

[16:10:20.0993] <ljharb>
aw, threads are great

[16:10:28.0146] <ljharb>
the notifications for them in matrix do kinda suck tho

Michael Ficarra: re 2952: once ecma262's rendering task can handle "normative-optional" as a step-attribute, I'll push up some tweaks to use that. But those will be pretty minor changes, so it's basically reviewable now.


2023-04-09
[09:30:29.0322] <jmdyck>
(Really, it's been reviewable since I posted it.)

not sure how important method ordering in the String.prototype section is, so I've added the well-formed strings methods in alphabetical order even though it splits them up and also splits up indexOf/lastIndexOf (which happened to both be adjacent and be in alphabetical order): https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3039

[09:06:27.0962] <Michael Ficarra>
shu: bakkot: let me know if you'd prefer to keep them adjacent and break alphabetical order instead

[10:50:26.0011] <Michael Ficarra>
jmdyck: you can bump ecmarkup to 16.2.0 in your PR and use the step markers now https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/releases/tag/v16.2.0

[13:24:41.0643] <jmdyck>
but you'll bump it in main before 2952 is merged?

[15:21:59.0364] <Michael Ficarra>
jmdyck: yep


2023-04-12
[14:21:51.0873] <jmdyck>
Hm, https://ci.tc39.es/preview/tc39/ecma262/sha/9b6e3a351608d3ced2c9b4855f0cdecc4bc21b31/#sec-evaldeclarationinstantiation has a normative-optional within a normative-optional. 

[14:23:36.0451] <jmdyck>
Ah, because they're for 2 different features.

Hi folks! ECMA secretariat just asked me for the PDF version of the 2023 spec, did you produce one yet?

[06:22:00.0692] <jmdyck>
On Apr 3, @ljharb said:
> i didn't bother making a PDF this year since i'm assuming they're going to make their own



[06:23:13.0871] <jmdyck>
(I'm assuming that "they" is Ecma.)

[08:48:49.0120] <Michael Ficarra>
"they" is Allen

[09:06:29.0844] <ljharb>
on behalf of ecma yeah

[09:07:09.0615] <jmdyck>
Is it known that Allen will do it again this year?
