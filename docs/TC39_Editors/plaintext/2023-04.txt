k, fixed, made the release and filed https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/466

[22:08:07.0225] <ljharb>
i didn't bother making a PDF this year since i'm assuming they're going to make their own

jmdyck: One thing of consequence to you is that we decided for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes/pull/133 to allow "Deprecated" to apply not just to clauses but also individual steps. That's something you may want to take advantage of in https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2952.

[08:54:24.0588] <Michael Ficarra>
Btw what's the status of #2952? Is it ready for review? I'd like to review and merge if it's ready.

[09:12:41.0842] <bakkot>
I gotta update ecmarkup to support labelling individual steps, for both of those

a humble request to not use threads

i hate the notifications

[11:20:42.0048] <Michael Ficarra>
strange, I think my client works the opposite way

[11:20:54.0919] <Michael Ficarra>
I never see things that happen in threads because it doesn't notify me

[11:21:32.0821] <shu>
also seems like a good reason to not use threads

lol. i posted the issue on the 2nd and all the delegates were informed in plenary

aw, threads are great

the notifications for them in matrix do kinda suck tho

Michael Ficarra: re 2952: once ecma262's rendering task can handle "normative-optional" as a step-attribute, I'll push up some tweaks to use that. But those will be pretty minor changes, so it's basically reviewable now.


2023-04-09
[09:30:29.0322] <jmdyck>
(Really, it's been reviewable since I posted it.)

not sure how important method ordering in the String.prototype section is, so I've added the well-formed strings methods in alphabetical order even though it splits them up and also splits up indexOf/lastIndexOf (which happened to both be adjacent and be in alphabetical order): https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3039

[09:06:27.0962] <Michael Ficarra>
shu: bakkot: let me know if you'd prefer to keep them adjacent and break alphabetical order instead

[10:50:26.0011] <Michael Ficarra>
jmdyck: you can bump ecmarkup to 16.2.0 in your PR and use the step markers now https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/releases/tag/v16.2.0

[13:24:41.0643] <jmdyck>
but you'll bump it in main before 2952 is merged?

[15:21:59.0364] <Michael Ficarra>
jmdyck: yep


2023-04-12
[14:21:51.0873] <jmdyck>
Hm, https://ci.tc39.es/preview/tc39/ecma262/sha/9b6e3a351608d3ced2c9b4855f0cdecc4bc21b31/#sec-evaldeclarationinstantiation has a normative-optional within a normative-optional. 

[14:23:36.0451] <jmdyck>
Ah, because they're for 2 different features.

Hi folks! ECMA secretariat just asked me for the PDF version of the 2023 spec, did you produce one yet?

[06:22:00.0692] <jmdyck>
On Apr 3, @ljharb said:
> i didn't bother making a PDF this year since i'm assuming they're going to make their own



[06:23:13.0871] <jmdyck>
(I'm assuming that "they" is Ecma.)

[08:48:49.0120] <Michael Ficarra>
"they" is Allen

[09:06:29.0844] <ljharb>
on behalf of ecma yeah

[09:07:09.0615] <jmdyck>
Is it known that Allen will do it again this year?

[09:26:31.0028] <ljharb>
nope, but the only reason we make the pdf is because ecma wants it, and i don't have an active Adobe CS subscription anymore (that they pay for), and they don't want to pay for proper typesetting, so the ball's in their court

[11:47:40.0115] <jmdyck>
indeed

[11:55:56.0248] <shu>
Chris de Almeida: go ahead

[12:51:40.0338] <Chris de Almeida>
> <@usharma:igalia.com> Hi folks! ECMA secretariat just asked me for the PDF version of the 2023 spec, did you produce one yet?

did you respond?  I didn't see anything, but.. that's unsurprising

[13:02:31.0375] <shu>
we can talk about it at this week's editor call

[13:02:56.0047] <shu>
but i feel like the two realistic choices are:

1. Ecma can press the "Print to PDF" button themselves
2. Ecma can hire someone to do a better job

[13:03:08.0161] <Chris de Almeida>
ExeCom meeting is in a few hours, so it may come up

[13:03:30.0660] <Chris de Almeida>
TC39 report scheduled for 7 PT tomorrow

[13:03:59.0249] <shu>
what do they want form the editor group? we're not going to make a pdf for them

[13:04:11.0451] <shu>
 * what do they want from the editor group? we're not going to make a pdf for them

[13:04:45.0051] <Chris de Almeida>
no idea.. I didn't see the correspondence.  I can certainly relay points 1 and 2 above

[13:10:15.0926] <Chris de Almeida>
it appears the 402 editors produced a PDF, which could lead to asking why they are getting one but not the other ü§∑

[13:11:20.0463] <shu>
> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> TC39 report scheduled for 7 PT tomorrow

what is this?

[13:13:31.0132] <Chris de Almeida>
`6.2.19` - The work of all TCs will be discussed every six months at a meeting of the ExeCom

[13:13:54.0860] <shu>
ah, and it's a separate session from the normal ExeCom meeting?

[13:14:46.0495] <Chris de Almeida>
this is the normal ExeCom meeting.  I think you may be referring to the GA meeting?

[13:15:11.0556] <shu>
you said "ExeCom meeting is in a few hours" and also "TC39 report scheduled for 7 PT tomorrow" so i thought it was 2 meetings

[13:16:03.0072] <Chris de Almeida>
bit clumsy of me -- the meeting starts in a little over 10 hours (2 AM CT)

[13:16:24.0745] <shu>
o ha, 7am!

[13:16:31.0154] <shu>
i understood that as 7pm for some reason

[13:16:56.0402] <Chris de Almeida>
yes... requested to do the TC39 portion later in the day so I don't have to get up in the middle of the night (or stay up all night)

okay so Istvan wrote to me saying that he's more or less aware of the status quo (that there's no PDF) and that Allen did it for us last year but also didn't quite mention if ECMA is going to do that for us, instead going for the vaguely pointy "someone should pick it up again and take action"

[03:50:58.0157] <ryzokuken>
I think he's proposing this be done as some sort of ecmarkup feature

[03:52:07.0587] <ryzokuken>
FWIW, we did produce a PDF version of the 402 spec and I could share the process with you (which is an iteration over what Leo had been doing for years) if anyone's interested

[06:54:42.0160] <Michael Ficarra>
IMO producing a high quality PDF is the job of a typesetter, not the editors, so I'm not really interested

[08:40:59.0828] <shu>
yeah

[08:41:06.0378] <shu>
istvan can press the print to pdf button himself
