our cache expiration on 262 is only 10 minutes and I can't find a way to change it :-(

[07:57:55.0506] <bakkot>
 you could always add a service worker

[07:57:59.0125] <bakkot>
I mean, probably don't do that

[07:58:03.0623] <bakkot>
but you could

i think it's github-pages-wide

slight issue: https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/6506

[21:34:15.0376] <bakkot>
can we just host it? it's like 200kb zipped for regular+bold+italic

[07:16:46.0902] <jmdyck>
NotEscapeSequence (NES) is disallowed in untagged TemplateLiterals,
but allowed in tagged TemplateLiterals.
So consider a tagged TemplateLiteral that contains a NES.
The TRV of that NES is a String, and the TV of it is *undefined*.
So in GetTemplateObject, the relevant element of `_rawStrings_` is a String,
and of `_cookedStrings_` is *undefined*.
Is that all correct?

[07:30:45.0349] <Chris de Almeida>
whatever font is used, we should serve it directly and not rely on CDNs

[07:56:44.0535] <jmdyck>
If so, the return-types of TemplateString + TemplateStrings need to be fixed, to allow for undefined.

[08:37:49.0982] <bakkot>
yup, sounds right

seems like we need to just host it, based on their response to michael's issue

[09:09:55.0456] <Michael Ficarra>
I will try swapping the glyph out and subsetting to get even smaller than what Google Fonts hosts.

[09:12:41.0320] <ljharb>
it'd be good if any modification you do to google's downloads is repeatable tho

[10:58:26.0514] <Michael Ficarra>
unbelievably, it actually worked ðŸ˜€

[10:58:54.0465] <Michael Ficarra>
I now know way too much about opentype features and glyph substitution

[10:59:36.0554] <Michael Ficarra>
also, they're like 15kb each, so 60kb total, about the same as Google Fonts

[10:59:48.0510] <Michael Ficarra>
since I added a documentation comment
