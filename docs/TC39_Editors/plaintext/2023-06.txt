bakkot: btw i found my bug with the extra bytes; i was just an idiot and forgot typed arrays aren't concat-spreadable

[08:08:36.0551] <Michael Ficarra>
nobody remembers what is and is not concat spreadable ðŸ˜ž

[09:25:31.0464] <ljharb>
i remember that arrays and nodelists are :-p but yeah i agree it's a dumb protocol, it should just have spread any non-primitive arraylike without a protocol
