I don't hate it

[16:12:58.0808] <shu>
lgtm

[16:14:49.0619] <Michael Ficarra>
pattern?

[16:18:07.0854] <shu>
my personal preference is no pattern. what's the pattern for?

[16:45:12.0453] <Michael Ficarra>
lol for looking dopey

[16:45:17.0752] <Michael Ficarra>
I don't like the pattern

[18:32:17.0670] <ljharb>
flagged css and no pattern seem good, fwiw

[18:39:53.0232] <Michael Ficarra>
we should get this merged before the 2024 cut: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3103

hey folks -- who will be handing the editors' report at plenary and how much time do you need?

[14:06:54.0135] <bakkot>
Chris de Almeida: me, about 5 minutes, same as always

[14:07:40.0402] <Chris de Almeida>
excellent, thank you

shu: DetachArrayBuffer only allows an AB, not a SAB - is there no need for the web to detach SABs? if so, how do they do it in the spec? should DetachArrayBuffer allow SABs also, just like IsDetachedBuffer does?

i do see that structuredClone/MessageChannel in node doesn't allow transferring SABs

[11:08:36.0464] <bakkot>
SABs cannot be detached

[11:08:46.0043] <bakkot>
transferirng a SAB doesn't detach it

[11:08:50.0671] <bakkot>
that is in fact the point of SABs


2024-02-05
[22:04:17.0943] <ljharb>
ok, then why does IsDetachedBuffer bother to allow an SAB?

[22:04:32.0565] <ljharb>
just to simplify callers?

[23:11:38.0838] <bakkot>
I assume so

[23:11:47.0799] <bakkot>
it's a reasonable question to ask of a SAB

[23:11:54.0979] <bakkot>
it's just that the answer is always "no"

[23:36:50.0823] <ljharb>
gotcha, thanks


2024-02-08
[13:05:47.0266] <ljharb>
(i've spoken to shu about it) at the end of the meeting i'll be asking for plenary approval of ES2024, including nicolo's normative PR and the transfer PR, so we can start the clock in time.

[13:06:06.0433] <shu>
what's the hard deadline to merge the PRs by?

[13:08:34.0386] <ljharb>
February 14th is 70 days ahead of GA which i'm told is on April 24th

[13:08:44.0379] <ljharb>
 * February 14th is 70 days ahead of GA which i'm told is on April 24th (which confused me because GA is usually in june)

[13:08:58.0598] <ljharb>
but basically, if we get them landed and i cut the spec within a week, and we get approval today, we're fine

[13:09:14.0908] <ljharb>
(transfer's freshly rebased if anyone wants to stamp it and slap the label on, fwiw)

[13:12:00.0141] <Michael Ficarra>
ljharb: also https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3222#issuecomment-1931050968

[13:12:14.0365] <ljharb>
ah yes thanks, i'll mention that too

[15:12:42.0506] <Chris de Almeida>
who was it that did a publish-on-demand print of the spec and what service did you use?

[15:16:58.0332] <Chris de Almeida>
vaguely recalling twas `bakkot` (?)

[15:23:00.0962] <bakkot>
nope

[15:23:10.0509] <bakkot>
I have used lulu.com for other things, but not of the spec

[15:55:06.0804] <Chris de Almeida>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> I know this because literally yesterday I had a printed book show up at my door which I made with paged.js which was missing lines of text at the bottom of a couple pages and it turned out to be because those lines were present in paged.js's preview but not in the PDF generated by doing print-to-pdf from that page

ah, it wasn't the spec but this is what I was thinking of

[15:58:38.0040] <bakkot>
I've been using lulu for more than a decade for random projects and am generally happy with it. don't expect a heritage-quality book but it's only a little lower quality than a typical mass-market book from a bookstore

[15:58:52.0493] <bakkot>
and it's like $10


2024-02-12
[13:23:36.0075] <ljharb>
(heads up the CI deploy preview stuff on begin.com is broken rn; i've got someone working on updating the SSL certs and getting it fixed - after which i'll merge whatever's waiting)


2024-02-15
[18:56:43.0229] <ljharb>
is https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3175 ready for the merge label?

[21:35:58.0645] <bakkot>
should be, just stamped

[09:13:53.0356] <ljharb>
thanks! should https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2814 have the es2024 label, or should i cut without it?

[09:20:50.0670] <Michael Ficarra>
umm it would be nice to get that in

[09:21:03.0196] <Michael Ficarra>
only thing it's waiting for is shu to respond about the note position

[09:21:06.0549] <Michael Ficarra>
otherwise it LGTM

[09:21:25.0475] <Michael Ficarra>
I also won't die on this hill if someone prefers the note where he put it

[09:21:33.0935] <ljharb>
k, labeled it. https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3279 is a nice cleanup that could land right after that, if desired :-)

[12:04:06.0037] <shu>
Michael Ficarra: i like it after?

[12:04:18.0687] <shu>
bakkot can be tie-breaker

[12:06:55.0760] <bakkot>
I don't care, and we appear to be wildly inconsistent, and therefore cast my vote for the thing which does not require us to push up any changes i.e. leave it as is

[12:07:19.0911] <bakkot>
(compare e.g. the note in the first case in https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-expressions.html#sec-runtime-semantics-arrayaccumulation)

[12:07:51.0178] <shu>
wfm

[12:58:00.0448] <ljharb>
k, i'll cut the spec this evening. feel free to stamp and label https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3279 before then if desired, but obv no rush

[14:41:05.0897] <ljharb>
oh also, we need another PR just like https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2709 and https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3032, for ES2024. i can write one, but it's probably better if one of yall does

[14:42:27.0477] <shu>
oh crap always forget about the foreword

[14:50:31.0574] <Michael Ficarra>
maybe we just delay until next editor call then?

[14:50:35.0286] <Michael Ficarra>
we have time

[14:51:25.0136] <Michael Ficarra>
we did these in late March last 2 times

[14:51:40.0516] <ljharb>
true, altho we said in plenary that the spec would be cut this week

[14:51:49.0490] <ljharb>
it'd be really nice to get it done today or tomorrow

[14:52:11.0024] <bakkot>
I can write something up tonight or tomorrow

[14:52:18.0603] <ljharb>
since it's largely just going to be summaries of a selection of the last few editor slides, it shouldn't take too long

[14:52:22.0240] <ljharb>
 * since it's largely just going to be summaries of a selection of the last 6 editor slides, it shouldn't take too long

[14:57:15.0569] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah if Kevin wants to make a PR I can review


2024-02-16
[11:25:37.0268] <bakkot>
shu Michael Ficarra https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3282


2024-02-17
[16:12:38.0170] <ljharb>
any update on the merge label for PR 3282?, or anything else to wait for?

[16:12:40.0707] <ljharb>
 * any update on the merge label for PR 3282, or anything else to wait for?

[16:13:13.0510] <shu>
should wait for stamp from michael

[16:42:41.0943] <ljharb>
sure, but any other PRs besides that one?

[16:44:35.0202] <shu>
ah i misinterpreted "anything else to wait for" as "on that pr"

[17:05:44.0262] <bakkot>
michael approved, should be good to go

[17:05:55.0237] <bakkot>
nothing else I can think of

[17:06:08.0746] <bakkot>
think it's time to cut once that lands

[21:16:47.0959] <ljharb>
sounds good

[21:17:11.0750] <ljharb>
(unless someone shu or kevin wants to stamp and label https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3279 - def not urgent tho)

[21:32:12.0862] <bakkot>
done

[21:33:40.0704] <ljharb>
thanks

[21:33:47.0378] <ljharb>
will have the candidate cut in the next 10-15

btw confirmed that zhangenming's commit email indeed isn't attached to the github account; the presence of the avatar isn't an indicator. when there's no account, the avatar shown is automatically the PR author's.

if you look at the commit that i've pushed, which should have *two* avatars, it only has mine.

PR #3279 un-defined sec-createmethodproperty (i.e., didn't make it an oldid)
