I don't hate it

[16:12:58.0808] <shu>
lgtm

[16:14:49.0619] <Michael Ficarra>
pattern?

[16:18:07.0854] <shu>
my personal preference is no pattern. what's the pattern for?

[16:45:12.0453] <Michael Ficarra>
lol for looking dopey

[16:45:17.0752] <Michael Ficarra>
I don't like the pattern

[18:32:17.0670] <ljharb>
flagged css and no pattern seem good, fwiw

[18:39:53.0232] <Michael Ficarra>
we should get this merged before the 2024 cut: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3103

hey folks -- who will be handing the editors' report at plenary and how much time do you need?

[14:06:54.0135] <bakkot>
Chris de Almeida: me, about 5 minutes, same as always

[14:07:40.0402] <Chris de Almeida>
excellent, thank you

shu: DetachArrayBuffer only allows an AB, not a SAB - is there no need for the web to detach SABs? if so, how do they do it in the spec? should DetachArrayBuffer allow SABs also, just like IsDetachedBuffer does?

i do see that structuredClone/MessageChannel in node doesn't allow transferring SABs

[11:08:36.0464] <bakkot>
SABs cannot be detached

[11:08:46.0043] <bakkot>
transferirng a SAB doesn't detach it

[11:08:50.0671] <bakkot>
that is in fact the point of SABs


2024-02-05
[22:04:17.0943] <ljharb>
ok, then why does IsDetachedBuffer bother to allow an SAB?

[22:04:32.0565] <ljharb>
just to simplify callers?

[23:11:38.0838] <bakkot>
I assume so

[23:11:47.0799] <bakkot>
it's a reasonable question to ask of a SAB

[23:11:54.0979] <bakkot>
it's just that the answer is always "no"

[23:36:50.0823] <ljharb>
gotcha, thanks

(i've spoken to shu about it) at the end of the meeting i'll be asking for plenary approval of ES2024, including nicolo's normative PR and the transfer PR, so we can start the clock in time.

[13:06:06.0433] <shu>
what's the hard deadline to merge the PRs by?

[13:08:34.0386] <ljharb>
February 14th is 70 days ahead of GA which i'm told is on April 24th

[13:08:44.0379] <ljharb>
 * February 14th is 70 days ahead of GA which i'm told is on April 24th (which confused me because GA is usually in june)

[13:08:58.0598] <ljharb>
but basically, if we get them landed and i cut the spec within a week, and we get approval today, we're fine

[13:09:14.0908] <ljharb>
(transfer's freshly rebased if anyone wants to stamp it and slap the label on, fwiw)

[13:12:00.0141] <Michael Ficarra>
ljharb: also https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3222#issuecomment-1931050968

[13:12:14.0365] <ljharb>
ah yes thanks, i'll mention that too

[15:12:42.0506] <Chris de Almeida>
who was it that did a publish-on-demand print of the spec and what service did you use?

[15:16:58.0332] <Chris de Almeida>
vaguely recalling twas `bakkot` (?)

[15:23:00.0962] <bakkot>
nope

[15:23:10.0509] <bakkot>
I have used lulu.com for other things, but not of the spec

[15:55:06.0804] <Chris de Almeida>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> I know this because literally yesterday I had a printed book show up at my door which I made with paged.js which was missing lines of text at the bottom of a couple pages and it turned out to be because those lines were present in paged.js's preview but not in the PDF generated by doing print-to-pdf from that page

ah, it wasn't the spec but this is what I was thinking of

[15:58:38.0040] <bakkot>
I've been using lulu for more than a decade for random projects and am generally happy with it. don't expect a heritage-quality book but it's only a little lower quality than a typical mass-market book from a bookstore

[15:58:52.0493] <bakkot>
and it's like $10

[13:23:36.0075] <ljharb>
(heads up the CI deploy preview stuff on begin.com is broken rn; i've got someone working on updating the SSL certs and getting it fixed - after which i'll merge whatever's waiting)

[18:56:43.0229] <ljharb>
is https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3175 ready for the merge label?

[21:35:58.0645] <bakkot>
should be, just stamped

[09:13:53.0356] <ljharb>
thanks! should https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2814 have the es2024 label, or should i cut without it?
