I'm not going to be able to make editor call today. We got snowed in and I'm single-parenting this week, so I have to watch the baby all day.

and next week I'll be travelling home from wasmcon during editor call, so I'll also miss that one

Michael Ficarra: https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-asynciterator-interface, under Table 80, the Note refers to "<em>AsyncIterators</em>". Should 3459 have changed that to "async iterators" ?
