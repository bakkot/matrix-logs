added a sentence to https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2451/files

[07:50:00.0311] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm pretty happy with that

[07:50:08.0063] <Michael Ficarra>
let me know if it covers what you wanted

[13:38:49.0727] <shu>
i still feel like i wanna read the phrase "template raw value" somewhere

lol, just saw https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/2454

[18:03:19.0475] <shu>
was pretty good


2021-07-14
[16:10:17.0875] <bakkot>
https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/545 is updated including the ` : ` -> `: ` change we asked for

[16:10:29.0552] <bakkot>
I think it's good to go

[16:10:51.0002] <bakkot>
should get a review from at least one of shu or Michael Ficarra , though

[16:11:12.0553] <bakkot>
also it'll conflict with many open PRs, but I am happy to take care of the rebases


2021-07-15
[17:41:08.0477] <shu>
will review next week or later this week if i decide to work

[18:12:34.0637] <Michael Ficarra>
I've reviewed it in the past, and I really don't expect to find anything new

[18:13:00.0998] <Michael Ficarra>
I can do a really quick once-over to make sure there's nothing stray included if you like

[18:27:28.0654] <bakkot>
Just skim for the syntax and read my description of the diff, basically

 * Just skim for the syntax/formatting and read my description of the diff, basically

[18:31:52.0787] <Michael Ficarra>
actually yeah, I see your diff of the rendering, that should be fine

[18:32:08.0645] <Michael Ficarra>
as long as we've not missed any recently-introduced AOs

[18:32:25.0901] <Michael Ficarra>
does ecmarkup ensure we don't define an AO without metadata?

[18:32:52.0130] <Michael Ficarra>
I see my RoundMVResult AO is there

[18:35:07.0523] <bakkot>
Nope, intentionally so that existing PRs still build

[18:35:19.0531] <bakkot>
we'll check manually for a while

[18:35:28.0341] <bakkot>
I'll turn on enforcement at some future point

[18:37:43.0948] <Michael Ficarra>
k yeah it's not the end of the world if we've missed some

[18:37:52.0674] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm gonna just stamp it

[18:38:14.0826] <Michael Ficarra>
... set a reminder to enable enforcement?

[18:38:23.0421] <Michael Ficarra>
maybe best to just have a tracking issue

[18:39:00.0622] <bakkot>
I'll put it in the linting tracking issue

[19:06:08.0751] <Michael Ficarra>
ljharb: did that do anything?

[19:07:26.0594] <Michael Ficarra>
I don't have any clue what these numbers mean

[19:11:48.0208] <ljharb>
now i can post

[19:11:54.0655] <Michael Ficarra>
lol just needed to add more 9s

[19:12:03.0644] <ljharb>
ship it

[19:13:17.0151] <ljharb>
ok so i'll land 545 first, and rebase everything else on top

[21:05:15.0042] <Michael Ficarra>
ljharb: is 2442 a nontrivial rebase?

[21:05:22.0536] <ljharb>
yes

[21:05:30.0009] <Michael Ficarra>
strange

[21:05:33.0782] <ljharb>
i could probably figure it out but it took more judgement than i wanted

[21:05:50.0926] <ljharb>
it's like, 2442 changes adjacent to 545 changes, and git not being good at detecting that

[22:03:47.0271] <ljharb>
does https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2125 need a post-545 adjustment as well?

[22:09:02.0757] <Michael Ficarra>
probably not, but it needs further review

[22:09:42.0849] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah I don't see any new AOs, so it should be ready to go assuming we get approvals

Michael Ficarra: bakkot: i wanna do a temperature check among us for moving structured clone into tc39 and owning it (+ the structured clone algorithms for 262 objects)

[12:16:49.0078] <bakkot>
I would be happy with that if HTML is on board

[12:23:17.0873] <shu>
indeed, domenic is the one who reached out to me to do it

[12:23:32.0217] <shu>
i'm thinking of an initial proposal to not expose it programmatically, just to do the refactoring across specs

[12:23:53.0404] <shu>
we'll then split the maintenance responsibilities as 262 owning the cloning algorithms for 262+402 objects, and HTML owns the others, instead of HTML owning everything

[12:24:11.0055] <shu>
the possibly contentious normative thing to hash out is what to throw for errors
