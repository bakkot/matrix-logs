FYI a student will be opening some PRs and issues related to https://github.com/tontonialberto/ecma262-spec-inconsistencies

They don't seem to be aware that there are semantically different uses for [[Foo]] notation.

[05:39:21.0066] <jmdyck>
or that objects don't have 'fields'.

[05:52:05.0781] <Michael Ficarra>
yes I spoke to him about that already

[05:52:16.0440] <Michael Ficarra>
he won't be opening a PR for that

[05:53:15.0430] <jmdyck>
the if/else stuff is valid, but he's missing some variations.

[05:58:22.0548] <Michael Ficarra>
those are the only ones he's interested in

[05:58:51.0579] <Michael Ficarra>
I also got a question today about what the repeat-until step's semantics should be https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-data-types-and-values.html#sec-bigintbitwiseop

[05:59:16.0575] <Michael Ficarra>
does it imply that the steps should be executed at least once?

[05:59:47.0305] <Michael Ficarra>
like a do-while with a negated condition

[06:00:46.0084] <Michael Ficarra>
by this, I mean ones that have the consequent/alternative on the same line as the if/else/else-if

[06:01:38.0845] <jmdyck>
CreateIntrinsics step 2 is indeed problematic, but I don't think it can be broken into a series of more-parseable steps.

[06:02:15.0118] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah I don't think it needs to be broken down, but its phrasing can probably be modernised

[06:03:54.0456] <Michael Ficarra>
and probably it would be better to explicitly loop over table rows

[06:04:12.0096] <jmdyck>
My inclination is that step 2 should become its own section, where you can at least let things breathe in separate paragraphs, lists.
