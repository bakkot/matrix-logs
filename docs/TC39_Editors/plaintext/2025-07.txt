FYI a student will be opening some PRs and issues related to https://github.com/tontonialberto/ecma262-spec-inconsistencies

[05:24:44.0464] <jmdyck>
They don't seem to be aware that there are semantically different uses for [[Foo]] notation.

[05:39:21.0066] <jmdyck>
or that objects don't have 'fields'.

[05:52:05.0781] <Michael Ficarra>
yes I spoke to him about that already

[05:52:16.0440] <Michael Ficarra>
he won't be opening a PR for that

[05:53:15.0430] <jmdyck>
the if/else stuff is valid, but he's missing some variations.

[05:58:22.0548] <Michael Ficarra>
those are the only ones he's interested in

[05:58:51.0579] <Michael Ficarra>
I also got a question today about what the repeat-until step's semantics should be https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-data-types-and-values.html#sec-bigintbitwiseop

[05:59:16.0575] <Michael Ficarra>
does it imply that the steps should be executed at least once?

[05:59:47.0305] <Michael Ficarra>
like a do-while with a negated condition

[06:00:46.0084] <Michael Ficarra>
by this, I mean ones that have the consequent/alternative on the same line as the if/else/else-if

[06:01:38.0845] <jmdyck>
CreateIntrinsics step 2 is indeed problematic, but I don't think it can be broken into a series of more-parseable steps.

[06:02:15.0118] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah I don't think it needs to be broken down, but its phrasing can probably be modernised

[06:03:54.0456] <Michael Ficarra>
and probably it would be better to explicitly loop over table rows

[06:04:12.0096] <jmdyck>
My inclination is that step 2 should become its own section, where you can at least let things breathe in separate paragraphs, lists.

[06:05:34.0850] <Michael Ficarra>
once he opens the issue about it, we can dump our ideas in there and I'll label it as "editor call"

[06:05:55.0123] <Michael Ficarra>
I think he was hoping that our changes to that step could get esmeta to automatically understand it, but I don't see that happening

[06:06:49.0434] <jmdyck>
The thing about explicitly looping over table rows is you can't make a single pass over the table and completely create an object at each iteration, because there are cycles in the references.

[06:07:14.0172] <Michael Ficarra>
ah, right

[06:07:39.0870] <Michael Ficarra>
you'd have to topo-sort the table, which is... not great if you want to peruse the table manually

[06:28:15.0123] <jmdyck>
You could conceivably do 2 passes, one pass to partially create the objects (without any references), then another pass to add the references (properties + [[Prototype]]).  Then you wouldn't need a topo-sort. However, the spec says that built-in functions are created with CreateBuiltinFunction, which takes a _prototype_ arg. So if you want to respect that, you have to do a topo-sort on [[Prototype]].

[06:29:13.0041] <jmdyck>
The table wouldn't have to be topo-sorted in the source, CreateIntrinsics can just say to sort it, which is basically what it does now.

[06:29:55.0846] <jmdyck>
"The creation of the intrinsics and their properties must be ordered to avoid any dependencies upon objects that have not yet been created."

[06:30:25.0254] <jmdyck>
However, the implications of that sentence aren't obvious.

[06:38:53.0485] <jmdyck>
But even if that part of the algorithm were made more explicit, esmeta would probably still need one-off stuff to parse it.

[06:43:52.0104] <Michael Ficarra>
this isn't a KAIST student btw

[06:45:47.0562] <jmdyck>
And that'd still leave the ~half of step 2 that talks about how you invoke CreateBuiltinFunction. I suppose you could do something like:
If the intrinsic to be created is a built-in function, then
- Let _steps_ be the definition of that function provided by this specification.
- Let _length_ be the initial value of the function's "length" property.
- [etc]
- Let _intrinsic_ be CreateBuiltinFunction(_steps_, _length_, ...).
- Set ... to _intrinsic_.

[06:46:10.0935] <jmdyck>
That would at least be more readable to humans.

[06:48:02.0308] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah that's exactly what I was thinking

[06:52:11.0199] <jmdyck>
Hm. So now I'm now more optimistic about breaking step 2 into steps, but (a) they're not necessarily more parseable, and (b) it's not trivial.

[06:52:21.0875] <jmdyck>
* Hm. So now I'm now more optimistic about breaking step 2 into substeps, but (a) they're not necessarily more parseable, and (b) it's not trivial.

[10:56:19.0775] <shu>
so for the week of july 7, we need a new time on either monday or friday

[10:56:26.0256] <shu>
my tue-thu literally have no free time

[10:57:03.0777] <shu>
Michael Ficarra: bakkot slots that work for you?

[10:57:46.0982] <bakkot>
after noon either day is currently free

[10:57:51.0491] <bakkot>
* after noon either day is currently free for me

[11:04:36.0577] <jmdyck>
Michael Ficarra: will there be videos of PLSS talks?

[14:34:11.0035] <bakkot>
jmdyck: https://www.youtube.com/live/r4imci31ntw?t=12168s

[14:34:14.0805] <bakkot>
unless you meant something else

[14:39:37.0646] <jmdyck>
That's PLDI, I was asking about PLSS this Friday. Some overlap in talks though.

[14:39:59.0648] <bakkot>
oh, sorry, I stopped reading after the first two letters apparently

[14:40:06.0239] <jmdyck>
heh

[14:43:28.0684] <jmdyck>
or I guess more specifically it was RPLS @ PLDI (vs PLSS @ ECOOP)

[14:48:02.0321] <Michael Ficarra>
I was asked for permission to record, so I guess that implies they will be recorded

[14:48:29.0315] <Michael Ficarra>
though my talk and Jihyeok's talk should be the same as RPLS

[14:48:50.0456] <Michael Ficarra>
or at least very very close

[14:49:26.0045] <jmdyck>
cool, thx

[14:52:39.0732] <Michael Ficarra>
you're gonna have to do before noon if we want to include Linus from now on (or move East)

[14:52:59.0023] <Michael Ficarra>
how about 11:30A Mountain?

[14:54:10.0886] <bakkot>
I was assuming we were just talking about the week of July 7

[14:54:24.0705] <bakkot>
not a permanent slot

[15:34:09.0139] <shu>
think about a permanent slot too

[15:34:26.0002] <shu>
my tue-thu are completely full for the foreseeable future
