@shuyuguo:matrix.org esmeta is failing for https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3287

[15:27:44.0640] <Michael Ficarra>
you'll need to add `OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor` to `esmeta-ignore.json`

[15:28:05.0449] <Michael Ficarra>
also please approve https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3414

@ljharb:matrix.org can you get to these when you get a chance? https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22ready+to+merge%22

[15:18:06.0631] <ljharb>
already been on it, but the first one i landed hadn’t signed the form, so I’m giving him a day or two to do that. if not, I’ll mark him as skipped and proceed

[15:50:09.0182] <Michael Ficarra>
@ljharb:matrix.org I think that's already done? CI is passing on both PRs

[15:50:49.0073] <ljharb>
awesome, i see that. will take care of the rest this afternoon (it’s early morning for me rn)

i'm gonna sneak in a Meta: commit to the PR i'm about to land to fix the IPR script; some previous contrib deleted their github

https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2721 has been stage 4 since april. Michael Ficarra I'd like to request prioritizing landing this. it's can't just hang out as a PR forever.

[03:48:34.0961] <Michael Ficarra>
k I'll bump it to the top of my queue for when I get back

oof. i think GHA's default ubuntu image stopped shipping with sbt (breaking esmeta) and nvm (breaking the rest of 262's workflows)

k, i unshifted a Meta commit onto the promise.try PR which should fix the issue by pinning to ubuntu 22

[17:53:03.0708] <ljharb>
ok, so now all the jobs that aren't "pull_request_target" (which pull from main, not the PR) are passing. are yall comfortable with me merging anyways, with the assumption that main will pass once merged?

[18:46:45.0846] <bakkot>
seems fine

[18:49:43.0502] <Michael Ficarra>
sure

changed my mind on pluralizing `[[UnderlyingIterators]]`

[13:23:37.0841] <bakkot>
it's not just the name of the slot, it's what it stores

[13:23:46.0587] <bakkot>
currently it's just a single value

[13:23:57.0108] <bakkot>
making it into a list, when it can only have one thing in it (for the moment) is a ibgger change

[13:24:16.0706] <bakkot>
so now I'm with shu in thinking we should wait until we need it to be plural

[16:17:09.0657] <bakkot>
looks like the IPR check script is acting up again

[16:19:21.0646] <bakkot>
... CI should probably be defensive against people renaming their accounts, if possible

[16:19:46.0068] <bakkot>
like can we just commit a list of account names -> ids, or something?

[16:21:49.0125] <ljharb>
i just pushed up a commit to fix that for this specific dude

[16:22:10.0463] <ljharb>
the problem is that the github form has a username, and not an ID

[16:22:52.0333] <ljharb>
and the check needs to run on a PR whose commit ID will change

[16:23:45.0637] <ljharb>
so i suppose what i'd have to do is make a cron job that scrapes the google sheet, and converts that to a file that caches the account ID, and commit that to a branch; and then the IPR check can use the cache file instead of the google sheet to check who's signed?

[16:32:37.0014] <Michael Ficarra>
why not just ask them to input their ID in the form instead?

[16:33:00.0998] <Michael Ficarra>
that took all of 5 seconds


2024-10-18
[20:42:45.0542] <ljharb>
because most people can't find their ID, and because historical data is the username, and changing a username is very rare

[20:43:30.0893] <ljharb>
the goal is to make it easy to contribute, not to make it easy for us to check contributions, altho both are obviously related

[07:32:09.0332] <bakkot>
I would guess that you can do this by adding some scripting to the google form, rather than needing a cron job

[07:51:25.0354] <ljharb>
i don’t have access to the full sheet, only the usernames read only. but that may still be a route

Michael Ficarra: bakkot i am at OOPSLA this wednesday for a panel, won't be at the editor call

[10:03:33.0442] <Michael Ficarra>
k

[11:22:44.0822] <jmdyck>
Since 3395 was merged, should I raise https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3395#pullrequestreview-2380526947 as a new issue, or does it have an easy answer?
