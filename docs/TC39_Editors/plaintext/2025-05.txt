Michael Ficarra: bakkot i've invited NicoloÌ€ to some future editor call to brainstorm ideas to make the module machinery editorially easier to understand

[09:28:00.0269] <bakkot>
great

[09:28:34.0510] <Michael Ficarra>
awesome

[14:05:29.0312] <Michael Ficarra>
new editorial convention just dropped:
> do not use determiners or pronouns to refer to values from other steps (e.g. "that number"); instead uses aliases or repetition

[14:19:38.0811] <shu>
who said that

[14:20:02.0518] <shu>
what's wrong with "that number"

[14:32:29.0397] <Michael Ficarra>
you should assign it to an alias and refer to the alias instead of hand-waving at things from earlier steps

[14:33:15.0015] <Michael Ficarra>
the context of this was a PR that referred to a Unicode data file in one step and then hand-waved a reference to "that line" from the file in the next step

[14:33:55.0440] <Michael Ficarra>
also added:
> assertion steps should not be necessary to understand an algorithm; a reader should interpret it the same if they are removed

[14:34:10.0847] <Michael Ficarra>
inspired by the same line, since the "prior step" there was actually an assertion step

[14:34:16.0638] <shu>
sometimes it is clear from context, sometimes it is not

[14:34:56.0765] <Michael Ficarra>
I can drop the convention for now or leave it in until we can discuss at editor call

[14:35:05.0432] <Michael Ficarra>
I added it because I thought it would be uncontroversial

[14:38:38.0739] <Michael Ficarra>
I would also like to add another one:
> do not include unnecessary demonstrative determiners (`the String _v_` when `v` is already a String) or use demonstrative determiners as a hand-wavey way to perform a conversion

@shuyuguo:matrix.org here was the specific line btw: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3587/files/37ad780a824f42495276961ee32bcc2ce6c3241b#diff-181371b08d71216599b0acccbaabd03c306da6de142ea6275c2135810999805aR38582
