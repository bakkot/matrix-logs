Of the last 100 PRs to be merged, 40 occasioned some change in ecmaspeak. (Not all changes involve an addition to the pseudocode grammar, but I'm guessing most of them.)

jmdyck: If you have the time, can you update https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2902? It is the only thing holding up https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2901.

[09:08:55.0863] <Michael Ficarra>
If you don't have time, let us know and we can apply the changes.
