I have mixed feelings about community translations

[08:05:54.0709] <Michael Ficarra>
on one hand, it's great that it makes it easier and more accessible for some people

[08:06:12.0358] <Michael Ficarra>
but on the other hand, it's bound to quickly become out of date

[08:06:56.0493] <Michael Ficarra>
and we can't officially endorse it if we can't verify the translation is correct and intent-preserving (among other reasons)

[08:07:42.0223] <Michael Ficarra>
also I'm not sure if they're technically legal?

I don't know how copyright works for this sorta thing
