is it weird to anyone else that https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-property-descriptor-specification-type says that an empty Record is a Property Descriptor?

[19:33:45.0104] <bakkot>
it is, though

[19:33:55.0823] <bakkot>
that's so `Object.defineProperty(foo, 'bar', {})` works

[23:32:26.0900] <ljharb>
i mean i get that an empty object has to work in a number of places. but since `{ enumerable: true }` isn't a property descriptor record either (that'd be `{ [[Enumerable]]: true }`) i'm not sure why an empty record needs to be one

[09:24:55.0943] <bakkot>
if you look at how `Object.defineProperty` works it basically mechanically converts the object into a spec record by copying over each of the relevant fields https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-data-types-and-values.html#sec-topropertydescriptor

[09:26:08.0934] <bakkot>
and then passing it to definePropertyOrThrow which switches on presence of various fields
