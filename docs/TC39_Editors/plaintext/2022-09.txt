Michael Ficarra: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2879 is a nontrivial rebase, if you'd mind doing it

[13:17:12.0169] <Michael Ficarra>
ljharb: k

[13:19:47.0051] <Michael Ficarra>
ljharb: done

[16:01:43.0150] <shu>
i just noticed that the "official" mirror at https://262.ecma-international.org/ doesn't mirror `multipage/`

[16:01:51.0660] <shu>
so pressing multipage 404s

[16:02:03.0919] <shu>
not sure who controls that, we should complain to istvan at plenary during the 262 update

@ljharb (or anyone): Is there discussion somewhere about "the mess that is \[\[Call\]\] vs \[\[Construct\]\]"?

[18:11:16.0477] <ljharb>
nothing likely in writing

[18:11:54.0583] <ljharb>
basically imo, instead of having a Call that throws, classes etc should have omitted call entirely, and typeof should have returned function for either Call or Construct

[16:29:14.0551] <jmdyck>
Should there be a user-accessible way, other than defining a class, to declare a construct-only function?

[21:18:58.0758] <ljharb>
i don't see the need for it

[21:20:15.0737] <ljharb>
`class` *is* the only way anyone should make anything that uses `new`

it's possible my headset will die during the editor update slides, so shu or Michael Ficarra could you be ready to take over? I will give it a go but may suddenly vanish

[18:24:29.0540] <Michael Ficarra>
sure

[18:25:02.0026] <shu>
also yes but michael gets to do it because he answered first

[18:25:30.0973] <Michael Ficarra>
shu: you can be second backup in case I also get disconnected

[18:26:11.0181] <Michael Ficarra>
I have no idea what you wanted to say about SearchFox bakkot 

[18:26:21.0232] <shu>
i think it was "it exists, did you know"

[18:26:27.0346] <shu>
the fact that ecma262 is indexed on it

[18:26:56.0178] <bakkot>
yup

[18:27:06.0883] <bakkot>
second slide has the link to it

[18:27:22.0338] <bakkot>
or rather tells you where to find the link
