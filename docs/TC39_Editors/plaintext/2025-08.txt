PR #3666 un-defined 4 table-* ids, BTW.

[17:52:09.0590] <Michael Ficarra>

jmdyck ping for meeting in case you wanted to attend

[13:12:02.0780] <jmdyck>
Thanks for the ping. Once again, completely forgot about it.

[13:13:07.0725] <jmdyck>

@ljharb:matrix.org I'm still seeing the editor call at our old Wednesday timeslot on the calendar

[10:34:27.0234] <Michael Ficarra>
if it's not just me, can you move it to our new timeslot of noon Pacific on Mondays?

[15:02:55.0183] <ljharb>
whoops, sorry about that. sure

[15:15:09.0379] <ljharb>
should be done

thanks

[15:35:06.0287] <jmdyck>
In 3655, "a boolean" should be "a Boolean". (Don't have time to submit a comment.)

[16:14:22.0633] <Michael Ficarra>
added a comment for you

hmm I'm not sure our decision on #2942 works

[13:30:23.0135] <Michael Ficarra>
if all async built-in function objects are built-in function objects, then wouldn't this line permit creating an async built-in function object? https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2942/files#diff-181371b08d71216599b0acccbaabd03c306da6de142ea6275c2135810999805aR13965
