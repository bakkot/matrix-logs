is https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3176 ready to merge?

[07:29:16.0088] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah, should be

[07:29:43.0338] <Michael Ficarra>
https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3179 should be good now too, right?

[08:37:00.0893] <ljharb>
both good, both landed. i've asked the author of the latter to add their commit email to their github account, after which the IPR check will be passing again (not sure why it didn't fail on the PR since i explicitly check for this; it's on my list to investigate)

I can't make editor call today due to being on a plane

[12:42:55.0040] <Michael Ficarra>
can't afford airplane wifi on F5 salaries ðŸ˜ž

[12:43:20.0661] <ljharb>
oof

[12:43:23.0878] <ljharb>
any thoughts on https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3238 ?

[12:43:51.0702] <ljharb>
that's the only thing on the label that isn't identity stuff

[12:43:53.0010] <Michael Ficarra>
I added editor call label to it

[12:43:55.0213] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm fine with it

[12:44:04.0846] <ljharb>
oh i meant from kevin since he won't be on the call

[12:44:09.0752] <Michael Ficarra>
ohhh

[13:32:37.0347] <shu>
how much can airplane wifi be, $80?

[14:36:48.0263] <bakkot>
turns out that the flight is delayed but I don't really want to take a call sitting here in the airport

[14:38:13.0992] <Michael Ficarra>

writing up the spec for base64 and I really want to use break/continue

[10:13:22.0442] <bakkot>
what if we defined those

[10:13:57.0741] <bakkot>
the alternative is "repeat, while done is false" and then a great deal of nesting

[10:18:37.0654] <Michael Ficarra>
we have early returns, so you could technically use that

[10:21:03.0933] <Michael Ficarra>
also, that reminds me that I wanted to clarify that early returns do, in fact, skip steps that follow

[10:51:42.0391] <ljharb>
a separate AO with early returns seems nice

[10:51:52.0513] <ljharb>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> also, that reminds me that I wanted to clarify that early returns do, in fact, skip steps that follow

â€¦ how would anyone assume otherwise?

[10:55:19.0984] <Michael Ficarra>
in some (older) programming languages, you could just set a return value at any point in the program (or multiple points) and continue execution

[10:56:19.0972] <Michael Ficarra>
there's no reason to believe that someone reading the spec steps should assume "return" also means "and stop executing further steps"

[10:56:36.0466] <Michael Ficarra>
it could reasonably be understood to mean "set the return value to this"

[10:56:51.0996] <Michael Ficarra>
 * in some (older) programming languages, you could just set a return value at any point in the function (or multiple points) and continue execution

[10:56:59.0127] <shu>
i think you're confusing setting the return value to a statement saying, control is returned

[10:57:21.0772] <shu>
the older PLs separated the two, but i don't know of any PL that has something that says "return" but doesn't return control

[10:57:55.0895] <shu>
 * i think you're confusing setting the return value with a statement saying, control is returned

[10:58:14.0045] <bakkot>
restructuring flow to use early returns instead of break/continue can make it worse

[10:58:38.0061] <bakkot>
in this case there is a fair bit of state which would need to be passed into the continuation AO

[10:59:25.0636] <bakkot>
also that doesn't work for continue unless we replace the whole loop with recursion, which would also be worse

[11:04:42.0912] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> the older PLs separated the two, but i don't know of any PL that has something that says "return" but doesn't return control

that's fair, I don't know of any that used the keyword "return" for this
