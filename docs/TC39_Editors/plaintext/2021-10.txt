what i want is to use `let` even for bindings i don't re-assign!

[12:32:10.0584] <bakkot>
yeah, I also hate that rule

[12:32:26.0408] <bakkot>
I think it predates my maintainership

[12:40:14.0044] <bakkot>
oh, no, it's because of typescript

[12:40:31.0687] <bakkot>
typescript, for some reason, has better type inference when using `const`

[12:41:06.0418] <bakkot>
this seems silly to me, since a whole program analysis should be perfectly capable of noticing that a `let`-bound variable is never reassigned and then treating it exactly like `const`

[12:41:09.0238] <bakkot>
but that's the justification

[12:41:35.0027] <shu>
that is strange

[12:41:39.0879] <shu>
the TS inference thing, i mean

[09:15:54.0847] <ljharb>
that rule is the best, let sucks, but I agree it’s ridiculous that if affects type inference whatsoever

[08:28:08.0042] <shu>
let does suck, but so does const!

[08:28:09.0670] <shu>
var forever

[10:54:37.0610] <ljharb>
should probably say that in comic sans tbh

[15:23:47.0803] <Michael Ficarra>
you use var? I just put everything on Object.prototype

[15:51:47.0137] <shu>
i use var because fast

[15:52:08.0813] <shu>
gonna propose to rename `var` to `vroom`

[16:47:02.0007] <bakkot>
shu: ecmarkup PR lgtm; do you want me to cut a release now, or do you want to wait until the ecma262 PR is up in case you discover changes you want to make during that process?

[16:50:31.0913] <shu>
nah let's just land it and iterate/bugfix as we work on adding the annotation in ecma262

[16:50:38.0520] <bakkot>
wfm

[16:50:45.0520] <shu>
just fingers crossed it doesn't require a new approach!

[16:52:31.0373] <shu>
bakkot: you applied your own suggestion, right?

[16:53:26.0976] <bakkot>
yup

[16:53:30.0804] <bakkot>
and pushed up the formatting

[16:53:57.0639] <shu>
great, thanks

I forgot to mention I'm out for a week starting tomorrow

[13:14:39.0494] <bakkot>
y'all will need to make a different meeting for the editor call

[13:42:59.0670] <shu>
thanks for the heads up i'll edit the meeting

[13:45:10.0833] <shu>
enjoy your vacation

shu: you're marked "no" on the event btw

[14:15:47.0304] <shu>
i see that

[14:15:52.0849] <shu>
i also cannot change it for some reason, but i can edit the event

[14:16:00.0716] <shu>
(i am planning on attending, and updated the Meet link)

[14:16:07.0724] <ljharb>
weird, and cool thanks

[14:16:58.0424] <shu>
i have the same event copied over to my personal calendar for the popup reminder

[14:17:10.0856] <shu>
i wonder if calendar is seeing there's a conflict and then auto-marking me as no

[14:17:44.0142] <ljharb>
oh yeah probably so

[14:17:58.0549] <ljharb>
i have that feature turned off

[14:18:46.0801] <shu>
no, that's not it

[14:18:50.0025] <shu>
i have no idea

[14:19:01.0787] <shu>
let me remove myself?

[14:19:57.0174] <ljharb>
now you're a maybe

[14:20:49.0658] <shu>
i think that worked

[14:21:02.0816] <ljharb>
LGTM

[14:21:10.0850] <ljharb>

ok, meaning richard's comment

[13:30:33.0723] <shu>
another npm noob question: when i ran `npm install` in ecma262, it basically rewrote package-lock.json from version 1 to version 2

[13:30:47.0040] <shu>
i'm guessing i shouldn't actually commit that? am i supposed to run it with some flags? am i using the wrong version of npm?

[13:37:54.0573] <shu>
ljharb: ^

[13:47:16.0178] <bakkot>
shu: yeah, that means you are npm 7 rather than npm 6

[13:47:19.0117] <bakkot>
it doesn't much matter though

[13:47:22.0302] <ljharb>
that's fine, npm 8 is out now too

[14:33:43.0439] <shu>
thanks

[15:00:20.0899] <Michael Ficarra>
eww, check out https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-stringtobigint

[15:00:35.0912] <Michael Ficarra>
why did we ever think it was acceptable to specify things that way?

[15:02:42.0980] <jmdyck>
expediency, probably.

[15:02:47.0852] <Michael Ficarra>
also, it returns a BigInt or NaN, which is very weird

[15:03:11.0718] <Michael Ficarra>
jmdyck: it seems like they wanted to save space or something

[15:03:16.0989] <ljharb>
expediency and also bigint was a massive spec, so it probably didn't get a thorough enough review. that seems to be a pattern in large proposals - it's easy to miss issues

[15:03:23.0181] <ljharb>

[15:03:55.0122] <Michael Ficarra>
agree ljharb, the bigger the review, the more weird stuff slips in

[15:04:33.0856] <Michael Ficarra>
in big reviews, it's easier to spot little local issues than big oddities

[15:06:59.0205] <bakkot>
it wouldn't even be that hard to factor out a "string to MV" AO and then use it in both places

[15:07:23.0336] <bakkot>
we already have such an AO but not over this grammar, I guess

[15:08:09.0894] <Michael Ficarra>
bakkot:  PRs welcome

[15:09:21.0621] <jmdyck>
In my notes, I've got some steps. I'd have to check them over.

[15:12:08.0444] <shu>
okay, a first draft of can-call-user-code at https://ci.tc39.es/preview/tc39/ecma262/sha/a5ba1ae3a48e8cffb1e6051bc97dceace591af20/

[15:12:08.0488] <jmdyck>
I'll probably have time this weekend.

[15:12:19.0197] <shu>
press 'u' to toggle the 'UC' annotation on AO links

[15:12:34.0468] <shu>
play around, it's probably way too conservative and we need a bunch of manual supprsesions

[15:13:25.0187] <shu>
somewhat expectedly and unfortunately, everything can call user code

[15:15:23.0018] <ljharb>
the "u" stuff is verryyyyyy slow to respond

[15:15:35.0545] <ljharb>
how are you changing the visibility?

[15:15:46.0565] <ljharb>
the way i'd assume is fastest is a single css class applied or removed to `html` or `body`, and have that class change something that doesn't case a reflow

[15:16:12.0387] <ljharb>
 * the way i'd assume is fastest is a single css class applied or removed to `html` or `body`, and have that class change something that doesn't case a reflow

[15:16:36.0663] <ljharb>
so, i don't see an annotation on https://ci.tc39.es/preview/tc39/ecma262/sha/a5ba1ae3a48e8cffb1e6051bc97dceace591af20/#sec-isregexp even tho it contains a step that has one - is that expected?

[15:16:54.0203] <ljharb>
it'd also be super useful to show the AO-level annotation in the TOC on the left pane, as well

[15:17:44.0570] <shu>
it is a terrible hack

[15:17:55.0234] <shu>
look at the "e-user-code" class

[15:18:04.0863] <shu>
it has a `::before` that has the 'UC'

[15:18:39.0026] <shu>
however, since i can't directly toggle `::before` visibility, i have a big of JS that injects a `<style>` tag with `.e-user-code::before { display: block !important }` when you press `u`

[15:18:47.0712] <shu>
we definitely should not ship with this

[15:18:48.0009] <ljharb>
why can't you?

[15:18:58.0503] <shu>
how... do you?

[15:19:12.0942] <shu>
i can't select for it

[15:19:35.0268] <ljharb>
if you have two `::before` blocks they don't control the same content?

[15:19:48.0945] <ljharb>
i haven't messed with native css in awhile

[15:19:49.0393] <shu>
yes, and that's what i do

[15:19:56.0043] <shu>
with that style injection hack

[15:20:09.0212] <shu>
but that's probably why it's so slow

[15:20:46.0604] <shu>
 * but that's probably why it's so slow

[15:21:29.0888] <ljharb>
gotcha

[15:21:52.0212] <ljharb>
i wonder if it'd be faster tho to have the styles be always there

[15:22:38.0611] <ljharb>
like
```
e-user-code::before {
  /* whatever */
  opacity: 0;
}
html.showUC e-user-code::before {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

[15:22:57.0511] <shu>
oh maybe, patches welcome?

[15:23:00.0273] <ljharb>
opacity as opposed to display, so that the document doesn't have to reflow, because the UC content will always be there

[15:23:06.0639] <shu>
anyway i don't think we should do any optimization work here until we hash out how we actually want to render these

[15:23:10.0948] <ljharb>
fair enough

[15:23:33.0138] <shu>
just needed _something_ to debug and see the false positives

[15:23:38.0468] <ljharb>
right

[15:23:44.0266] <shu>
most of the false positives i've seen so far are of the integer coercion flavor

[15:23:56.0163] <shu>
where we know something we're coercing is a number we constructed internally or something

[15:28:16.0961] <ljharb>
another is https://ci.tc39.es/preview/tc39/ecma262/sha/a5ba1ae3a48e8cffb1e6051bc97dceace591af20/#sec-createregexpstringiterator which is kind of the same case

[15:28:35.0372] <ljharb>
iow, technically if you called that AO with a user-provided regex, the annotations are correct; but it's only ever called with a spec-fiction-regex, so they're not

[15:28:49.0017] <ljharb>
there's probably a similar case with async iteration

[15:28:57.0143] <Michael Ficarra>
I was expecting a badge more like 

[15:29:40.0824] <shu>
ljharb: awesome, please note them down in a comment :)

[15:30:10.0143] <shu>
Michael Ficarra: that would reflow, right? would be slower for sure

[15:30:13.0692] <shu>
visually wfm

[15:30:14.0046] <Michael Ficarra>
oops, simplified should be small-caps

[15:30:26.0130] <Michael Ficarra>
it would reflow, but I'm not all that against reflow

[15:30:46.0873] <shu>
yeah, we can discuss rendering at the next call or after the next plenary

[15:31:02.0485] <shu>
i have very little opinion here other than that it be nice and clear

[15:31:11.0271] <shu>
i think my only bar is "no low contrast crap"

[15:34:20.0627] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah, well using a class on `<html>` as ljharb suggests should be faster than the current hack of inserting a new stylesheet

[15:34:28.0280] <Michael Ficarra>
I would start there

[15:36:30.0157] <shu>
i wonder if we can farm out the task of finding false positives out to committee delegates... 😈

[15:41:00.0536] <Michael Ficarra>
just merge it, and with enough time ...
