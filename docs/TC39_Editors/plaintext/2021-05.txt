we really need to do the refactoring to get rid of optional AO parameters...

[14:07:12.0343] <shu>
is it blocking you on something?

[14:07:56.0162] <Michael Ficarra>
no I just hate it whenever I see it

[14:08:20.0861] <shu>
i think you just volunteered doing it then :)

[14:10:22.0378] <bakkot>
I started looking into it and it seemed like it would be ugly so I stopped

[14:10:28.0124] <bakkot>
optional parameters are kinda nice tbh

[14:10:47.0153] <Michael Ficarra>
oh I 100% do, I just need to not spend 100% of my editorial time doing PR reviews

[14:11:48.0454] <Michael Ficarra>
bakkot: were you duplicating the AO body or forwarding a default value to the AO with the longer parameter list?

[14:40:44.0666] <bakkot>
Michael Ficarra: I was just adding the default value at all callsites

[14:41:14.0103] <Michael Ficarra>
oh, yeah, depending on how many call sites there are, that makes sense too

[15:03:34.0348] <Michael Ficarra>
did we decide to allow "built-in generator function"s for the iterator helpers proposal?

FYI, it looks like this: https://tc39.es/proposal-iterator-helpers/#sec-iteratorprototype.map
