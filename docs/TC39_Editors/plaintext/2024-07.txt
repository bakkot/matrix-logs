i assume yall don't mind if i push up a Meta commit that only changes scripts/check-form.js?

[13:48:22.0707] <ljharb>
if you do, i can make a PR, just takes longer

[14:13:50.0371] <Michael Ficarra>
unless there's a better reason than speed, I prefer everything go through PR to 262

[14:19:39.0685] <shu>
btw i am PTO rest of the week

[14:21:42.0027] <ljharb>
sounds good, Iâ€™ll make a PR tonight or tomorrow
