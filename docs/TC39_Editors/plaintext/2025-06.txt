Is there an editor call this week? Sounded like Michael Ficarra and shu wouldn't be attending.

[19:44:01.0892] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm gonna say no

[19:44:11.0753] <jmdyck>
ditto next week?

[19:45:33.0520] <Michael Ficarra>
that one's up to the others

[20:02:25.0059] <shu>
i'll be out this week for sure, next week also likely since it'll be first week at new job

[20:02:54.0529] <shu>
i think it's a good bet to cancel call for this week and next

[20:08:43.0279] <bakkot>
yeah let's skip this and next

[20:09:04.0425] <jmdyck>

Michael Ficarra: re https://github.com/es-meta/esmeta/issues/287: FYI, ecmaspeak-py generates a report like that.

[07:51:55.0425] <shu>
Michael Ficarra: bakkot things don't look good for my free time for next week either. i'll try to find some time the first week of july for us to chat

I mostly care specifically about the phrases as esmeta understands them. But I'd also like to see ecmaspeak-py's output. How do I invoke it to get that output?

[22:12:26.0520] <Michael Ficarra>
second week of July, I'm at ECOOP the first week

[04:45:02.0186] <jmdyck>
`analyze_spec.py _output spec.html` will generate many files (all in `_output/`), and `_output/pseudocode_prod_counts` is the file in question.
