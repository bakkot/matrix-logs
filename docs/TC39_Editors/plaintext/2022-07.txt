will be working on the PR to actually integrate it into the spec and explain its implications tomorrow morning

[13:17:51.0424] <ljharb>
i'll be about 20 minutes late to the editor call today

[16:36:05.0329] <shu>

[16:36:09.0395] <shu>
what the hell is this

ljharb: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2810 is ready whenever you get around to it

[19:48:27.0443] <bakkot>
should land as two commits

[20:46:50.0092] <ljharb>
huh, what achievements

[08:16:21.0844] <shu>
ljharb: on the profile page, left hand side, i see Achievements

[08:26:45.0741] <shu>
not a fan

[09:09:28.0064] <ljharb>
interesting

[09:14:18.0221] <ljharb>
oh they've had some of them for awhile - the arctic vault one eg

[12:48:08.0997] <shu>
allen, bless his heart

[13:40:17.0908] <ljharb>
what now?

[13:41:14.0007] <shu>
his description of his journey in producing the pdf copies of the specs in the email thread from istvan

[13:42:05.0153] <jmdyck>
members only, i'm guessing.

[13:42:17.0212] <shu>
i'm actually not sure who gets those emails

[13:42:25.0480] <shu>
ecma's email infrastructure is mysterious

[13:42:43.0538] <shu>
and mostly non-functional, which is why we use github issues now

[13:44:45.0612] <ljharb>
ah i'm no longer on that thread, i suspect, because it was sent to my coinbase email

[13:44:58.0804] <ljharb>
feel free to cc in my gmail if you're willing :-)

[13:47:24.0184] <shu>
forwarded

[15:57:45.0728] <ljharb>
bakkot: just filed https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/issues/468, if you're feeling ambitious :-) trying to crank out some spec text before tommorrow's deadline

bakkot: is there any chance that SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is being treated as a Date by ecmarkup and not a Date.UTC?

[21:32:49.0403] <ljharb>
because like, rn it's 7/12, but in UTC it's 7/13. just stabbing in the dark

[21:41:35.0369] <bakkot>
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is a number of seconds since the epoch, which is not a quantity which depends on the timezone, but afaict the render should use UTC, not the local timezone

[21:45:09.0976] <bakkot>
so yes if you render it right now, based on a SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH from within the last few hours, it should render as 7/13

[15:39:34.0042] <Michael Ficarra>
my graduate research advisor was a logician, so a lot of that terminology has been deeply ingrained in me

[15:53:13.0512] <shu>
audience consideration is important

bakkot: does bakkot transcribe bot work with Google Meet?

[16:09:04.0491] <shu>
the AV setup of the conference room we have booked doesn't allow us to easily hook Jitsi into the room's AV hardware, so we're going to be using Meet


2022-07-16
[17:06:53.0967] <bakkot>
yes

[17:06:58.0196] <bakkot>
it works with anything

[17:07:02.0803] <bakkot>
I just need to bring a second laptop

[17:07:36.0565] <bakkot>
i just route the entire computer's audio output back to its audio input and transcribe its audio input
