https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2683 is rebased and just needs stamps now

[20:52:57.0424] <bakkot>
syg: I made you an issue https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/3320

[21:03:48.0911] <bakkot>
(I would do it myself but I can't actually figure out what the definitions of those terms is supposed to be)

[08:37:47.0974] <shu>
got it, will take care of it

[07:41:25.0421] <bakkot>
I am going to close https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3322 unless anyone particularly wants this change

[08:57:01.0826] <shu>
+1

[08:57:09.0238] <shu>
bakkot: i don't get the build failure on https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/actions/runs/8977191619/job/24655470100?pr=3321 locally, ideas?

[08:57:51.0886] <bakkot>
shu: that build failure is for the prior commit; addressing my comments fixed it

[08:58:37.0168] <shu>
ah doh

[08:58:40.0167] <shu>
i didn't reload the tab

[08:58:52.0699] <shu>
new commits show up with reload but i guess the checks don't get updated

[09:01:01.0118] <bakkot>
yup

[09:01:13.0522] <bakkot>
which is a bit silly but oh well

[13:19:56.0387] <jmdyck>
Given 3322, we should maybe have a sentence saying that function summaries are (in general) incomplete / imprecise / non-normative.

[16:30:10.0785] <Michael Ficarra>
they are normative and correct, just not complete, which I think most people would intuitively understand

i'm going to be migrating the tc39 CI stuff (deploy preview, primarily) to a different AWS setup (along with the Begin folks). at some point there'll be a few hours downtime, i'll try to ping here beforehand, but if you notice problems please do lmk.

[14:29:47.0821] <shu>
copy, thanks for heads up

DNS impact?

[14:32:20.0608] <ljharb>
it’ll require a dns change to be coordinated with the migration yes, i meant to ping you to ask who’s making those changes now :-)

this PR needs another approval: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3139

[17:05:34.0375] <Michael Ficarra>
it's holding up https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3274

[17:06:12.0614] <Michael Ficarra>
also, I'm gonna add a new "integration point" label for changes that affect our spec integration interface

[17:08:40.0380] <Michael Ficarra>
nvm, I see we already have a "layering" label

[17:08:44.0204] <Michael Ficarra>
there's so many labels!

[11:11:05.0282] <ljharb>
thanks, on it

[11:11:07.0146] <ljharb>
 * thanks, on it now

[11:13:35.0513] <ljharb>
(i switched to esbuild and it doesn't bundle by default; it's fixed now)

we can peg that action to the "v1" or "v2" branches if we want, that'll be safer than "main"

[16:17:32.0786] <bakkot>
shu: do you want to stamp esmeta bumps like https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3325

[16:17:36.0727] <bakkot>
or should we just mark as ready

[16:26:44.0084] <shu>
nope, happy to not stamp
