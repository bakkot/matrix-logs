PromiseResolve has some uses of SameValue which I think could just be "is" https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/control-abstraction-objects.html#sec-promise-resolve

[22:01:04.0359] <jmdyck>
It has one use of SameValue, comparing _xConstructor_ (a language value, probably an Object) with _C_ (definitely an Object). Editorial-Conventions says to use SameValue when comparing objects or unknown language values.

[05:50:32.0453] <Michael Ficarra>
Yep. Not my preference, but it's what we agreed upon.

looks like i have a conflict tomorrow, unlikely to make it

[21:38:46.0345] <shu>
though now that i'm here i took a look at michael's comments. strong strong disagree with michael's preference for "A List [...]" over « »

ljharb ping on landing https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3679

[12:20:58.0014] <ljharb>
ah thanks

[12:23:34.0744] <ljharb>
no approvals?


[12:28:43.0976] <bakkot>
michael looked at it, he just didn't approve because he had a change he wanted to make but we agreed he'd do it in a followup

[12:29:27.0377] <ljharb>
ok - what's the change?

[12:37:23.0865] <bakkot>
https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3679#issuecomment-3206760917

[13:50:54.0065] <bakkot>
updated the base64 PR, slightly different from NRO's suggestion https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3655#discussion_r2350102918


2025-09-16
[19:25:25.0363] <bakkot>
any further comments or shall I stamp it as ready? Michael Ficarra has not technically approved

[19:27:43.0420] <shu>
no further comments form me

[20:09:26.0694] <jmdyck>
I'm finding more stuff re 3655, working on the review

[20:34:42.0166] <Michael Ficarra>
3655 is going to be the most reviewed Stage 4 PR ever

[16:50:33.0676] <jmdyck>
editor call cancelled next week presumably


2025-09-19
[15:47:01.0277] <bakkot>
any further comments on https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3655 or shall I stamp it?
