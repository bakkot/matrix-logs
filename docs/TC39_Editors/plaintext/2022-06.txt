@bakkot: done.

[15:05:16.0310] <bakkot>
jmdyck: thanks! gonna hold off on merging until after this meeting, I think, since we have a few regex proposals up at this meeting and they're written as diffs against the existing spec

[15:05:27.0156] <bakkot>
but will land after that, and get the proposals rebased

[15:45:14.0804] <jmdyck>
ok

anyone care to stamp https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2793? basically just check the preview to confirm the changes to user code for the promise machinery look right

[09:27:00.0660] <shu>
what was changed in 12.1.1 to change the UC propagation?

oops, totally forgot about the meeting.

For a merge-to-main, is it possible for there to be one commit on the main branch, but multiple contributing commits still in the PR? (So that the main branch stays 'uncluttered', but if an archeologist wants to investigate/understand something, the detailed commits + commit messages are still available in the PR.)

in theory, yes - that's what "squash and merge" does. but ljharb has a strong preference for force-pushing the PR branch to have exactly the commits which are going to land, for reasons I am now forgetting.

[17:55:45.0377] <ljharb>
Because the PR ref remains forever, and because if it deserves to be a separate commit in the PR, it deserves to be one in main.

[19:47:21.0281] <jmdyck>
I disagree. I think it's useful to have different levels of commit granularity in main vs PR.

[19:48:07.0239] <jmdyck>
(or at least, different levels of commit granularity available _some_where, and I'm not sure where that would be other than the PR)

[20:20:12.0181] <jmdyck>
Moreover, "deserves" according to whom? *I* determine what deserves to be a separate commit in my PRs. Are you saying that my choices for the PR should determine what constitutes a commit for main? If so, there will be a lot more fine-grained commits in main, which (a) is probably not what the editors want, and (b) is probably not even what I want *in main*.
