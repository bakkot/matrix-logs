jmdyck: thanks! gonna hold off on merging until after this meeting, I think, since we have a few regex proposals up at this meeting and they're written as diffs against the existing spec

[15:05:27.0156] <bakkot>
but will land after that, and get the proposals rebased

[15:45:14.0804] <jmdyck>

anyone care to stamp https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2793? basically just check the preview to confirm the changes to user code for the promise machinery look right
