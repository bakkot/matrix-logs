Commenter access is turned on for anyone with the link, so don't share beyond the room.

Sure, but that's high friction. There's nothing sensitive, I just don't want randos immediately on it.

I'm not sure whether we plan to meet tomorrow, but I will be out of the office on Monday and may not be able to attend.
I have not yet had the time to investigate the ASI issue for extractors nor the cover grammar issues for `is` and `void`, but may be able to start on that later in the week.

we still have a meeting on the calendar, but i'm also not sure what we have to discuss - does anyone have anything they want to be sure to talk about?

[08:05:00.0469] <ljharb>
ok well now the calendar meeting is deleted so i can’t even get to the zoom - did someone do that by accident?

[08:05:27.0982] <ljharb>
also can someone post the link?

[08:08:42.0533] <TabAtkins>
Well shit, I use the calendar to get the link

[08:09:02.0057] <TabAtkins>
Yeah someone just have accidentally deleted it instead of just saying they weren't attending

[08:09:35.0001] <ljharb>
i assume that’s what happened, but it also deleted every copy of the meeting, past and present

[08:09:51.0352] <ljharb>
so i guess we won’t have a meeting today, and if someone can get me the link I’ll restore the event manually

[08:09:59.0224] <TabAtkins>
SABOTAGE

[08:11:11.0046] <dminor>
I'm an owner for the TC39 events, so I can recreate the event.

[08:11:19.0594] <dminor>
Do you want me to make a new Zoom invite at the same time?

[08:11:28.0359] <dminor>
Every second Monday, right?

[08:11:38.0847] <ljharb>
yes, starting 2 weeks from today i guess

[08:11:59.0624] <ljharb>
(i can edit the calendar also, i just don’t have a Mozilla zoom link)

[08:13:38.0857] <dminor>
I've created it, hopefully you can edit as necessary

[08:14:23.0173] <ljharb>
thanks, will do shortly

[08:15:21.0548] <ljharb>
general guidance for everyone tho: just in case, never delete a calendar item, ever, unless you’re the event organizer and you want nobody else to see it. instead click “no” and mentally tune it out :-)

the next meeting is scheduled for Memorial Day, should we skip it?

[15:29:46.0234] <TabAtkins>
Or shift it?

[15:30:05.0039] <TabAtkins>
(I can also attend, if necessary. I'll still be waking up at normal time, as my wife will be going to work as normal.)

[15:34:31.0123] <ljharb>
i'd be fine bumping it a week if others are
