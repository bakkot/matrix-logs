Commenter access is turned on for anyone with the link, so don't share beyond the room.

Sure, but that's high friction. There's nothing sensitive, I just don't want randos immediately on it.

I'm not sure whether we plan to meet tomorrow, but I will be out of the office on Monday and may not be able to attend.
I have not yet had the time to investigate the ASI issue for extractors nor the cover grammar issues for `is` and `void`, but may be able to start on that later in the week.

we still have a meeting on the calendar, but i'm also not sure what we have to discuss - does anyone have anything they want to be sure to talk about?

ok well now the calendar meeting is deleted so i canâ€™t even get to the zoom - did someone do that by accident?
