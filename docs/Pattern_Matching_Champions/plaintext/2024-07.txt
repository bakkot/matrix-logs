there is a discussion about pipeline in a group I'm in

[08:51:56.0872] <Jack Works>
they want the function has the ability to know how they're called, normal function? or pipeline? and they want to have different call other in those two cases:

```js
onClick: xxx(prevent(listener)) |> stop |> yyy,
```

I don't know what exact he want, but someone mentioned `new.target`. The function can be aware of that if they're called like `new f()` or `f()`
