Re: the meeting chat. I don't think any decisions can be made without having all of the champions present.

[09:39:48.0947] <Willian Martins>
Thanks!

And unfortunately I will also miss the *next* meeting two mondays from now, as I will be on a *different* vacation. Sorry that all my absences sync up perfectly with our current meeting cadence.

[12:45:47.0311] <TabAtkins>
(I could do next monday, or *four* mondays from now)

Are we meeting?

[07:58:06.0156] <ljharb>
in 2 minutes, yep

[08:58:18.0417] <Jack Works>
sorry I was hurry on the last train and cannot focus on the chat, do we have any consensus reached this meeting?

I heard the support towards no ${} and likely to adopt extractors. is that correct?

[10:56:49.0384] <ljharb>
no consensus exactly, but things are leaning in that direction i think (array extractors only, possibly)

what happened to iterators?

[18:18:05.0576] <ljharb>
iterators? I just meant not object extractors
