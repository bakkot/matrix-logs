I presented pattern matching to JSCIG and get some feedbacks

[00:40:29.0351] <Jack Works>
Some feedbacks are about the confusions/bugs in the slides, I have commented on the slide.

[00:40:42.0474] <Jack Works>
The rest are about the proposal design, and I think we can do better

[01:03:33.0695] <Jack Works>
other feedbacks are not too formal so I will post it here

[01:04:47.0333] <Jack Works>

Feedback:

```js
when ([ 'go', dir and ('n' or 'e' or 's' or 'w')]):
```

> if I need to write `dir and ('n' or 'e' or 's' or 'w')`, there is no way to extract them out. I have to copy and paste.

Feedback 2: 

Syntax has too much noise in it.

Question: Why a `()` after `when` is required? It's enough to separate LHS and RHS with the `:` we have. (I don't remember why we made that decision so ...)

[01:12:53.0922] <Jack Works>
Feedback 3:

`Symbol.match` and `Symbol.matcher` creates confusion

[01:15:55.0109] <Jack Works>
And the final problem, the current Custom Matcher is too verbose on syntax.

I wish it could be the rbuckton 's unapply form and also bring it to the destructing:

```js
match (val) {
    when (Some(val)): val,
    when (None()): undefined
}
```

And if we have this form, the alternative syntax I proposed in issue #248 will become


```js
match (val) {
    when (NaN): NaN
    default(Magic): console.log("default case with", Magic)
}
```

[01:16:44.0260] <Jack Works>
üôè really want this one, it's much simpler to use

[09:10:41.0752] <ljharb>
Jack Works: we talked about the identifier pattern in a previous meeting that i'm pretty sure you were present for; my last comment on that issue sums it up

[09:11:02.0182] <ljharb>
iow:
```
when ([foo])
```
needs to work, therefore
```
when (foo)
```
must also work

it's not enough imo; the parens are a necessary boundary. container characters aren't noise, they're explicit easy-to-tune-out boundary markers.

But it's already not working in most places.

And when we discussed this, I didn't recall that we have considered the future special identifier pattern like undefined and infinity.

Take that into our consideration, I think the solo identifier pattern should be a syntax error. There are better ways to do it. `default(binding)`. This way is also more clear on visuals. Easier to read. 

[09:18:31.0240] <ljharb>
what do you mean not working in most places?

[09:18:39.0319] <ljharb>
anywhere inside a pattern, a bare identifier is an irrefutable match

[09:18:55.0203] <ljharb>
(undefined and infinity and NaN aren't future patterns, they're part of this proposal)

[09:19:11.0109] <ljharb>
`default(binding)` simply *can not work* for nested matches, like inside an array or object

[09:19:32.0967] <ljharb>
and, because of `if`, you need to be able to do `when (foo) if (condition)`, which the `default()` wouldn't support, because "default with if" would be bizarre

[09:19:56.0724] <ljharb>
we certainly could make `when (foo)` by itself a syntax error - we already will, if it's not the last clause - but i'm not sure what value that would add

[09:20:00.0744] <Jack Works>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> what do you mean not working in most places?

Solo identifier pattern as a syntax error if it does not occur at last. So in most places it's not working.
