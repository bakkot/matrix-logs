We didn't make useful quorum for the meeting, so offline ping: a couple of people wanted to take the gist back to their team to discuss before we made a final yay/nay on updating the proposal in the repo. Does anyone object to moving forward with this?

i've been traveling and haven't really had a chance to fully review the gist; i'll be back on the 10th. maybe we could plan to move forward early next week?

TabAtkins: gist review:
 - `plain-or-dotted-ident` presumably includes brackets and optional things and whatever, the same stuff a decorator allows after `@`?
 - for `<plain-or-dotted-ident>(<matcher-list>)`, what happens if it's a function that does not have a Symbol.matcher property?
 - i really like the desugaring example for `is`, but that falls apart with the bindings bit, and that makes me nervous
 - for bindings in an `if` does it also apply to an `else if` and every other else in the chain?

does the gist already incorporate all the discussion at the bottom of it?

 - there should not be an optin for regex named group bindings, since they're statically mentioned it's not the same as `with`. if someone doesn't want the bindings they just don't have to reference them.

I like the name `Symbol.matcher` and since nobody knows about or uses `Symbol.match` i think it'd be a shame to pick a worse name for our symbol :-(
