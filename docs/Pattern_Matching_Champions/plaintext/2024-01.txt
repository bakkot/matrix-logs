I'm on vacation next week so I won't be around for the meeting.

i'll be there but it's pretty important we all get on the same page, so it may not be worth it if tab won't be there. anyone else have thoughts on keeping or skipping the meeting?

[21:27:55.0027] <Jack Works>
no update since last one

[07:40:17.0394] <rbuckton>
I'm fine with skipping or postponing

[07:53:03.0421] <Jack Works>
I think I'll go sleep now, I'd also prefer skipping or postponing

[08:00:41.0102] <ljharb>
sounds good, i'll cancel it

[12:33:16.0236] <ljharb>
i won't be at the meeting on the 22nd; i'm out of town

[22:34:23.0252] <ljharb>
do we think there's any possibility we'll all be on the same page, and be ready to present, at the next meeting? if so we may want to try to schedule a meeting at a different time so we can be sure everyone shows up

[12:26:21.0641] <TabAtkins>
Okay, I'm back from vacation.

[12:26:43.0903] <TabAtkins>
And yes, I think so, so yeah let's find a time we can do if you're missing next monday.

[12:39:39.0519] <ljharb>
awesome. i can do this week, or next thursday/friday, or the week of the 29th

[15:21:15.0030] <mpcsh>
this week is tough for me, but next thurs / fri should be wide open

FYI, I've started drafting a `void` "discard" binding proposal here: https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-void-binding. The goal is to subsume the previous `using void` part of the resource management proposal into a more general purpose form for specifying "discarded" bindings, as an explicit _Elision_ marker, and for future use as a "discard" pattern for pattern matching. The explainer is very light on details at the moment, I plan to flesh it out over the next few days.

This has now been fully fleshed-out with motivations, example syntax, intended semantics, etc.

Are we rescheduling today's meeting?

[07:17:58.0101] <ljharb>
yes

[07:50:42.0808] <TabAtkins>
I'm be just a few minutes late to the meeting this morning

[07:50:58.0383] <TabAtkins>
Oh nm then

hello, rbuckton will you consider update how customMatchers are written in https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=934F1675ED4C1638%21299428&authkey=!AEyZcVuri5fJLbQ (page 17)? It does not match what pattern matching using now in raw.githack.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching/new-spec/index.html

[20:06:53.0706] <rbuckton>
I'm aware its a bit out of date, I'll fix it tomorrow.

[20:08:54.0967] <Jack Works>
in page 23, I think matching the inner value of a Map/Set is a footgun (when using the current semantic in the pm proposal) because it is ordered match
