[07:57:48.0518] <TabAtkins>
I'm planning on showing up, since we haven't had one in a while.

[07:59:47.0495] <ljharb>
Same - I’ll be a few minutes late but we def need a meeting

do we have meeting today? I'd prefer not showing today but if we're discussing something important I can make it

The current semantics of `InvokeCustomMatcher` don't work well for extractors due to the `SameValueZero` and `SameValueNonNumber` semantics on steps 1 and 3. I would expect that steps 1 and 3 would return `false` when _kind_ is `~list~`, since a `Foo(x)` is invalid if `Foo` isn't a valid matcher since an iterator is expected.

Also, step 10 and 11 say:
> 10. Perform ? GetIteratorCached(_result_, _cacheGroup_).
> 11. Return _result_.

Why are we not returning the iterator here? I was hoping to avoid dragging in all of the caching logic for non-pattern Extractors, but if I want to reuse `InvokeCustomMatcher` it seems like I would need to do so.

We also still need to narrow down whether _receiver_ makes sense, or whether there are other ways to accommodate those cases (i.e., a getter returning a bound function, etc.).

Yes. It's a bug, actually it fails the spec assert "Assert: listSubject is an Object.". In the `~list~` mode, it should throw.

Oh it's another bug, there are some type mismatch here
