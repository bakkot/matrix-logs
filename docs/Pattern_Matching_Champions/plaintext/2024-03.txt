The current semantics of `InvokeCustomMatcher` don't work well for extractors due to the `SameValueZero` and `SameValueNonNumber` semantics on steps 1 and 3. I would expect that steps 1 and 3 would return `false` when _kind_ is `~list~`, since a `Foo(x)` is invalid if `Foo` isn't a valid matcher since an iterator is expected.

Also, step 10 and 11 say:
> 10. Perform ? GetIteratorCached(_result_, _cacheGroup_).
> 11. Return _result_.

Why are we not returning the iterator here? I was hoping to avoid dragging in all of the caching logic for non-pattern Extractors, but if I want to reuse `InvokeCustomMatcher` it seems like I would need to do so.
