do we allow Elision?

[05:10:49.0173] <Jack Works>
`x is [,,,1]` or `x is [void, void, void, 1]`?

[05:11:01.0850] <Jack Works>
I remember we've discussed this before but I cannot recall the decision

[08:44:26.0467] <Jack Works>
are we really allowing `let` leak to the outside of the expression?

[08:44:43.0949] <Jack Works>
this section is nightmare now and I don't know how to get started

[08:45:26.0595] <Jack Works>
for example, `const a = expr is let b` is a thing now, and it can happen arbitrary deep

(I also believe if it really goes like this, engines won't like it)

I think holes should probably match as if they were `void` patterns. (But I could easily be convinced they should be an error.)
