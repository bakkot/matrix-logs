do we allow Elision?

`x is [,,,1]` or `x is [void, void, void, 1]`?

[05:11:01.0850] <Jack Works>
I remember we've discussed this before but I cannot recall the decision

[08:44:26.0467] <Jack Works>
are we really allowing `let` leak to the outside of the expression?

[08:44:43.0949] <Jack Works>
this section is nightmare now and I don't know how to get started

[08:45:26.0595] <Jack Works>
for example, `const a = expr is let b` is a thing now, and it can happen arbitrary deep

[08:49:49.0845] <Jack Works>
> <@jackworks:matrix.org> this section is nightmare now and I don't know how to get started

(I also believe if it really goes like this, engines won't like it)

[13:12:57.0715] <TabAtkins>
> <@jackworks:matrix.org> I remember we've discussed this before but I cannot recall the decision

I think holes should probably match as if they were `void` patterns. (But I could easily be convinced they should be an error.)

[13:16:09.0211] <TabAtkins>
> <@jackworks:matrix.org> for example, `const a = expr is let b` is a thing now, and it can happen arbitrary deep

Yep, that's correct. `b` would be established at the top of the nearest block scope (whether before or after `a` I'm not sure, and I'm not sure if the order matters), and be in TDZ until it was set by the pattern.

[16:54:56.0236] <Jack Works>
I think that requires me to add all production into section 8

try to find some cursed case

[21:42:15.0938] <rbuckton>
I'm not sure that's a helpful exercise. You can find cursed cases of just about any syntax. None of those cases will be likely in practice. 

[02:40:08.0279] <Jack Works>
😭

[11:09:07.0777] <ljharb>
yes, elision is allowed and should simply ignore that item

[11:12:18.0686] <Jack Works>
All the easy part of the spec is done

[11:14:15.0146] <Jack Works>
The rest work:
- Object & Array pattern (not that hard, because I can copy cache semantics from the old spec)
- Extractor pattern (depends on RS of Array pattern)
- Binding pattern (don't know how to do this, so I'll leave it to the last)

[11:41:26.0549] <Jack Works>
oh, I think match expressions need a cover grammar...

[11:43:11.0808] <Jack Works>
I wonder if we can change it to postfix syntax to solve this problem, like expr matches { ... }

https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching/pull/295

This PR is now ready. I have no more things to change before I receive any input. The Scope Analysis is left as a TODO and it won't be in this PR.

I hope README PR can be updated to fit the spec because more details are considered when writing the spec than just considering the normal cases in the README

[08:05:32.0371] <Jack Works>
The last thing I hope to add is private field match, `{ #field: let x }`, I didn't add it and left as an editor note. if we have this we should also have it in destructing.

[08:06:35.0470] <Jack Works>
Also I found `match expression` is not easy to use when I writing examples. `Do expression` or similar semantics is necessary to write code in an ergonomic way.

[08:09:50.0176] <Jack Works>
match expr and match stmt also has a syntax conflict, I think the RHS of a match clause should be like this:

MatchPattern `:` lookahead != `{` Expression `;`
MatchPattern `:` Block `;`

MatchExpression: it is a SyntaxError if Block Contains Return/Break/Continue

i think there should be a separate proposal to add it in destructuring, and then once it lands, both would get it

[10:56:18.0206] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I think that's reasonable.

[10:56:28.0258] <TabAtkins>
No strong reason for us to jump ahead of destructuring here.

problem I found with `is` expr. might be visually confusing

[21:19:29.0802] <Jack Works>
```js
if (expr is x[Symbol.toPrimitive]) {}
```

x[Symbol.toPrimitive] or (expr is x)[Symbol.toPrimitive]?

[21:20:03.0593] <Jack Works>
this is basically a problem for all patterns we have, even adding `( )` does not solve this problem

[21:20:25.0228] <Jack Works>
 * this is basically a problem for all patterns we have, even adding `( )` around pattern does not solve this problem

[21:20:54.0472] <Jack Works>
the only way I see now is to add `( )` around the whole `expr is ...`

[10:59:14.0732] <TabAtkins>
`x[foo]` is a pattern, the grammar should bind that way. If you want to force the other parsing, `(expr is x)[Symbol.toPrimitive]`.

[11:42:36.0220] <Jack Works>
> <@tabatkins:matrix.org> `x[foo]` is a pattern, the grammar should bind that way. If you want to force the other parsing, `(expr is x)[Symbol.toPrimitive]`.

not yet IMO, then let me change another example 

[11:42:51.0356] <Jack Works>
x is a and {}.toString

[11:43:21.0048] <Jack Works>
{}.toString is not a valid pattern, so it means (x is a and {}).toString

[12:25:45.0827] <TabAtkins>
Ah right, yes that's reasonable.

[12:25:58.0610] <TabAtkins>
I mean, it's def confusing, but it's the behavior I'd expect to fall out.

[12:26:42.0897] <rbuckton>
I wouldn't expect that to be valid at all

[12:27:06.0410] <rbuckton>
`is` is not a MemberExpression, so `x is a and {}.toString` would just be a syntax error

[12:27:53.0402] <rbuckton>
Just like `i++.toString()` is also a syntax error

[12:31:35.0539] <rbuckton>
> <@tabatkins:matrix.org> `x[foo]` is a pattern, the grammar should bind that way. If you want to force the other parsing, `(expr is x)[Symbol.toPrimitive]`.

I'm not certain how useful `x[foo]` would be as a pattern, as its arguably *vanishingly* rare that anyone would publish an API that puts an extractor/matcher in a symbol-named property of an object, as that results in a very poor developer experience.

[12:32:09.0802] <TabAtkins>
`x is arr[1]`

[12:32:18.0074] <rbuckton>
`x is { [foo]: let y }` is definitely a valid pattern

[12:32:56.0341] <rbuckton>
> <@tabatkins:matrix.org> `x is arr[1]`

That looks more like someone might have been confused as to how array destructuring works.

[12:33:17.0773] <TabAtkins>
There is no meaningful difference between that and `x is obj.foo`

[12:36:08.0124] <rbuckton>
`obj.foo` does not allow for arbitrary expression evaluation inside of a pattern, while `obj[foo]` does, so there is a meaningful difference.

[12:38:41.0678] <rbuckton>
My point is that the 99%+ use case is going to be `x is obj.foo`, so I'm not sold on how valuable `x is obj[foo]` will be, especially if it adds unnecessary complication to the grammar or semantics.

[12:44:08.0629] <rbuckton>
 * My point is that the 99%+ use case is going to be either `x is foo` or `x is obj.foo`, so I'm not sold on how valuable `x is obj[foo]` will be, especially if it adds unnecessary complication to the grammar or semantics.

`x is obj[foo]` is critically necessary because of symbols

[13:50:29.0693] <rbuckton>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> `x is obj[foo]` is critically necessary because of symbols

I would argue that putting a custom extractor you want to match *against* behind a symbol is a terrible API design.

[13:50:31.0657] <ljharb>
there's a huge "expected usage" difference where it's unlikely people will decorate with a symbol or computed property of an object, but it's very likely they'll want to match against one

[13:50:42.0438] <ljharb>
it doesn't have to be a custom extractor, `is` isn't just for those.

[13:53:47.0619] <rbuckton>
It would still be a poor design choice, to store the think you want to match against behind a symbol, whatever it is. I'm also not saying we *shouldn't* have it, but that if it came down to a choice over whether to have that capability vs almost any other piece of the proposed pattern matching syntax, I would cut indexed access in a pattern first.

[13:53:54.0626] <rbuckton>

[14:05:35.0455] <TabAtkins>
the fact that you can match against something in `foo.bar` implies that you need to be able to match against something in `foo[0]`. Symbols don't even factor into it; this is purely just that JS does not make a meaningful distinction between dot property access and bracket property access, and we shouldn't either.


2023-11-22
[16:19:03.0485] <Jack Works>
yes, match against arr[0] is a legit use case

[16:20:32.0524] <Jack Works>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> `is` is not a MemberExpression, so `x is a and {}.toString` would just be a syntax error

ok...? I do not quite understand how this works, can you explain more? now it is a relational expression, that already makes x is {}. toString illegal?

[16:33:10.0904] <rbuckton>
Yes, if `is` is in RelationalExpression, then `is {}.anything` is illegal

[16:33:53.0924] <rbuckton>
`a in b.c` is legal because the right-hand side of `in` allows MemberExpression. 

[16:35:14.0861] <rbuckton>
`a is pattern` doesn't parse a MemberExpression on the right, it parses a MatchPattern, so it only allows a	`.` if it is specified in syntax

[16:36:51.0770] <Jack Works>
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

[16:37:31.0603] <rbuckton>
We allow `a is b.c` because you've explicitly specified PatternMatchingMemberExpression: https://raw.githack.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching/new-spec/index.html#prod-PatternMatchingMemberExpression

[16:37:39.0879] <Jack Works>
that's interesting, what is legal to follow a relational expression directly?

[16:38:26.0672] <Jack Works>
I want to make sure nothing is visually confusing

[16:57:13.0937] <rbuckton>
there are two ways to think about "to the right":
1. When parsing a _RelationalExpression_, what can be parsed for any given production on the right of a relational operator. For example, in `` RelationalExpression `<` ShiftExpression ``, what kind of things can be parsed if you only look at _ShiftExpression_.
2. When parsing productions top-down, if a production contains a _RelationalExpression_, what kind of things can you parse after the RelationalExpression itself is finished.

For (1), given `A < B`, `B` can be anything that can be parsed in a _ShiftExpression_:
- ShiftExpression: `<<`, `>>`, `>>>` (i.e., `A < B << C` is parsed as `A < (B << C)`)
- AdditiveExpression: `+`, `-` (i.e., `A < B + C` is parsed as `A < (B + C)`)
- MultiplicativeExpression: `*`, `/`, `%` (i.e., `A < B * C` is parsed as `A < (B * C)`)
- UpdateExpression: postfix `++`, `--`
- LeftHandSideExpression/OptionalExpression/MemberExpression/CallExpression: `?.`, `[`, `.`, `` ` ``

For (2), you look at anything that can _contain_ a RelationalExpression on the left of some other terminal/nonterminal:
- RelationalExpression: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `instanceof`, `in` (i.e., in `A < B`, `A` can be a RelationalExpression, so it can be followed by `<`, etc.)
- EqualityExpression: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`
- BitwiseANDExpression: `&`
- BitwiseXORExpression: `^`
- BitwiseORExpression: `|`
- LogicalANDExpression: `&&`
- LogicalORExpression: `||`
- CoalesceExpression: `??`
- ConditionalExpression: `?`, `:`
- AssignmentExpression: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.

- CoalesceExpression: `??`
- ConditionalExpression: `?`, `:`
- AssignmentExpression: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
- Expression: `,`
- Anything that follows where Expression can be used

[17:00:35.0392] <rbuckton>
So in `A < B`, if `B` is just an identifier, the following tokens could legally follow it:
- From (1): `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`, `?.`, `[`, `.`, `(`, `` ` ``
- From (2): `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `&`, `^`, `|`, `&&`, `||`, `??`, `?`, `:`, `=`, `+=` (and other compound ops), `,`, plus anything that can follow _Expression_ in the grammar.

[17:01:34.0267] <rbuckton>
Everything that comes from (1) is only legal because it is specifically part of the grammar defined for _RelationalExpression_. Everything that comes from (2) is legal because some other production defines it as following a _RelationalExpression_.

[17:03:27.0212] <rbuckton>
So for an `is` pattern, you will always contend with (2), but the grammar you supply for MatchPattern will define (1). The caveat, of course, being ASI and how it applies to ambiguous tokens like `+`, `-`, `(`, and `[` that can start a new statement.

[17:04:03.0029] <Jack Works>
thanks, this is very helpful

[17:04:14.0122] <rbuckton>
Since `.` is defined in (1) for a given RelationalExpression, it only really has the meaning we ascribe to it given the syntax we define.

[17:04:44.0156] <Jack Works>
for is expression, the only valid set is from (2)

[17:05:28.0288] <Jack Works>
so, a confusing case (especially for JSX users) will be `x is < y > z ...`

[17:06:40.0208] <rbuckton>
Correct. Per the pattern grammar, `a is b.c` is legal only because we define it as part of PatternMatchingMemberExpression, which limits what can be the starting token to Identifier, `this`, `super`, and a MetaProperty (like `new.target`)

[17:07:05.0047] <Jack Works>
and it is visually confusing, no parse confusing because JSX element is not a pattern

[17:07:59.0011] <rbuckton>
Yes. In regular JS, it would be parsed as `(x is < y) > z` since _RelationalPattern_ can appear on the left. 

[17:10:01.0867] <rbuckton>
JSX has its own set of parsing concerns, given that JSX also looks like valid JS when you consider ASI, and requires either infinite lookahead or a fairly aggressive cover grammar to address:
```js
a
<b>c 
```

[17:11:21.0715] <rbuckton>
That visual confusion can be addressed via linters or limitations on JSX syntax. Also, `x is < y > z` is somewhat meaningless because its rare to compare booleans relationally.

[17:12:13.0081] <Jack Works>
another case I can think of is developers might forgot to add `and` and let it becomes `x is > 10 < 20` (should be `x is > 10 and < 20`), but I think it's not a problem we need to care about

[17:12:26.0050] <rbuckton>
I also wouldn't expect that `x is <y>` would be meaningful in a file that had both JSX and pattern matching, I could never see it as a blessed syntax.

[17:13:16.0374] <rbuckton>
> <@jackworks:matrix.org> another case I can think of is developers might forgot to add `and` and let it becomes `x is > 10 < 20` (should be `x is > 10 and < 20`), but I think it's not a problem we need to care about

This seems like something a type system could catch (i.e., `boolean` and `number` are not comparable)

[17:14:13.0205] <Jack Works>
I think `is` expression is ok now

Fyi, I have a concern with the editors note here: https://raw.githack.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching/new-spec/index.html#prod-MemberExpressionPattern:~:text=All%20productions%20except,can%20be%20removed.

I would argue that `` PatternMatchingMemberExpression `.` IdentifierName `` is also a minimum requirement, otherwise this will not meet my needs for Extractors and ADT enums. I think `?.` could be dropped, as DecoratorMemberExpression does not support it and I'm not even clear on what matching against an optional chain should even mean.

[17:22:04.0725] <Jack Works>

[17:25:11.0425] <rbuckton>
There's a conflicting interpretation that it could mean "if the property isn't present, don't throw *AND* don't match". 

[17:25:31.0749] <rbuckton>
vs "if the property isn't present, don't throw and _match `undefined`"
