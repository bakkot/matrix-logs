do we allow Elision?

[05:10:49.0173] <Jack Works>
`x is [,,,1]` or `x is [void, void, void, 1]`?

[05:11:01.0850] <Jack Works>
I remember we've discussed this before but I cannot recall the decision

[08:44:26.0467] <Jack Works>
are we really allowing `let` leak to the outside of the expression?

[08:44:43.0949] <Jack Works>
this section is nightmare now and I don't know how to get started

[08:45:26.0595] <Jack Works>
for example, `const a = expr is let b` is a thing now, and it can happen arbitrary deep

(I also believe if it really goes like this, engines won't like it)

I think holes should probably match as if they were `void` patterns. (But I could easily be convinced they should be an error.)

Yep, that's correct. `b` would be established at the top of the nearest block scope (whether before or after `a` I'm not sure, and I'm not sure if the order matters), and be in TDZ until it was set by the pattern.

I think that requires me to add all production into section 8

class T extends ((class {} is let x), x) { [1 is let y]() {}, x = ((1 is let z), z) };

const { x = 1 is let y, [(Symbol.iterator is let w, w)]: p } = 1 is let z;

if (false) expr is let x; // if (false) let x = expr // is syntax error

[19:31:53.0379] <Jack Works>
try to find some cursed case

[21:42:15.0938] <rbuckton>
I'm not sure that's a helpful exercise. You can find cursed cases of just about any syntax. None of those cases will be likely in practice.
