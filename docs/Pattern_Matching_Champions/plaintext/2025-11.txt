I still have a strong hope on Pattern Matching, but my status does not allow me to focus on tc39 things, the only tc39 related things I did in the last year is maintaining engine262.

yeah - I’d hoped we’d present this week but we haven’t gotten things together yet. Maybe January

We should probably meet soon to discuss the proposal following TC39 last week, however I won't be available for the regularly scheduled meeting tomorrow. Should we try to get everyone involved on a call on Dec 8th?
