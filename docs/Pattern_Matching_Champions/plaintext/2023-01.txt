hey friends! I'm back today from my inadvertent mental health hiatus. good to see all your pretty faces again 😁

[09:09:17.0696] <mpcsh>
and looks like, mercifully, I don't have all that much to catch up on...?

[09:30:08.0769] <TabAtkins>
Correct. ^_^

[09:31:33.0062] <TabAtkins>
I'm leaning toward presenting at the meeting at the end of this month, but I'll have to do some work to get ready for that - basically synthesizing the convos we've had the last several months.

[09:39:47.0769] <mpcsh>
should we get a champions call on the calendar? 👀

[13:25:15.0474] <ljharb>
that sounds like a good idea

[13:25:30.0339] <ljharb>
tab, want to lmk when would be a safe date to schedule it after?

[14:44:46.0945] <rbuckton>
While not a champion, I'd like to be included if possible. 

[15:06:02.0756] <ljharb>

i'm happy to also join, but i am in a weird place right now and will be a way for a while

[08:15:55.0861] <yulia>
I can't work past 8 pm CET these days so that may make things a bit complicated

[08:47:42.0385] <yulia>

TabAtkins: we've only got 4 days until the deadline to seek stage 2; is that still something we're shooting for this meeting? or would it just be an update presentation?

[22:13:51.0005] <rkirsling>

[08:10:23.0017] <yulia>
are there any plans to meet thus far?

[11:29:58.0892] <ljharb>
nope, seems like we won't be presenting this meeting, but maybe in march?

What's our latest consensus? 

[19:43:21.0431] <ljharb>
we don't have one yet since we haven't met :-)

[20:05:13.0280] <Jack Works>
Then how can we plan to present when we don't have consensus 🤔
