Are we meeting today, or canceling for this week?

I expect some folks may be traveling today.

After 20 minutes, only Richard and Jack showed up and we don't seem to have an agenda, so we're assuming this is canceled.

i totally spaced that we had it; i had to get the kids ready this morning. without a full complement tho there's not much we could get done.
