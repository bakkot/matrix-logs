anyone planning on meeting today? I can, altho I’ll be 10 min late or so

[07:58:22.0454] <rbuckton>
I was planning on joining, although I don't know if we have an agenda. I know TabAtkins was working on slides for plenary a few months ago, but IIRC we haven't presented any updates to plenary in a while.

[08:04:47.0340] <TabAtkins>
Sorry, yeah, no updates today. I know I won't be able to make the next meeting in April, as I'll be on vacation, but does the group want to present regardless? If so, I'll prepare and we can chat in two weeks

[08:06:44.0621] <rbuckton>
Should I assume we are not meeting today then?

[08:12:16.0330] <ljharb>
yes, let’s cancel today

[08:12:41.0562] <ljharb>
and yes tab if you can get us slides asap I’ll be able to present in April

Since Monday is a US holiday, let's pre-emptively cancel

[09:20:58.0539] <ljharb>
it’s also plenary week, and we’re not presenting anything
