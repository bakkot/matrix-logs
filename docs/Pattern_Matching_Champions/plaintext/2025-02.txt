anyone planning on meeting today? I can, altho Iâ€™ll be 10 min late or so

I was planning on joining, although I don't know if we have an agenda. I know TabAtkins was working on slides for plenary a few months ago, but IIRC we haven't presented any updates to plenary in a while.

Sorry, yeah, no updates today. I know I won't be able to make the next meeting in April, as I'll be on vacation, but does the group want to present regardless? If so, I'll prepare and we can chat in two weeks
