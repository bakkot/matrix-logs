If people are available today, I would like to meet briefly to check if we think it's reasonable to present at the next meeting or push to the one after

[07:42:45.0126] <ljharb>
Iâ€™ll be there, a few minutes late. (and i think the one after)

[08:01:16.0409] <rbuckton>
I'll join momentarily

Hiya! I'm planning to submit a proposal at the next plenary for assertions (or the problem it solves), and I think it will have some overlap with pattern matching.

Bringing it up here so it's on your radar and in case you have any comments https://github.com/JakobJingleheimer/proposal-assertions ðŸ™‚

jakobjingleheimer: Hm, I don't immediately see the connection. Enlighten me?

eg `assert.equal(typeof x.foo, 'boolean');` and `match (x) { when { foo: boolean } {} }` are equivalent, aside from error message

[15:51:04.0029] <ljharb>
* eg `assert.equal(typeof x.foo, 'boolean');` and `match (x) { when { foo: boolean }: {} }` are equivalent, aside from error message

[15:51:13.0213] <ljharb>
* eg `assert.equal(typeof x.foo, 'boolean');` and `match (x) { when { foo: boolean }: {} }` are equivalent, aside from error message (ignore any syntax mistakes, it's off the cuff)

[16:31:41.0258] <TabAtkins>
Oh, sure, I guess, but just using a `when` like that just for an assertion isn't really the intended usage. (It won't even give you a very good error message, just the generic "fell off the end" error.) I don't think it really overlaps in practice.
