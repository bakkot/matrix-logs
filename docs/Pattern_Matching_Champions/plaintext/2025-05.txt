If people are available today, I would like to meet briefly to check if we think it's reasonable to present at the next meeting or push to the one after

Hiya! I'm planning to submit a proposal at the next plenary for assertions (or the problem it solves), and I think it will have some overlap with pattern matching.

Bringing it up here so it's on your radar and in case you have any comments https://github.com/JakobJingleheimer/proposal-assertions ðŸ™‚
