[15:30:21.0050] <ljharb>
can we send out a gcal invite for the meeting, which i presume is on monday? if so, can we also add willian to it?

I ended up catching a cold this weekend and underprioritizing sleep is probably how it happened in the first place, so

[23:25:19.0661] <rkirsling>
I think it's best for me to go to bed early and sit this one out

[02:03:49.0225] <yulia>
For sure, I don't think there will be anything ground moving at this meeting, just a chance to catch up and see where everyone's thoughts are at. feel better!

something is weird with my internet

[08:03:10.0519] <TabAtkins>
I guess I'll be a second, this meeting requires me to be signed into Zoom

[10:26:36.0157] <yulia>
should the time be 1 hr later? I created the meeting so i think it is on berlin time but we haven't switched to summer time yet

[10:36:26.0047] <yulia>

TabAtkins: I posted a reply to your comment on #281 (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching/issues/281#issuecomment-1487092535), but think it might be better to go into more detail here. I have some concerns about the the proposed grammar in your gist. Some of it seems unnecessary and it is quite heavy-handed with the use of `when`. 

[08:37:01.0820] <rbuckton>
JS syntax is essentially designed to be read in a way that is a rough approximation of English grammar rules, so a phrase like:
```
if match(when(pattern) = expression) {
}
```
Reads like: "If match when pattern equals expression, then ..."

While:
```
if (expression is pattern) {
}
```
Is far easier to interpret as the English phrase "If expression is pattern, then"

[08:39:11.0234] <TabAtkins>
Yeah I'm drafting a response

[08:40:10.0207] <rbuckton>
`match` works well as an expression form on its own since it also follows English grammar rules:

```
let x = match (expression) {
  when true: doA();
  when false: doB();
};
```
Which can be read as: "Let `x` [be the result of] match[ing] expression.
When [`x` is] `true`, [then] `doA()`.
When [`x` is] `false`, [then] `doB()`.
[Otherwise, throw an error]"

My biggest concern with your proposed syntax is that it isn't very "grok"-able, which was something yulia wanted to make sure we considered.

I explored a number of novel syntax options in https://gist.github.com/rbuckton/df6ade207eecad4fc94cedc3aae79ceb, and the syntax that I favor matches the tenets I laid out in https://gist.github.com/rbuckton/fca8b4ecc4eb16422b01f2557203082b (e.g., concise, expressive, explicit, extensible, and exhaustive).

I proposed `is` expressions because they are concise and compose well with existing syntactic constructs like `if`, `do-while`, `while`, `for`, conditional expressions, `yield`, `await`, arrow functions, and logical operations.

I like `match` expressions because they push developers towards exhaustive matching, and are an improvement both over `switch` (with all of its failings), and conditional expressions (as `match` removes the need to cache the head expression).

I very much favor minimal, yet expressive pattern syntax, such as:
- Literal constant patterns (i.e., `0`, `null`, `"hello"`, etc.)
- Object and array patterns (i.e., `{ x: 10, y: 20 }`, `[10, 20]`, etc.)
- Qualified name patterns for custom matchers (i.e., `String`, `Point`, `Option.Some`, etc.)
- Extractors for nested matching in custom matchers (i.e., `Point({ x: 10, y: 20 })`, `Foo(1, 2)`, etc.)
- Negation patterns (i.e., `not null`, `not String`, etc.)
- Disjunction patterns (i.e., `String or Number`, etc.)
- Conjunction patterns (i.e., `Array and { length: 10 }`, etc.)
- `let`/`const` patterns (i.e., `Option.Some(let value)`, `{ x: 10, y: let y }`, etc.)

I favor `let`/`const` patterns because they are explicit, recognizable, and familiar. They are also bound "in place", which avoids repetition. They also remove the need for `${}` placeholders that are necessary in the current syntax only to differentiate between _references_ to existing variables and _bindings_ produced by the pattern. I generally favor `let`/`const` over Rust's `@` syntax for bindings, as `@` is very confusing in Rust, and would overload the meaning. I find keyword-based syntax to be far easier to introduce over sigil-based syntax due to the limited budget we have remaining in the language for sigils.

Also, while I don't consider these to be necessary for an MVP pattern matching proposal, I think there is room to expand (in another "layer" or later proposal) the pattern syntax to include things like RegExp literal patterns and relational patterns.

[09:40:34.0606] <rbuckton>
Even if my suggestions for syntax were adopted, there are still issues to consider. Should object patterns be exhaustive by default, requiring a `...` to opt out of exhaustiveness? Or, should object patterns be non-exhaustive by default, requiring something like `{| |}` to differentiate (much like Flow's exact object types). Should object patterns test whether the current match subject is an Object? Or, should anything other than `null` and `undefined` be allowed (i.e., to match `{ length }` against a string)?

In the same vein, should array patterns be exhaustive by default, requiring a `...` to opt out of exhaustiveness? Should we ensure object and array patterns are aligned in terms of exhaustiveness?

[09:40:57.0871] <rbuckton>
Also, it has been suggested that custom matchers be treated as functions to be called in absence of a `Symbol.matcher` method, or as classes (and thus tested via `instanceof`). Given that there are multiple camps in JS that either favor classes vs. functions/FP, do we have a solution that doesn't ostracize a large percentage of the community? Given the semantic meaning of a statement like `x is Y`, I generally favor an approach that leverages an `instanceof`-like behavior by default, while providing an opt-in mechanism for functions.  This is partly due to readability, i.e., `x is String`, `x is Point`, `x is SharedArrayBuffer`, etc., vs. `x is isString`, `x is Array.isArray`, etc.

[09:53:36.0654] <rbuckton>
The custom matcher protocol is expecting a one to one operation like `Matcher = obj => MatchResult`, which aligns well with an infix operation. General purpose functions aren't always suited to be called with a single argument, and in-situ within a pattern is a terrible place to try to `.bind()` something or wrap with an arrow function to supply arguments. If the concern introducing a simple mechanism to convert an existing unary test function, we could introduce a `Matcher` class that wraps.

It would be nice if we could differentiate between a `class` and a `function` (at least, a `function` that isn't intending to represent an ES5-style "class"), and then branch the default behavior on that.

I know I just dumped a bunch of stuff in here, but I'll be on PTO for the next week and a half as I'll be moving. I'll try to respond to discussions, but my responses may be delayed. I wanted to make sure I had some of my thoughts written down before going on vacation.


2023-03-30
[13:13:38.0661] <TabAtkins>
Differentiating between a `class` (rather, its constructor function) and a regular function is, as far as I can tell, not possible? Maybe there's a branding thing we can lean on that's not web-exposed

[13:14:15.0247] <TabAtkins>
But `x = class Foo {}` and `y = function Foo(){}` produce objects that appear to be indistinguishable on the sort of inspection you can perform in DevTools.

[13:17:48.0159] <TabAtkins>
I'll say that the vast majority of what you typed, rbuckton-pto, I agree with and support (most is already the proposal, a few bits are additional changes that I also agree with making). There's no need to restate most of it. I also don't think we need to relitigate a bunch of questions - array and object exhaustiveness has been well-argued in the proposal and unless you think you have a strong argument for changing the current proposal it's gonna look like it currently does.

[13:18:49.0838] <TabAtkins>
As for syntax of the various matcher uses that I posted, I'm more than open to changes. I'm just trying to make sure that all the usages are reasonably consistent, and parseable without tying our hands on grammar changes in the future.

[13:19:59.0164] <TabAtkins>
i'll do some more fiddling in the thread

[13:22:44.0085] <TabAtkins>
One big issue that we're gonna run into, tho, is the collision of extractor patterns in matchers with extractor patterns in destructuring. It looks like extractors-in-destructuring end up claiming a big chunk of syntax space that would make it impossible to ever do anything else in those syntax slots without some awkward manipulations. How much are you insisting on extractors-in-destructuring if we have extractors-in-matchers, and can use matchers in `let` and function args in place of the existing destructuring?

[13:46:30.0415] <rbuckton-pto>
I won't be able to respond in detail until the middle of next week as I'm packing and moving over the next few days. 

[14:19:45.0234] <TabAtkins>
np, i dropped more comments in the thread that'll be more useful to respond to, anyway

[14:25:23.0270] <TabAtkins>
I do wonder if we can handle the predicate case by just making `if(<expr>)` a matcher pattern. Matches if its expr is true, establishes no bindings. You'd commonly have to write `x and if(foo(x))` or something, so you can test the value at that point, but still.

[14:26:50.0863] <TabAtkins>
Then we could remove the explicit `if()` clause from the match() arms. And without an `if()` in the grammar (and *with* the `:` separator that we have now), we can probably just remove the `when()` wrapper too.

[14:27:22.0163] <TabAtkins>
```js
match(val) {
  [a, b]: a+b;
  default: 4 // chosen by fair die roll;
}
```

[14:27:37.0464] <TabAtkins>
(this is parseable, since `default` is a reserved word)

[14:28:17.0939] <TabAtkins>
And then since `if()` is a matcher, `match(val) { if(foo == bar): baz; }` Just Works, no need for us to handle it specifically.

[14:30:46.0439] <TabAtkins>
`{foo: Custom([1, a])} and if(myTest(a))` would be a valid matcher if you didn't want to nest the `if` deeply, identical to today's proposal `when({foo: Custom([1, a])}) if(myTest(a))`

[15:47:44.0144] <rbuckton-pto>
C# also has headless cases:
```cs
x switch {
  [a, b] => a+b,
  _ => 4
}
```

[16:14:08.0519] <ljharb>
oof, i think the when wrapper is valuable and necessary

It doesn't seem so bad to me, and there's nothing keeping us from using a different token than `:`. That said, I'm still fine with `when` as a clause indicator inside of `match`. 

[10:40:37.0836] <TabAtkins>
rbuckton-pto: Was your suggestion for `let` with a destructure, a matcher in a trinary, and an object literal a serious suggestion? Or were you shitposting? I'm finding it hard to respond to that in text without seeming incredulous and/or rude, apologies.

[10:41:36.0142] <TabAtkins>
> having it look almost exactly like an object literal seems very hard to teach

It doesn't, tho? If anything, it looks like a switch(). ^_^

[10:43:11.0309] <TabAtkins>
But my interest really is just in making sure that matchers are used in as similar a fashion as possible across their usage sites. If match() wraps them in a when(), then everywhere else probably should as well. If everywhere else doesn't, then match() probably shouldn't either. I think this is necessary to make the proposal as a whole feel smooth and easy to digest.

[10:44:18.0787] <TabAtkins>
And inside of `match()` is perhaps the location *least* requiring of a special wrapper to indicate context, since it's a brand new construct which can *only* contain that one thing! So "a `when()` inside of `match()`, but naked everywhere else" is exactly backwards, I think. ^_^

[11:18:35.0620] <rbuckton-pto>

Not shitposting, and not sure what seems out of place. I'm not advocating for `assert(val is Point(let x, let y))`, but that would be feasible with `is`.

I don`t find `let when(pattern) = y` useful because we already have destructuring, which has parallels between `let [x] = y` and `[x] = y`. The `let when` syntax has no parallel in expression space. Extractors would also have parallel syntax in binding and assignment patterns.

Matching is somewhat different, however. Matching is a conditional operation, destructuring is not. `let` is not conditional either, so `let when` feels out of place. 

[11:20:52.0144] <TabAtkins>
What seemed out of place was just that it was *ridiculously* verbose. You have to name each binding *three times* to smuggle it out. Considering the objections to my earlier syntax suggestions based on the verbosity of an extra `match` and `when()`, it seemed somewhat contradictory to suggest such a pattern is best spelled so roundabout and verbosely. ^_^

[11:22:45.0381] <TabAtkins>
Re: the parallel between expression and destructuring: Matchers also have `[]` and `{}`, tho. And I'm coming around pretty well to the extractor pattern being the primary way to do custom matchers (but still having ${} as an escape hatch, possibly), so that also matches up. 

[11:23:23.0049] <TabAtkins>
So I'm not sure I understand - is it just that matchers can be *more powerful* than that? Even tho the common case is not, and they'll usually very closely resemble destructuring?

[11:26:17.0119] <rbuckton-pto>
The `let { x, y } =` example is verbose, yes, but uses what could otherwise be regular js in the initializer. 

[11:27:20.0888] <TabAtkins>
I don't understand why that's a benefit here, considering we're talking about new syntax.

[11:27:25.0151] <rbuckton-pto>
In a way it's meant to illustrate that a `let` statement isn't a good fit for pattern matching itself, because matching is conditional and `let` is not. 

[11:28:05.0909] <rbuckton-pto>
The closest you get to a useful example is the `assert` one, because you need to validate the condition was successful. 

[11:28:48.0167] <TabAtkins>
Let's discuss that point directly, then, rather than trying to insinuate it via intentionally bad examples. ^_^

[11:29:46.0299] <rbuckton-pto>
It's hard to have this conversation right now. My PC is disconnected for a move and my laptop is packed. I'm currently on matrix from my phone

[11:30:13.0262] <TabAtkins>
Not a problem. ^_^ go! be on vacation! stop responding!

[11:49:21.0978] <rbuckton-pto>
The `let { x, y }` example seems like a bad example, but it isn't far from a real world example in many pattern matching languages. In a lot of cases, you will see a value branch on different patterns using something like `match`, but may need to provide more than one result. Consider this example that uses a combination of `match`, extractors, and ADT enums to represent movement in a 2D game

```js
const { dx, dy } = match (action) {
  when Action.Move({ direction: "north", distance: let dist }): { dx: 0, dy: dist },
  when Action.Move({ direction: "south", distance: let dist }): { dx: 0, dy: -dist },
  when Action.Move({ direction: "east", distance: let dist }): { dx: dist, dy: 0 },
  when Action.Move({ direction: "west", distance: let dist }): { dx: -dist, dy: 0 } 
};
```

This is a perfectly reasonable pattern, and exhibits the exact same behavior as my other example.

  action is Action.Move({ direction: "south", distance: let dist }) ? { dx: 0, dy: -dist } :

Yes, that's more reasonable when there are many branches, because you're also communicating what parts of the potentially-quite-different patterns are being condensed into the set of common bindings. That's useful to communicate in the code!

But that's not a relevant concern when you're evaluating one single branch.

(Also, anything to do with `let` directly impinges on how we want to handle matchers in arglists.)

I'm not yet convinced on matchers in parameter lists. I do want extractors, though, which is another reason they are intended to work in destructuring as well.

Okay updated proposal for "matchers everywhere" (longform in linked gist, abbreviated 1-pager in comment) https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching/issues/281#issuecomment-1492546570
