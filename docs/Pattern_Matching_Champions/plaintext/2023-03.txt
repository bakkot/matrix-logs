I ended up catching a cold this weekend and underprioritizing sleep is probably how it happened in the first place, so

[23:25:19.0661] <rkirsling>
I think it's best for me to go to bed early and sit this one out


2023-03-27
[02:03:18.0947] <yulia>
moved!

[02:03:49.0225] <yulia>
For sure, I don't think there will be anything ground moving at this meeting, just a chance to catch up and see where everyone's thoughts are at. feel better!
