Rust finally got "name the value *and* destructure it further" in its match expression https://twitter.com/m_ou_se/status/1451273883592560644

can we enable "inviting" on this channel?

[07:09:49.0569] <TabAtkins>
The room is public, so presumably that's already allowed?

the button is grayed out for me. in the pipeline champions room, it's green

it's in the tab of roles & permissions

[19:04:35.0891] <legendecas>
now it's set with only moderator can invite users

[19:07:20.0719] <mpcsh>
good eye! changed it to default. ljharb did that fix it?

[19:11:37.0605] <legendecas>
I can confirm my invite button becomes green :)
