what do we all think are the remaining blockers to seeking stage 2?

I suspect nothing? We should try to close the remaining issues, and make sure the spec text is up to date, but that's it.

The more I write and read examples, the more I think we could get away with dropping the () around the matcher, as long as we have the separator character. `when (${...})` is just a lot of wrappers, and I don't want to special-case top-level `${}` over other things.

[10:57:18.0669] <TabAtkins>
`when ({foo})` or `when([foo])` too, just too many wrapper chars. Gimme `when {foo}: ...` and `when [foo]: ...`

[11:45:02.0702] <ljharb>
so you want `when null` and `when /a/g` and `when 3` etc?
