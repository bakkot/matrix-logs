what do we all think are the remaining blockers to seeking stage 2?

[10:25:18.0033] <TabAtkins>
I suspect nothing? We should try to close the remaining issues, and make sure the spec text is up to date, but that's it.

[10:56:39.0490] <TabAtkins>
The more I write and read examples, the more I think we could get away with dropping the () around the matcher, as long as we have the separator character. `when (${...})` is just a lot of wrappers, and I don't want to special-case top-level `${}` over other things.

[10:57:18.0669] <TabAtkins>
`when ({foo})` or `when([foo])` too, just too many wrapper chars. Gimme `when {foo}: ...` and `when [foo]: ...`

[11:45:02.0702] <ljharb>
so you want `when null` and `when /a/g` and `when 3` etc?

[11:45:30.0744] <ljharb>
i think that it's a _reasonable_ possibility, now that the pin operator has boundaries, in a way where it was unreasonable with `^`

[11:45:49.0669] <ljharb>
but i'm not sure it's better. the parens are a nice static delimiter to indicate the pattern

[11:46:16.0314] <ljharb>
i guess we still haven't figured out if there should be a separator before the RHS, and what it is?

[12:26:11.0130] <TabAtkins>
Yes, I'd want all of those, so long as we have the RHS separator.

[12:26:32.0588] <TabAtkins>
And yeah we haven't figured it out yet, but it looked like several champions were leaning towards `:` the last time we discussed this.

[13:27:34.0137] <mpcsh>
do we want to have one more champions call?
