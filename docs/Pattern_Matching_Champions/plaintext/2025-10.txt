We should meet soon to discuss the future of this proposal. We haven't made much progress with it over the last year, and there are conflicting proposals that could stymie future advancement. For example, https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Declarations-in-Conditionals is seeking Stage 2 advancement in November, which is a direct conflict with `is` (or `~=` or whatever it ends up being).

I filed https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Declarations-in-Conditionals/issues/13 to discuss the overlap
