tenary does not have a "block" to be scoped

[20:24:23.0006] <rbuckton>
The block would be the block containing the ExpressionStatement, not the expression itself. 

[20:26:35.0392] <rbuckton>
Block scopes are always at the statement level, though `match`/`when` may end up being the lone exception

I think that's even worse

[07:25:36.0700] <rbuckton>
That's the behavior that C# has, so there is precedent

[07:26:22.0297] <rbuckton>
And it's consistent with normal `let`/`const`

[11:41:47.0062] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I'm not sure I see the confusion, the scopes are exactly the same as normal. The fact that the binding is established in an expression rather than a statement doesn't change anything, in my mind.

[12:05:01.0161] <rbuckton>
We just need to clarify corner cases like parenthesized statement heads in `if`, `switch`, `with`, and `while`. And maybe the expression in `for..of` and `for..in`.

[12:45:03.0991] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, statement heads are the corner case - they're halfway between the outer scope and their inner block scope. But they're already complex in various ways, so that's nothing new.

[15:23:14.0357] <ljharb>
i think statement heads making bindings make sense intuitively. i do not think expressions making bindings make sense.

I don't think expression-local block scoping makes sense, but I disagree with respect to bindings. Expressions introducing bindings is quite common in many languages, so I don't think it would be difficult to adopt or learn. 

[18:30:15.0128] <ljharb>
other languages arenâ€™t the rubric; either now or eventually, most JS devs have or will have never used another language

[18:49:48.0034] <rbuckton>
I don't find that argument compelling. It assumes JS devs cannot adapt and the language itself cannot evolve. Besides, even JS can introduce bindings in expressions and has been able to do so since it was created. It's just that most often it was unintentional. 

[18:53:57.0630] <rbuckton>
And I'm not arguing that *because X has it, we should have it". I'm arguing that it's a compelling feature with reasonable semantics in many languages that JS also shares other syntax with. It's not a huge leap to adopt the capability, and not difficult to learn or understand. I'm also arguing that it's a feature I've seen requested from several sources, one of which is a noted language designer. It's also a feature that is regularly present in FP style languages and has a long history, and a large part of the JS community uses it for functional programming.

i'm not saying that "other languages do it" is an anti-argument. i'm saying it's a very very weak argument.
