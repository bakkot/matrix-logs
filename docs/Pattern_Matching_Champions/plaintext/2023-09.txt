tenary does not have a "block" to be scoped

[20:24:23.0006] <rbuckton>
The block would be the block containing the ExpressionStatement, not the expression itself. 

[20:26:35.0392] <rbuckton>
Block scopes are always at the statement level, though `match`/`when` may end up being the lone exception

I think that's even worse

[07:25:36.0700] <rbuckton>
That's the behavior that C# has, so there is precedent

[07:26:22.0297] <rbuckton>
And it's consistent with normal `let`/`const`
