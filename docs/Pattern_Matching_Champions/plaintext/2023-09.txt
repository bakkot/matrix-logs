tenary does not have a "block" to be scoped

[20:24:23.0006] <rbuckton>
The block would be the block containing the ExpressionStatement, not the expression itself. 

[20:26:35.0392] <rbuckton>
Block scopes are always at the statement level, though `match`/`when` may end up being the lone exception

I think that's even worse

[07:25:36.0700] <rbuckton>
That's the behavior that C# has, so there is precedent

[07:26:22.0297] <rbuckton>
And it's consistent with normal `let`/`const`

[11:41:47.0062] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I'm not sure I see the confusion, the scopes are exactly the same as normal. The fact that the binding is established in an expression rather than a statement doesn't change anything, in my mind.

[12:05:01.0161] <rbuckton>
We just need to clarify corner cases like parenthesized statement heads in `if`, `switch`, `with`, and `while`. And maybe the expression in `for..of` and `for..in`.

[12:45:03.0991] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, statement heads are the corner case - they're halfway between the outer scope and their inner block scope. But they're already complex in various ways, so that's nothing new.
