there's quite literally no overlap between our timezones - I tried to pick the least-bad slots, but if folks have objections I can change the poll

[14:42:48.0627] <rkirsling>
yeah I think this hasn't really worked out in that regard

[14:43:20.0483] <rkirsling>
for the whole pandemic it's been as if early morning PT were the only times that exist in the world

[14:44:49.0009] <rkirsling>
even though we've had increased ability to meet at later-than-usual hours

[15:35:57.0427] <ljharb>
yeah basically everyone always claims the PT morning slots for every meeting

PT morning is just the best-of-bad-options for covering the three major timezone regions most people are in. it sucks for everyone

alright with four responses we're down to only one time that's a full green check for everyone, so I'm calling it for tuesday dec 14 from 8:00-10:00am PST. will send a calendar invite shortly
