I'm applying all our resolutions right now, and I'm finally to the binding visibility one, and I have a question.

[11:48:27.0374] <TabAtkins>
So `&`/`|` is simple, as is array patterns; bindings from earlier patterns are visible to later patterns. But what about object matchers?

[11:49:05.0595] <TabAtkins>
Should `{a, b: ${console.log(a)}}` work? If so, I presume `{b: ${console.log(a)}, a}` wouldn't work? Or should neither work?

[11:58:18.0205] <mpcsh>
is both working an option?

[11:59:20.0174] <TabAtkins>
That seems impossible; `{a: ${console.log(b)||"a"}, b: ${console.log(a)||"b"}}` logs what, exactly?

[11:59:31.0646] <mpcsh>
yeah you're right
