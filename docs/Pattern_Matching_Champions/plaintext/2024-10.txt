@rbuckton do you include Function.prototype[Symbol.customMatcher] methods in extractor proposal?

[20:03:20.0800] <Jack Works>
if not, adding them in the pattern matching proposal later might be a breaking change

[20:03:44.0090] <Jack Works>
(or basically all runtime built-in methods in the pattern matching)

[20:04:29.0336] <Jack Works>
or we can hold the engines to ship it (ah JS Sugar comes!) until pattern matching catches the process
