> <@rkirsling:matrix.org> in theory you could keep nesting `is ... if (...)`s

I think this point may have been overlooked in the discussion about `is` and `if` 

[19:03:39.0464] <rkirsling>
this really is something that arises from the combination of the two

[19:06:49.0600] <rkirsling>
though I guess it's not exclusive to `if` _patterns_; it's mostly something that happens due to `is` existing

[19:07:50.0334] <rkirsling>
though as Ron mentioned immediately above, the spelling of `if` pattterns/guards as `if` is the compounding factors

[19:07:51.0600] <rkirsling>

[19:08:13.0755] <rkirsling>
 * as Ron mentioned immediately above, the spelling of `if` pattterns/guards as `if` is the compounding factor

[19:11:03.0512] <rkirsling>
basically
```
if (... is ... if (... is ... if (...)))
    if (...)
        return;
```
would be our new world of JS

[19:11:15.0627] <rkirsling>
 * basically

```
if (... is ... if (... is ... if (...)))
    if (...)
        return;
```

would be valid in our proposed world

[19:12:59.0535] <Jack Works>
syntactically valid does not mean developers must write that. otherwise `throw throw x` should also be banned 

[19:13:27.0416] <rkirsling>
that's not a counterargument

[19:18:36.0706] <rkirsling>
it would be completely negligent to not have a thorough discussion about such a case

[19:20:25.0203] <rkirsling>
the crux is that it would be extremely easy to write code in one can't easily tell what construct `if (...)` is

[19:21:39.0422] <rkirsling>
 * the crux is that it would be extremely easy to write code in which one can't easily tell what construct `if (...)` is

[19:22:28.0208] <Jack Works>
but both if statement and if pattern accept an expression and evaluate it and do truthy test

[19:22:55.0827] <Jack Works>
it's not so important to distinguish them, because they have the same semantics 

[19:23:50.0370] <rkirsling>
they absolutely do not have the same semantics; one is a control flow construct and one is a subexpression

[19:34:57.0263] <rkirsling>
 * they absolutely do not have the same semantics; one is a control flow construct and one is a boolean subexpression

[01:12:08.0203] <ljharb>
fwiw i'm strongly opposed to dropping `when` entirely

[01:12:26.0876] <ljharb>
also is matthew mathieu?

[01:12:52.0119] <ljharb>
 * fwiw i'm strongly opposed to dropping `when` entirely (but am flexible on spelling)

[01:15:49.0297] <ljharb>
also i commented on the perf concern on the issue; tldr, this isn't a thing that's usually a problem and not something we should be concerned about

[08:08:04.0473] <mgaudet>
it me.

[08:08:10.0738] <mgaudet>
I am implementer. Raising concern. 

[08:08:17.0634] <mgaudet>
FWIW

[08:09:07.0289] <mgaudet>
The iterator protocol is hard to optimize, and I'm trying to provide feedback that will result in a performant proposal 

[08:09:17.0930] <mgaudet>
or, at least have the -potential- to be performant

[08:49:18.0682] <rbuckton>
I think it's fine to pay the cost for classes, but maybe we just don't support unboxing for primitives. Either that, or we distinguish between `x is String` and `x is String()` somehow. Different symbol methods maybe? 

[10:59:55.0143] <TabAtkins>
Yeah that was my suggestion in the issue.
