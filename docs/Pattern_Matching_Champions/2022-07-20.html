I've similarly been less engaged with the current proposal. Part of that is because of time constraints, but additionally, it's felt like the proposal iterated so quickly in a direction I wasn't confident about, that I didn't want to be a lone dissenter on the matter. When I came here to say that on Friday, I saw Yulia already had.</p>
<p>So when I came back to this chat yesterday and saw <a href="https://github.com/codehag/pattern-matching-epic">https://github.com/codehag/pattern-matching-epic</a>, I was actually pleasantly surprised. While the proposal is currently a strawperson of how pattern matching could be built up bit-by-bit, each of those building blocks resonates a lot with me. A few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>explicit binding syntax, while seemingly repetitive, makes things clearer, avoids adding an interpolation syntax, and inverts value-matching to a higher priority to binding-introduction (which I think is likely the better direction as a default).</li>
<li>while neither proposal is <em>stellar</em> for tagged unions, I'm more amenable to the "epic" proposal variant for it so far (partially thanks to prioritizing value-matching)</li>
<li>subsuming switch, while tempting, might do more harm than good. I'm also not convinced that behaviors like fallthrough are consistently undesirable</li>
<li>the compositional possibilities of a standalone match are exciting</li>
</ol>
<p>I think there's a lot to consider in that proposal, and I suspect my team would be more amenable to it.</p>
