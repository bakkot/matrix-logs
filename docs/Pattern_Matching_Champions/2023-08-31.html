From the short conversation we had yesterday, his primary interest has to do with functional programming. In languages like Haskell, Scheme, and ML, <code>let..in</code> expressions provide variables that are scoped to sub expressions. Python has something similar as well in the form of assignment expressions (<code>x := y</code>). C# even has this capability as well with variable patterns (much like the <code>let</code> patterns I've proposed), though it's not as ideal: <a href="https://dotnetfiddle.net/g4Zf13">https://dotnetfiddle.net/g4Zf13</a>.</p>
<p>An example from the TypeScript compiler that Anders mentioned is this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">function getTypeOfPropertyOrIndexSignatureOfType(type: Type, name: __String): Type | undefined {
    let propType;
    return getTypeOfPropertyOfType(type, name) ||
        (propType = getApplicableIndexInfoForName(type, name)?.type) &amp;&amp;
            addOptionality(propType, /*isProperty*/ true, /*isOptional*/ true);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This requires declaring a mutable variable at the statement level. He believes something like the following would be an improvement for FP-style development:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">function getTypeOfPropertyOrIndexSignatureOfType(type: Type, name: __String): Type | undefined {
    return getTypeOfPropertyOfType(type, name) ||
        (const propType = getApplicableIndexInfoForName(type, name)?.type) &amp;&amp;
            addOptionality(propType, /*isProperty*/ true, /*isOptional*/ true);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Where the <code>propType</code> variable can be declared <code>const</code> and doesn't require lifting the declaration out of the expression.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting on his feedback regarding <code>do</code>-expressions, but my take is that <code>do</code> doesn't make this expression any more succinct or clear, it just introduces a confusing statement scope in the middle of an expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">function getTypeOfPropertyOrIndexSignatureOfType(type: Type, name: __String): Type | undefined {
  return getTypeOfPropertyOfType(type, name) ||
    do {
      const propType = getApplicableIndexInfoForName(type, name)?.type;
      propType &amp;&amp; addOptionality(propType, /*isProperty*/ true, /*isOptional*/ true);
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>While <code>x is let y</code>/<code>x is const y</code> isn't necessarily an ideal solution, it remains concise and is possibly even more powerful since it's combined with pattern matching:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">function getTypeOfPropertyOrIndexSignatureOfType(type: Type, name: __String): Type | undefined {

<blockquote>
<p>I would also argue that <code>do</code> [expressions] attempt to solve a problem I don't have, i.e. full statement bodies in the middle of an expression. Once you need full statement blocks, you're probably better off not being in an expression context. In other words, the only problem <code>do</code> expressions would solve for me is that of giving names to sub-expressions, but they're so clumsy that I'd avoid them and advise my team to do so as well.</p>

He hasn't been partial to <code>do</code> expressions, so I'm hoping this would address that as well. <code>x is let y</code> could theoretically fill the same role as a <code>let..in</code> expression in other languages:</p>
<pre><code>// PowerQuery
x = let a = foo() in
    let b = a.b in
    [a, b];

// OpenSCAD
x = let (a = foo())
    let (b = a[0])
    [a, b];

x = foo() is let a,

If anything I still think <code>else</code> is better than <code>default</code> because its shorter and lines up visually:</p>
<pre><code>match (foo) {

<p>Also, in English, the word "when" at the start of a sentence can imply either a statement of fact, or begin a question. While "is" at the start of a sentence can only imply a question.</p>
<p>So <code>match (foo) { when pattern: ... }</code> would generally be interpreted as: "<strong>When</strong> <em>foo</em> is <em>pattern</em> then ...", while <code>is</code> would generally be interpreted as: "If <em>foo</em> <strong>is</strong> <em>pattern</em> then ...", which is a bit of cognitive overhead, imo.</p>
<p>That's why <code>is</code> makes sense as an infix expression form, since it has the infix position in the statement above. For example: <code>if (x is String) ...</code> reads as "If <em>x</em> <strong>is</strong> a String, then ...".</p>
