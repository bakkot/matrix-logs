With an <code>if</code> clause, you have to spend time and energy rearranging your pattern to satisfy the runtime requirements of a trailing <code>if</code> (which I described a few days ago), while having <code>if</code> available as a pattern allows you to keep those (hopefully few) occurrences local to the subpattern that needs them. I hope, though, that the pattern matching syntax itself is expressive enough so as to avoid needing to lean on <code>if</code> except for the narrowest of corner cases.</td></tr>

<p><code>is</code> feels like "<em>huh? this is not the proposal I showed up for? we're here to make a better <code>switch</code>, not to pull a bait-and-switch</em>", yet wanting <code>if (x is Some(let v))</code> makes a lot of sense. Simultaneously though, it's clear that for the general POJO situation, <code>if (let { foo } = x)</code> would integrate better into the language.</p>
<p>Indeed, the temperature of the committee that I was experiencing last week is that having "pattern matching has a solution for that!" come up in the discussion of a half-dozen disparate proposals is a <em>worrying</em> signal, that the feature has grown unreasonably large.</p>
<p>Although I was thinking yesterday that the spelling <code>if</code> is more of an issue than whether it's a pattern, this may have been mistaken. If <code>if</code> is a guard then it feels more natural to exclude it from <code>is</code>, which makes my largest concerns disappear. I believe strongly that patterns should be as simple as possible -- it's not even clear to me that <code>and</code> is a good idea; the thing that we really <em>need</em> it for is a way to connect a binding to a pattern that's going to use that binding, yet ironically that's exactly the case where <code>and</code> is not the most intuitive keyword to read.</p>
</blockquote></mx-reply>it's not a bait and switch; we got feedback from SM that we <em>can't</em> do a better switch unless we build it iteratively, and <code>is</code> makes perfect sense for that</td></tr>
