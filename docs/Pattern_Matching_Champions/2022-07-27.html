Due to rushing this, two parts got intertwined and a bit confusing. 1) we need to layer this, how can we do that (so i started working on something, then 2) oh, if we layer it, some interesting stuff falls out like allowing pattern matching syntax in many places (im particularly interested in LHS)</td></tr>

I would consider it the underlying objection if we want to use that term. The second part, I tried to do a little to much with the decomposition into constituent parts exposing smaller pieces, eventually building up the final proposal from that you have (as close as possible via layering) and also addressing a syntax concern which is that destructuring is already confusing for developers, this will make it significantly more so. We should tread carefully there and reconsider what syntax we are introducing. I think this is fully solvable. In fact, if we fully restrict the when statement to what is already recognizable, i would be amenable to that. That said, if we do that, we lose some of the interesting things that the proposal can do, and this part of the decomposition of it. Something we can talk about. The syntax i was using was not final, i want to emphasize again</td></tr>

I don't know when the last pattern matching meeting even happened, or where it was decided that this goes to stage 2. This might be due to the fact that matrix loses messages, I don't know.
