As in, from what I understand, the problem that is being proposed to be solved is near the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary advantage of this direction is that it avoids blessing string decimals as a first-class numeric data type (something the Amount champions insist is not the intent, but which has a risk of being interpreted that way by the community).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>That</em> seems like an abbreviated representation of the kind of actual issue that I have been asking to be actually raised, so that it can be discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is meant by "blessing string decimals as a first-class numeric data type"?</li>
<li>What's the problem with doing something like that?</li>
<li>Is it our intent to do or not do so?</li>
<li>Is the problem about what the Amount proposal is doing, or is this strictly about avoiding a slippery slope?</li>
</ul>

<p>At the last meeting, we got some quite clear direction from the committee that the inclusion of unit conversion ought to be explored as a part this proposal's first step. No work on this has been done since the November meeting, and we have no alignment among this group about the details around this. Attempting to discuss things further in committee is very unlikely to be fruitful, and we should avoid doing so at this time.</p>
