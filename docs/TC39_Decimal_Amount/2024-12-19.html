The recent proposal I championed kept the status quo except that more nonzero significant digits in the string would be retained. I would have liked to retain trailing zeros, too, but that almost certainly would have broken the Web.</p>
<p>The string support in Intl.NumberFormat should therefore not have any direct impact on the design of Decimal or Measure.</p>
<p>However, this is a good example of why I want the Measure and Decimal champions to talk more; I don't think we should be developing these proposals in two silos.</p>

This would really "level up" numbers in ECMAScript. And it's better for Intl because users who have these structured types floating around can call <code>toLocaleString</code> on them and it will just work.</td></tr>

Doing a design holistically is the plan. That said, if you want to block decimal on having measure be further along in development, I can understand that point of view.</td></tr>
