I created https://github.com/tc39/proposal-amount/issues/75 after some chats with Oli.

I know eemeli is still waiting for "V8's list of grievances with string-based Amount", but I think as champions we can still discuss the feasibility of this direction. I added it to the agenda on Thursday

Happy to discuss that tomorrow, though the issue does seem to bury the lede a bit? As in, from what I understand, the problem that is being proposed to be solved is near the end:
> The primary advantage of this direction is that it avoids blessing string decimals as a first-class numeric data type (something the Amount champions insist is not the intent, but which has a risk of being interpreted that way by the community).

_That_ seems like an abbreviated representation of the kind of actual issue that I have been asking to be actually raised, so that it can be discussed:
- What is meant by "blessing string decimals as a first-class numeric data type"?
- What's the problem with doing something like that?
- Is it our intent to do or not do so?
- Is the problem about what the Amount proposal is doing, or is this strictly about avoiding a slippery slope?

Also, just to be clear and explicit about it: Even though the agenda for the next plenary is still remarkably empty, I am quite strongly of the opinion that _**no Amount topics ought to be added to this TG1 meeting's agenda**_.

At the last meeting, we got some quite clear direction from the committee that the inclusion of unit conversion ought to be explored as a part this proposal's first step. No work on this has been done since the November meeting, and we have no alignment among this group about the details around this. Attempting to discuss things further in committee is very unlikely to be fruitful, and we should avoid doing so at this time.
