I created https://github.com/tc39/proposal-amount/issues/75 after some chats with Oli.

I know eemeli is still waiting for "V8's list of grievances with string-based Amount", but I think as champions we can still discuss the feasibility of this direction. I added it to the agenda on Thursday

Happy to discuss that tomorrow, though the issue does seem to bury the lede a bit? As in, from what I understand, the problem that is being proposed to be solved is near the end:
> The primary advantage of this direction is that it avoids blessing string decimals as a first-class numeric data type (something the Amount champions insist is not the intent, but which has a risk of being interpreted that way by the community).

_That_ seems like an abbreviated representation of the kind of actual issue that I have been asking to be actually raised, so that it can be discussed:
- What is meant by "blessing string decimals as a first-class numeric data type"?
- What's the problem with doing something like that?
- Is it our intent to do or not do so?
- Is the problem about what the Amount proposal is doing, or is this strictly about avoiding a slippery slope?
