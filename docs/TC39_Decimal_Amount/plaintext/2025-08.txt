A colleague of ours (Brian Kardell) might be interested in joining our call today to talk about the possible amount web integration

It's just me so far.

Two main takeaways: 

1. *If* we support infinity, we probably also want to support NaN and -0, because then we are basically redefining Amount to be a reified IntlMV instead of MV
2. *If* we have spec mandated limits, they should be at least as much as the IntlMV limits, and could be the same 
3. I will make a PR implementing proposed IntlMV limits, which we can review to see if we want to see them applied to Amount
