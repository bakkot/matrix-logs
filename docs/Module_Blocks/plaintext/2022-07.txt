Do you mean, the first import without assertion, and the second import with assertion so the browser needs to fetch the source again to check if  assertion succeed?

ðŸ‘€ What if import("/a") then import("/b") but /b redirects to /a? does "/a" execute twice?

No

That case very much does execute twice in browsers, even if it only fetches /a once
