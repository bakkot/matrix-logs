I feel like the biggest open question is whether module blocks are cached by source position or not. I think it might be most efficient to just have an incubator call about this. Anyone not okay with that? And how do I schedule one officially? ðŸ˜…

Isn t my `unique` solution good enough? ðŸ˜‚

[06:17:50.0733] <Surma>
Well, Iâ€™m kinda changing my opinion that all module blocks should be cached by source position

[06:18:26.0233] <Surma>
so that would make that extra syntax moot ðŸ˜…

[06:18:44.0052] <Surma>
I hope we can avoid additional syntax

an incubator call would be good. to have one, during plenary when incubator call chartering happens, we'd add module blocks. ping shu to give him a heads up

Weâ€™re stepping up spec work on Compartments and it would be good to get in sync.
