I needed to prune some company-specific bits and navigate our convoluted process for making Google Docs actually public. ðŸ˜…

The first doc is a bunch of explanation on the problems we have with existing attempts at context management and some possible solutions we're iterating on to solve these problems in a more flexible way. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v8tMzV51Cuz32-60dhopoIMIxWfy_epOIRwoL5LmKVc/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v8tMzV51Cuz32-60dhopoIMIxWfy_epOIRwoL5LmKVc/edit?usp=sharing</a>

The second doc is partly relevant in that it describes an integration between the Diagnostics Channel concept and context management for the purpose of providing control to users to decide in which ways they want to propagate context for their specific store around particular points defined by library code as possibly interesting. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTZ2C5BKsoVRnU_ihyi93blF3cxXIbqqcIaSYurhBRk/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTZ2C5BKsoVRnU_ihyi93blF3cxXIbqqcIaSYurhBRk/edit?usp=sharing</a>

I additionally have some slides from a recent internal talk I can also share which covers this overlap more briefly, and with specific examples. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jYO45MudKGPOtir5hK0_wB7XS0D_ksLe4j5NvC8YfTc/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jYO45MudKGPOtir5hK0_wB7XS0D_ksLe4j5NvC8YfTc/edit?usp=sharing</a></td></tr>

It also has some spots I still would like to improve, but what is shared is a snapshot-in-time copy of what the <em>current</em> state is, so I will have to replicate future changes into these docs as it is deemed relevant.</p>
<p>The main change I'm considering is thinking of a better expression of the context management part of the Window Channel concept in Diagnostics Channel to put more of the logic and explanation of its use into the context management space. I'm not yet sure if that involves having some additional ContextWindow construct or something like that...still thinking on that one. ðŸ¤”</p>
