So this would be for "lexical" variables as well.</td></tr>

But I don’t know if I can represent the arguments for set() well, and I am pretty sure this all would not form much of an interesting argument in favor of flow-through.</td></tr>

Assuming <code>await</code> and <code>Promise.then</code> are both lexically bound (which I mostly agree with - the former somewhat moreso than the latter, but overall I think it makes sense), there's no way to get at the promise's resolution context, and that's very relevant for understanding "follows from".  Would we expose some sort of static function to grab it?  <code>Promise.resolutionSnapshot(promise)</code>?  <code>Snapshot.fromPromise(promise)</code>?  Could something like that work more generally for other cases like events?</td></tr>
