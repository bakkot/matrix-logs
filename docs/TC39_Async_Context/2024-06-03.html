In my diagrams, merge points generally have a solid line and a dashed line going into them.  The solid line represents the causal (or "flow") context, while the dashed like is what I'd call the lexical context.  For an <code>await</code>, flow context is "flow-through", while lexical context is "flow-around".  For a callback, flow context is "call-time", while lexical context is "registration-time".  The current proposed semantics are heavily tilted toward merging into the lexical context, while Stephen is advocating for merging into the flow context.  Is there <em>any way</em> we can put these two contexts on more equal footing?  I think the one obvious option to me would be to define two types of async variables: <code>LexicalVariable</code> and <code>FlowVariable</code>, and at any given merge point, we copy the flow context from the flow side and the lexical context from the lexical side.  I'm not seeing any other way to unite these two defaults... does anyone else?</td></tr>

Flow variables require a lot of bookkeeping at a lot of points scattered through the specs, and it is unclear how js devs should even build a mental model around them, it could be argued</td></tr>

For flow advocates: how bad would it be if we called LexicalVariable “Variable” and did FlowVariable in a follow-on proposal?</td></tr>
