I think the conclusion is that there is no way to abstract "calling" context in an API shape like AsyncContext. The biggest problem is that the most recent calling context may not be the one you really need, that providing more than one would result in unbounded calling context history, and that it would expose some implementation details about the execution order of the "callers". For telemetry / debugging use cases, one approach is to gather points at certain key times. For promises for example, you can give them an ID and "log" when they are resolved (potentially to another promise), when reactions are added and executed, etc.. Then you can correlate all this and recompose your execution graph. this of course sounds very similar to async_hooks, and is too powerful of an API to expose to "unprivileged" code.</td></tr>
