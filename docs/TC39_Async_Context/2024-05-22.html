What is the indicated issue URL?

Part of the reason we discussed <code data-md="`">using</code> declarations with modifications to <code data-md="`">await</code> keyword to restore the previous context at the suspend point.</blockquote></mx-reply><p>This is exactly what I'm talking about. You seem to be explicitly aiming for binding <em>around</em> awaits, cutting off the branched execution merging back. This is explicitly what most users have told me they <em>don't</em> want. The code coming <em>out</em> of that await is a continuation, so it's essentially the same as if the remaining code was passed into that call as a callback, which <em>does</em> propagate context through. The fact that promises and async/await <em>will not</em> flow context through to continuations is extremely confusing to literally every user I've talked to about this. The whole <em>point</em> of context management to everyone I have talked to is to be able to set a value at some point in a branch of async execution and to be able to retrieve that same value <em>anywhere</em> in logically continuing execution, which <em>any</em> merge point like awaits, promise continuations, or callbacks all <em>are</em>.</p>
<p>The fact we are specifying a behaviour which seemingly no one outside of this group is asking for is very strange to me.</p>

This is a common execution pattern which auto-instrumentation needs to be able to resolve, and it can't be done unless we flow context <em>through</em> merging branches.</p>
<p>This is user code which <em>we do not control</em> but are expected to be able to trace through correctly. There is no user error here because the user expects to not have to modify their code for it to be traceable, and there's no error in how APM vendors are handling these situations because we simply lack the tools for it to be <em>possible</em> to track directly. This was the entire point of creating AsyncLocalStorage in the <em>first</em> place, but it sadly only got <em>part</em> of the way to correctness due to resource constraints and lacking runtime capabilities.</p>

In particular, the concern is that the ability to do an unbounded <code>set()</code> isn't a good situation.  Further, they weren't at all concerned with the visibility issues from pruning off subtasks by binding around them, for two reasons: (1) exact follows-from relationships are primarily relevant for critical path analysis, which already has numerous other issues making it intractable, and (2) we can get a reasonable enough picture with the mutable trace objects referenced in a "lexically scoped" async store (i.e. what's currently proposed here).  The rough structure we use (IIUC) is that the async-local variables are trivially cheap span IDs and the global store is a log of events that includes those IDs.  When a span begins/ends, it gets a new ID the start/end times and parents are appended to the log (along with any additional metadata).  The graph can then be reconstructed later from that log.</p>
<p>I agree completely with Justin's assessment of the <code>doSomething()</code> example - it wouldn't be an issue if <code>doSomething</code> were properly instrumented.  If you branch into two parallel subtasks without making a child span, you're asking for a bad time.</p>
</blockquote></mx-reply><p>For the first part:</p>
<ul>
<li>In what way is critical path analysis intractable? This is literally what tracing products are <em>for</em>.</li>
<li>Mutable trace objects are what the entire industry does <em>presently</em> for Node.js. Every tracing product also has at least 30%+ CPU overhead and 50%+ memory overhead as a result. <em>All</em> tracing products are completely unusable at massive scale, which is why most FAANG is either flying practically <em>blind</em> with Node.js (Netflix), or doesn't use it in production <em>at all</em> because the tooling insufficient</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the second part:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>doSomething()</code> function here is user code calling into some <em>other</em> things we instrument. We have no awareness of this code as it's not part of any userland module, therefore it is impossible for us to instrument. This is an <em>extremely common</em> scenario which tracing products are <em>expected</em> to be able to trace. APM vendors are <em>constantly</em> losing deals because we are unable to product correct traces for many prospective customers.</li>

But maybe this is a "you can't keep your cake and eat it" situation where we're saying that we need to provide this control.  Overall, I don't think the one who calls dispatchEvent is the one who knows which context it should be in.</td></tr>

I suspect this has to do with my starting point.  I (and I think others here) come from a perspective where this is an implicit version of what golang does explicitly with their Context object.  When you pass a Context into a subtask, that task is free to make its own child Contexts with different mappings, but because Context is itself immutable, there's no way for those changes to be visible to the caller.  So from the point of view of seeing this as just a bag for passing implicit parameters, there's no expectation that a callee could change one for a caller (unless the passed object is itself mutable).</p>
<p>If you are instead coming from a perspective where the purpose of this is to provide a mechanism to track execution flow, then I suspect the surprise goes in the opposite direction.  So the question is (1) which of these is AsyncContext intended to be, and (2) is there any reasonable way for it to do both?  Is "context" even the right concept for tracking execution flow, or is there something else that could do it more naturally?</p>
