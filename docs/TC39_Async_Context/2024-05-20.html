Pool mechanisms I would say are almost universally okay to bind globally, but almost <em>every</em> other scenario is a matter of opinion and should (at least in my opinion) probably not bind at all by default and always follow that path through internals because otherwise you end up with these strange flows like with async/await not flowing <em>through</em> awaits the way most users seem to expect.</blockquote></mx-reply>I found this initially surprising, but I'm wondering if this actually makes more sense under the "flow through await" scenario. With preserve-around-await semantics and default registration-time binding, you end up needing a bunch of global binds just to get reasonable behavior. Again, my axiom here is that application code and library/framework code shouldn't need to be aware of each other's variables in order to do the right thing. With preserve-around-await, global binds seems like generally the thing you need to uphold that axiom. But with flow-through-await, I can imagine that maybe that's no longer required, provided you're not somehow picking up promises that came from vastly different contexts, which seems generally unlikely to happen in most common situations.</td></tr>

If you flow <em>through</em> rather than <em>around</em> things then it's <em>generally</em> most advisable to actually bind-per store to only do graph reductions where needed whereas trying to bind <em>around</em> things all over the place takes way more binds and is often inescapable.</p>
<p>It's a lot better to just let things flow <em>through</em> by default and then provide some additional tools to reduce the graph where necessary. In general cases this is just the bind method, but for awaits it might make sense to have a store option to make it auto-bind on awaits or something like that. I <em>personally</em> feel it makes a lot more sense for await binds to be an option rather than a default we need to find a way out of, but I don't care <em>too</em> much either way, so long as the tools can do what is needed in a reasonable way.</p>
