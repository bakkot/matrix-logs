Hello 👋

I wrote down an alternative proposal for the integration of AsyncContext with events, to run the event handlers using the dispatch context rather than the registration context.

I don't know if I will be able to join the meeting on Tuesday (and if I will, I'll be there just for the first 30 minutes), but I'd love if you could take a look :)
