I will miss the AsyncContext meeting, but I want to encourage Googlers to get in touch with Jatin on the CWI Wiz team re: testing AsyncContext. If needed, maybe Igalia could provide them a custom Chrome build including AsyncContext for testing.

sorry I would like to talk about the FinalizationRegistry context issue but I won't be able to today

[08:59:53.0778] <littledan>
but feel free to discuss without me; I'm fine with reaching the other conclusion, but I'd like us to strongly consider simplifying and reducing overall complexity vs Justin's proposal.

Is the AsyncContext meeting open to interested parties who are not delegates?

[10:17:56.0985] <Bradford Smith>
A member of our Google JS/TS Libraries team is very interested in the AsyncContext effort because he needs it for our libraries.

I'm not sure if the meeting is open for anyone to join, but I think we've had at least one meeting where we had some non-delegate

[10:31:15.0641] <Bradford Smith>
I would certainly like Steve to be able to attend if he wishes. I think he likely has some interesting ideas to contribute, and he definitely wants to use the upcoming AsyncContext feature to inform development we need.

[11:01:35.0764] <littledan>
Steve can definitely join; he is a Google employee, and Google is an Ecma member

[11:01:52.0729] <littledan>
the important thing is that intellectual property contributed by Steve is licensed for the standard, which is already covered

[11:02:18.0417] <littledan>
I'd like this call to be open to all relevant experts; please propose any more people who you want to join, and we'll figure out how to get them in.

[11:02:30.0448] <littledan>
this might require signing certain legal agreements to license intellectual property

[11:03:28.0019] <littledan>
did you end up discussing the FinalizationRegistry snapshot question?

[11:06:38.0021] <Andreu Botella>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> did you end up discussing the FinalizationRegistry snapshot question?

in the end we decided to use construction-time

[11:09:31.0063] <Justin Ridgewell>
I think we should be open to anyone. I had invited Steve to join in Jan, but he declined. If he's changed his mind I'd be happy to have him.
