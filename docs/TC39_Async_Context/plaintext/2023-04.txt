Looks like April 18 16:00-17:00 UTC is going to be the winner?

[16:18:10.0219] <Justin Ridgewell>
I wonder if we might do weekly meetings, though, instead of every-other-week?

[16:18:31.0790] <Justin Ridgewell>
There are quite a few issues open issues that we need to work through

[16:34:54.0081] <littledan>
Sure, works for me

Works for me too!

For me it conflicts with a meeting, but the meeting can probably be rescheduled

Chris de Almeida: I think you were made an owner of the TC39 cal?

[21:09:14.0925] <Justin Ridgewell>
Is it possible for you to move the new AsyncContext meeting into TC39?

[08:01:12.0822] <Chris de Almeida>
sure.  TZ is UTC or... ?

[08:04:57.0418] <Justin Ridgewell>
Actually, Jordan helped with this last night

[08:09:41.0668] <Chris de Almeida>
sure -- it appears the meeting IS in UTC.  notably, it will not shift for DST.  is that an issue for anyone?

[08:10:58.0546] <Justin Ridgewell>
Hasn't DST past?

[08:11:17.0795] <Justin Ridgewell>
I think it's fine to use UTC since everyone won't shift times at the sameâ€¦ time.

[08:12:37.0832] <Chris de Almeida>
but it means anyone in countries observing DST, will have the meeting at a different time half the year

[08:14:07.0117] <Chris de Almeida>
so for example, for me right now, the meeting is at 11, but in November it will move to 10 and then in March move back to 11 

[08:15:57.0927] <Chris de Almeida>
usually we would want these meetings to observe DST because most of us (I think) are in TZs that observe DST.  we don't all change over at the same time, but this usually will only manifest in two meetings per year ending up at a different time for people in one of the TZs
