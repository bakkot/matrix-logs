I made some additional changes to the web integration document to clarify certain things

ðŸ‘‹ Hello team!

I wrote another polyfill for this feature. 
It works a bit differently that the current one, it works only by intrumenting the Promise object. 

check it out: https://github.com/iliasbhal/simple-async-context.
It satifies the test suite in the repo + some extra tests that I added.

Let me know what you think ;)

Turns out, they work kind of similary. Few differences here and there:

  - On the strategy used to store data in the context. 
    `simple-async-context` let the garbage collectore reclaim memeory, it won't programmaticaly delete stored data.

  - `simple-async-context` will polyfill timers as well.
  - The way it instruments Promise is slightly different.

Note: We don't programaticaly delete Variable data because otherwise we won't be able access the context from a running timer.

Does this work in Bun, Deno, Node and the Web?

[14:57:36.0791] <Phil>
I wrote a package that now depends on your package: https://code.foss.global/push.rocks/smartcontext, but it does not seem to work in Chrome? Node works though.

I'm getting ReferenceError: setImmediate is not defined

Seems like it can be replaced with setTimeout?

Or are there any caveats for the way AsyncContext works?

updated it a bit to better reflect the idea of async context.
