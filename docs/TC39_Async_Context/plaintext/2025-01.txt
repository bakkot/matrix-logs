ðŸ‘‹ Hello team!

I wrote another polyfill for this feature. 
It works a bit differently that the current one, it works only by intrumenting the Promise object. 

check it out: https://github.com/iliasbhal/simple-async-context.
It satifies the test suite in the repo + some extra tests that I added.

Let me know what you think ;)
