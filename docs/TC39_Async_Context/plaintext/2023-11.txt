yulia: Apropos of MarkM’s analyses of AsyncContext, this is Mark’s work https://github.com/endojs/endo/pull/1424, discussion 1 https://youtu.be/vECr5IDJzpg, and discussion 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28wfHOWCROo

Hey, should we participate in this group? https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Vsdh-DM72AfMg_FIt9yT9ExEWF4A_vRbQ3jRNBe09w/edit#heading=h.9bhcivx2kxus

The Client Instrumentation SIG is primarily focused on the general API and data structure of OpenTelemetry required for efficient data collection from terminals like web page, mobile app. For instance, how to describe a user session and how to co-relate a session to a span.

[01:58:02.0318] <Chengzhong Wu>
The discussion may be generalized and language-agnostic because works in OpenTelemetry specification need to be feasible to implemented in various languages and runtimes.

[01:58:56.0144] <Chengzhong Wu>
Do you find any topic that you are interested and we should connect with the folks in the SIG?

[11:50:14.0022] <littledan>
These docs seem to indicate the interest of that group in this space: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/#status-and-releases

Well, yes, OpenTelemetry client instrumentation is still working in progress. The client includes browser, android, iOS mobile app and the work includes the RUM data model and the semantic convention of event attributes, for instance, an http span should contain a "http.request.method" attribute.

It's high level design of realtime user monitoring.

[00:05:33.0337] <littledan>
Isn’t AsyncContext part of that?

[01:11:51.0698] <Chengzhong Wu>
The client instrumentation SIG is defining a specification for all clients, including browser, android, etc. A better space to discuss a specific language feature would be the SIG for each language implementation, as in the JS SIG: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCyoQK49WVcE-x8oryZOTTToFm7sIeUhxFPm9g-qL1k/edit

I'm in the waiting room. Today's agenda is pretty light

There’s a new meet link, I don’t think there should be a waiting room anymore
