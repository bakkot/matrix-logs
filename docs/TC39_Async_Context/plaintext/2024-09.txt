> <@littledan:matrix.org> I'm curious how your tracing framework deals with these third-party integration cases today, and how well that works out.

It's still at way too early a stage to say, I think.  We've integrated it into a single Angular application (our internal metrics tool, as a dogfood prototype) and are still working on integrating it with Wiz (our internal-only UI framework) to use it in a second product.  So we don't have all that much data yet, though we _did_ end up not monkey-patching `addEventListener` in order to get as far as we have - i.e. events are always in dispatch-context, with async events in the empty context for now.
