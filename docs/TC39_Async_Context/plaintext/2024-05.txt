I think `Variable.wrap` ends up being a very different thing from delimited snapshots -- delimited snapshots operate on sections of the stack that contain (possibly) multiple variables, without the caller needing to know which variables are involved, whereas `Variable.wrap` is a convenience method for something you can already do without any kind of snapshots (global or delimited) as long as you know the variable(s) you want to operate on

Can you write example code of how delimited stacks would work?
