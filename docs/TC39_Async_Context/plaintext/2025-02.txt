I've just checked, and there doesn't appear to be a request for a Mozilla standards position (https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions) for AsyncContext. Given the large potential impact on DOM APIs, we'll definitely want this to go through the standards position process before it advances much further at TC39.

It would really appreciate it if one of the champions would open an issue so we can begin the process. I think Olli and I are the relevant Mozillians to provide feedback.
