I've just checked, and there doesn't appear to be a request for a Mozilla standards position (https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions) for AsyncContext. Given the large potential impact on DOM APIs, we'll definitely want this to go through the standards position process before it advances much further at TC39.

It would really appreciate it if one of the champions would open an issue so we can begin the process. I think Olli and I are the relevant Mozillians to provide feedback.

Hey all... just wanted to follow up... at the remote plenary in december I had put my hand up as a reviewer... unfortunately available time has been quite scarce. However, I am carving out time next week to review the current state of the proposal and will hopefully have that completed by end of next week.

I cannot attend the meeting today, but I wrote down some thoughts about the ergonomics: https://hackmd.io/@nicolo-ribaudo/SJz-ydiqkl

I need to write down "most people, even who work on browser engines, know very little about weak maps" in a post-it note somewhere
