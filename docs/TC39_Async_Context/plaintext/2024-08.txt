- `.get()` is ~50% faster regardless of the number of async resources
- `.get()` is ~15% faster regardless of the number of nested `.run()` calls
- Creating new async resources/promises is 50% to 1400% faster depending on number of resources
    - Itâ€™s 2%-14% slower when no `Variable` are in use?

* 1.  `.get()` is ~50% faster regardless of the number of async resources
2.  `.get()` is ~15% faster regardless of the number of nested `.run()` calls

      - Itâ€™s 2%-14% slower when no `Variable` are in use?

Is there a test for speed of the `.run()` itself?
