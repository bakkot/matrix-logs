How do we not have an example in the README using `await`?

It's mentioned in the motivation, and there is a paragraph specifically about await... but you are right, there is no example on it

I was discussing the Governor proposal with some folks and someone mentioned a question of how it worked with AsyncContext and the async iterator helpers.  In particular, my understanding (though I could be wrong) is that there's a slight mismatch between iterator helpers and hypothetical generator-based implementations of those helpers - in particular iter.map() runs the function in the same context that called next() whereas the trivial function* map() would run the mapper in the initial caller's context.  I would assume the async iterator helpers will be similar - are these assumptions/understandings correct?

(or are we planning to specify registration-time context for (async) iterator helpers?)

Yes it matches those assumptions

(and talking with the observables champion, this week we agreed that observables behave consistently with that btw)
