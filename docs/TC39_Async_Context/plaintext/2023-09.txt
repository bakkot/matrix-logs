This is a good writeup. It should probably also speak to the issue Andreu raised above: when you call .then(cb) and get a new promise, or when you do an await inside of an async function with no catch, the *resulting* promise is the one which has the unhandled rejection, and its rejection site is the one that is used. In those two cases, the rejection site is the place is the same as the creation site.

Hey, I think I might forgotten to mention it here, but we're having a breakout session in TPAC next Wednesday about HTML integration of AsyncContext: https://github.com/w3c/tpac2023-breakouts/issues/39

Yesterday’s AsyncContext breakout unfortunately failed to gather the participation of many stakeholders who we were trying to bring together for discussion. Are we going to have a replacement discussion during this week on the sidelines of TPAC? How is scheduling that going?

[19:59:05.0495] <James M Snell>
That's unfortunate. I had been planning to join but just couldn't make it work with the timezone offset. Will definitely try to make the next one. 

[20:39:29.0921] <littledan>
Would’ve been good to have you but the real missing parties were the browsers. We will try to catch up with them on the sidelines somehow
