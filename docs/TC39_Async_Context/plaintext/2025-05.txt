ðŸ‘‹ Hey team!

I'd like to introduce myself and andrew-cnv . We're working for Canva, a web based online design platform. We're currently looking to improve our telemetry in the product and have come across Async Context.

We were wondering if we could attend the next meeting and get a lay of the land. The future topic on usable polyfills to test with is especially interesting. We were also wondering what are the blockers for this proposal reaching stage 2.7.

Hi! The main blocker for stage 2.7 is figuring out exactly how the context should propagate across the many web APIs, especially events
