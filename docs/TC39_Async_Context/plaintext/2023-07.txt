So, do we want to give a status update at the next TC39 meeting?

[16:31:46.0240] <littledan>
(This should be fine to add after the deadline)

BTW amazing article explaining the value of AsyncContext and WinterCG. Thanks Justin and James for speaking with Mary. https://thenewstack.io/beyond-browsers-the-longterm-future-of-javascript-standards/

littledan: apologies for the delay, missed your message. Didn't talk to neither Anne nor Ms2ger about this just yet..

I'll be traveling next week so I won't be able to make it too.

ok to delete next week's meeting, due to plenary?

[11:16:55.0293] <Justin Ridgewell>
Yes

Hey, I wrote some initial test262 tests: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3874

[09:02:03.0723] <Andreu Botella>
Also, the spec text should be updated to make generators propagate the init snapshot. I will try to do that myself, but I'm not that familiar with execution contexts and all of that

It looks like there are a few spec-created iterators that use the generators machinery internally

[04:36:12.0024] <Andreu Botella>
currently I think this would only allow observing the AsyncContext generators state if you use `Object.defineProperty` to make one of the indexes of an array (or maybe also a regex) have a getter

[04:36:18.0280] <Andreu Botella>
```js
const asyncVar = new AsyncContext.Variable();

const array = [23, 34, 45];
Object.defineProperty(array, 1, {
  get() {
    return asyncVar.get();
  }
});

const iter = asyncVar.run("foo", () => array.values());

asyncVar.run("bar", () => {
    console.log([...iter]);  // [23, "foo", 45]
});
```

[04:36:29.0832] <Andreu Botella>
but this would be more readily observable with iterators helpers

[04:36:32.0952] <Andreu Botella>
 * but this would be more readily observable with iterator helpers

[04:40:10.0506] <Andreu Botella>
```js
const asyncVar = new AsyncContext.Variable();

const array = [23, 34, 45];
const iter1 = array.values();
const iter2 = asyncVar.run("foo", () => {
    return iter1.map(v => [asyncVar.get(), v]);
});
asyncVar.run("bar", () => {
    console.log([...iter2]);  // [["foo", 23], ["foo", 34], ["foo", 45]]
});
```

[04:41:16.0252] <Andreu Botella>
is this expected?

Hey, I have a PR for generator support: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context/pull/61

[10:08:51.0079] <Andreu Botella>
it'd be good to get a thorough review from someone who understands execution contexts and generators more than me, to make sure I haven't missed anything

[10:09:19.0403] <Andreu Botella>
but I think this is enough to have the behavior of restoring the context at initialization

[10:10:33.0365] <Andreu Botella>
or rather, to restore the initialization context the first time the generator is resumed, and then on every yield store the current context to restore that next time

[10:10:57.0850] <Andreu Botella>
although that isn't really needed now that I think about it, since you can't have nested yields

[10:11:36.0890] <Andreu Botella>
 * although that isn't really needed now that I think about it, since you can't have nested yields, or modify the snapshot within a function stack frame

[10:12:03.0548] <Andreu Botella>
I guess I can get rid of the snapshotting on yield then

[10:18:48.0715] <Andreu Botella>
 * although that isn't really needed now that I think about it, since you can't yield the outer generator inside a callback run within it, or modify the snapshot within a function stack frame
