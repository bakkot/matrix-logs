So, do we want to give a status update at the next TC39 meeting?

BTW amazing article explaining the value of AsyncContext and WinterCG. Thanks Justin and James for speaking with Mary. https://thenewstack.io/beyond-browsers-the-longterm-future-of-javascript-standards/

I'll be traveling next week so I won't be able to make it too.

Hey, I wrote some initial test262 tests: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3874

Also, the spec text should be updated to make generators propagate the init snapshot. I will try to do that myself, but I'm not that familiar with execution contexts and all of that

It looks like there are a few spec-created iterators that use the generators machinery internally
