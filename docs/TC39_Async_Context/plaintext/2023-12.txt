Justin Ridgewell: do we use this new link today, or the meeting link shared in the calendar?

Just noticed that the calendar has been updated with the new link.

[09:04:16.0261] <Chengzhong Wu>

me too

[09:07:24.0945] <Chris de Almeida>
I think Justin and Jordan are the only ones with host permission

[09:07:45.0510] <Chris de Almeida>

I did not send cancellation notice for the original meeting, so you may need to manually clear your calendars of the old one

Sorry, conflicting meetings. I thought I redid the meeting to now require me to admit everyone.
