Given that meeting time conflicts were raised, and the next plenary in 3 weeks, how do people think about switching on/off weeks for meetings (other bi-weekly) starting next week?

In terms of events that we wanted to set to dispatch-context from the start, there was mention of same-window `postMessage` (I assume it's nonsense to talk about preserving context when messaging a different window?).  Would `MessageChannel` also be covered here?  (the reason I ask is that I'm working on a userland `aroundEach` for Jasmine - it mostly works, but only if I polyfill context propagation for `MessagePort.prototype.onmessage`)
