Given that meeting time conflicts were raised, and the next plenary in 3 weeks, how do people think about switching on/off weeks for meetings (other bi-weekly) starting next week?

In terms of events that we wanted to set to dispatch-context from the start, there was mention of same-window `postMessage` (I assume it's nonsense to talk about preserving context when messaging a different window?).  Would `MessageChannel` also be covered here?  (the reason I ask is that I'm working on a userland `aroundEach` for Jasmine - it mostly works, but only if I polyfill context propagation for `MessagePort.prototype.onmessage`)

[03:58:14.0909] <Chengzhong Wu>
agree, these tasks are pretty similar and I think we should apply the same policy on them. Contexts should not be preserved across agents. But if the async context variable is explicitly passed to a different window, I don't see it to be a problem to preserve the context?

Given that there is a use case we can surely include it in the list

Yeah I think context preservation should work across realms in the same agent: if they can pass (some) objects to each other, they should be able to preserve the context

[04:00:44.0095] <Andreu Botella>
Part of the reason why we focused on same-window `postMessage` is because that is sometimes used as a scheduler

[04:01:30.0264] <Andreu Botella>
but yeah, it makes sense to extend that to other windows in the same agent, or to `MessageChannel`

[08:46:35.0695] <snek>
i've been playing around with async context and disposables, and i realized they don't really work well together because we don't restore the context around suspend points (except in async generators?). curious if anyone else has thought about this at all.

[08:48:14.0573] <Chengzhong Wu>
async context variable disposable needs https://tc39.es/proposal-async-context/#sec-generatorresume to play well with generator/yield

[08:54:31.0964] <snek>
more specifically i was hoping these two examples would behave the same, but the second one doesn't work because you'd have to restore the context "inside" await, before it returns to the caller. https://gist.github.com/devsnek/2eee5001144f7e39513e3694ca6b3e8d

[10:40:59.0746] <Steve Hicks>
I'm not sure I quite understand your example.  You've written `[[AsyncContext]] = 'FOO'` but (syntax aside) the current proposal doesn't allow just setting the context.  Are you assuming something like
```javascript
{
  using _ = asyncVar.with('FOO');
  foo();
}
```
or are you thinking of something else entirely?

```

[10:49:55.0649] <Steve Hicks>
That said, we're currently thinking about the impact of whether `yield` preserves context (i.e. the initialization context from the initial generator call), or whether it brings in the context from the surrounding `next()` caller (i.e. the dispatch context).  If it uses initialization context then context is sensibly block-scoped, and `using` makes a lot more sense.  If context might change across a `yield` then it's a lot less clear that `using` is at all viable, since the state to clean up at the end of the block scope may have changed out from under it.  So if `yield` exposes the dispatch context, then we're back to reconsidering what an `enterWith` or `set` semantics might look like.  In particular is the question of whether `set` in an inner/outer function body should change the value out from under an outer/inner function.  I.e.
```javascript
async function f() {
  g();  // n.b. not awaited
  x.set(2);
  await 1;
  console.log(y.get()); // 3 ?
}
async function g() {
  await 1;
  console.log(x.get()); // 2 ?
  y.set(3);
}
```

[10:51:40.0257] <Steve Hicks>
and how exactly one sets the boundaries on where mutations _do_ affect

[11:01:42.0265] <nicolo-ribaudo>
snek I'm also not fully understanding your question, but it _seems_ similar to a discussion we had in the past:

```js
runWithContext(1, async () => {
  console.log(getContext()) // 1
  await new Promise(resolve => runWithContext(2, resolve));
  console.log(getContext()) // ?
});
```

Is answering what the second `getContext()` call logs the same as answering your question?

yes i am thinking about a disposable like that

[11:04:40.0555] <snek>
except this doesn't work with async functions because they don't restore the scope on awaits, you're forced to wrap the function.

[11:13:50.0465] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Async functions capture the scope right before pausing and restore them when resuming:

- right before pausing, step 7 of await (https://tc39.es/ecma262/#await) calls PerformPromiseThen
- step 7 of PerformPromiseThen (https://tc39.es/proposal-async-context/#sec-performpromisethen) takes a snapshot of the async context

- when the promise is resolved, step 1.d of the reaction job created in NewPromiseReactionJob (https://tc39.es/proposal-async-context/#sec-newpromisereactionjob) restores the context before running the code after the await

[11:14:50.0926] <snek>
that's not exactly what i'm talking about

[11:16:06.0426] <snek>
its about code that effectively uses `enterWith`

[11:18:03.0415] <snek>
i'm referring to specifically when the async function is suspended, it does not restore the context. additionally, the promise reactions capture and restore their context. i'm basically suggesting that async function body evaluation should do the same.

[11:18:34.0347] <snek>
 * i'm referring to specifically when the async function is suspended, it does not restore the context. additionally, as you noted, the promise reactions capture and restore their context. i'm basically suggesting that async function body evaluation should do the same.

[11:18:59.0285] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh you mean that before pausing they restore the context that was active before that the code in the async function run?

[11:19:17.0517] <snek>
ye

[11:19:18.0594] <snek>
 * yes

[11:19:43.0197] <snek>
this is only relevant if you can "mutate" async variables though, which the proposal currently does not allow

[11:19:58.0063] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok -- just within the current AsyncContext itself this seems to be only editorial right? It's not observable, and it only becomes observable if somebody builds a new API that behaves like async context and uses the same propagation mechanism

[11:20:49.0859] <snek>
idk if i'd call it editorial but yes the functionality would be something the host builds on top, not something the js api currently exposes

[11:22:02.0433] <snek>
 * idk if i'd call it editorial but yes the functionality would be something the host could build on top of, not something the js api currently exposes

[11:22:21.0859] <Justin Ridgewell>
There are various changes to the spec we’ll need to make if we ever add `using` support. Right now they’re not necessary to make.

[12:54:11.0067] <Steve Hicks>
But if we're contemplating either (1) making `yield` bring in the dispatch-context, or (2) exposing `enterWith`, then it's possible that we're already painting ourselves into a corner where `using` is a non-starter.

[12:54:49.0538] <Steve Hicks>
To be clear, this I'm not convinced that this is a problem, but I do think it's worth at least some thought

[12:56:00.0594] <Steve Hicks>
In particular, if you have `enterWith` then presumably you can implement `using` semi-reasonably in userland.

[12:56:37.0828] <snek>
using can be done in terms of enterWith, but you will get behavior that is probably not what you want unless the context is restored properly at suspend points

[12:56:55.0210] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'd really prefer that, if we do one of those two in the language, we do `using`. It's much harder to make mistakes with it

[12:57:47.0619] <snek>
i am generally a fan of what `using` can enable with this, for example `using span = tracer.createSpan()`. all i'd ask for at this point is that we don't prevent that from happening in the future.

[13:00:07.0295] <Steve Hicks>
IIRC, The concern with `using` today was that it wasn't sufficiently hermetic.

[13:00:45.0755] <Steve Hicks>
i.e. what happens if you write `tracer.createSpan()[Symbol.enter()]` and then never dispose it?

[13:00:55.0723] <Steve Hicks>
 * i.e. what happens if you write `tracer.createSpan()[Symbol.enter]()` and then never dispose it?

[13:01:20.0628] <Steve Hicks>
Of course, that's less concerning if `enterWith` is already a possibility

[13:01:43.0778] <Steve Hicks>
(effectively the above _is_ `enterWith` IIUC)

[13:02:10.0533] <snek>
yes i would say this is equiv to providing enterWith

[13:02:53.0027] <snek>
though if we start to seal up some of the things like context leaking out of suspends, the "never dispose" problem becomes less and less of a danger to callers

[13:02:57.0532] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I did have concerns with `using` because the proposal makes it trivial to just forget `using`. However, `using` with some check that you actually get Symbol.dispose would be much better than enterWith, since it makes it hard to *accidentally* forget to close the context

[13:03:25.0656] <Steve Hicks>
but it still leaves the question of what happens if you write
```
const d1 = v.enter(1);
d1[Symbol.enter]();
const d2 = v.enter(2);
d2[Symbol.enter]();
d1[Symbol.dispose]();
d2[Symbol.dispose]();
```
?

[13:04:37.0456] <Steve Hicks>
> <@devsnek:matrix.org> though if we start to seal up some of the things like context leaking out of suspends, the "never dispose" problem becomes less and less of a danger to callers

Not sure what you mean about context leaking out of suspends - IIUC this is already sealed up, though `enterWith` _could_ (depending on spec) cause a problem

[13:05:04.0720] <snek>
yes i mean if this functionality exists

[13:05:34.0962] <ljharb>
as a separate topic, i don't really grok the details of the proposal personally, but it seems like a number of node core collaborators are unhappy with the design of the proposal (in ways i also don't understand). i don't think it would be appropriate to advance an implementation that isn't also useful in node, so before seeking advancement, can yall please ensure their concerns are explained and hopefully addressed?

[13:06:39.0045] <nicolo-ribaudo>
As far as I understand, the "problem with Node.js" is that they have to APIs for setting the context, and this proposal is only defining one leaving the second one as a follow-up proposal

[13:06:45.0270] <Steve Hicks>

However, `using` with some check that you actually get Symbol.dispose would be much better than enterWith, since it makes it hard to *accidentally* forget to close the context

At the time we were talking about forcing the use of `using` so that it was syntactically guaranteed to be correct - but Ron Buckton had an issue with composability.  snek's example of `tracer.createSpan()` exactly demonstrates the composability problem, since `createSpan` would need to call `[Symbol.enter]` and `[Symbol.dispose]` directly rather than syntactically.

[13:06:53.0714] <nicolo-ribaudo>
* As far as I understand, the "problem with Node.js" is that they have two APIs for setting the context, and this proposal is only defining one leaving the second one as a follow-up proposal

In this example, I'm hoping we can make it throw at the second call somehow

  await 1;
  console.log(v.get());
}
{
  using _ = v.enter(2);
  f();
}

well i know how they work given the current spec text

[13:15:15.0685] <Steve Hicks>
they don't work at all under the current spec text

[13:15:21.0773] <Steve Hicks>
because `enter` isn't a thing
