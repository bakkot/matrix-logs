I just realized that V8 implements async functions as generators

[04:42:47.0396] <Andreu Botella>
I wonder if making generators work with AsyncContext would have any effect on async functions

[07:50:13.0403] <shu>
doesn't... everyone implement async functions as generators?

[07:50:25.0033] <shu>
even transpilers do i thought

[07:51:44.0930] <Andreu Botella>
implementing AsyncContext in V8 is my first time working on a JS engine

[07:52:09.0171] <Andreu Botella>
so this is new to me

[07:55:47.0537] <shu>
ah

[07:56:07.0964] <shu>
basically the suspend/resumption mechanism you need for generators and async functions are the same, so you just build it once

[07:56:32.0802] <shu>
regardless whether a resume point is a yield or an await, still a resume point

[07:58:04.0451] <Andreu Botella>
yeah, I get that

[07:58:29.0201] <Andreu Botella>
actually I watched a livestream Yulia did implementing async functions in SM a number of years ago, so it didn't quite come as a shock that this worked that way

[07:59:01.0507] <Andreu Botella>
I just hadn't realized that that would be the case when starting to think about changing generators here

[08:03:19.0099] <littledan>
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the redundancy here is unobservable (the promise reaction will "already" queue up the right AsyncContext)

Thereâ€™s a great babel transform that implements them as purely promises, but only for a lintable subset that excludes some loop patterns. It never got to Babel core tho, sadly.
