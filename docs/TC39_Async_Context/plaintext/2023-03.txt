We have spec text! https://tc39.es/proposal-async-context/

[10:21:55.0814] <Justin Ridgewell>
I think the only surprising change is the addition of `[[Construct]]` on wrapped callbacks:
```
const Foo = AsyncContext.wrap(class Foo {});

// The wrapper will invoke construct on the wrapped function
new Foo();
```


[10:22:15.0862] <Justin Ridgewell>
This comes from the behavior of `Function.p.bind`

[12:25:31.0724] <littledan>
yeah I am OK with including or omitting the [[Construct]] behavior

[12:42:18.0394] <littledan>
the spec would probably be clearer if we could use whatwg infra algorithms

[12:42:28.0516] <littledan>
(for the mapping)

[12:43:39.0074] <littledan>
we should probably think about exposing reusable algorithms (for web specs) for get and run, but this is an editorial thing

[12:44:08.0692] <littledan>
it might be nicer editorially if we avoided SameValueZero; SameValue or simply = is enough. (But the nicest would be to say that it's a mapping...)

[12:44:31.0584] <littledan>
anyway I don't see any bugs in the spec; looks good for Stage 2 to me

[12:48:11.0181] <Andreu Botella>
IIRC the `setTimeout` infrastructure in HTML jumps off-thread to sleep, and then queues a task on the event loop

[12:48:31.0000] <Andreu Botella>
a wrapped `setTimeout` would have to "send" a snapshot off-thread

[12:48:36.0678] <Andreu Botella>
is that fine, as long as the values are not read?

[12:49:05.0180] <littledan>
I'm not sure if it should be phrased like that

[12:49:23.0828] <littledan>
I hope that you can work with ms2ger and Yoav on a proposed wording here

[12:50:01.0165] <littledan>
I think queued tasks would often carry asynccontext snapshots with them, but that snapshot shouldn't ever logically leave the main thread

[12:50:35.0272] <Andreu Botella>
 * a `setTimeout` that wraps the callback would have to "send" a snapshot off-thread

[12:51:04.0549] <littledan>
in any case, you'll want to have clean abstract algorithms for creating an AsyncContext, and get and run, so that the embedding spec doesn't need to call the actual JS functions


2023-03-09
[11:49:40.0549] <littledan>
We really need to execute on improving the motivation section of the async context readme, especially for the web use cases. Here's a summary of use cases I have in mind:

- Prioritizing threads of control, along the lines of https://github.com/WICG/scheduling-apis , and inheriting these priorities across callbacks and async/await (both the built-in mechanism and JS-level mechanisms)
- Collecting performance information across logical asynchronous threads of control, including both timings and with OpenTelemetry. See this project which can only work with async/await if you use a custom transpiler: https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-js/classes/_opentelemetry_context_zone_peer_dep.ZoneContextManager.html
- There's some other use case with React Cache but I don't fully understand it.
- We have other use cases within Bloomberg in the Terminal to track different logical "applications" which run in the same JS heap, but I'm not sure if anyone else runs into these issues. (We also want to make more use of OpenTelemetry)

[11:49:51.0437] <littledan>
Every time I talk with a web person about this proposal, they are confused for this exact reason

[11:50:22.0838] <littledan>
Can someone take the action to make a PR to the async context readme on this topic? If not, please let me know and I'll try to eventually do it (but might not have time before this meeting)

[11:51:31.0492] <littledan>

also: Are we putting AsyncContext on the agenda for this TC39 meeting? We need to decide by tomorrow and add it if so.

[11:52:55.0989] <Andreu Botella>
Chengzhong mentioned in the WinterCG meeting that the idea was to propose it for stage 2 for this TC39 plenary


[11:53:43.0367] <littledan>
Good, let's put it on the agenda then

[11:54:05.0972] <littledan>
it will need to have this web motivation better documented for this plenary

[11:54:49.0766] <littledan>
This will also be important to have written down significantly before the March 16th WebPerf WG call which will discuss AsyncContext

[11:56:51.0465] <Andreu Botella>
is there some link for the react use case?

[11:57:19.0461] <littledan>
(I only know of the description in Justin's slides... IMO the others are sufficient to start with)

[11:57:55.0101] <Andreu Botella>
ok, I'll make a PR for that

[14:05:26.0961] <littledan>
https://www.w3.org/webperf/

[14:05:46.0221] <littledan>
I think a lot of the strongest use cases for AsyncContext in the web are around performance metrics, so we're going to discuss this there.

[15:08:00.0698] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
If we (non-champions) have additional use cases to suggest, should we open issues on the proposal repo? Or sketch them here?

[15:19:38.0577] <littledan>
Either an issue, here, or an explainer PR would all be good and helpful!

Working on slides now

[23:26:27.0911] <Justin Ridgewell>
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LLcZxYyuQ1DhBH1htvEFp95PkeYM5nLSrlQoOmWpYEI/edit#slide=id.p

[06:31:43.0567] <littledan>
Great, thanks for writing slides, Justin, these look really good! Some notes:
- IMPORTANT: right before Slide 2, insert a slide which quickly lists some use cases (including at least 2 client-side use cases, plus a third thing which is internal infrastructure within web standards [Yoav's thing]); hopefully this can also link to Andreu's more detailed description at the top of the README [The rest of these comments are nits, but the motivation is key.]
- In Slide 4, note explicitly that this is what Promise .then, setTimeout, etc would do. [Or: Consider consolidating slides 3 and 4 into something which just shows the interface, saving the pseudocode implementation for a bonus slide. I am undecided on whether we should do this]
- Write somewhere on the slides that we consider all of the questions raised to be things that we aim to resolve between Stage 2 and Stage 3. Emphasize this especially for the web platform integration and unhandled rejection context--these must be spelled out, and we plan to work with Yoav Weiss on this, who was already thinking in this direction for the previously mentioned internal use case.
- The constructor parameters idea is really superficial; should it really be the first slide? Maybe we should start with the important issues. [Also IMO the parameter order should be reversed but that's a comment I should make in the issue]
- The web platform doesn't have a lot of cases to consider because it's weird--this is just an inherent difficulty with AsyncContext wherever it's done. I think "case by case" might make it sound too bad--we'll have some organizing principles, we just don't have a proposal yet. The proposal here will be a precondition for Stage 3. (BTW: Avoid saying "a Stage $n question" because people use this term both to mean, a precondition to enter $n or something to discuss during $n)
- Focus on explaining next steps towards resolution when presenting each of these slides.
[More notes to come, have to go]

[08:24:06.0825] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
speaking of constructor parameters, I really like the `defaultValue` idea, though I suppose you could subclass `AsyncContext` to add functionality like that if you wanted it

[08:24:56.0847] <Andreu Botella>
could you? since you'd need to wrap all uses of the `AsyncContext` in a `run`, I think

[08:25:25.0719] <Andreu Botella>
oh, by overriding `get` I guess

[08:28:01.0561] <James M Snell>
I've also been asked about the possibility of setting up a construction-time default value but really don't think it's a good idea. I imagine that it would have the same basic effect as `asyncLocalStorage.enterWith(...)`, modifying the state of the current async context unless it is defined as "use this value as the default if the current storage for this is undefined"

[08:29:40.0661] <James M Snell>
if that's the semantic, then I can get on board with it, but if setting the value on the constructor actually modifies the async context, definitely not

[08:35:04.0504] <Andreu Botella>
I'm not familiar with the `AsyncLocalStorage` API, but I don't think I understand the difference between those two options

[08:35:10.0229] <Andreu Botella>
would it lead to any observable difference?

[08:35:39.0615] <Andreu Botella>
oh, is this about snapshot?

[08:35:56.0518] <Andreu Botella>
 * oh, is this about wrap?

[08:36:57.0377] <Justin Ridgewell>
The default value would only be returned if the mapping can’t be found in the global state

[08:37:17.0588] <Justin Ridgewell>
You wouldn’t be able to modify the context instance after the fact

[08:37:32.0511] <Justin Ridgewell>
So just modifying the get method’s last step

[08:38:49.0939] <James M Snell>
So I guess the key question then is what happens in the `AsyncLocalStorage.exit(...)` case, which Node.js defines as exiting the context scope but we've implemented as being equivalent to `als.run(undefined, () => {})`

[08:39:42.0930] <Justin Ridgewell>
Setting to an explicit undefined isn’t the same as no found mapping, so you’d get undefined

[08:40:07.0987] <James M Snell>
e.g. what would you expect in the following:

```
const als = new AsyncLocalStorage({ defaultValue: 'foo' });
als.run(123, () => {
  als.exit(() => {
    console.log(als.getStore()); // undefined or foo?
  }
})
```

[08:41:42.0488] <Justin Ridgewell>
Undefined, but it could really be either. AsyncContext doesn’t have an exit method, so this is really just Node

[08:42:24.0627] <Andreu Botella>
if this is only something that is a concern when implementing `AsyncLocalStorage` in terms of `AsyncContext`, I'm not sure that's enough to block this addition

[08:42:40.0310] <Andreu Botella>
it can surely be implemented anyway with an additional layer of indirection, right?

[08:43:10.0374] <James M Snell>
yeah, I think I just wanted to make sure that adding the default value does not actually modify the current storage context

[08:43:23.0307] <James M Snell>
if it's local to the `AsyncContext` instance itself, then +1

[09:24:32.0511] <Andreu Botella>
> <@abotella:igalia.com> is there some link for the react use case?

If we don't include the React or Bloomberg Terminal use cases, it seems like the only non-browser-internal use cases we have logging, timing and OpenTelemetry

[09:25:55.0755] <Andreu Botella>
the browser-internal use cases are relevant, of course, but it'd be great to have more use cases for having `AsyncContext` as an actual JS built-in

[10:00:40.0253] <Andreu Botella>
https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context/pull/30

[12:32:33.0693] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
here are a dozen use cases (some overlapping) I pulled from some old notes: https://gist.github.com/benjamn/f901cdc634a2d6e29542c32330208a87

[12:34:20.0254] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
I'd love some guidance on which of those sound more/less interesting, or need clarification/elaboration, so I can prioritize which ones I turn into issues

[13:06:31.0659] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
fwiw, the use case I care most about is https://gist.github.com/benjamn/f901cdc634a2d6e29542c32330208a87#file-topological_dependency_tracking-md

[13:17:10.0945] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>

[04:04:53.0654] <Andreu Botella>
Aren't the snapshot requirements on `HostMakeJobCallback` and `HostCallJobCallback` a bit too loose?

[04:05:15.0254] <Andreu Botella>
we don't want hosts to populate `[[AsyncContextSnapshot]]` with any snapshot whatsoever

[04:42:39.0205] <Andreu Botella>
I opened https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context/pull/31 to tighten those requirements

[04:52:20.0744] <littledan>
> <@abotella:igalia.com> I opened https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context/pull/31 to tighten those requirements

This PR LGTM but I think we should really refactor the PR to make abstract operations for run and get. Then, this PR would say, the AsyncContext must be created by run

[04:52:20.0994] <littledan>
(This implies a tighter host limitation, otherwise hosts could do anything run does)

[04:52:21.0164] <littledan>
I would also mention JS-implemented scheduling and, delete the last bullet point (access limitation) as I think a lot of people will be skeptical of it and it will throw off the discussion 

[04:52:21.0337] <littledan>
Sorry I didn’t review Andreu’s PR earlier. Let’s avoid the term “asynchronous callstack” as it is confusing and misleading (doesn’t make it clear that run has to be explicit). Instead, we are talking about the asynchronous flow of control.

[04:58:14.0203] <littledan>
Also would be good if the spec had a sort of introduction that linked to the readme

[04:58:35.0858] <littledan>
Maybe it should begin with the definition of the AsyncContext class and then go into how it works

[04:58:46.0877] <littledan>
(Again, apologies for the delayed review )

[05:14:22.0423] <Andreu Botella>
Huh, it looks like `Atomics.waitAsync`'s `HostResolveInAgent` leaves *everything* to the host, rather than using `HostMakeJobCallback` and `HostCallJobCallback`

[05:15:59.0429] <Andreu Botella>
should it be up to the host whether the callback gets wrapped there?

[05:17:38.0915] <littledan>
Let’s leave any proposed refactorings there for later (since we will learn what html wants as this proposal evolves, and no need to duplicate the debate)

[05:18:13.0158] <Andreu Botella>
sure

[05:18:55.0733] <littledan>
We can just note that this state of the spec might mean that TC39 might not hold us to a very meaningful layering

[05:18:56.0567] <Andreu Botella>
I just have been learning a bit about low-level concurrency and was trying to make sense of the atomics and memory model parts of the spec, and I noticed this slightly intersected with AsyncContext

[05:19:15.0834] <littledan>
Hopefully the layering can be expressed more by the structure of the spec and less by requirements 

[05:19:33.0690] <littledan>
Requirements end up being really unclear 

[05:25:13.0732] <littledan>
It is great that you noticed this connection btw, even if it is not actionable right now 

[07:10:55.0615] <Andreu Botella>
the way the spec is written right now, `AsyncContext.wrap` doesn't check if the argument is a function, but it does check if it's a constructor

[07:11:13.0528] <Andreu Botella>
in order to figure out whether to make the wrapped function a constructor or not

[07:11:26.0114] <Andreu Botella>
do we want this behavior?

[07:12:40.0654] <Andreu Botella>
also, `AsyncContextWrappedFunctionCreate` is defined to take a function object as its first argument, which isn't the case since `AsyncContext.wrap` doesn't check that

[07:13:02.0862] <littledan>
I guess we should eagerly check for callability, as this is what .bind does

[07:13:37.0555] <littledan>
btw if Function.prototype.bind doesn't work for class declarations (just old-style classes), does that mean its [[Construct]] behavior is thought of as "legacy"? In this case, should we not bother replicating it?

[08:55:41.0991] <rbuckton>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> btw if Function.prototype.bind doesn't work for class declarations (just old-style classes), does that mean its [[Construct]] behavior is thought of as "legacy"? In this case, should we not bother replicating it?

How does `Function.prototype.bind` not work? You can `new` the result, but you can't subclass it without fixing `.prototype` first:
```js
class C {}
let C1 = C.bind(null);
new C1() instanceof C; // true

class D extends C1 {} // TypeError: Class extends vlaue does not have a valid prototype property
C1.prototype; // undefined

C1.prototype = C.prototype;
class D1 extends C1 {} // ok
```

[11:48:42.0905] <littledan>
oh well Function.prototype.bind throws on things which are not callable. I forgot about how classes are callable and they just throw.

[12:01:33.0943] <ljharb>
it's so baffling to me that the call/construct slots were basically made useless with things like that

[12:08:33.0557] <littledan>
yes, it makes me feel like it was a mistake to have a [[Construct]] hook in the first place

[12:19:33.0380] <ljharb>
i mean it'd be super useful to have both slots actually mean what they're called, but short of that having two is silly

[12:51:46.0829] <rbuckton>
I'd love for a "call constructor" to be valid in the language. It'll be possible to write a user-space `@Callable` decorator, I think, but you would have to replace the constructor with a regular `function` to do so. A native `@Callable` that does the same thing could just replace the `[[Construct]]` slot.

[12:54:49.0046] <rbuckton>
What's weird to me is that `class` has a `[[Call]]` that throws, but `() => {}` doesn't have a `[[Construct]]` at all (even one that throws).

Fixing this in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context/pull/32. Thanks for catching this!

[04:02:46.0454] <Andreu Botella>
Do we want values in the async context mapping to be ECMAScript language values?

[04:03:30.0390] <Andreu Botella>
I was thinking that maybe Yoav Weiss's task attribution could be defined in terms of storing an HTML spec-level value on the mapping for a symbol that's not associated to any `AsyncContext` instance

`AsyncContext.prototype.get` could then assert that the gotten value is an ECMAScript language value

[05:26:43.0282] <littledan>
yes, I think this would be a good direction for part of the refactoring patch which also exposes abstract operations for get, run, and the AsyncContext constructor.


2023-03-16
[03:23:10.0825] <Andreu Botella>
Don't know about you, but I thought the idea was to implement task attribution *on top of* AsyncContext, rather than the other way around

[03:23:24.0752] <Andreu Botella>
but implementing it on top of task attribution seems to be what Yoav is proposing

[03:23:38.0144] <Andreu Botella>
 * but implementing AsyncContext on top of task attribution seems to be what Yoav is proposing

[03:29:22.0276] <Andreu Botella>
I wonder what the folks from server-side V8-based runtimes think about that

[07:08:17.0882] <James M Snell>
so the way we handle things in workers... What we actually store using the v8 API is an embedder object wrapped in a js object. We call this embedder object an "Async Context Frame" (or frame for short). That frame maintains a mapping of `StorageKey` to JS Value. Every `AsyncLocalStorage` instance (equivalent to `AsyncContext`) represents one `StorageKey`. Whenever `als.run(...)` is called, we create a new frame as a clone of the current and set the new value associated with that key. "Capturing" the current context just means holding a reference to whatever frame is current 

[07:09:15.0060] <James M Snell>
What's nice about this design is that we can (and do) have `StorageKey` instances that are not associated with a specific `AsyncLocalStorage` instance

[07:11:13.0516] <James M Snell>
the values actually stored are also ECMAScript language values

[07:11:36.0784] <James M Snell>
but those could be externals (js objects wrapping embedder objects) 

[07:39:54.0995] <Andreu Botella>
Hm, I guess if task attribution gets spec'd in the web platform, and it is used for the scheduler API, that would fall under WinterCG

[07:40:26.0752] <Andreu Botella>
and no matter how that gets implemented in V8, V8-based WinterCG runtimes could handle it the same way as Chromium

[07:42:34.0686] <Andreu Botella>
so it might not matter that the current async context snapshot is not managed by V8 itself

[07:43:11.0286] <littledan>
Andreu Botella: What is the difference? Is there some conversation happening somewhere that I'm missing?

[07:46:29.0877] <Andreu Botella>
 * oh, rereading that I now realized that the doc was framing AsyncContext as a web API rather than a JS built-in, so it wouldn't actually be implemented in V8 if that is accepted

[07:47:15.0983] <James M Snell>
yeah from our perspective (workers) it won't matter to us so long as we can keep using that v8 api to propagate the context

[07:48:27.0170] <James M Snell>
I rather like the way the API works currently because it makes things super simple for us

[07:51:59.0241] <Andreu Botella>
in terms of spec layering (which might not correspond at all to how V8/Chromium implement it), if AsyncContext is still spec'd in TC39 rather than in the web specs, task attribution would have to depend on it

also I think they should reference OpenTelemetry (maybe with a link to the zone.js library)

[12:53:36.0804] <littledan>
Both the slides and the explainer make several references to "asynchronous callstack". I would like to discourage folks from using that term, as I think it confusingly implies that we're doing something more similar to Yoav's TaskAttribution. We're not saving a callstack with the whole asynchronous history or building a derivation tree of everything; we're just preserving stuff stashed in .run() through an asynchronous flow of control.

[12:57:19.0528] <littledan>
So I'd suggest saying, "asynchronous flow of control", or especially better if we say something more concrete, e.g., "Annotating logs with information related to a particular logically related series of operations, even with callbacks and promises" (or, maybe there's a better way to put that, idk)

[12:58:30.0434] <littledan>
in particular: the logical "async stack" can sometimes grow in an unbounded way by accident by just chaining operations. Yoav's system handles this in a lossy way--things can fall off a circular buffer. We're specifically hoping to avoid this by making .run() explicit.

[12:59:00.0722] <littledan>
[though I guess we do need to decide what to do on stack overflow/excessive growth, which can still happen with .run()]

> <@littledan:matrix.org> How did the WebPerf WG meeting to, Chengzhong Wu ?

as far as I can tell, the initial feedback is positive (slides of the talk: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cmAUbNUsqkuO6gMjhPaEcVGHuCJFYluntw7AIPETGaI/edit?usp=sharing)

[20:08:12.0421] <littledan>

[20:12:04.0046] <littledan>
The use cases there are very interesting. Maybe it would be useful to link that deck from the readme

And possibly go into it at TC39 as well if there is skepticism raised 

[20:13:21.0604] <littledan>
(Could be pasted on as bonus slides?)

[20:24:35.0578] <Chengzhong Wu>
yeah, we can bring the use case slides up when needed.

Agreed. "async stack" sounds like we are preserving the exact call stacks but this is not accurate.

apologies! should be now

[01:34:52.0268] <Yoav Weiss>
If I can try to summarize the feedback: RUM providers would be very interested in being able to keep track of operations that are a result of a certain AsyncContext

[01:35:33.0479] <Yoav Weiss>
e.g. "This element timing entry is a result of a user click on element X" is something they'd love to be able to surface to their customers

[01:36:12.0512] <Yoav Weiss>
It was unclear from the conversation if the current API enables them to achieve that without over-instrumentation of their customers' code (which they prefer not to do)

[01:38:26.0156] <Yoav Weiss>
But maybe magicaly surfacing the AsyncContext data in PerfObserver entries can help them do that if they wrap addEventListener callbacks

[01:50:17.0667] <Chengzhong Wu>
> <@yoavweiss:matrix.org> It was unclear from the conversation if the current API enables them to achieve that without over-instrumentation of their customers' code (which they prefer not to do)

Yeah, this can be another interesting topic that we can discuss about. Node.js provides experimental [`diagnostics_channel`](https://nodejs.org/api/diagnostics_channel.html#diagnostics-channel) for library providers to expose certain events, for example: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/main/docs/api/DiagnosticsChannel.md.

[01:54:19.0326] <Chengzhong Wu>
I don't think async context is the exact only tool helping in this problem.

[02:01:09.0854] <Yoav Weiss>
(dunno much about the implementation complexity of actually doing that in V8)

[04:43:21.0548] <Andreu Botella>
Is `AsyncContext.wrap` only needed in userland JS with things like non-builtin promise libraries?

[04:44:14.0441] <Andreu Botella>
I was mostly thinking of it from an implementation perspective where you have to wrap when enqueuing promise jobs and other tasks

[04:45:00.0954] <Andreu Botella>
 * I was mostly thinking of it from an implementation perspective where you have to wrap when enqueuing promise jobs and other tasks, so I hadn't really thought about how it'd be used in userland

[04:45:11.0404] <Andreu Botella>
but I guess it's only really useful at that same level of abstraction

[04:54:40.0675] <James M Snell>
Yoav Weiss: I think what you describe there matches what we're doing in workers. We do have cases where we gave to grab a strong reference the current frame (taskscope in your proposal) and enter it manually (for instance, when queuing unhandled rejection events, or setTimer/setInterval... We also use it for tracing internally). If we had to implement task attribution apis in the runtime I don't think that's too much of a problem tho I would need to see more of what's involved. 

[06:01:38.0291] <littledan>
> <@abotella:igalia.com> and no matter how that gets implemented in V8, V8-based WinterCG runtimes could handle it the same way as Chromium

I don't think this is the case, because Node.js at least needs to be able to host Chrome at the same time. So there's value in the "multiplexing" of different variables being at the V8 level, rather than the blink level. Is that right, James M Snell ?

[06:01:59.0732] <Andreu Botella>
oh, that's right, Electron

[06:06:48.0825] <James M Snell>
Yep that's exactly it. As long as embedders can capture a reference to the entire frame at a point in time when necessary. 

[06:07:14.0869] <James M Snell>
Having v8 manage it for us is best

[10:26:12.0921] <Justin Ridgewell>
> <@yoavweiss:matrix.org> It was unclear from the conversation if the current API enables them to achieve that without over-instrumentation of their customers' code (which they prefer not to do)

I'm also not certain how they collect their data. If it's anything like OTEL, then we should be pretty good.

[10:28:06.0415] <Justin Ridgewell>
> <@abotella:igalia.com> Is `AsyncContext.wrap` only needed in userland JS with things like non-builtin promise libraries?

It's also useful when firing batches of handlers with a framework level event listener. Eg, I don't want to install a click listener on every element, I just want one at the root and it'll fire the handlers for the specific element that was clicked.

[10:29:10.0288] <littledan>
right, any time you have an API which takes a callback and the API logically "schedules" that callback, it might be a good idea to use .wrap()

[10:34:09.0267] <Justin Ridgewell>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> So I'd suggest saying, "asynchronous flow of control", or especially better if we say something more concrete, e.g., "Annotating logs with information related to a particular logically related series of operations, even with callbacks and promises" (or, maybe there's a better way to put that, idk)

I disagree with this. I think explaining this in terms of the async callstack is the perfect way, because people already have a understanding of how that propagates

[10:34:59.0678] <Justin Ridgewell>
I don't think the we imply that we're capturing the actual function calls anywhere

[10:44:08.0635] <Justin Ridgewell>
Particularly for cases like `await promiseFromAnotherContext`, is the context after that await the one from the promise? That would follow control flow, but describing it as the the callstack clears up that confusion

[10:44:31.0187] <Justin Ridgewell>
And, it's easy to explain why the context contains a certain value, just poke up the callstack in the dev tools

[11:13:19.0130] <littledan>
> <@jridgewell:matrix.org> I don't think the we imply that we're capturing the actual function calls anywhere

Huh, what does the term callstack mean to you?

[11:14:10.0163] <littledan>
Anyway I am just trying to help you make things are clear, it’s your call how to present it


2023-03-22
[17:30:53.0389] <littledan>
I had some quick chats today at TC39 with dminor and bakkot, everyone seemed cautiously positive though a little uncertain about use cases. I am optimistic about the presentation but we might consider adding bonus slides that go in more depth there (eg just taking what was in legendecas’s webperf wg slides)

[17:31:50.0503] <littledan>
I didn’t get the feeling that the complexity around what things are wrapped was considered a very bad issue for either (just something to work out) but maybe I misunderstood them

[17:32:02.0818] <littledan>
Good luck this week on proposing for Stage 2!

[08:16:26.0038] <James M Snell>
So, here's a question. fetch has the `Response` object. This can be created using a `ReadableStream` object, which uses a number of internal promises to manage state. In workerd, we have a method that handles received requests and can return a `Response` object specifying the response to an http request. So, imagine a case like:

```
const als = new AsyncLocalStorage(); // or AsyncContext
export default {
  async fetch(req) {
    const readable = als.run('abc', () => new ReadableStream({
      pull(c) {
        c.error(new Error(`boom ${als.getStore()}`));
      }
    }));
    return als.run(123, () => new Response(readable));
  }
}
```

The actual pipe from the readable happens by the code that calls the `fetch` function handler here, which is running in the root async context where `als` store will be `undefined`.

What value would you expect `als.getStore()` to return when the error is constructed?

[08:17:37.0762] <James M Snell>
Keep in mind that the pull function can be called at different times depending on the value of the `highWaterMark` configured for the readablestream

[08:23:18.0220] <James M Snell>
specifically, pull might be called when the ReadableStream is created, and any time after while it is being read

[08:52:15.0163] <Justin Ridgewell>
I don't have a good answer. Just from the use case I recognize that it must be one of the two (and not `undefined` just because the `Response` object is leaked out of the fetch), but I don't have a good idea of which one of these contexts is the "registration" context

[08:53:59.0839] <Justin Ridgewell>
In my experience, the contexts are the same. I create the readable and the response in the same overall context, so the distinction doesn't matter

[08:56:02.0429] <James M Snell>
That's fair. What I suspect is that for web apis, once AsyncContext is integrated, we'll need a way of identifying in webidl which types are expected to capture and propagate the async context

[08:56:38.0210] <James M Snell>
It's going to be needed regardless of where AsyncContext ultimately gets defined (tc39 or whatwg, etc)

[10:51:00.0200] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
Here’s my take: if/once `AsyncContext` becomes an official part of the language, utilities like `ReadableStream` could (backwards compatibly!) begin to support a contract whereby the context in effect at `ReadableStream` construction time is automatically restored each time `pull` and other callbacks are called

[10:51:20.0626] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
In the meantime (potentially for a long time), you might need to take matters into your own hands using `AsyncContext.wrap`:

[10:51:26.0955] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
``` export default {
  async fetch(req) {
    const readable = als.run('abc', () => new ReadableStream({
      pull: AsyncContext.wrap((c) => {
        c.error(new Error(`boom ${als.getStore()}`));
      }),
    }));
    return als.run(123, () => new Response(readable));
  }
}
```

[10:51:51.0207] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
With this code, the `als` with `abc` is bound to the `pull` callback function so `als.getStore()` can return `abc` instead of undefined for the Error

[10:52:21.0500] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
Of course, this `AsyncContext.wrap` binding means any other `AsyncContext` values coming from the caller of the `pull` callback (some code in the `ReadableStream` implementation) will now be ignored, but that’s probably safe as long as you don’t expect/care `ReadableStream` to be manipulating `AsyncContext`

[10:52:25.0332] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>

[10:52:43.0903] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
Is that helpful?

[10:55:27.0151] <James M Snell>
Unfortunately it doesn't exactly help. If I call c.error() within the pull, and there's a queued read, that queued read is likely not necessarily going to be rejected immediately when the `c.error` is called. It might end up getting processed from a different async scope, which means if it results in an unhandledrejection event, it will propagate the wrong context

[10:56:22.0432] <James M Snell>
going to have to play with this case a bit more to really tease out all the various cases

[10:57:10.0760] <James M Snell>
There are a variety of situations that make this complicated.

[10:57:49.0983] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
whatever code is scheduling/queueing those read jobs needs to be using something like `AsyncContext.wrap` to preserve the context from one job to the next, I think?

[10:58:04.0171] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
are you trying to get this to work without modifying library code that does this kind of scheduling? (seems hard)

[10:58:06.0394] <James M Snell>
for instance, I may have multiple reads queued, all called from separate async contexts, but a mismatched number of pulls, where one pull triggered by one context fulfills multiple reads

[10:58:22.0268] <James M Snell>
yeah, we're not in control of the ReadableStream implementations

[10:58:47.0300] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
ok I think I see the rub you were pointing out

[11:00:06.0090] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
a single invocation of `pull` can represent multiple different contextual branches

[11:00:40.0716] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
 * a single invocation of `pull` can handle/inherit multiple different contextual branches

[11:02:26.0654] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
do you think the solution is somehow to merge the branches into one context, or to keep the different branches distinct so `pull` can create the errors with their correct (not merged) contexts?

[11:03:17.0428] <littledan>
> <@jasnell:matrix.org> That's fair. What I suspect is that for web apis, once AsyncContext is integrated, we'll need a way of identifying in webidl which types are expected to capture and propagate the async context

This differs from how Yoav ended up implementing a similar feature in Blink. It turned out that the WebIDL layer approach was too slow.

[11:03:32.0329] <littledan>
instead, it's more like, you propagate the context when queueing a task

[11:09:05.0258] <James M Snell>
so in this case it's a bit complicated. "when queing a task" ... for a readable stream, a pending read can be viewed as a queued task

[11:09:21.0620] <James M Snell>
when a read is received, the stream may or may not call pull to ensure that the read can be fulfilled

[11:09:43.0362] <James M Snell>
and a single pull can cause multiple pending reads to be fulfilled

[11:10:04.0388] <James M Snell>
so, within that pull, should it use the context of the read that immediately triggered it?

[11:10:19.0640] <James M Snell>
or should it use the context that was current when the stream was created?

[11:11:23.0871] <James M Snell>
and if that pull causes an error, causing all subsequent reads to reject with unhandled rejections, should the unhandled rejection events be called from the async context for the individual read or the context that was active when the pull errored

[11:13:15.0375] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
is there some mechanism currently for the `pull` callback to tell why an error occurred, in a way that points back to one particular read?

[11:13:28.0021] <James M Snell>
no

[11:14:07.0364] <James M Snell>
whether it throws or calls `controller.error(...)` the effect is the same, the stream is put into an errored state such that all pending and future reads are rejected with that reason

[11:14:47.0568] <James M Snell>
all pending reads would be rejected within the same async context and not the frame that was current when the read was scheduled

[11:15:17.0233] <James M Snell>
so the unhandledrejection handler would see that context and the context that scheduled the read in the first place would be lost

[11:17:17.0474] <James M Snell>
Here's another example:

```
const als = new AsyncLocalStorage();

const readable = als.run(123, () => new ReadableStream({
  pull(c) {
    c.error(`boom ${als.getStore()}`);
  }
}, { highWaterMark: 0 }));
const response = als.run('abc', () => new Response(readable);
const reader = als.run('xyz', () => response.body;
const read = als.run(321, () => reader.read();
await Promise.all([
  als.run('???', async () => await read),
  als.run('???', async () => await read)
]);
```

[11:17:43.0396] <James M Snell>
 * Here's another example:

```
const als = new AsyncLocalStorage();

const readable = als.run(123, () => new ReadableStream({
  pull(c) {
    c.error(`boom ${als.getStore()}`);
  }

const read = als.run(321, () => reader.read();
await Promise.all([

]);
```

[11:18:25.0537] <James M Snell>
sorry that's a bit off... one sec

[11:18:26.0671] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
I'm not sure this works as you'd hope: `const reader = als.run('xyz', () => response.body)`

const read2 = als.run(567, () => reader.read();

]);
```

[11:19:23.0332] <James M Snell>
that's thrown in just to make it more complex. I know it wouldn't do anything :-)

[11:19:26.0871] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
 * I'm not sure this works as you'd hope: `const reader = als.run('xyz', () => response.body)`, since `reader.read` won't automatically restore the `xyz` context value when called

[11:23:50.0828] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
would it be acceptable for the unhandledrejection error to report a set of contexts rather than just one? or is that a nonstarter?

[11:24:32.0723] <James M Snell>
it's called once per each unhandled promise rejection, there's only one context associated with each

[11:24:35.0183] <Mathieu Hofman>
I have been thinking we need to extend AsyncContext itself to handle a set of context

[11:24:39.0986] <James M Snell>
reporting a set would not make sense there

[11:25:05.0777] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
how does `pull` know which `read` was to blame, and so which context to report?

[11:26:00.0151] <Mathieu Hofman>
so that the context user can gather the values associated with both the registration and the trigger paths

[11:26:23.0061] <James M Snell>
it doesn't. Currently pull would be called within the async context of whatever read triggered it. It could also be called following the completion of the start algorithm microtask (the async context where the stream is constructed).

[11:28:13.0023] <James M Snell>
we can break this down to a few specific questions:

1. Because the various "algorithms" associated with a stream are considered part of its internal implementation (e.g. start, pull, close), should those always be executed in the async context frame in which the stream itself was created

[11:29:37.0205] <James M Snell>
2. If a read promise rejects and is unhandled, should the unhandledrejection error be called in the async context in which the read promise was rejected (which is likely different than the context that scheduled the read), or the async context that was current when the read was scheduled

[11:30:08.0182] <James M Snell>
 * 2. If a read promise rejects and is unhandled, should the unhandledrejection event be called in the async context in which the read promise was rejected (which is likely different than the context that scheduled the read), or the async context that was current when the read was scheduled

[11:34:11.0291] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
Mark Miller brought up a point a while back (when `AsyncContext` was last proposed), about what to do with an `AsyncContext.wrap`-bound function that gets called in a context where some `AsyncContext` instance that was previously bound with one value happens to have a different value in the new calling context

[11:34:33.0070] <James M Snell>
Keeping in mind also that people can do silly things like..

```
let controller;
const readable = als.run(123, () => new ReadableStream({
  start(c) { controller = c; }
}));
const read = als.run('abc', () => readable.getReader().read());
als.run(321, () => controller.error('boom'));
```

[11:36:15.0616] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
Are you expecting the context to be propagated somehow by the assignment `controller = c`? Whatever context is in effect in `start` is pretty clearly lost by this code, right?

[11:36:34.0050] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
I don't expect `controller.error` to have access to anything beyond the `321` context, there

[11:37:13.0387] <James M Snell>
nope, it's definitely lost. so if we always called the algorithm in the context captured when the readablestream was created, this would escape that context and would cause the reads to be rejected in the context where the value is 321

 * Mark Miller brought up a point a while back (when `AsyncContext` was last proposed), about what to do with an `AsyncContext.wrap`-bound function that gets called in a context where some `AsyncContext` instance that was previously bound with one value (for some `AsyncContext`) happens to have a different value in the new calling context

[11:37:46.0305] <James M Snell>
but what should be the context for the unhandledrejection associated with the read

[11:37:51.0361] <James M Snell>
'abc' or '321'?

[11:39:39.0698] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
I can imagine a `Promise` implementation that has a chance of preserving `abc` (in this code) in the final context associated with the rejected `read` promise

[11:41:49.0485] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
but that's assuming/imagining `Promise` objects capture context at creation time (when `readable.getReader().read()` is called), which is yet to be decided or implemented

[11:42:49.0397] <Mathieu Hofman>
Why would a promise ever need to capture the creation time? I only see it the resolution and registration time as being useful

[11:43:06.0261] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
for unhandledrejection error attribution, mostly, I think?

[11:43:23.0932] <James M Snell>
we've previously decided that, for promises, the context would be captured at the moment the continuation was attached. So either when then is called or we await

[11:43:36.0092] <Mathieu Hofman>
that's the rejection time that's useful, not the promise creation time

[11:43:42.0871] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>

[11:43:59.0203] <James M Snell>
and that in the deferred promise case, we'd propagate the context that is current when either resolve() or reject() is called

[11:44:14.0610] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
I'm fine with that

[11:44:25.0097] <James M Snell>
but in the ReadableStream case, it's *most* useful to treat `read()` itself as a scheduled task

[11:44:26.0157] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
so it's the context when `reject()` is called that matters?

[11:44:47.0263] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
 * so it's the context when `reject()` is called that matters (determines the context reported by the unhandledrejection error)?

[11:44:51.0600] <James M Snell>
since the read promise itself might be rejected from a completely unrelated context

[11:46:27.0906] <Mathieu Hofman>
wouldn't the onus be on the `read()` implementation to reject the promise from the context in which `read()` was called if the rejection is related to the read implementation.

[11:47:05.0137] <James M Snell>
yeah, it's not specific to the promise itself

[11:47:31.0717] <James M Snell>
should the read operation itself capture the current context and make sure that whenever that queued promise is resolved or rejected the captured context is entered

[11:48:40.0702] <James M Snell>
or should it always be resolved in the context the stream was created... or should it always be resolved in the context that happens to be current whenever start/pull or whatever mechanism internal to the stream causes the promise to be rejected/resolved

[11:48:48.0618] <Mathieu Hofman>
Here is a question: if the user aborts, which causes the read to be rejected, what context matters? the context in which read was started, or the one in which the operation was aborted. I believe the latter is the meaningful one

[11:49:55.0468] <James M Snell>
I agree. but in the unhandledrejection handler for an individual read, does the same answer apply?
