We have two AsyncContext agenda items on April plenary: https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/main/2025/04.md

it'd probably be good to add a constraint to have them back-to-back

I don't have preferences on this. Each of them is a long topic.

Michel Mocny is doing a lightning talk about task attributions in BlinkOn, and he's mentioned AsyncContext

I have a conflict today and won't be able to join the bi-weekly. Given that we just had the plenary last week, do we have any agenda to talk about?
