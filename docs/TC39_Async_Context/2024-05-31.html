It seems strange to me that you would expect to be able to use the id produced later - if you just rearrange them, then it works with flow-around, and that's the order I'd expect them to be in.</p>
<p>But it seems like flow-through allows making it order-independent with a bit more care, at the cost of risking a catastrophic failure if somebody trashes your state, while flow-around insulates you from the risk (it's defensive programming by default, essentially), but then adds risk from structuring your middlewares incorrectly.</p></td></tr>

With flow-through, anything that is logically <em>after</em> should reasonably expect to receive the context from something which came before it, whereas with around flow you have to deeply understand the full structure of the application to know exactly <em>where</em> context will reach, and refactors become problematic because if things get raised to different levels suddenly they have different contexts.</p>
<p>As for risk of state being trashed, I don't see how that's possible unless you go around sharing stores with untrusted users, in which case it's kind of your own fault if it gets trashed. Generally a store should be owned and managed by the same code so you always fully <em>know</em> what's in the store. Even with around flow you can still get trashed stores if you give others access to the store as they can just <code><a href="http://store.run">store.run</a>(...)</code> <em>anywhere</em>.</p>
