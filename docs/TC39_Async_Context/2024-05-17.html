When calling an async function, the portion up to the first await is called synchronously, so if we choose to wrap that part in a span then that activity should be considered a child-of relationship.

(maybe you already wrote about it somewhere?)</blockquote></mx-reply>There's not really any writing on it presently, but basically because we don't flow into promise continuations we need to keep an object at the top-level of the request which we push spans into and basically <em>guess</em> what the parent is because, unlike with callbacks, the parent does not flow into the continuation. This means we have to look at what has been pushed into that list in the past and try to guess what the parent would be. Sometimes it's simply the last span in the list, but not always, so we need to do some additional analysis to figure out what was the last span which <em>could</em> be a realistic parent, which requires we also hold a bunch of the span metadata. Holding all this metadata is expensive given that we could have hundreds of thousands of concurrent spans. What we <em>want</em> is for the <em>correct</em> context to just be able to flow through the resolve path so we only need to store the IDs and can entirely eliminate that big bag of data which lives for the whole life of the request.</td></tr>

To my mind, automatic binding around await is basically one of the main purposes of AC, so if you're not doing that, what are you gaining?  Is it just the question of restoring context after awaiting an already-done promise?  Assuming all awaited promises were pending when the await kicked off, then a simple model seems like doing nothing would "just work" since the continuation would follow immediately afterwards, so the global value would be correct.  Of course this breaks down when the await doesn't actually have to wait - and maybe also when two independent jobs are running interleaved?<br><br>So a global variable is obviously a bit too naive to work, but where I'm struggling is to understand how an AC.Variable with mutable state falls short?  That seems like it would address the issue of interleaved independent tasks, at least, and since (within the same task) you're presumably not clobbering the actual container variable, then that part shouldn't need to change after an await (and if it did, it could presumably be communicated back upstream).  ISTR Stephen mentioning performance concerns, but it's important to compare this against the performance cost of additional overhead needed to maintain a more complex graph, or more different kinds of state that need extra work to fork/join.</blockquote></mx-reply>It's not that we need <em>no</em> binds for async/await, it's that we want it to bind at the resolve point of the promise being awaited rather than at registration time directly at the point the await occurs. This would mean context would flow <em>through</em> promises rather than <em>around</em> them. It would <em>also</em> mean the restore which occurs <em>after</em> the await resumes would be that resolve point value rather than what the value was before the await occurred.</td></tr>

Callback-based code should be updated to wrap the callbacks so that the behavior is the same.  I understand that the fact that ALS has existed for a while with the other behavior makes this a bit of a problem...  Ideally the standard Node APIs would have all been updated to wrap/bind when ALS first came out, before anyone began depending on the non-wrapping behavior.</blockquote></mx-reply>It's <em>intentional</em> that it behaves that way with callbacks. That's how context management is <em>supposed</em> to work as it's not useful for most cases if it doesn't flow into continuations. That's literally the <em>point</em> of the "async" in AsyncLocalStorage.</td></tr>
