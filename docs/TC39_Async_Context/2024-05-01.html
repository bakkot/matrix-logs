So it ends up looking something like...</p>
<pre><code>Snapshot.partial&lt;T&gt;(v: Variable&lt;T&gt;): Snapshot
</code></pre>
<p>with the only difference being that when you capture a partial snapshot it captures all variables inside the most recent <code><a href="http://v.run">v.run</a></code> (including <code>v</code>), and when you <code>run</code> a partial snapshot it instates that sequence of bindings on top of whatever variables are already in scope (perhaps shadowing some if they're in the current scope and also in the partial snapshot, but not clobbering anything that wasn't mentioned in the snapshot).</p>

When multiple callers all call <code>computed.get()</code> in some order, we want to be sure that the answer we saved into the computed didn't depend on which caller was first. If you have multiple frameworks doing their own extensions, they can save/restore their <em>own</em> dynamic context using try/finally... but you run into problems if two frameworks have different extensions and don't know how to properly mask off each others'. Delimited snapshots nail this use case so well that I thought I'd try to float them and see if they seemed to help with any of the other ongoing AsyncContext mysteries</td></tr>
