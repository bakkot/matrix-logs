It’s still not my favorite implementation becuase of mutability and odering of async functions causing unrelated breakages, eg if <a data-md="" href="https://gist.github.com/jridgewell/4aa2d6458f41d4574d6aeb580dc80d5d">main</a> started with an <code data-md="`">await 0</code> before entering <code data-md="`">’bar’</code>, the outside caller sees different behavior. It feels like Zalgo-lite.</blockquote></mx-reply><p>Similar, but the intent is that the <em>runtime</em> would generally be defining those scopes rather than only ever being handled by a user-facing API. We have a bunch of discrete execution concepts which can be used as boundaries for these scopes such as a promise continuation or a callback. We could also probably extend the Function type with something like a <code>func.bindToContext(value)</code> which could be similar to having that function call <code>run(...)</code> internally.</p>
<p>My point is, we can have the nice DX of the set/get interface without too heavily exposing the scoping problem to users. Decoupling the scoping also makes it potentially reusable, which would be beneficial if we <em>do</em> decide to make separate types for the two around and through flows. It would simplify things for users if they can describes scopes with a single API and have both flow systems just make different decisions about how to link the scopes together in the graph.</p>

They would strongly hold their resolution context. The engine wouldn’t mutate user’s context automatically, and without a library API to know when the current exeuction is finalized, you’re left guessing when you can mutate the context or drop all promises.</blockquote></mx-reply>Yes, promises suck a little bit in that they would need to hold the reference alive as long as the promise remains alive. This <em>could</em> increase memory pressure, but is also the <em>expected</em> behaviour as any future continuation attached to that promise <em>should</em> restore that context value.</td></tr>
  <tr class="msg" id="L7"><td class="ts-cell"><a class="ts" href="#L7" alt="Mon May 27 2024 11:14:01 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)">18:14</a></td><td class="nick-cell"><div class="m-ov">&lt;<span class="nick nick-10" title="@stephenbelanger:matrix.org">Stephen Belanger</span>&gt;</div></td><td class="msg-cell"><mx-reply><blockquote> in Stephen's proposal of preserving the resolution context, this would just work I think</blockquote></mx-reply><p>Yes, <code>unhandledrejection</code> is one particular case where the desired context is <em>always</em> the flows-through context. You want to capture the context as it was when the rejection <em>happened</em>, even if it flows through a bunch of intermediate layers.</p>
<p>The difference between through and around flows is basically the same conceptually as subject and predicate. The <em>through</em> path gives you the subject of the failure so you can actually <em>see</em> what's going on. Whereas the <em>around</em> path gives you the predicate which is only describing what is being <em>done</em> with that subject, but that's not relevant in the case of a failure as it's what <em>would have</em> been done but will not be <em>because</em> of the failure.</p>
<p>This also matches that prior description of around flow being like parameter flow. It describes where execution is <em>going</em> and not so much where it <em>came from</em>, which is a bit counter-intuitive from the flow users have generally expected from AsyncLocalStorage where they want to know where something <em>came from</em> so they can acquired stored information about that originating execution.</p>
