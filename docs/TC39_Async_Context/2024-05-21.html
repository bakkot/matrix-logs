As you've pointed out, with the flow-through semantics, <code>run</code> is very clearly the wrong name, and <code>set</code> is much more appropriate.  But your example also hints at some mechanism whereby changes to the variable would still somehow go out of scope?  I think that's important, but it seems like it would lead to lots of confusion.  If some other scope is entered internally, would that inner scope accidentally prune off a branch of var mutations?  That also doesn't seem right.</blockquote></mx-reply>I think allowing unbounded <code data-md="`">set</code>s opens up the same problems as scoping, and introduces a global leak that is unfixable (how do you ever know when the last set value is not needed anymore?).</td></tr>

This means we have to look at what has been pushed into that list in the past and try to guess what the parent would be. Sometimes it's simply the last span in the list, but not always, so we need to do some additional analysis to figure out what was the last span which <em>could</em> be a realistic parent, which requires we also hold a bunch of the span metadata. Holding all this metadata is expensive given that we could have hundreds of thousands of concurrent spans. What we <em>want</em> is for the <em>correct</em> context to just be able to flow through the resolve path so we only need to store the IDs and can entirely eliminate that big bag of data which lives for the whole life of the request.</blockquote></mx-reply>I think this is what Iâ€™m missing. I donâ€™t understand why could would need to guess, Iâ€™m naively assuming its always follows-from the last child and child-of the current parent. Whatâ€™s a case where this isnâ€™t correct? How does the flows-through solve holding holding the hundreds of thousands of concurrent spans?</td></tr>

I think all we can really do is make captures be a copy of what the reference points to at the time and not be the same binding, so at least that top-level mapping of store to value doesn't propagate upward. This is also partly <em>why</em> I think it's important that it be treated as a <em>variable</em> and not a <em>bag of data</em>, because data bags are problematic when it comes to leaking mutations.</td></tr>
