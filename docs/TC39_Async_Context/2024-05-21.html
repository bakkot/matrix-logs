As you've pointed out, with the flow-through semantics, <code>run</code> is very clearly the wrong name, and <code>set</code> is much more appropriate.  But your example also hints at some mechanism whereby changes to the variable would still somehow go out of scope?  I think that's important, but it seems like it would lead to lots of confusion.  If some other scope is entered internally, would that inner scope accidentally prune off a branch of var mutations?

I think all we can really do is make captures be a copy of what the reference points to at the time and not be the same binding, so at least that top-level mapping of store to value doesn't propagate upward.

What are the inner and outer awaits? In my mind, the async context is bound when we enter the function, it doesn’t matter where the awaits are.</blockquote></mx-reply><p>The spec, as it is presently, calls for capturing the context at the point where an await happens, not where the promise being awaited resolves. The context flows <em>into</em> that promise, and it <em>would</em> flow all the way to the point of resolving, but then we orphan that branch and return the context back to the captured value of that outer await.</p>
<p>In this particular example though, it's using <code>store.enterWith(...)</code> which effectively sets the value in the <em>current</em> scope without creating a new scope first. Because the initial segment of an async function executes synchronously, if that occurs <em>before</em> the first await of that <em>internal</em> function then the point at which the outer function captures its await will have already change <em>its</em> context and so will adopt that inner context. Whereas if that inner function modifies the current context <em>after</em> the first await within that inner function it will have already passed the point where the outer function captured the await context and so it would <em>not</em> use that value. The fact this sometimes changes the outer function context and sometimes doesn't is extremely confusing. Users are expecting it to <em>always</em> change the outer context, as indicated in the issue, because it is logically a continuation and should therefore behave the same as it would were it written with callbacks instead.</p>
