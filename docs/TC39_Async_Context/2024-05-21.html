In my mind, the async context is bound when we enter the function, it doesnâ€™t matter where the awaits are.</td></tr>

This was another one of the points I had to discuss with the SES folks to get them on board with the proposal.

As you've pointed out, with the flow-through semantics, <code>run</code> is very clearly the wrong name, and <code>set</code> is much more appropriate.  But your example also hints at some mechanism whereby changes to the variable would still somehow go out of scope?  I think that's important, but it seems like it would lead to lots of confusion.  If some other scope is entered internally, would that inner scope accidentally prune off a branch of var mutations?  That also doesn't seem right.</blockquote></mx-reply>I think allowing unbounded <code data-md="`">set</code>s opens up the same problems as scoping, and introduces a global leak that is unfixable (how do you ever know when the last set value is not needed anymore?).</td></tr>
