Imagine the parent is doing a fetch and creates an abort signal, then passes that same signal to the children to perform their fetches. They each setup their own fetch state otherwise, maybe logging. It’d be surprising that the parent aborting their fetch causes the child’s fetch to inherit the parent’s fetch state.</blockquote></mx-reply>I'm not quite sure what you're saying.  If you pass the same signal to the children, then aborting them is exactly what I'd expect.  It should be a conscious choice which signal to pass, and reusing a signal indicates to me precisely that you want them all to abort together.</td></tr>

That API is designed to avoid "prop drilling", where an outer JSX component needs to pass data to an inner JSX component, but due to JSX's design, this ends up requiring every component in between to accept and pass along that same data.  The generally accepted solution is to put a <code>&lt;Context&gt;</code> element around the outside, and then it can be accessed directly by any descendent without adding arguments everywhere in between.  If, for some reason, there were an additional provider for the same context variable, it would override the previous one, but only for the current scope - so it's clean.  It would be very susprising if changes to this context in a child scope ended up affecting other sibling subcomponents.</p>
<p>In general, this use case of "implicit parameter propagation without needing to virally change the signatures  in between" is relevant both in JSX but also in ordinary JS, and it basically always wants the bind-around approach.</p>

It applies scopes in <em>exactly the same way</em>. It just does it implicitly at the runtime level. And yes, there most certainly <em>is</em> a way to know when execution ends: any time the runtime would become <em>idle</em> and/or transition to microtask processing it knows it has reached the end of the current selection of synchronous code. At that point you end that context.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, you don't <em>actually</em> need to know when an end occurs if all execution descends from a root at the beginning of execution as then the <em>start</em> of any execution would be propagating and therefore swapping out the context value <em>anyway</em>, so clearing it at the <em>end</em> actually becomes unnecessary as it would be immediately followed by a change <em>anyway</em>. There's actually been mathematical proofs of this for the .NET implementation.</p>
