Are you expecting <code>someAsyncApi</code>â€™s rejection time?</blockquote></mx-reply>I'm not seeing a specific code example, but I can imagine a few possibilities: (1) <code><a href="http://v.run">v.run</a>(1, () =&gt; Promise.reject()).then(x =&gt; x)</code> doesn't actually invoke the callback, so would it be reasonable to <em>not</em> change the rejection context?  (2) It's also possible that the <code>then</code> handler runs in the causal context instead of the registration context - so regardless of whether or not it runs, it might still not lose the context.</td></tr>

You could emulate flow-through behavior at the <code>await</code> site with a userland <code>promiseSnapshot = (promise) =&gt; promise.then(() =&gt; new Snapshot(), () =&gt; new Snapshot())</code> helper function (you'd need to <code>await promiseSnapshot(promise)</code> to get ahold of it... so maybe there's a more performant option via a builtin, or something else we could carve out of those conceptual building blocks).  And you can opt into registration context with a <code>Snapshot.wrap</code> anytime it's needed.  So this seems to provide the most expressivity, I think the mental model is pretty  self-consistent, and I don't think it runs afoul of SES requirements.</td></tr>
