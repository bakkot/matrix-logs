Now that this is shipping, it is probably a good time to contact that team and get them to reengage. They came to earlier source map meetings but somehow dropped out 

[05:09:22.0303] <jkup>
Was thinking the same! I’ll try to find someone 

[05:11:57.0068] <littledan>
(Should be in the past notes)

[05:34:55.0599] <Paul Irish>
Might be Ron Buckton

[05:55:04.0704] <littledan>
There was another person from the VSCode team directly who also attended some meetings 

[05:57:52.0297] <JaseW>
It was most likely Connor Peet, he implements this on VS Codes side and is the lead for the debugger stuff

The zoom link on the calendar invite is invalid for me.

[09:00:54.0300] <Nic>
For me too

[09:00:56.0421] <jkup>
Yes same

[09:01:08.0794] <jkup>
littledan: do you own that invite?

[09:01:18.0946] <jkup>
Or do I?

[09:02:19.0461] <Nic>
Can some of you with enterprise zoom / google meet create a new link? :)
