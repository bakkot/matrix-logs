Devin Rousso: not that I looked into the offsets reported across browsers I noticed that Safari is the only one which diverges on which token is reported. (And firefox gets column counting wrong): https://github.com/source-map/source-map-rfc/issues/5#issuecomment-1538000188

[02:12:37.0393] <Armin Ronacher>
would be curious if this is intended

[08:50:39.0473] <littledan>
hey, I drafted some slides for TC39 next week. Any reviews would be very much appreciated: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10nYC0dD-CWXnmPtqeuQMVM15b8kWMgrIS6j2G2wpoyw/edit#slide=id.g24095b33afb_0_89

[08:50:45.0256] <littledan>
let me know if you want edit access or want to co-present

It's great to have this kind of testing! It'd be nice if we could complement this with what various tools produce when they are trying to make this mapping.

[08:52:59.0005] <littledan>
also I take it that when you say UTF-32 you mean that Firefox is counting the number of code points, whereas other browsers are counting code units?

[10:41:46.0756] <littledan>
Posted the slides on the agenda

[10:42:06.0393] <littledan>
Let me know if any of you want to come to the meeting as an invited expert; I can propose your inclusion if you get in touch with me

Yeah, it counts code points

im betting JSC is looking at the source code location in the entire file, not just in the `<script>` which is probably intended?

[00:17:11.0241] <Kamil Og√≥rek>
Devin Rousso: I don't think it's the case. If you externalize the test contents into a separate file and load it inside nested tags, it behaves the same

[06:15:40.0440] <Jan Olaf Martin>
FWIW, I think Safari's decision here is orthogonal to source maps and more related to the (lack of) standardization around `err.stack`. so maybe it's out of scope from a source map spec perspective?

[06:17:44.0131] <Jan Olaf Martin>
"Is the location of a function call in a stack trace the location of the call operator or the location of the entire function call expression" is an interesting question but I assume the job of a source map would just be to map whatever location the browser chooses to pick back to the original source

[06:18:08.0708] <Jan Olaf Martin>
(unless I'm missing cases where that fundamentally changes things like the scope nesting)

TC39 has accepted us to work on source maps as TG4! There was explicit support from Apple, so I expect to see them join soon.

[10:29:28.0649] <littledan>
If you're participating in this group and not an Ecma member, you'll need to sign up as an Invited Expert. Please get in touch with me if you haven't already done so.

[10:40:59.0288] <Chris de Almeida>
even better:  get your org to join Ecma

[10:47:41.0837] <littledan>
But to be clear, Ecma is happy to extend invited expert status to all interested participants in this source maps group through the end of 2023

Does this look like a good statement of scope/programme of work to you all, for formalizing TC39-TG4 (source maps)? https://gist.github.com/littledan/5f3736a50a40c610d6e864f33a75dcad

Looks great!  Only possible change might be to split this bullet point into two:

> To liaise with other interconnected standards bodies and host environments such as the W3C, Node.js, etc.

Something like this:

> To liaise with other interconnected standards bodies such as the W3C
> To liaise with producers and consumers of source maps, such as Node.js, in-browser developer tools, IDEs, and hosted debugging services

honestly the second phrase is awkward because that describes more like the people who we want to be in the group

[14:00:28.0035] <littledan>
I think I'd just stick with the first

[14:01:16.0617] <justingrant>
üëçÔ∏è Whatever you think is good is OK with me. 

[16:11:51.0353] <Justin Ridgewell>
LGTM

I see the calendar invite for today's meeting suddenly disappeared, so is it not happening?

[05:02:52.0391] <Kamil Og√≥rek>
Nope.

> "Hi everyone, I wanted to inform you that today's tools meeting is cancelled. Since we already had a meeting earlier this month, our next meeting is scheduled for June 28. I look forward to seeing you then."


[05:04:26.0077] <littledan>
Sorry about the confusion, I will set up a new source map-specific meeting as soon as I get the formation of the TG formalized with Ecma. The TC39 tools outreach meetings will revert now to being general-purpose.

[05:04:46.0033] <littledan>
I was thinking of scheduling this in a week or two

[05:05:27.0664] <littledan>
Do people want to instead meet at the time that was on your calendar?

[05:19:43.0879] <Kamil Og√≥rek>
I think last wednesday of the month works just fine, and if we skip this one nothing wrong will happen

[11:31:55.0378] <littledan>
I'm working on getting everyone who needs it enrolled as an invited expert. Once that's settled (should be by the end of next week) I'll schedule a new source maps meeting. It will be a distinct calendar event from the last-wednesday-of-the-month TC39 tools meeting; that other meeting is about several different topics, not just source maps

[11:32:36.0703] <littledan>
Do people have any preferences for time/day of a meeting? I was thinking of sticking with the same time and day of the week, given that it seemed to work well for folks, but maybe it'll be, for example, the second Wednesday of the month.

[11:38:23.0609] <justingrant>
What time on Weds? 

[11:39:06.0859] <littledan>
it was noon NY time

[11:39:14.0037] <littledan>
does that time work for people?
