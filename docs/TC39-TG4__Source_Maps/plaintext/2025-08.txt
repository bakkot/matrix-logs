qq for the spec/test repo names. Are we keeping the tc39/ecma426 repository name on GitHub? I remember that there was some discussion to rename it back to source map but I can't seem to find it now. If not, do we plan to align the test repo name also to something like tc39/test426?

We could just leave the test suite in the main repo for now, and split it if we need to.

I don’t think we’ll ever get as complex as test262

I'm happy to do whatever on this. But maybe just leave it? It was a bit of confusion where some folks suggested we needed to rename everything to the ecma name but then others pushed back. If anyone has strong opinions I'm happy to go with whichever
