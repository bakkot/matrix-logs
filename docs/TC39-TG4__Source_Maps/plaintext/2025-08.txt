qq for the spec/test repo names. Are we keeping the tc39/ecma426 repository name on GitHub? I remember that there was some discussion to rename it back to source map but I can't seem to find it now. If not, do we plan to align the test repo name also to something like tc39/test426?

[23:33:47.0193] <Justin Ridgewell>
We could just leave the test suite in the main repo for now, and split it if we need to.

[23:34:03.0145] <Justin Ridgewell>
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever get as complex as test262

I'm happy to do whatever on this. But maybe just leave it? It was a bit of confusion where some folks suggested we needed to rename everything to the ecma name but then others pushed back. If anyone has strong opinions I'm happy to go with whichever

ljharb Could you move the "TG4: Scopes" event from September 25th to October 2nd, to avoid the conflict with plenary? üôè

[09:52:00.0478] <ljharb>
sure - usually we just cancel plenary overlaps, you want to move it?

[09:52:42.0520] <Nic>
Yes

[09:53:26.0196] <ljharb>
k

[09:53:37.0590] <ljharb>
done

[09:58:27.0069] <Simon Z√ºnd>
Nic jkup : Seems like there is a "Disallow new branches" on tc39/ecma426. At least thats what it said when I tried to push a new "proposal-scopes" branch

[09:58:47.0507] <jkup>
checking!

[10:02:02.0431] <jkup>
Simon Z√ºnd: try again?

[10:02:47.0814] <Simon Z√ºnd>
Perfect, thanks, scopes is now at https://github.com/tc39/ecma426/tree/proposal-scopes

[10:04:31.0302] <Simon Z√ºnd>
So the preview can now be found at https://tc39.es/ecma426/branch/proposal-scopes/.
