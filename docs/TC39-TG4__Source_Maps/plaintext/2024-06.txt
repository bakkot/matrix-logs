I'm confused as to why sometimes I see a source map with multiple sources but only a single sourcesContent. I think it's when you use a bundler but I guess I would have thought that whenever you have multiple `sources` you'd have the same number of `sourcesContent`

#safeSpace what is the deal with index maps? Do any tools create them? Or are they something application developers would create themselves when they have complicated build pipelines? I was trying to find a tool to create an example but came up empty.
