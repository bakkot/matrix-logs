I'm confused as to why sometimes I see a source map with multiple sources but only a single sourcesContent. I think it's when you use a bundler but I guess I would have thought that whenever you have multiple `sources` you'd have the same number of `sourcesContent`

I responded (on Threads) with some answers to the questions they were asking or linking to our proposals for feature requests they had! https://www.threads.net/@jonkuperman/post/C7z4E7_C8Uf

#safeSpace what is the deal with index maps? Do any tools create them? Or are they something application developers would create themselves when they have complicated build pipelines? I was trying to find a tool to create an example but came up empty.

[09:22:09.0451] <Jan Olaf Martin>
I know of one use but I’m not sure it’s observable without internal auth. It’s used to serve source maps for dynamically bundled code. Think: /chunks/a,b,c returning the concatenation of 3 JS chunks and a source map header for an index map that includes each of the 3 chunks’ individual map

[09:23:23.0816] <Jan Olaf Martin>
I’ve also recently used it as a way to create fast source maps for on-the-fly bundling in development but that only really works if bundling is completely free of rewrites / source maps can be cached at a per-file level.

[09:24:23.0465] <Jan Olaf Martin>
I’m not aware of something in the OSS world that does either of those two things (although the latter is based on closure compiler’s uncompiled bundler)

[10:25:17.0274] <jkup>
That's perfect. Thanks. Yeah it seems very useful for those cases and I just wanted to make sure they weren't a lot more common and I was just missing something!

[11:01:12.0105] <littledan>
I think we had an issue thread about this and concluded that index source maps are a thing, but the feature of them of linking to other URLs was fiction (probably already removed)

[11:10:03.0805] <jkup>
Yeah we removed sections.url but then I went down a rabbit hole trying to better understand them in general!

It’s us!! 

[11:09:21.0855] <Justin Ridgewell>
Turbopack uses index maps (why didn’t we call them secctioned maps?) during bundling, because we can individually cache the output of each step file and then join them together during serving without duplicating the memory for the bundled map

[12:53:10.0630] <jkup>
Oh that’s really cool, thanks!

Agata and I did our talk this morning! I think it went well. Not a ton of feedback but some great questions and a few folks were extremely complimentary.

For the hackathon, does anyone have any proposals or presentations they'd like to talk about? I think it will be super fun to just get everyone caught up on the meetings and current proposals and then work together implementing things and adding tests. But I also think it would be a good chance if anyone has any new ideas or topics they'd like to discuss, to do so in person.

[15:54:52.0964] <Justin Ridgewell>
I was planning on working on the Scopes proposal implementation

[15:55:05.0395] <Justin Ridgewell>
Happy to do some testing work, too
