I'm confused as to why sometimes I see a source map with multiple sources but only a single sourcesContent. I think it's when you use a bundler but I guess I would have thought that whenever you have multiple `sources` you'd have the same number of `sourcesContent`

#safeSpace what is the deal with index maps? Do any tools create them? Or are they something application developers would create themselves when they have complicated build pipelines? I was trying to find a tool to create an example but came up empty.

[09:22:09.0451] <Jan Olaf Martin>
I know of one use but Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s observable without internal auth. Itâ€™s used to serve source maps for dynamically bundled code. Think: /chunks/a,b,c returning the concatenation of 3 JS chunks and a source map header for an index map that includes each of the 3 chunksâ€™ individual map

[09:23:23.0816] <Jan Olaf Martin>
Iâ€™ve also recently used it as a way to create fast source maps for on-the-fly bundling in development but that only really works if bundling is completely free of rewrites / source maps can be cached at a per-file level.

[09:24:23.0465] <Jan Olaf Martin>
Iâ€™m not aware of something in the OSS world that does either of those two things (although the latter is based on closure compilerâ€™s uncompiled bundler)

[10:25:17.0274] <jkup>
That's perfect. Thanks. Yeah it seems very useful for those cases and I just wanted to make sure they weren't a lot more common and I was just missing something!

[11:01:12.0105] <littledan>
I think we had an issue thread about this and concluded that index source maps are a thing, but the feature of them of linking to other URLs was fiction (probably already removed)

[11:10:03.0805] <jkup>
Yeah we removed sections.url but then I went down a rabbit hole trying to better understand them in general!

Itâ€™s us!! 

[11:09:21.0855] <Justin Ridgewell>
Turbopack uses index maps (why didnâ€™t we call them secctioned maps?) during bundling, because we can individually cache the output of each step file and then join them together during serving without duplicating the memory for the bundled map

[12:53:10.0630] <jkup>
Oh thatâ€™s really cool, thanks!

Hey folks! Just a reminder we have the hackathon coming up in Munich soon! I would love to have anyone who would like to attend. Survey to fill out is here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNtxFiMqBJDkV94-opDo3VJ38WPOT6AG2a1Sz3BVV0Fnr6UA/viewform?usp=sf_link

For the hackathon, does anyone have any proposals or presentations they'd like to talk about? I think it will be super fun to just get everyone caught up on the meetings and current proposals and then work together implementing things and adding tests. But I also think it would be a good chance if anyone has any new ideas or topics they'd like to discuss, to do so in person.

[15:54:52.0964] <Justin Ridgewell>

Devin Rousso: This is fantastic! We have a #tc39-tg4-tests@matrix.org:matrix.org channel if you'd like to join! The current state (which I need to document a bit) is that we have our tests in https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests and Mozilla has landed it as a dependency in their source-map library: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/pull/505

neato!  im not entirely sure what the process is for approving external things within WebKit, but i can ask around and see what's up

[09:02:17.0557] <Devin Rousso>
 a simple solution might be to create a `LayoutTests/inspector/external/source-map/` and then periodically update the content in there from the `source-map-tests` repo

[06:33:13.0273] <bomsy>
I'll be coming in later in the day (probably mid day) as my flight is in the morning tomorrow.

Missing 3 authors: szuend,lforst,fitzgen

They are all in the TG4 team but not Delegates

[02:45:40.0692] <Nic>
I guess the question is: do I need to update the GitHub teams, or the script that checks them

[02:45:46.0751] <littledan>
Shu should enroll all Google participants in TG4 as delegates, under our current process (and probably also Steven Hicks as well, as he's very involved in some areas)

[02:45:50.0950] <Rob Palmer>
   I have no record of Simon ever being requested as a TC39 delegate

[02:46:34.0303] <littledan>
but that doesn't cover fitzgen, who was at Mozilla when he did things; he should maybe be added to the emeritus team

[02:46:46.0556] <littledan>
lforst is Sentry I think

This is my fault. I requested two people, and Shu added one and then I closed out the issue. Simon is going to reach out to Shu and get added now!
