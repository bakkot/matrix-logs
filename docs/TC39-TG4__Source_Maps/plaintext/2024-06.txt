I'm confused as to why sometimes I see a source map with multiple sources but only a single sourcesContent. I think it's when you use a bundler but I guess I would have thought that whenever you have multiple `sources` you'd have the same number of `sourcesContent`

I responded (on Threads) with some answers to the questions they were asking or linking to our proposals for feature requests they had! https://www.threads.net/@jonkuperman/post/C7z4E7_C8Uf

#safeSpace what is the deal with index maps? Do any tools create them? Or are they something application developers would create themselves when they have complicated build pipelines? I was trying to find a tool to create an example but came up empty.

[09:22:09.0451] <Jan Olaf Martin>
I know of one use but Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s observable without internal auth. Itâ€™s used to serve source maps for dynamically bundled code. Think: /chunks/a,b,c returning the concatenation of 3 JS chunks and a source map header for an index map that includes each of the 3 chunksâ€™ individual map

[09:23:23.0816] <Jan Olaf Martin>
Iâ€™ve also recently used it as a way to create fast source maps for on-the-fly bundling in development but that only really works if bundling is completely free of rewrites / source maps can be cached at a per-file level.

[09:24:23.0465] <Jan Olaf Martin>
Iâ€™m not aware of something in the OSS world that does either of those two things (although the latter is based on closure compilerâ€™s uncompiled bundler)

[10:25:17.0274] <jkup>
That's perfect. Thanks. Yeah it seems very useful for those cases and I just wanted to make sure they weren't a lot more common and I was just missing something!

[11:01:12.0105] <littledan>
I think we had an issue thread about this and concluded that index source maps are a thing, but the feature of them of linking to other URLs was fiction (probably already removed)

[11:10:03.0805] <jkup>
Yeah we removed sections.url but then I went down a rabbit hole trying to better understand them in general!

Itâ€™s us!! 

[11:09:21.0855] <Justin Ridgewell>
Turbopack uses index maps (why didnâ€™t we call them secctioned maps?) during bundling, because we can individually cache the output of each step file and then join them together during serving without duplicating the memory for the bundled map

[12:53:10.0630] <jkup>
Oh thatâ€™s really cool, thanks!

Hey folks! Just a reminder we have the hackathon coming up in Munich soon! I would love to have anyone who would like to attend. Survey to fill out is here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNtxFiMqBJDkV94-opDo3VJ38WPOT6AG2a1Sz3BVV0Fnr6UA/viewform?usp=sf_link

Agata and I did our talk this morning! I think it went well. Not a ton of feedback but some great questions and a few folks were extremely complimentary.

For the hackathon, does anyone have any proposals or presentations they'd like to talk about? I think it will be super fun to just get everyone caught up on the meetings and current proposals and then work together implementing things and adding tests. But I also think it would be a good chance if anyone has any new ideas or topics they'd like to discuss, to do so in person.

[15:54:52.0964] <Justin Ridgewell>
I was planning on working on the Scopes proposal implementation

[15:55:05.0395] <Justin Ridgewell>
Happy to do some testing work, too

Invites for hackathon day 1, hackathon day 2 and dinner on day 2 should have just gone out! If you didnâ€™t get them or have any logistical questions or issues please let me know!!

hey just FYI im working on implementing support for `ignoreList` in WebKit via <https://webkit.org/b/275552>

[16:30:26.0920] <Devin Rousso>
im also happy to help add any new sourcemap tests into WebKit

Devin Rousso: This is fantastic! We have a #tc39-tg4-tests@matrix.org:matrix.org channel if you'd like to join! The current state (which I need to document a bit) is that we have our tests in https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests and Mozilla has landed it as a dependency in their source-map library: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/pull/505

neato!  im not entirely sure what the process is for approving external things within WebKit, but i can ask around and see what's up

[09:02:17.0557] <Devin Rousso>
 a simple solution might be to create a `LayoutTests/inspector/external/source-map/` and then periodically update the content in there from the `source-map-tests` repo

Canâ€™t wait to see some of you tomorrow! Meysam should be expecting us around 9am at the Google office (I think one of the invites said 8). Iâ€™ll be there but I think timing is a bit flexible so just message if you need to be let in later!

[06:33:13.0273] <bomsy>
I'll be coming in later in the day (probably mid day) as my flight is in the morning tomorrow.

[06:33:35.0302] <littledan>
I just got into Munich! See you all soon

[06:35:51.0192] <Nic>
I'll arrive at 18:30, then if anybody is up for dinner I'd be happy to meet :)

[06:36:58.0048] <Justin Ridgewell>
Iâ€™m here, too. Happy to meet up for dinner.

[07:59:26.0954] <littledan>
FYI it is the tail end of Munich Pride festivities, head to Marienplatz if you want to catch the main stage, more information at https://www.csdmuenchen.de/en/

[09:33:07.0226] <Artem Kobzar>
I would also be happy to join the dinner

[10:13:03.0858] <Nic>
I just arrived at my hotel â€” Justin Ridgewell Artem Kobzar (and whoever else wants!) let's meet in 30 minutes somewhere?

[10:17:32.0901] <Artem Kobzar>
Sure. I'm staying in this [hotel](https://www.discoverasr.com/de/citadines/germany/citadines-arnulfpark-munich?gad_source=1) (pretty close to the Google office)

[10:19:20.0372] <Nic>
Oh it's a three minutes walk from mine

[10:19:45.0180] <Nic>
Maybe let's meet in your lobby and then go towards the center?

[10:20:15.0998] <Artem Kobzar>
Sure. Sounds great!

[10:20:19.0337] <Nic>
I'll be there in 20 minutes :)

[10:20:36.0473] <Artem Kobzar>
Okay, I'm waiting ðŸ™‚

[10:21:36.0347] <Justin Ridgewell>
Iâ€™m in the Novotel 1min away

[10:22:01.0494] <Nic>
Ok let's all meet in Artem's lobby

[10:44:30.0911] <Nic>
Justin Ridgewell We are coming towards your hotel 

[14:41:19.0997] <jkup>
Sad to have missed the fun! Iâ€™m just now making my way to my hotel
