Hey folks! If you all get time, would you mind helping me fill out this list? https://github.com/jkup/source-map-users/blob/main/README.md

I'd love a centralized list of all the codebases that generate or parse source maps. So we can know how we're doing re: testing and implementation of new features! (Sorry if I got anything wrong)

For the generators, I would also list the gen-mapping consumers such as Babel (since they are the ones that feed data into gen-mapping, and that data must be correct)

My apologies, I am out of town and won't be able to attend.

[09:12:49.0332] <jkup>
No problem! I'm taking notes!

https://github.com/tc39/source-map/pull/82 <- I think this PR should be good to land but requires somebody with push access to actually merge it

Looks like the check is misconfigured for that repo? Missing GH_TOKEN..? https://github.com/tc39/source-map/actions/runs/9004478291/job/24737546428?pr=82

(the author may not have signed, just want to make sure we know that they haven't)

 * ~(the author may not have signed, just want to make sure we know that they haven't)~ Krinkle does appear in the sheet, so I assume the check would pass

[09:47:18.0490] <Nic>
Ugh maybe when we merged the repos we messed that up

[09:47:29.0301] <Nic>
Let me check

[09:47:37.0283] <Jan Olaf Martin>
 * ~~(the author may not have signed, just want to make sure we know that they haven't)~~ Krinkle does appear in the sheet (row 633), so I assume the check would pass

[09:47:52.0517] <Nic>
We can merge that PR without waiting then

[09:50:40.0281] <Nic>
Ok the token will expire in one year (GitHub doesn't let me make it longer)
