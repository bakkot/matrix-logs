Hey folks! If you all get time, would you mind helping me fill out this list? https://github.com/jkup/source-map-users/blob/main/README.md

I'd love a centralized list of all the codebases that generate or parse source maps. So we can know how we're doing re: testing and implementation of new features! (Sorry if I got anything wrong)

For the generators, I would also list the gen-mapping consumers such as Babel (since they are the ones that feed data into gen-mapping, and that data must be correct)

My apologies, I am out of town and won't be able to attend.

No problem! I'm taking notes!

https://github.com/tc39/source-map/pull/82 <- I think this PR should be good to land but requires somebody with push access to actually merge it
