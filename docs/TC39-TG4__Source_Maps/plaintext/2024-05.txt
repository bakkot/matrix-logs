Hey folks! If you all get time, would you mind helping me fill out this list? https://github.com/jkup/source-map-users/blob/main/README.md

I'd love a centralized list of all the codebases that generate or parse source maps. So we can know how we're doing re: testing and implementation of new features! (Sorry if I got anything wrong)

[06:54:38.0319] <Nic>
For the generators, I would also list the gen-mapping consumers such as Babel (since they are the ones that feed data into gen-mapping, and that data must be correct)

Meeting happening now! https://bloomberg.zoom.us/j/97901112561?pwd=TlNyeW8ycGlaMk9BTmUxMHZrcE11dz09

My apologies, I am out of town and won't be able to attend.

[09:12:49.0332] <jkup>
No problem! I'm taking notes!

https://github.com/tc39/source-map/pull/82 <- I think this PR should be good to land but requires somebody with push access to actually merge it

Looks like the check is misconfigured for that repo? Missing GH_TOKEN..? https://github.com/tc39/source-map/actions/runs/9004478291/job/24737546428?pr=82

[09:44:54.0176] <Jan Olaf Martin>
(the author may not have signed, just want to make sure we know that they haven't)

[09:47:11.0449] <Jan Olaf Martin>
 * ~(the author may not have signed, just want to make sure we know that they haven't)~ Krinkle does appear in the sheet, so I assume the check would pass

[09:47:18.0490] <Nic>
Ugh maybe when we merged the repos we messed that up

[09:47:29.0301] <Nic>
Let me check

[09:47:37.0283] <Jan Olaf Martin>
 * ~~(the author may not have signed, just want to make sure we know that they haven't)~~ Krinkle does appear in the sheet (row 633), so I assume the check would pass

[09:47:52.0517] <Nic>
We can merge that PR without waiting then

[09:50:40.0281] <Nic>
Ok the token will expire in one year (GitHub doesn't let me make it longer)

[10:26:55.0241] <Jan Olaf Martin>
Nice - let me know if I can do anything else here. I assume the only step now is that somebody with commit bit merges it. Mostly wanted to make sure the PR author doesn't get too discouraged from future contributions. :)

Hey folks! We're working on maintaining a set of milestones for the work we are doing. We have a list here that I'd love feedback on! Is anything missing or innaccurate?

The new React compiler has a cool playground including a source map tab which is pretty cool https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhASwLYAcIwC4AEwUYCAsghhADQEkIDKeAhnggL4EBmMEGBAHRAwEzOHiECAdggAeOfAQAmCLsygAbQlyhTxaCFIJkAngEEsWABQBKItIIE4hsIQDaaPbVJ4AknoBdAgBeOlImVgQrAAYbBycXQjxMBDAAJhCw8koIK1sQgD4CTzgAKjTqD0C4owIRPFgjAB4lNAA3AvjHFvaCgAkEDQ0IAgB1XA0lImSMVLT2JoB6Vo6ugiaAIyg8PEMCQwBhDTQ4AGtg4Hzgop9-OCsSgGoARht2ApMIJa2dw07apYrAoAbmk7GkIHYQA

Hey all! Could someone remind me of the current state of the Scopes proposal? From the latest notes I could find, I wrote that Simon Zünd and Holger Benl were feeling pretty good about the state of it but Justin Ridgewell wanted some more time to look at it before we attempted to proceed. Does that sound right?

I think we resolved the standing issues, but I haven’t updated my code yet.

thanks for creating this overview! There was talk in the last call about a hackathon in Munich, if I understood correctly

Does somone have more info about when this will be and the topics that will be on the table? We have some people from our side interested in the DebugIDs topic on this agenda. And we'd like to budget more time to it
