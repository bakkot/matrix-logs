I sent a PR to change the "Scopes" encoding scheme as discussed in the last meeting (https://github.com/tc39/ecma426/pull/171). Kindly take a look. We can go over it in detail in the next "Scopes" meeting (on the 27th) or maybe even in the general source map meeting (on the 12th) if we have left-over time.

Hey all, I also started with drafting spec text for the "scopes" proposal using ecmarkup. It currently contains mostly grammar and how to decode the format. I'm planning to keep working on this in the next days/weeks. You can find the latest draft here: https://szuend.github.io/ecma426-proposal-scopes/.

At the upcoming TG4 meeting I'm planning to present a very brief status update on the range mappings proposal. I'll share the slides ahead of time here just in case anyone is curious: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D1sk9vR5OjSDT28xYDZdMpRjvj0JRQOBmF2bdZ7G4Dc/edit?usp=sharing

Looks very good. I'm excited to see this progress because Chrome DevTools team has already signalled interest to implement, once Range Mappings achieves further Stage advancement.

Concretely this will aid debugging in Node.
