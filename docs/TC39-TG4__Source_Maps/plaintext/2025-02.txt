I sent a PR to change the "Scopes" encoding scheme as discussed in the last meeting (https://github.com/tc39/ecma426/pull/171). Kindly take a look. We can go over it in detail in the next "Scopes" meeting (on the 27th) or maybe even in the general source map meeting (on the 12th) if we have left-over time.
