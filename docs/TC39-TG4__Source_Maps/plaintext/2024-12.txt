Did we resolve the bikeshed vs ecmarkup question?

[10:52:16.0085] <Aki>
Sorry to hassle during plenary, but https://tc39.es/ecma426/ still needs your attention

[11:04:48.0487] <Nic>
Is it something that we should do now, or after that the spec is approved?

[11:05:03.0679] <Nic>
(I assumed it was the latter, but happy to do it now too)

[11:06:59.0974] <Aki>
now would be good, since the spec links to that URL

optimistic spec publishing, I like it

[10:48:32.0384] <ljharb>
it's just a candidate until it's approved, but def should be published :-)

[11:54:37.0127] <Aki>
What lives at that URL isn’t the standard, it’s the most current specification. The standard is a snapshot, tc39.es/ecma426 is the latest commit on main in theory. 

[11:56:19.0363] <littledan>
is there a reason it has to live at 426 instead of hosting that permanently just at its current location, http://tc39.es/source-map/ ?

[11:56:27.0853] <littledan>
maybe we could set up a redirect in gh-pages

[11:57:19.0006] <Aki>
Consistency?

[11:58:58.0677] <littledan>
it'll be awkward to maintain copies of the living editor's draft in two repos, we should probably either rename source-map to ecma426 or make a redirect, I think.

 * it'll be awkward to maintain copies of the living editor's draft in two repos, we should probably either rename source-map to ecma426 or make a redirect in the other direction, I think.

[12:06:22.0082] <Aki>
i guess i kind of assumed y'all would do the rename but i guess it doesn't really matter as long as the linking is consistent.

[13:02:12.0093] <ljharb>
like 262, shouldn't this be a living standard?

[13:02:31.0710] <ljharb>
iow the snapshot is what gets posted on ecma's site, but the only document that matters is "whatever's merged into the repo that shows up on the tc39.es page"

[13:02:41.0723] <ljharb>
 * iow the snapshot is what gets posted on ecma's site, but the only document that actually matters in practice is "whatever's merged into the repo that shows up on the tc39.es page"

[13:02:44.0774] <littledan>
well, 262 isn't *officially* a living standard -- I just like to refer people to the editor's draft ;)

[13:03:00.0742] <ljharb>
it's official in that it's the way TC39 wants it treated :-p

[13:03:10.0678] <littledan>
but, yes, we all agree that people should look at the most recent version, and I think this is going to be the case regardless of the URL

[13:03:15.0911] <ljharb>
that ecma doesn't have the facility for that isn't really a concern for the rest of the world

[13:03:18.0797] <littledan>
well, I dunno if we've officially said that

[13:03:47.0337] <littledan>
in fact, Ecma has said that we *cannot* normatively reference WHATWG living standards. (We'll have to reconsider this in the future, though)

[13:03:47.0750] <ljharb>
> The document at https://tc39.es/ecma262/ is the most accurate and up-to-date ECMAScript specification. It contains the content of the most recent yearly snapshot plus any finished proposals

[13:04:02.0199] <littledan>
(agree with the emoji)

[13:05:11.0687] <ljharb>
i'd personally suggest that the source map spec be under tc39.es/ecma42whatever, it should be published there immediately prior to approval, and that should be the only one, and the snapshot is what ecma will inevitably post on ecma's website that basically nobody needs to care about

[13:07:05.0002] <littledan>
heh, I tried to do a rename but I can't, because Nic just created an ecma426 repo

[13:07:23.0125] <littledan>
Nic: How about we delete that repo and move this one to there? So we preserve all the history and everything

[13:07:38.0283] <littledan>
I would like to not have two repos that we have to manage

[13:09:30.0367] <ljharb>
k i renamed that one, try now?
