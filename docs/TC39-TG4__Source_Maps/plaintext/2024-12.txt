Did we resolve the bikeshed vs ecmarkup question?

[10:52:16.0085] <Aki>
Sorry to hassle during plenary, but https://tc39.es/ecma426/ still needs your attention

[11:04:48.0487] <Nic>
Is it something that we should do now, or after that the spec is approved?

[11:05:03.0679] <Nic>
(I assumed it was the latter, but happy to do it now too)

[11:06:59.0974] <Aki>
now would be good, since the spec links to that URL

optimistic spec publishing, I like it

[10:48:32.0384] <ljharb>
it's just a candidate until it's approved, but def should be published :-)

[11:54:37.0127] <Aki>
What lives at that URL isn’t the standard, it’s the most current specification. The standard is a snapshot, tc39.es/ecma426 is the latest commit on main in theory. 

[11:56:19.0363] <littledan>
is there a reason it has to live at 426 instead of hosting that permanently just at its current location, http://tc39.es/source-map/ ?

[11:56:27.0853] <littledan>
maybe we could set up a redirect in gh-pages

[11:57:19.0006] <Aki>
Consistency?

[11:58:58.0677] <littledan>
it'll be awkward to maintain copies of the living editor's draft in two repos, we should probably either rename source-map to ecma426 or make a redirect, I think.

 * it'll be awkward to maintain copies of the living editor's draft in two repos, we should probably either rename source-map to ecma426 or make a redirect in the other direction, I think.

[12:06:22.0082] <Aki>
i guess i kind of assumed y'all would do the rename but i guess it doesn't really matter as long as the linking is consistent.
