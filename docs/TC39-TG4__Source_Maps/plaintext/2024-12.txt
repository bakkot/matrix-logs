Did we resolve the bikeshed vs ecmarkup question?

[10:52:16.0085] <Aki>
Sorry to hassle during plenary, but https://tc39.es/ecma426/ still needs your attention

[11:04:48.0487] <Nic>
Is it something that we should do now, or after that the spec is approved?

[11:05:03.0679] <Nic>
(I assumed it was the latter, but happy to do it now too)

[11:06:59.0974] <Aki>
now would be good, since the spec links to that URL

[10:43:55.0095] <littledan>
optimistic spec publishing, I like it

[10:48:32.0384] <ljharb>
it's just a candidate until it's approved, but def should be published :-)

[11:54:37.0127] <Aki>
What lives at that URL isnâ€™t the standard, itâ€™s the most current specification. The standard is a snapshot, tc39.es/ecma426 is the latest commit on main in theory. 

[11:56:19.0363] <littledan>
is there a reason it has to live at 426 instead of hosting that permanently just at its current location, http://tc39.es/source-map/ ?

[11:56:27.0853] <littledan>
maybe we could set up a redirect in gh-pages

[11:57:19.0006] <Aki>
Consistency?

[11:58:58.0677] <littledan>
it'll be awkward to maintain copies of the living editor's draft in two repos, we should probably either rename source-map to ecma426 or make a redirect, I think.

[11:59:10.0181] <littledan>
 * it'll be awkward to maintain copies of the living editor's draft in two repos, we should probably either rename source-map to ecma426 or make a redirect in the other direction, I think.

[12:06:22.0082] <Aki>
i guess i kind of assumed y'all would do the rename but i guess it doesn't really matter as long as the linking is consistent.

[13:02:12.0093] <ljharb>
like 262, shouldn't this be a living standard?

[13:02:31.0710] <ljharb>
iow the snapshot is what gets posted on ecma's site, but the only document that matters is "whatever's merged into the repo that shows up on the tc39.es page"

[13:02:41.0723] <ljharb>
 * iow the snapshot is what gets posted on ecma's site, but the only document that actually matters in practice is "whatever's merged into the repo that shows up on the tc39.es page"

[13:02:44.0774] <littledan>
well, 262 isn't *officially* a living standard -- I just like to refer people to the editor's draft ;)

[13:03:00.0742] <ljharb>
it's official in that it's the way TC39 wants it treated :-p

[13:03:10.0678] <littledan>
but, yes, we all agree that people should look at the most recent version, and I think this is going to be the case regardless of the URL

[13:03:15.0911] <ljharb>
that ecma doesn't have the facility for that isn't really a concern for the rest of the world

[13:03:18.0797] <littledan>
well, I dunno if we've officially said that

[13:03:47.0337] <littledan>
in fact, Ecma has said that we *cannot* normatively reference WHATWG living standards. (We'll have to reconsider this in the future, though)

[13:03:47.0750] <ljharb>
> The document at https://tc39.es/ecma262/ is the most accurate and up-to-date ECMAScript specification. It contains the content of the most recent yearly snapshot plus any finished proposals

[13:04:02.0199] <littledan>
(agree with the emoji)

[13:05:11.0687] <ljharb>
i'd personally suggest that the source map spec be under tc39.es/ecma42whatever, it should be published there immediately prior to approval, and that should be the only one, and the snapshot is what ecma will inevitably post on ecma's website that basically nobody needs to care about

[13:07:05.0002] <littledan>
heh, I tried to do a rename but I can't, because Nic just created an ecma426 repo

[13:07:23.0125] <littledan>
Nic: How about we delete that repo and move this one to there? So we preserve all the history and everything

[13:07:38.0283] <littledan>
I would like to not have two repos that we have to manage

[13:09:30.0367] <ljharb>
k i renamed that one, try now?

[13:11:08.0668] <ljharb>
(btw what did yall figure out wrt the static parsing security concern thing?)

[13:12:58.0066] <littledan>
clever!

[13:15:06.0578] <ljharb>
LGTM https://tc39.es/ecma426/

[13:15:10.0799] <littledan>
yep, seems to be up: http://tc39.es/ecma426/

[13:15:27.0874] <littledan>
RIP https://tc39.es/source-map/ -- I think that's sort of poisoned now

[13:15:47.0584] <ljharb>
nah it can be redirected too, in the repo that houses tc39.es itself

[13:16:01.0677] <littledan>
oh, could you set that up?

[13:16:06.0117] <littledan>
thanks for your help here!

[13:16:12.0957] <ljharb>
make a `source-map/index.html` in https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io, and use meta tags to redirect

[13:16:15.0055] <ljharb>
i can do it, sure

[13:16:52.0785] <littledan>
oh right, somehow I was picturing an HTTP redirect, which I don't know how to do in gh-pages

[13:17:16.0424] <ljharb>
yeah that's a pages limitation :-/

[13:17:21.0741] <ljharb>
but an http meta one is fine

[13:17:31.0592] <littledan>
yeah agreed

[13:17:40.0986] <littledan>
OK I'll just make the redirect

[13:19:32.0717] <ljharb>
i pushed it up, waiting on the deploy

[13:19:41.0918] <littledan>
oh great thanks

[13:19:42.0975] <ljharb>
done, and working

[13:20:00.0522] <ljharb>
consider the source map source mapped

[13:20:04.0532] <littledan>
that looks instant enough

[13:20:20.0750] <ljharb>
 * consider the source map source, mapped

[13:20:54.0671] <littledan>
hey can we list Jon and Nic as co-editors of ECMA-426, in the final PDF? They both did so much work, but I guess we don't mention chairs in the document itself.

[13:21:17.0099] <ljharb>
its yalls spec, mention whoever you want :-p

[13:21:59.0754] <littledan>
I think someone is waiting for permission from someone else to list those names; ljharb and I hereby grant you such permission

[13:28:33.0054] <Aki>
thanks y'all!

[13:36:05.0544] <Aki>
come up with copy quick, i just fired off what i thought were the last corrections to Patrick

[13:38:22.0628] <littledan>
oops, well, just like put them as editors alongside Asumu if we're not allowed to write them down as chairs?

[13:38:31.0922] <littledan>
is any more copy needed?

[13:38:41.0270] <littledan>
both of them have literally personally done significant editorial work

[13:58:36.0589] <ljharb>
sounds like co-editors to me

[14:09:27.0467] <littledan>
Aki: Need anything more?

[14:10:36.0128] <Aki>
the editors aren't listed at all

[14:10:47.0296] <littledan>
oh, where's the current pdf?

[14:15:55.0587] <Aki>
i mean it's build from the spec

[14:16:03.0519] <Aki>
the spec has no editor info in the intro https://tc39.es/ecma426/#intro

[14:27:43.0670] <littledan>
oh, I see what you mean by copy (comparing with how the ECMAScript spec has editors listed)

[14:29:15.0879] <Nic>
Hey thanks y'all for figuring this out, I was overthinking and avoiding renaming the repo until after the final approval but I'm happy y'all decided otherwise :)

[14:30:38.0792] <Nic>
It'd be nice to have Jon's and my name'sÂ there, but probably not worth the effort of editing the PDF again. We can probably just add them to the web version, and for the next edition see if we can figure out a better copyÂ 

[14:30:54.0179] <littledan>
well, Asumu's name isn't there either

[14:32:40.0017] <littledan>
How about we add a final paragraph to the introduction, "In 2023-2024, the source map format was developed into a more precise Ecma standard, with significant contributions from many people, including Asumu Takikawa, Nicolo Ribaudo, and Jon Kuperman. Further iteration on the source map format is expected to come from TC39 TG4."

[14:32:54.0280] <littledan>
(with Nicolo's correct accent)

[14:33:45.0016] <littledan>
if it's too late, just adding names to the web version also seems fine

[14:34:43.0210] <Nic>
We'd all really appreciate that (speaking also on behalf of Asumu and Jon, with which I actually already talked about this ðŸ˜…) â€” but ultimately I'll let it to Aki to decide if it goes already in the PDF or just on the web version.

[14:34:51.0180] <Nic>

[14:34:57.0093] <Nic>
That wording seems good

[14:35:20.0441] <Aki>
get it written, i 'll get it published.

[14:37:19.0850] <Nic>
It should go at the end of the introduction, after the paragraph about V3 now been the latest version forever since when we took over

[14:37:26.0616] <Nic>
Do you want me to PR it?

[14:38:17.0895] <Aki>
do that for yourself. and also i won't be pulling it in for this particular PDF so link me to it so i can copy & paste

[14:54:13.0022] <Nic>
https://github.com/tc39/ecma426/pull/162 I'd like an ack from either Dan or Jon or Asumu, and then it's good to go

[14:55:01.0336] <littledan>
approved

[14:58:21.0560] <littledan>
btw you all should probably take my admin rights over 426 away from me :)

[15:02:51.0974] <Nic>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> btw you all should probably take my admin rights over 426 away from me :)

This can wait for another day as it's getting late for me :)

[15:05:37.0518] <littledan>
good night!

[15:22:51.0021] <littledan>
Aki: Can you copy-paste from here?

[15:36:52.0605] <Nic>
Perfect :)

[15:39:33.0097] <littledan>
ship it!

[15:39:41.0657] <littledan>
I'm looking forward to seeing you in New York, Aki!

[15:39:56.0884] <littledan>
still not too late for all the rest of you to RSVP to attend in person

[06:48:21.0180] <Nic>
Hey -- you might have seen that we renamed the repo to the new spec name/number. If you also rename your local folder, you'll need to delete the `.venv` folder for `make` to actually work

[06:49:56.0109] <Nic>
Ok actually that completely broke my bikeshed and it can't be reinstalled

[06:50:34.0315] <littledan>
oops sorry about that

[06:51:21.0172] <Nic>
I guess it's one more reason to use ecmarkup: we don't need to fiddle around with python venvs ðŸ˜…
