hello ðŸ‘€ one thing I was talking about recently as part of e18e.dev efforts was the idea of a sourcemaps server (like how c#/.net has symbol servers)
maybe its worth bringing up here and seeing what people think

something like npm but which hosts sourcemaps and nothing else. at build time we point all of our sources at that server (inject the domain into the sourcemaps url) rather than shipping sourcemaps

has anyone ever thought about that?

[10:27:59.0055] <James>
could we build that today with existing sourcemaps or would we not be able to reference another host?

I have no knowledge about .net and c# â€” what would that be? Like a CDN for source maps?

[13:00:35.0378] <Nic>
Or a package registry for them?

[13:00:49.0790] <Nic>
What are the advantages/disadvantages over the current approaches?

To answer the last question first: You'd be able to achieve this already with the current source map format. The sourceMappingURL is allowed to be cross-origin.

The closest thing I can think of are artifact servers for cloud providers. E.g. MS Azure allows you to host source maps (and original source files) for you behind some OAuth, so you can securely debug an app without making the source/source maps publicly available (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/javascript/consume-source-maps-from-azure).

AFAIK there is no package registry purely for source maps yet.
