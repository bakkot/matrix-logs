Iâ€™ll do it and should be able to finish in 5 mins! I meant to add slides this week but have been sick!

Sorry for coming in so late on this but here are the slides I'm planning to use to present our status updates at TC39 plenary today, we still have time to make any changes or corrections! https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W6p3pI1f-tqibcGZc2Fcj3JsEejW5fp749e-mFetK80/edit?usp=sharing
