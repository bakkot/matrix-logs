I‚Äôll do it and should be able to finish in 5 mins! I meant to add slides this week but have been sick!

Hey folks! Sorry for coming in so late on this but here are the slides I'm planning to use to present our status updates at TC39 plenary today, we still have time to make any changes or corrections! https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W6p3pI1f-tqibcGZc2Fcj3JsEejW5fp749e-mFetK80/edit?usp=sharing

[08:09:54.0020] <abelkius>
Looks good! 

[08:10:15.0403] <abelkius>
November 2023 is on 2 slides, should one of them be December 2023?

[08:11:22.0503] <abelkius>
Or actually all of that happened in November?

[08:12:22.0810] <jkup>
The date title idea kind of fell apart üòÇ I‚Äôll rework it!

[08:26:26.0674] <Jan Olaf Martin>
Thanks for putting this together!

Hey folks! We're trying to plan our next in-person gettogether and hackathon. I was thinking Munich hosted in the Google office would be good considering how many of our members live in that area. We also thought picking a date that's far enough from today that we'll have some great progress to share but not too far from the TC39 September plenary so we can make sure we're on a good track for that presentation. I'm going to throw out a few dates to vote on and if the location or the dates are problematic, please let me know and we'll try to work it out!

Sorry I will have to miss the call today

[09:02:47.0047] <Artem Kobzar>
Seems like the link is still invalid üòî

[09:02:51.0438] <abelkius>
Is the link broken?

[09:02:56.0395] <abelkius>
oh yeah, for me too

[09:03:22.0048] <jkup>
I'm also out of office today

[09:04:01.0836] <abelkius>
should we move the meeting then?

[09:07:03.0334] <Simon Z√ºnd>
I can provide a meets link if anyone has something they wanna chat about?

[09:08:54.0700] <Artem Kobzar>
From my side, I want to discuss the behavior we want to describe for SourceMap consumers when using a wrong version number.

[09:09:33.0102] <Artem Kobzar>
But we could discuss it here asynchronously.

[09:10:57.0567] <littledan>
Do people want something scheduled for this time next week? Vote with emoji reacts

[09:11:52.0963] <littledan>
(Or also feel free to make a new link and hold the call now!)

I just made 2 new multi-year recurring Zoom meetings for our calls and Jordan Harband helped me update them on the TC39 calendar. Hopefully no more room problems!
