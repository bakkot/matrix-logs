This was a great talk from our very own Kamil OgÃ³rek https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/javascript-source-maps-can-we-do-better

[03:52:19.0747] <Kamil OgÃ³rek>
Thank you! ðŸ™‡

I'm going to give a live version at https://2023.nodejsconf.it/ if anyone is going to be around :)

is there an agenda for the meeting today?

[07:59:01.0155] <jkup>
Last time we used the doc in the invite but I don't see an agenda for this meeting cc littledan 

[08:09:28.0753] <Jack Works>
sorry I feel not good so I may not come today. Hope there is a meeting note I can see the discussion later!

(it's also midnight for me)

On the topic of tests here a list of stuff we have:
* https://github.com/getsentry/rust-sourcemap/tree/master/tests
* https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/blob/master/symbolic-sourcemapcache/tests/integration.rs
* https://sourcemaps.io

Thank you Armin Ronacher !

We didn't have time to circle back to testing, but here are some thoughts I had for later discussion:

- Many generator implementations result in mappings unique to the source language (TS, Flow, CoffeeScript, SASS, etc.)
- One of the hardest parts is manual output verification
- Source map output itself is relatively useless for manual inspection
- Often need to rely on secondary output for verification, i.e. TS uses a text file showing source to generated with mappings. Still not great
- Generated to source visualization can be helpful, but few tools
- No visual diff tools for generated to source visualizations that I'm aware of
- No automated tools for validating debugger stepping in source maps that I'm aware of

Thanks for the write-up rbuckton - sorry we didn't get back to it on the call.

From yesterday's meeting we were hoping to have a dedicated room for the source map testing efforts. Can one of the admins create one for us?

[04:16:26.0695] <littledan>
You donâ€™t need any permission to create a Matrix room

## TC39-TG4 source map hackathon, September 22 at Google Munich and online

We all want to make progress on source maps, but have trouble finding the time. Letâ€™s get together for a hybrid hackathon to work on them together!

Google Munich will be hosting a hybrid summit to talk about and hack on source maps and developer tools more broadly. Everyone interested in participating in TC39-TG4 (the source map standards committee) fill out [*this form*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScx5SESWXT9W8OMNNaaYqFRYRFmfRp2EezYjeW-2gAvtlANYw/viewform) to register, whether in person or remote.

Note: if you are not yet a member of TG4 but are interested in joining, please fill out the above form and we will get in touch.

Details:
Location: Google Munich office
Date: September 22nd, 2023
Time: 9 AM - 5 PM Central European Time (includes breakfast and lunch)
Agenda tbd (will post a draft next week)

During the hacking time, some things we can work on together or separately:
- tests for source maps
- The source map spec
- Source map validator
- Descriptions of source map features
- Prototype implementations of new source map features

I hope to see you there!

This was a fun read https://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/11/introducing-closure-tools.html - Especially where it mentions  "You can use the (closure) compiler with Closure Inspector, a Firebug extension that makes debugging the obfuscated code almost as easy as debugging the human-readable source."

FYI - looks like the TC39 Github org has great Google ranking. The search results in incognito for "source map v3" do already send people that way.

[10:08:07.0326] <littledan>
Well, to be fair, this includes a redirect from a long-standing repo that wasnâ€™t in TC39

[10:08:35.0344] <littledan>
But anyway this points to the (boring) need to make sure our repo READMEs do a good job describing the current status and efforts 

[10:09:09.0154] <littledan>
PRs welcome!

[14:21:47.0712] <littledan>
Hey,  I'm in touch with a really good tech journalist who's working on an article on source maps. Would anyone like to be in touch with her? If so, I'll send an introduction.
