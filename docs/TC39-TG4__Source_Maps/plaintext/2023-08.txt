On the topic of tests here a list of stuff we have:
* https://github.com/getsentry/rust-sourcemap/tree/master/tests
* https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/blob/master/symbolic-sourcemapcache/tests/integration.rs
* https://sourcemaps.io

We didn't have time to circle back to testing, but here are some thoughts I had for later discussion:

- Many generator implementations result in mappings unique to the source language (TS, Flow, CoffeeScript, SASS, etc.)
- One of the hardest parts is manual output verification
- Source map output itself is relatively useless for manual inspection
- Often need to rely on secondary output for verification, i.e. TS uses a text file showing source to generated with mappings. Still not great
- Generated to source visualization can be helpful, but few tools
- No visual diff tools for generated to source visualizations that I'm aware of
- No automated tools for validating debugger stepping in source maps that I'm aware of
