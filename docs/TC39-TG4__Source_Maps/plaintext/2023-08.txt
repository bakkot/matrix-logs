This was a great talk from our very own Kamil Ogórek https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/javascript-source-maps-can-we-do-better

[03:52:19.0747] <Kamil Ogórek>
Thank you! 🙇

I'm going to give a live version at https://2023.nodejsconf.it/ if anyone is going to be around :)

is there an agenda for the meeting today?

[07:59:01.0155] <jkup>
Last time we used the doc in the invite but I don't see an agenda for this meeting cc littledan 

[08:09:28.0753] <Jack Works>
sorry I feel not good so I may not come today. Hope there is a meeting note I can see the discussion later!

(it's also midnight for me)

On the topic of tests here a list of stuff we have:
* https://github.com/getsentry/rust-sourcemap/tree/master/tests
* https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/blob/master/symbolic-sourcemapcache/tests/integration.rs
* https://sourcemaps.io

Thank you Armin Ronacher !

We didn't have time to circle back to testing, but here are some thoughts I had for later discussion:

- Many generator implementations result in mappings unique to the source language (TS, Flow, CoffeeScript, SASS, etc.)
- One of the hardest parts is manual output verification
- Source map output itself is relatively useless for manual inspection
- Often need to rely on secondary output for verification, i.e. TS uses a text file showing source to generated with mappings. Still not great
- Generated to source visualization can be helpful, but few tools
- No visual diff tools for generated to source visualizations that I'm aware of
- No automated tools for validating debugger stepping in source maps that I'm aware of

Thanks for the write-up rbuckton - sorry we didn't get back to it on the call.

From yesterday's meeting we were hoping to have a dedicated room for the source map testing efforts. Can one of the admins create one for us?

[04:16:26.0695] <littledan>
You don’t need any permission to create a Matrix room

## TC39-TG4 source map hackathon, September 22 at Google Munich and online

We all want to make progress on source maps, but have trouble finding the time. Let’s get together for a hybrid hackathon to work on them together!

Google Munich will be hosting a hybrid summit to talk about and hack on source maps and developer tools more broadly. Everyone interested in participating in TC39-TG4 (the source map standards committee) fill out [*this form*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScx5SESWXT9W8OMNNaaYqFRYRFmfRp2EezYjeW-2gAvtlANYw/viewform) to register, whether in person or remote.

Note: if you are not yet a member of TG4 but are interested in joining, please fill out the above form and we will get in touch.

Details:
Location: Google Munich office
Date: September 22nd, 2023
Time: 9 AM - 5 PM Central European Time (includes breakfast and lunch)
Agenda tbd (will post a draft next week)

During the hacking time, some things we can work on together or separately:
- tests for source maps
- The source map spec
- Source map validator
- Descriptions of source map features
- Prototype implementations of new source map features

I hope to see you there!

This was a fun read https://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/11/introducing-closure-tools.html - Especially where it mentions  "You can use the (closure) compiler with Closure Inspector, a Firebug extension that makes debugging the obfuscated code almost as easy as debugging the human-readable source."

FYI - looks like the TC39 Github org has great Google ranking. The search results in incognito for "source map v3" do already send people that way.

[10:08:07.0326] <littledan>
Well, to be fair, this includes a redirect from a long-standing repo that wasn’t in TC39

[10:08:35.0344] <littledan>
But anyway this points to the (boring) need to make sure our repo READMEs do a good job describing the current status and efforts 

[10:09:09.0154] <littledan>
PRs welcome!

[14:21:47.0712] <littledan>
Hey,  I'm in touch with a really good tech journalist who's working on an article on source maps. Would anyone like to be in touch with her? If so, I'll send an introduction.

 We should befriend the folks working on the Eiffel language (TC49-TG4)
