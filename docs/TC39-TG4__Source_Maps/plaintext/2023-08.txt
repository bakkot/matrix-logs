Thank you! ðŸ™‡

is there an agenda for the meeting today?

Last time we used the doc in the invite but I don't see an agenda for this meeting cc littledan

sorry I feel not good so I may not come today. Hope there is a meeting note I can see the discussion later!

On the topic of tests here a list of stuff we have:
* https://github.com/getsentry/rust-sourcemap/tree/master/tests
* https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/blob/master/symbolic-sourcemapcache/tests/integration.rs
* https://sourcemaps.io

Thank you Armin Ronacher !

We didn't have time to circle back to testing, but here are some thoughts I had for later discussion:

- Many generator implementations result in mappings unique to the source language (TS, Flow, CoffeeScript, SASS, etc.)
- One of the hardest parts is manual output verification
- Source map output itself is relatively useless for manual inspection
- Often need to rely on secondary output for verification, i.e. TS uses a text file showing source to generated with mappings. Still not great
- Generated to source visualization can be helpful, but few tools
- No visual diff tools for generated to source visualizations that I'm aware of
- No automated tools for validating debugger stepping in source maps that I'm aware of

Thanks for the write-up rbuckton - sorry we didn't get back to it on the call.

From yesterday's meeting we were hoping to have a dedicated room for the source map testing efforts. Can one of the admins create one for us?

You donâ€™t need any permission to create a Matrix room

## TC39-TG4 source map hackathon, September 22 at Google Munich and online

We all want to make progress on source maps, but have trouble finding the time. Letâ€™s get together for a hybrid hackathon to work on them together!

Google Munich will be hosting a hybrid summit to talk about and hack on source maps and developer tools more broadly. Everyone interested in participating in TC39-TG4 (the source map standards committee) fill out [*this form*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScx5SESWXT9W8OMNNaaYqFRYRFmfRp2EezYjeW-2gAvtlANYw/viewform) to register, whether in person or remote.

Note: if you are not yet a member of TG4 but are interested in joining, please fill out the above form and we will get in touch.

Details:
Location: Google Munich office
Date: September 22nd, 2023
Time: 9 AM - 5 PM Central European Time (includes breakfast and lunch)
Agenda tbd (will post a draft next week)

During the hacking time, some things we can work on together or separately:
- tests for source maps
- The source map spec
- Source map validator
- Descriptions of source map features
- Prototype implementations of new source map features

I hope to see you there!
