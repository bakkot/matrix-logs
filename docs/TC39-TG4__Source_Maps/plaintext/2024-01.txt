Hey folks! Are any of you planning on attending the next TC39 plenary in San Diego in person?

[07:35:46.0954] <Nic>
Yes!

[07:45:00.0986] <littledan>
maybe!

[08:29:14.0128] <rbuckton>
Unfortunately, I can't attend in person

I'm unable to connect to the Zoom linked in the Calendar invite still. Anyone else? If so, I can go ahead and create a temporary Zoom for today!

[09:00:31.0943] <asumu>
I was unable to connect either

[09:00:34.0636] <Holger Benl>
same here

To clarify. On the last call, we were discussing that we should fix the version number in the spec, but we already have it (section "Source Map Format," on the line with the "version" definition):
https://tc39.es/source-map-spec/#source-map-format
Would we like something else here?

[12:47:13.0133] <littledan>
Yeah, it should indicate what source map processors should do if the version is not 3 (IMO: reject the source map)

https://tc39.es/source-map-spec/#json-over-http-transport

Do we know if this also applies to HTTPS?

[08:53:48.0268] <Justin Ridgewell>
Yes, it still applies

[08:54:16.0940] <Justin Ridgewell>
That string is called an XSSI prefix, and it's to prevent sites from trying to "execute" the JSON contents

[08:57:29.0867] <Nic>
Ok thanks!

[11:02:37.0084] <littledan>
Should we continue having “two dialects” of source maps, or should we just say that this can be at the beginning of any source map?

[11:03:02.0198] <littledan>
Like should we test that “non-HTTP[S]” usage does not permit this prefix?

[12:09:18.0665] <Jan Olaf Martin>
I assume "HTTP(S)" really is "non-inline/non-data URLs"? E.g. source maps from `file://` URLs I assume would realistically still allow the XSSI prefix for consistency..?

[12:10:07.0505] <Jan Olaf Martin>
With that assumption, I do believe that a test to verify that inline data URLs don't permit the prefix is very reasonable

[12:48:45.0746] <littledan>
> <@jkrems:matrix.org> I assume "HTTP(S)" really is "non-inline/non-data URLs"? E.g. source maps from `file://` URLs I assume would realistically still allow the XSSI prefix for consistency..?

OK so what about source maps being fed into an offline stack trace decoding system? or used in Node.js?

I created a "has potential test cases" label for the RFC repo -- please use it when posting interesting examples so that one day we'll not forget to extract them as tests :)

where did this request come from?

Samina, for the memento 

[14:17:34.0058] <Chris de Almeida>
ok.. strange we have not received this request for TG3 and I don't think TG2 either, but not positive

[14:17:57.0793] <Chris de Almeida>
well.. we keep attendance records though, so maybe that's why it wasn't asked

[14:18:41.0262] <jkup>
Oh yeah I’m not sure. She sent me TG3 as a template to use but not sure if it was last years or this years 

[14:19:36.0603] <Chris de Almeida>
ah, can you message me that?  it will be obvious if it's out of date
