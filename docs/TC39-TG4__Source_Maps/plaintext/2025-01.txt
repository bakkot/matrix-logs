This is low stakes but can we have a quick chat about repo naming for the spec and tests repositories? We had https://github.com/tc39/source-map but renamed it to https://github.com/tc39/ecma426. But now we have https://github.com/tc39/ecma426 and https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests which is inconvenient. Should we:

üå¥ Rename the tests repo to tc39/test426
üö≤Ô∏è Leave the spec as 426 and the tests as source-map-tests
üé¢ Rename the spec back to tc39/source-map and leave the tests

Note that we did the rename because we wanted to make sure that tc39.es/ecma426 pointed to the spec, but this could work just via a redirect (like how we preserved the tc39.es/source-map URL, but backwards). I think there was a misunderstanding at some point that there was a procedural/Ecma requirement for the naming, but in reality, we can just choose whatever's most convenient for us.

Gooling "source map spec", https://github.com/tc39/source-map-spec pops up as the top result...

that's not so bad

Hey folks. I got a bit of internal feedback on the spec and was hoping to bring some of the points to the larger group:

1. Under https://tc39.es/ecma426/#mappings-structure we have the section that begins with "To decode a base64 VLQ..." and the defined algorithm has step 1 as returning null but other failure cases throwing an error. This seems inconsistent.
2. On the same algorithm, there was also feedback that it might be cleaner to switch to return codes instead of number/null/throwing: Paraphrasing: "It might make more sense if the decoder returns a code and appends numbers into an output vector. Then it simply becomes 'return' without writing any values to the vector vs. error conditions that throw.
3. We mention -2^31 - 2^31-1 in the spec and use those values but then we say "If value is 0 and sign is -1, return -2147483648" - why not keep the -2^31 style nomenclature there and forego the note?

but 2^31 is 0
