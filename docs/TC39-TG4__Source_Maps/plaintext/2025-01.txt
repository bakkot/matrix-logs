This is low stakes but can we have a quick chat about repo naming for the spec and tests repositories? We had https://github.com/tc39/source-map but renamed it to https://github.com/tc39/ecma426. But now we have https://github.com/tc39/ecma426 and https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests which is inconvenient. Should we:

🌴 Rename the tests repo to tc39/test426
🚲️ Leave the spec as 426 and the tests as source-map-tests
🎢 Rename the spec back to tc39/source-map and leave the tests
