This is low stakes but can we have a quick chat about repo naming for the spec and tests repositories? We had https://github.com/tc39/source-map but renamed it to https://github.com/tc39/ecma426. But now we have https://github.com/tc39/ecma426 and https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests which is inconvenient. Should we:

üå¥ Rename the tests repo to tc39/test426
üö≤Ô∏è Leave the spec as 426 and the tests as source-map-tests
üé¢ Rename the spec back to tc39/source-map and leave the tests

[07:09:05.0870] <littledan>
Note that we did the rename because we wanted to make sure that tc39.es/ecma426 pointed to the spec, but this could work just via a redirect (like how we preserved the tc39.es/source-map URL, but backwards). I think there was a misunderstanding at some point that there was a procedural/Ecma requirement for the naming, but in reality, we can just choose whatever's most convenient for us.

Gooling "source map spec", https://github.com/tc39/source-map-spec pops up as the top result...

that's not so bad

Hey folks. I got a bit of internal feedback on the spec and was hoping to bring some of the points to the larger group:

1. Under https://tc39.es/ecma426/#mappings-structure we have the section that begins with "To decode a base64 VLQ..." and the defined algorithm has step 1 as returning null but other failure cases throwing an error. This seems inconsistent.
2. On the same algorithm, there was also feedback that it might be cleaner to switch to return codes instead of number/null/throwing: Paraphrasing: "It might make more sense if the decoder returns a code and appends numbers into an output vector. Then it simply becomes 'return' without writing any values to the vector vs. error conditions that throw.
3. We mention -2^31 - 2^31-1 in the spec and use those values but then we say "If value is 0 and sign is -1, return -2147483648" - why not keep the -2^31 style nomenclature there and forego the note?

Meeting starting now! https://bloomberg.zoom.us/j/97901112561?pwd=TlNyeW8ycGlaMk9BTmUxMHZrcE11dz09

[09:53:55.0356] <littledan>
but 2^31 is 0

[09:57:21.0680] <jkup>
we use 2^31-1 right? 

[09:57:32.0385] <littledan>
that's -1 then!

[09:57:53.0462] <littledan>
oh wait I was thinking of &

[09:57:59.0134] <littledan>
I guess 2^31 is 30

[09:58:18.0660] <littledan>
no, 29, ugh

[09:58:23.0835] <littledan>
I can't do math

[09:58:30.0128] <jkup>
I mean same

[09:58:45.0980] <littledan>
anyway I'm joking, I think ^ is unambiguous in practice

[09:58:50.0465] <littledan>
but you could use superscript instead of ^

[09:59:18.0595] <jkup>
Totally fair. But do we think specifying the full int is unecessary?

[10:42:49.0198] <littledan>
yeah no I like the abbreviation idea, it gets the intent across better

> <@dcrousso:matrix.org> we may also want to see if there's a way to have each test be a separate test so that if failures occur they're more specific

Hi Devin just a quick update on this PR, I was able to update it so that each source map test is a separate sub-test in the TestSuite object. It‚Äôs also passing all the CI including debug builds now. Would be happy to address anything else.

Is there any update on if the licensing is ok for WebKit?

[20:23:42.0779] <Devin Rousso>
awesome! i'll take another look

[20:23:59.0688] <Devin Rousso>
i haven't heard anything from WebKit folks about the licensing. i'll ask again

Hi folks, just a reminder that there's a scopes meeting in ~30m. I think so far there's an agenda item about continuing to discuss scope encodings.

[08:32:41.0981] <Simon Z√ºnd>
I don't wanna hog all the time again, so if someone has a different topic, they can prepend it in the agenda :)

Meeting time! https://bloomberg.zoom.us/j/98319586084?pwd=Skwyejc3bDBMRnY5ZlBqaUp0VzFBQT09
