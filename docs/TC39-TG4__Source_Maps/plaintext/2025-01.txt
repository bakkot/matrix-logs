This is low stakes but can we have a quick chat about repo naming for the spec and tests repositories? We had https://github.com/tc39/source-map but renamed it to https://github.com/tc39/ecma426. But now we have https://github.com/tc39/ecma426 and https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests which is inconvenient. Should we:

üå¥ Rename the tests repo to tc39/test426
üö≤Ô∏è Leave the spec as 426 and the tests as source-map-tests
üé¢ Rename the spec back to tc39/source-map and leave the tests

Note that we did the rename because we wanted to make sure that tc39.es/ecma426 pointed to the spec, but this could work just via a redirect (like how we preserved the tc39.es/source-map URL, but backwards). I think there was a misunderstanding at some point that there was a procedural/Ecma requirement for the naming, but in reality, we can just choose whatever's most convenient for us.

Gooling "source map spec", https://github.com/tc39/source-map-spec pops up as the top result...
