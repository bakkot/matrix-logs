Hey all, I'm looking into starting a draft for the scopes spec text. The data structures involved are somewhat complex, should we embrace the TypeScript syntax to describe types and maybe even extend it to also describe the root SourceMap object that way? There is some prior art for this e.g. for Microsoft's language server protocol: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/. They also use TS notation to describe JSON structures. There is also JSON-schema, but it's not that human-readable. Any thoughts?

This is a great question. I'm not 100% sure on it. Wondering if Dan/Nic will have a better idea!

for the specification itself? seems good for drafts but we might iterate editorially later

Hey, yes. I assume most of these data structures are spec-internal, right? Since the exposed "API" is just that there is an array of strings.

Web specs usually use a record/struct type for that: [this is an example of what ECMA-262 uses](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#realm-record) and [this is an example of what everything else uses](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-script). I would go with the latter, since our spec is written in bikeshed, so it's more like the non-ecma262 specs.

I think using the TS notation can be useful for other spec readers though, especially for the "public API" (i.e. for describing the shape of the source map JSON object). Maybe that could go somewhere in a note, in https://tc39.es/source-map/#source-map-format

I'd like to organize the "mapping" info as a proper struct, I could draft something up and you can take it as an example. Also, feel free to ping me for any editorial question :)

definitely this is good to go ahead with your initial drafts IMO
