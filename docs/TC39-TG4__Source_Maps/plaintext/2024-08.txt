Hey all, I'm looking into starting a draft for the scopes spec text. The data structures involved are somewhat complex, should we embrace the TypeScript syntax to describe types and maybe even extend it to also describe the root SourceMap object that way? There is some prior art for this e.g. for Microsoft's language server protocol: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/. They also use TS notation to describe JSON structures. There is also JSON-schema, but it's not that human-readable. Any thoughts?
