Hey all, I'm looking into starting a draft for the scopes spec text. The data structures involved are somewhat complex, should we embrace the TypeScript syntax to describe types and maybe even extend it to also describe the root SourceMap object that way? There is some prior art for this e.g. for Microsoft's language server protocol: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/. They also use TS notation to describe JSON structures. There is also JSON-schema, but it's not that human-readable. Any thoughts?

[02:28:29.0009] <jkup>
This is a great question. I'm not 100% sure on it. Wondering if Dan/Nic will have a better idea!

[08:41:35.0176] <littledan>
for the specification itself? seems good for drafts but we might iterate editorially later

[08:44:14.0510] <Nic>
Hey, yes. I assume most of these data structures are spec-internal, right? Since the exposed "API" is just that there is an array of strings.

Web specs usually use a record/struct type for that: [this is an example of what ECMA-262 uses](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#realm-record) and [this is an example of what everything else uses](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-script). I would go with the latter, since our spec is written in bikeshed, so it's more like the non-ecma262 specs.

I think using the TS notation can be useful for other spec readers though, especially for the "public API" (i.e. for describing the shape of the source map JSON object). Maybe that could go somewhere in a note, in https://tc39.es/source-map/#source-map-format

[08:45:00.0455] <Nic>
I'd like to organize the "mapping" info as a proper struct, I could draft something up and you can take it as an example. Also, feel free to ping me for any editorial question :)

[08:45:03.0585] <littledan>
definitely this is good to go ahead with your initial drafts IMO

Q: Is it valid to have the same URL twice in the `sources` list? Or do they get coalesced?

Nic: I opened an issue on this a bit ago that documents the current browser behavior btw https://github.com/tc39/source-map/issues/85

Oh, thanks!

hey yall!

[18:55:46.0089] <Devin Rousso>
got some good news

[18:56:00.0067] <Devin Rousso>
i have a working implementation of `ignoreList` in WebKit ðŸŽ‰

[18:56:21.0038] <Devin Rousso>
but there's a few PRs that need to be merged beforehand

[18:56:49.0458] <Devin Rousso>
if anyone else here is a WebKit reviewer (or knows someone they could ask to help), id appreciate any assistance in getting this approved ðŸ™‚ <https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/31768> (Web Inspector: allow sourcemaps to be blackboxed)

[18:57:24.0166] <Devin Rousso>
as soon as that's merged, i already have a `.patch` ready to go for the final followup <https://webkit.org/b/275673> (Web Inspector: add support for `ignoreList` in sourcemaps)

FYI: I won't be able to attend the meeting today

[01:34:54.0105] <Artem Kobzar>
Does it work for Wasm too?

[01:36:52.0172] <Artem Kobzar>
Hey yall!
I've assembled a draft for the DevTools Custom Formatters spec. Could somebody create a repo for it, or should I create a repo under my personal account, and only after that will we create an official one for the spec?


[01:39:56.0605] <Nic>
Usually for TC39 proposals we start in a personal repo and then move them over. We can follow the same path 

[02:12:17.0126] <Artem Kobzar>
The repo: https://github.com/JSMonk/devtools-formatters-spec/
The rendered draft: https://jsmonk.github.io/devtools-formatters-spec/

There is still some work (like describing goals and the background, but I believe we need to discuss those sections)

Hi there.
I'm just thinking. Since we are also working not only on SourceMap standardization but also on CustomFormatters and Wasm Console API (WIP, draft name), does it make sense in the near future to declare that TG4 is working not on the SourceMaps spec but on the "debugging experience" (or at least list all the spec we are working on)
