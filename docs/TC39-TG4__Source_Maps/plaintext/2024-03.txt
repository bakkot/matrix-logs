I moved our Google Docs notes into a central repository (https://github.com/jkup/tg4). I figure we can give a TC39 GitHub admin rights to it, and they can move it into the TC39 org. I wanted to give folks a bit to check it out before I submit it to be linked in https://github.com/tc39/notes

you can put it in github.com/tc39-transfer on your own, and then i can bounce it in
