I moved our Google Docs notes into a central repository (https://github.com/jkup/tg4). I figure we can give a TC39 GitHub admin rights to it, and they can move it into the TC39 org. I wanted to give folks a bit to check it out before I submit it to be linked in https://github.com/tc39/notes

you can put it in github.com/tc39-transfer on your own, and then i can bounce it in

Justin Ridgewell (and all): As the scopes proposal (https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/blob/main/proposals/scopes.md) nears spec completion, and a few consumers (Chrome DevTools, Replay.io) are working on implementations, I think it would be great for a generator to also begin work on an implementation. I asked Nic about how difficult it would be for me (with help) to add scopes support to Babel and they mentioned that you had probably the most context around Babel's source map generation. I'm curious if you have any time / availability to help shepherd a feature implementation!
