I moved our Google Docs notes into a central repository (https://github.com/jkup/tg4). I figure we can give a TC39 GitHub admin rights to it, and they can move it into the TC39 org. I wanted to give folks a bit to check it out before I submit it to be linked in https://github.com/tc39/notes

you can put it in github.com/tc39-transfer on your own, and then i can bounce it in

This is a very cool idea!

also if you lmk the github names of everyone in tg4, i'll make a team for them (DM is fine)

Justin Ridgewell (and all): As the scopes proposal (https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/blob/main/proposals/scopes.md) nears spec completion, and a few consumers (Chrome DevTools, Replay.io) are working on implementations, I think it would be great for a generator to also begin work on an implementation. I asked Nic about how difficult it would be for me (with help) to add scopes support to Babel and they mentioned that you had probably the most context around Babel's source map generation. I'm curious if you have any time / availability to help shepherd a feature implementation!

I have a couple of questions/comments on the Scopes proposal:
- Why is Original Scope `column` absolute?
- What‚Äôs the point of splitting Original Scope‚Äôs Start/End? Just encode it together
- Are Generated Range‚Äôs `originalScope` and `callsite` mutually exclusive?
- I have no idea how to parse Generated Range‚Äôs `bindings`.
    - Is `M` a DATA?
    - What is ‚Äúnegative number of sub-ranges‚Äù?
    - ‚ÄúUse -1 to indicate that the current variable is unavailable (e.g. due to shadowing) in this sub-range‚Äù‚Ä¶
        - This causes a large delta encoding to jump backwards, then a large delta to jump forwards. Just encode an empty string value into `names` array
    - [Side note: the note telling you that `line` is relative is in the `column` list item]
