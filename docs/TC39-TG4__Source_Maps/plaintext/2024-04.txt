Next week is TC39 plenary! For those who don't know we always give a ~5 minute update during plenary both to keep folks in the loop but also to highlight what we're currently working on in case anyone wants to join. I was hoping to cover:

- Work being done on the scopes proposal (progress on spec as well as early start of implementation)
- Work being done on the testing initiative (might be too early to request feedback but at least people know we're actively working on it)
- Examples of the work we're doing hardening the spec (Asumu's last two comments in here would be great for that)
- RFC on `sourceMappingURL` comment?
- Anything else?
