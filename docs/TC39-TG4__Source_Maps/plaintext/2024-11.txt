do y'all have plans to move from bikeshed to ecmarkup (or some other tool) in the future? or do you plan on sticking with bikeshed?

I haven't heard of any plans; do you see a reason why we should move away from bike shed?

The plan is to stick to bikeshed, because it's much easier to use for those familiar with neitherÂ

that's fine

just trying to plan for putting together PDF

I would like to invite someone to give a presentation about the current state of the Source Maps specification efforts to the Web Foundations team (and possibly other interested folks) at Google. The requirements are minimal. Just show up and spend 30-minutes telling us stuff (slides are nice but not required) and allow us to ask you questions for another 30 minutes. Remote participation is expected, but you're also welcome to come in person and get a free lunch out of it, if you like.

Who would be interested?

I backported the changes with the ExeCom feedback to the 2024 branch. I also disabled merge commits in the repo because cherry-picking a merge is much more annoying than cherry-picking a commit, so please use squash-merge :)

Thanks to Justin Ridgewell  for volunteering.

Sorry I hadn't gotten back sooner. Thanks for volunteering Justin! I put in an internal request to do this and still have not heard back.
