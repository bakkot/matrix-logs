do y'all have plans to move from bikeshed to ecmarkup (or some other tool) in the future? or do you plan on sticking with bikeshed?

I haven't heard of any plans; do you see a reason why we should move away from bike shed?

The plan is to stick to bikeshed, because it's much easier to use for those familiar with neitherÂ
