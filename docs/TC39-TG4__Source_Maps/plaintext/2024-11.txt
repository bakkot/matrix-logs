do y'all have plans to move from bikeshed to ecmarkup (or some other tool) in the future? or do you plan on sticking with bikeshed? 

[14:36:48.0181] <littledan>
I haven't heard of any plans; do you see a reason why we should move away from bike shed?

The plan is to stick to bikeshed, because it's much easier to use for those familiar with neitherÂ 

[17:30:14.0315] <Aki>
that's fine

[17:30:22.0655] <Aki>
just trying to plan for putting together PDF

[09:40:08.0468] <Bradford Smith>
I would like to invite someone to give a presentation about the current state of the Source Maps specification efforts to the Web Foundations team (and possibly other interested folks) at Google. The requirements are minimal. Just show up and spend 30-minutes telling us stuff (slides are nice but not required) and allow us to ask you questions for another 30 minutes. Remote participation is expected, but you're also welcome to come in person and get a free lunch out of it, if you like.

[09:40:20.0925] <Bradford Smith>
Who would be interested?

I backported the changes with the ExeCom feedback to the 2024 branch. I also disabled merge commits in the repo because cherry-picking a merge is much more annoying than cherry-picking a commit, so please use squash-merge :)

[15:40:52.0537] <Bradford Smith>
Thanks to Justin Ridgewell  for volunteering.

Sorry I hadn't gotten back sooner. Thanks for volunteering Justin! I put in an internal request to do this and still have not heard back.

[10:30:54.0233] <Aki>
Okay I know I already asked this but hear me out. When I first asked if you were planning on moving to bikeshed, it was a question with no motive, just genuine curiosity. The more I work on putting together publishing stuff for the sourcemaps standard, the more I find myself wishing the TC39 standards were consistent (and wondering how you're going to publish a digital version of the standard that doesn't look like it's being published by w3c)

[10:31:10.0591] <Aki>

[10:31:35.0577] <Aki>
so the question i asked before was "are you planning to move from bikeshed" and my new question is 

would you consider moving to ecmarkdown/ecmarkup?

[10:36:15.0573] <Nic>
I guess given that there is a concrete reason to do it we can consider doing it

[10:36:41.0026] <Nic>
How urgent would it be? Is it a blocker for you?

[10:36:46.0324] <Aki>
it is not

[10:36:51.0519] <Aki>
i'm going to do the PDF first

[10:37:04.0036] <Nic>
I'll put this on the next TG4 agenda

[10:37:16.0082] <Nic>
Oh, it's tomorrowÂ 

[10:37:29.0469] <Aki>
after i'm done with that, there's a _possibility_ i could put together a first draft of an ecmarkdown version for y'all

[10:37:36.0382] <Aki>
do you want me at that meeting?

[10:38:12.0592] <Nic>
You would be welcome to join, but no worries if you can't (I can try to present from your point of view)

* You are welcome to join, but no worries if you can't (I can try to present from your point of view)

[10:39:10.0030] <Aki>
oh yeah i have an appointment to donate blood that conflicts

[10:43:47.0604] <Aki>
If y'all decide not to change, I'd also love to hear what your plan is for restyling, if you have one

[11:07:55.0262] <littledan>
WinterCG is currently using bikeshed too, so if Ecma gets good at publishing Bikeshed specs, it'll be useful.

[11:08:26.0128] <littledan>
what restyling requirements exist? My understanding is that some W3C specs are standardized in ISO, so maybe we could work with them to find what is really needed.

[11:26:45.0292] <Aki>
i mean my comment was really saying "it looks like it belongs on w3.org"

[11:27:13.0969] <littledan>
oh does it refer to it?

[11:27:24.0150] <Aki>
no, it _looks like it_

[11:27:33.0441] <Aki>
two different definitions of requirements. there's the web version of the latest, and the web/pdf versions of frozen/published versions

[11:27:42.0457] <Aki>
the latter has formal requirements which i can handle

[11:27:52.0064] <Aki>
the former is likeâ€¦Â can you make it look like it blongs to ecma?

[11:28:03.0314] <littledan>
whatwg has some specs using bikeshed as well (even as others use the crazy pascal tooling)

[11:28:08.0919] <Nic>
I wonder whether changing colors would be enoughÂ 

[11:28:22.0538] <Nic>
Sprinkling some orangeÂ 

[11:29:03.0784] <littledan>
for the sake of comparison, since Ecma is bigger than TC39, I'm wondering whether you think the cyclonedx spec looks like an Ecma spec.

[11:30:00.0997] <Aki>
TC54 is moving to ecmarkup (by their own volition, not me asking them to)

[11:30:14.0612] <littledan>
interesting!

Meeting now, for those that participate :) We'll start in 1 min

[09:05:14.0273] <asumu>
Meeting link for anyone who needs it https://bloomberg.zoom.us/j/97901112561?pwd=TlNyeW8ycGlaMk9BTmUxMHZrcE11dz09

[09:39:54.0976] <Nic>
asumu: how much time do you need for your point?

[09:40:10.0384] <Nic>
Is 10 mins enough?

[09:40:14.0384] <Nic>
Or do you prefer more?

[09:40:17.0707] <asumu>
Nic: not too much time, can bump it to mostly async too

[10:06:58.0990] <asumu>
Re: index maps & overlaps, see https://takikawa.github.io/source-map-spec/#decoding-an-index-map (step 8.7) where there's a big green note about the overlap check. I was also planning to re-write this check to compare the {first, last} points of the previous and current sub-maps which I think is clearer and more precise than the current check.

[10:20:05.0486] <Nic>
Given that the error are optional, it seems like the spec text gives already enough freedom to implementations (they could just report the "some" errors that match what you describe in the note). I still find the note useful, but I would word it as "source map consumers may, for example, ..."

[10:20:17.0502] <Nic>
Or we make this case a non-optional error in the algorithm, since the note shouldn't actually prescribe what to do

[10:22:27.0884] <Nic>
Luca Forstner The "error stacks" proposal I mentioned is https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-stacks, which also defines a structured representation of the stack so that, if then we add debugIDs on top of it, you wouldn't need to parse the string.

If you are interested in it, I recommend reaching out to ljharb as he was the original champion :)

[01:34:41.0347] <Luca Forstner>
That's cool history! Thanks for sharing - I will definitely take a look. I also need to look into the normal TC39 process a bit. A bit scary admittedly ðŸ˜ƒ


2024-11-15
[18:01:22.0656] <Aki>
is the 2024 branch reliably frozen? also did y'all make the changes requested? (I think maybe updating one informative section to be normative?)

[02:45:00.0026] <Aki>
draft PDF

[03:21:57.0542] <Nic>
Hey Aki, sorry for not answering earlier.

[03:22:04.0879] <Nic>
What is the informative section you are talking about?

[03:39:41.0543] <Nic>
Aki I looked at the draft PDF you sent me and it's looking very good, thanks!

I went through the 2024 branch and I noticed that there is one piece of feedback that still isn't on that branch (a slight rewording of the "issue" in 7.1.2). I'll get it merged today, and then everything is good.

About that "issue", I'm curious about how you decided to render it in the PDF. I _think_ you renamed it to "Note" just because Ecma specs only have Notes/Examples, but I wonder why it's orange like examples and not green like other notes?
