Hey folks! We have another plenary coming up next week. I'm just planning on giving a small update. I was going to cover:

1. The hackathon we had and our end to end demo
2. The state of the test suite (https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests)
3. The state of Scopes proposal
4. The tests being merged into Firefox and soon merged into Chrome
5. Maybe talk about some of the WASM work with custom formatters and the debug API?

Anything else I should mention?

Maybe say that we plan to present the finished spec next yime

aside: has anyone made contact with the wpt folks to let them know that this testing is going on, and we're doing it outside of their repo?

I didn't realize the plenary presentation was today. I thought it was tomorrow. Here is my first draft on the TG4 slides if anyone has time to review: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ke8rSW31P09Fgd7KuWyBox_JpBSG0RdKIoeJCbHsnK4/edit?usp=sharing

asumu: is it fair to say the test suite is "100% complete for testing the current specification"? Didn't want to misspeak

We're planning on bringing the cleaned up specification to the October plenary, to seek approval for publishing out first version
