Hey folks! We have another plenary coming up next week. I'm just planning on giving a small update. I was going to cover:

1. The hackathon we had and our end to end demo
2. The state of the test suite (https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests)
3. The state of Scopes proposal
4. The tests being merged into Firefox and soon merged into Chrome
5. Maybe talk about some of the WASM work with custom formatters and the debug API?

Anything else I should mention?
