i can work on getting the tests merged into WebKit

[14:30:25.0530] <Devin Rousso>
are there any features WebKit is missing that i should also implement?

[14:32:51.0727] <Nic>
A scopes implementation would be great eventually, for when we'll need the "two implementations" requirement!

[14:33:08.0306] <Nic>
Or â€” check which tests in the test suite are failing ðŸ˜‰

Do we have a table somewhere to track which proposals are at which stage? I can't find anything in the repo. The proposal docs themselves also don't contain which stage they are at.

[01:30:13.0936] <jkup>
We donâ€™t. This is something we havenâ€™t been great about. I need to do some work on my slides today, I can add a table to our readme and maybe label the specific proposal docs as well 

[02:55:02.0967] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
Just stumbled over a major issue with the scopes proposal: https://github.com/tc39/source-map/issues/133. We need to address this sooner rather than later.

Hi folks! Sorry been traveling a lot and figured it might be best to ask all of my questions in one place! How are we feeling for plenary?

- I have the slides linked above. Might add a bit more context to them 
- Have we made a decision on https://github.com/tc39/source-map/pull/122 - are we still trying to get it in?
- Have we cut the branch well point to as the 2024 spec?
- Are we still working on generating the official pdf of the spec?

> Are we still working on generating the official pdf of the spec?

Aki is going to do it, it will be ready in a few months

> Have we cut the branch well point to as the 2024 spec?

Not yet, but there are no changes on `main` that would not be in 2024. We can point to `main` for now

[08:26:58.0756] <Nic>
jkup: I made some changes to slide 6, please take a look!

[08:27:52.0366] <jkup>
Will do thank you! Maybe wait for Simon to weigh in on the "emit names" PR before cutting the branch?

[08:28:01.0232] <jkup>
I'm gonna add some more stuff in the morning Tokyo time too!

For the "names" PR: I updated it with the changes that we discussed in the last "Scopes" meeting and now I'm waiting for reviews.

[01:44:53.0166] <jkup>
Perfect, ty!

Is this about sourceMappingUrl not being allowed in multiline comments?

[03:37:04.0125] <jkup>
Curious which tool produces them 

[03:45:04.0383] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
Just to be clear, multi line comments are `/* #sourceMappingUrl= */`? The spec never mentions these so they are implicitly disallowed anyway? I'm not opposed to calling it out explicitly though.

[03:51:25.0394] <jkup>
That was my guess. We don't mention either way right now, for some reason I thought Nic had some thoughts about what we can and can't say about the comment. I know we discussed last line of file which we decided *not* to specify, instead specifying the last occurence via https://github.com/tc39/source-map/blob/main/source-map.bs#L796

[04:19:36.0384] <Nic>
Multiline comments are indeed supported: https://tc39.es/source-map/#extraction-javascript

[04:19:53.0739] <Nic>
But removing them seems very risky, we would need first to make sure no tool actually generates them

[04:20:16.0162] <jkup>
I was thinking about replying to the post asking if they know which tool was generating them? I haven't seen the before

[04:20:36.0504] <Nic>
From that tweet:

> nested sourcemap multiline comments

If it's nested in a bundle, it's not a source map comment so the tool was _correctly_ removing it

[04:21:42.0136] <Nic>
i.e. in
```js
let modules = {
  0: () => {
    console.log("hi from mod a");
    // #sourceMappingURL=./a.js.map
  },
  1: () => {
    console.log("hi from mod b");
    /* #sourceMappingURL=./b.js.map */
  }
}
```

there are no source map comments

[04:22:47.0950] <jkup>
You are saying that bundlers should remove sourceMappingUrl comments from individual files as it bundles them together?

[04:24:37.0866] <Nic>
They don't need to remove them, because "adding some code after the comment" already has the effect of making it not a source map comment

[04:24:49.0435] <Nic>
Bundlers removing them is equivalent to removing `/* hello! */`

[04:24:52.0465] <Nic>
It's not wrong

[04:24:59.0857] <Nic>
It's just useless, other than to save code size

[04:25:59.0630] <Nic>
Do you want me to reply to that tweet?

[04:26:26.0299] <jkup>
Sorry yeah if you don't mind. I'm not following but also distracted in this community event.

[04:38:41.0111] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
V8 does not support magic comments in multi line comments.

[04:40:39.0998] <Nic>
Oh well, that's good to know and probably means that nobody relies on it :)

[04:42:20.0549] <Nic>
I now remember that initially my PR only had `//`, and then _for some reason_ I updated the algorithm to include `/*`. I'd need to check in the meeting notes if we captured why

[04:44:47.0387] <jkup>
yeah i also cannot remember 

[04:46:23.0003] <Nic>
It seems like Firefox supports both: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/frontend/TokenStream.cpp#1961-1962

[04:46:42.0749] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
Just wanted to post the same link

[04:46:56.0293] <Nic>
But the comment says that the multiline form is `/* //# sourceMappingURL=... */` and not /*# sourceMappingURL=... */ ðŸ¤”

[04:47:11.0068] <Nic>

[04:47:46.0973] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
You'd probably have to check the test cases or trace the scanner code to figure out exactly what it supports

[04:48:34.0405] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
One more signal, I don't know of any bugs filed against DevTools where someone required support for `/* #sourceMappingURL=...*/`

[04:48:50.0151] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
 * One more signal, I don't know of any bugs filed against Chrome DevTools where someone required support for `/* #sourceMappingURL=...*/`

[04:52:25.0184] <Nic>
Firefox's scanner: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/frontend/TokenStream.cpp#3172

It seems like it parses `/*# sourceMappingURL=... */`

[04:54:08.0808] <Nic>
For many tools it's easier to support multine comments, because it means that you need just a single regexp for both CSS and JS

[04:57:26.0179] <Nic>
Babel supports both btw

[04:57:38.0231] <Nic>
 * Babel supports both btw, when looking for a pre-existing source map

[04:59:40.0304] <Nic>
It seems like DuckDuckGo's build system uses multi-line comments, at least for `sourceURL`: https://github.com/duckduckgo/content-scope-scripts/blob/8da65a0fdf4fc9e61f38961a453975c238e32b53/scripts/utils/build.js#L102
