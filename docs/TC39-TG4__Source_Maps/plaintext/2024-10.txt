i can work on getting the tests merged into WebKit

[14:30:25.0530] <Devin Rousso>
are there any features WebKit is missing that i should also implement?

A scopes implementation would be great eventually, for when we'll need the "two implementations" requirement!

Or â€” check which tests in the test suite are failing ðŸ˜‰

Do we have a table somewhere to track which proposals are at which stage? I can't find anything in the repo. The proposal docs themselves also don't contain which stage they are at.

We donâ€™t. This is something we havenâ€™t been great about. I need to do some work on my slides today, I can add a table to our readme and maybe label the specific proposal docs as well

Just stumbled over a major issue with the scopes proposal: https://github.com/tc39/source-map/issues/133. We need to address this sooner rather than later.
