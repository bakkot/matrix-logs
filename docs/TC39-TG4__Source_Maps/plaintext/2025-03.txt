Holger Benl: I uploaded the terser prototype here: https://github.com/szuend/terser/tree/scopes. Keep in mind that this is rather nasty, just to get some scopes out of terser :) See `rebuild-bench.sh` on how to invoke terser so scopes information is included.

It seems like to make auto linking to ecma426 work in proposals we need to setup something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tc39/ecma262-biblio

I can try doing it next week, but I'd be happy if somebody beats me to it :)

Simon Zünd and anyone who's interested: I've hacked terser to output scope mapping information for inlined functions: https://github.com/hbenl/terser/tree/scopes. It's still incomplete and buggy:
- it doesn't support multiple input files
- a variable that was removed gets its original name as value (it should be unavailable)
- the name of an inlined function gets its function expression as value (it should be unavailable)
- I've only tested with a few small examples so far, I expect it to still lose scope mapping information for some transformations

Hi folks, so there’s a TG4 meeting coming up later today. Just a heads up that due to DST I think it will be one hour earlier than usual for people in Europe

Small announcement, we (Chrome DevTools) published the DevTools implementation for "scopes" encoding/decoding as a standalone library. You can find it here: https://jsr.io/@chrome-devtools/source-map-scopes-codec

Hi folks just a reminder that the scopes meeting is scheduled to start in a few minutes

I've added the notes for that meeting in the usual google docs now

Where is the usual Google doc?
