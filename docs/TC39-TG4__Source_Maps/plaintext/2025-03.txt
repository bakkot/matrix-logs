Holger Benl: I uploaded the terser prototype here: https://github.com/szuend/terser/tree/scopes. Keep in mind that this is rather nasty, just to get some scopes out of terser :) See `rebuild-bench.sh` on how to invoke terser so scopes information is included.

It seems like to make auto linking to ecma426 work in proposals we need to setup something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tc39/ecma262-biblio

I can try doing it next week, but I'd be happy if somebody beats me to it :)
