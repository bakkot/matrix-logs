I'm in the process of writing a simple test for the "Debug ID" proposal. The question is what to do for index source maps in general for "debug IDs". Thinking about it for a minute, I think the correct thing to do would be to add a "debugId" field also to the root of an index source map, and the decoding ignores "debugIds" of the section source maps. This way, the sections can have different "debugId"s that match with their section `"file"`. While the "root debugId" of an index source map matches with the "root file" field. Thoughts?

Actually, this would pretty much match what we do with the `"file"` field: The "root file" field is the one used for the source map record. And section `"file"` fields are ignored.

I put up a PR for the tests, might be easier to discuss with concrete examples: https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests/pull/36

I just noticed the source maps spec link is missing from the TC39 website.  any volunteers to submit a PR?  ðŸ™‚ 

[09:53:46.0379] <jkup>
I'm happy to, should it go on the bottom section under "Standards"?

[09:54:38.0464] <Chris de Almeida>
yes, also in the specs menu at the top

[09:55:10.0389] <Chris de Almeida>
(maybe elsewhere (?)) -- I did not do an exhaustive check for where specs get listed on the site. I only noticed it missing from the top nav
