Hey folks, I started to put together some small but concrete examples the scopes proposal should be able to handle: https://szuend.github.io/scope-proposal-examples/. It's just a bunch of static files. The idea is two-fold:
1) I think we should be very explicit in what kind of code transformations we support, and which are out of scope (pun intended xD, but e.g. outlining comes to mind)
2) I'm planning to "hand-encode" the scopes section for these examples based on the current proposal. Then I can use the examples to verify the DevTools prototype (e.g. setting breakpoints in a bunch of places and verify the stack trace, scope view, expression evaluation, etc.)

Simon ZÃ¼nd: So excited to check this out! Sorry I haven't had a chance to look yet!
