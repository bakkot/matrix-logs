Typo? This is the TG4 room, not the TG3 one

ugh

[12:31:05.0154] <Chris de Almeida>
not my day today apparently 🙂

Hey folks, I started to put together some small but concrete examples the scopes proposal should be able to handle: https://szuend.github.io/scope-proposal-examples/. It's just a bunch of static files. The idea is two-fold:
1) I think we should be very explicit in what kind of code transformations we support, and which are out of scope (pun intended xD, but e.g. outlining comes to mind)
2) I'm planning to "hand-encode" the scopes section for these examples based on the current proposal. Then I can use the examples to verify the DevTools prototype (e.g. setting breakpoints in a bunch of places and verify the stack trace, scope view, expression evaluation, etc.)

Simon Zünd: So excited to check this out! Sorry I haven't had a chance to look yet!

[13:19:13.0107] <littledan>
I'm not sure if I'll be able to attend the source maps meeting this coming Wednesday, because I'll be at NodeConf EU

[13:19:28.0781] <littledan>
Will anyone else be available to run the meeting?

[13:28:41.0365] <jkup>
Yep!

Ah, sorry to do this. Something has come up for me on Wednesday and I can no longer attend the call. Is anyone here available to run it?

[03:42:08.0566] <rbuckton>
I will not be able to make the call on Wednesday either. 

[06:14:12.0425] <littledan>
Tobias wrote me "LGTM" in response to https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/pull/59

hey folks -- who will be handing the TG4 report at plenary and how much time do you need?


2023-11-18
[11:59:45.0171] <Nic>
I will do it, I think 15 minutes is good

[07:38:47.0711] <Nic>
Next week there is the TC39 TG1 meeting. Are we still meeting for TG4?

[10:17:07.0083] <littledan>
Let’s cancel 


2023-11-24
[06:45:56.0549] <Nic>
Hey, I prepared two slides decks for this TC39 meeting:
- TG4 updates https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18DtsUGrXPOY1Hp6aLqGlaOGYColCUzBa7Y5BRzGBYN4/edit
- New process https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13sq6qcfxf3NYKghudqBG8NSJU3b5SeXO9ay-tywfDcM/edit

Feedback is welcome!

Simon Zünd: I was trying to set up a test harness for the source maps tests, starting from testing the stack trace output of a simple error thrown. I was using "puppeteer" and before that "chrome-remote-interface", they're both clients for chrome devtools protocol, in both cases I was not able to get the original file names, it looks like the events I'm listening to are fired before the source maps are applied (e.g. Runtime.exceptionThrown)? Do you have some recommendation on what to use for the test harness, which events or maybe a completely different approach? Thanks! 

[07:30:23.0140] <Simon Zünd>
We don't apply source maps on the CDP level. At the most you get the "sourceMappingUrl" in the "Debugger#scriptParsed" event.

[07:30:38.0297] <Simon Zünd>
Source mapping happens in the DevTools frontend itself.

[07:31:55.0357] <Simon Zünd>
e.g. for the stack trace when the debugger pauses, we resolve the names using this function: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end/models/source_map_scopes/NamesResolver.ts;l=707;drc=d618a37b054370dc425983d3044bef7694d8a0e5

[07:43:38.0165] <abelkius>
Thanks, in this case I think we would need to have tests that dev tools and other consumers would be able to run internally rather then hooking into the events from CDP. I'll still give it a think, if you have any suggestions or ideas feel free to share.

Do you have any thoughts on how to attach tests onto the front of this?

[00:11:43.0644] <Simon Zünd>
Not sure what you mean exactly with "onto the front". But for the consumer side I have 2 ideas:
1) For JS-to-JS transformations we could debug the unminified and the minified code + source maps and check that stack traces/expressions are the same
2) We could annotate some source files with expectations. E.g if you pause here this is what we expect the stack trace to be. And this expression should evaluate to this value etc.
I'm unsure how far we wanna push in building a generic harness here for running different implementations (if at all).

> I'm unsure how far we wanna push in building a generic harness here for running different implementations (if at all).

I would expect the shared test suite to just include declarative tests, with a description on how to interpret them (similarly to https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/INTERPRETING.md). Then, there would be a per-implementation harness that knows how to run the tests in specific projects

[02:23:53.0529] <Simon Zünd>
That would be my intuition as well, at least for the consumer side.

cool, I'll take a look, thanks!
