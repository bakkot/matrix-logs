Unfortunately, I will be a couple hours late to the meeting at Google Munich. My flight was cancelled, and my new flight will arrive at 11 AM. See you at lunchtime!

Today was just *so* good. I'm feeling so excited to get to work on source maps. Thanks to everyone for hosting and attending and taking notes and sharing ideas!

Folks, unfortunately, I will not present anything on Thursday because I am leaving Google soon. Chrome DevTools is still very much interesting in pushing source maps forward, I believe Simon Zuend will take it from here.

Here are the slides I presented at the TC39 plenary giving an update for our group! In the future, I will make sure to get my slides done earlier so I can get feedback from the group before presenting. Just had a very busy week!
