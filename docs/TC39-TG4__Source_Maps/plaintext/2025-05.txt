one minor fix i just discovered ðŸ™‚ <https://github.com/tc39/source-map-tests/pull/31> (*fix incorrect baseFile for sourcesContentNotStringOrNull*)

Do we already have test suites for magic comment extraction?

The tests we have so far don't test for that, no. But it could make sense to add some, possibly in a different part of the test suite

I was talking with a colleague that is trying to solve (in a proprietary product, I believe) the problem of "given a stack trace, how do I tell what source map version to use for the files linked in it"

[09:54:03.0578] <Nic>
And I wonder whether with debug IDs `error.stack` could become something like
```
Error!
  at /file1.js (line:col) [debug id]
  at /file2.js (line:col) [debug id]
```

[09:54:14.0734] <Nic>
Even though I know that the contents of `error.stack` are not defined anywhere

Cool idea! It would definitely be useful, even if unofficial.

[04:28:10.0436] <Luca Forstner>
Like... obv drawbacks are that it would potentially break existing stack trace parsers and that's it maybe a bit loud for pure userland.
