Devin Rousso shared with me,
FYI the majority of tests in WebKit for sourcemap stuff are in https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/tree/main/LayoutTests/inspector/formatting

[00:28:28.0611] <littledan>
We can incorporate this into shared tests!

I don't think I noticed `x_google_lineCount` until today. Is that used? https://github.com/tc39/source-map-spec/blob/main/source-map.bs#L251

Hi Ryan Day !

I started working on polyfills for debug IDs: https://github.com/lforst/tc39-debug-id-proposal-polyfill

Right now this only entails Rollup and Vite. I'd also like to have some for Webpack and Esbuild. Shouldn't be too hard to do. The implementation is based on our experiments for the [Sentry Bundler Plugins](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript-bundler-plugins).

Is this what I should be reviewing for the proposal itself? https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/blob/main/proposals/debug-id.md

[05:30:55.0813] <littledan>
Or do you have anything further ?
