In the current sourcemap spec, for the specific case of an inline sourcemap (embedded in the executable JS via Base64 for example), is there a way to reference the current file without knowing it's name? 

[00:02:09.0196] <Rob Palmer>
Specifically I wonder if "file" or "sources" can use the value "."

[00:07:00.0183] <Nic>
No. The meaning of the "file" field is currently left up to whoever is using the source map.
 
If I were to implement it "." wouldn't work, because I would resolve it as `new URL(".", generatedFile)` which would strip the last segment from the generated file URL. However, `new URL("", generatedFile)` returns generatedFile, so maybe "" works. But it's unspecified.

[00:08:29.0931] <Nic>
For sources that might actually work, because we define URL resolution for them

[00:08:51.0975] <Rob Palmer>
The spec seems to indicate URLs are permitted for both fields. 

[00:09:07.0038] <Rob Palmer>
Ah

[00:09:10.0545] <Rob Palmer>
You are right

[00:10:12.0045] <Rob Palmer>
Do you think we could enhance the spec to formalise the empty string as a self-reference? 

[00:10:31.0548] <Rob Palmer>
(at least for the case of an inline sourcemap) 

[00:12:06.0049] <Nic>
I need to double check for the current spec for sources actually implies that "" works, and if it does we can just add a note

[00:12:29.0623] <Rob Palmer>
That would be excellent! 

[00:12:36.0273] <Nic>
For file, it might be more difficult because I fear that the reason it's currently unspecified is that we don't know how tools use it, or worse that they disagree

[00:15:47.0973] <Rob Palmer>
If it is not possible to enhance/strengthen "file", my next question will be: what is the smallest change we can make to the spec to permit the inline use-case to reference itself for both field? (with some kind of constant rather than needing to vary based on knowledge of the filename) 

[00:17:30.0975] <Rob Palmer>
The specific use-case is type-stripping runtimes that execute *.ts files directly, but need to provide an inline comment to inform debuggers that there has been no change of filename, to appease the debugger. 

[00:18:44.0680] <Rob Palmer>
Whilst this can be achieved by injecting the filename, this is wasteful and turns what could be an easily understandable constant into a mysterious ever-changing Base64 that varies from file to file.
