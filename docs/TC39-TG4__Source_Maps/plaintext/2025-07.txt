When y'all reference a WHATWG document, is it down to the clause or is it the whole document? What would you do if you could normatively reference it all willy-nilly?

Looks like we reference individual clauses, eg https://tc39.es/ecma426/#sec-FetchSourceMap

Hypothetically, could you… not?

[10:08:41.0134] <Nic>
I'm not sure I understand the question. What does it mean to reference a document normatively, but not use individual sections?

[10:09:04.0636] <Nic>
The references in https://tc39.es/ecma426/#sec-bibliography is what would become normative if they could

Hi folks, just a reminder that the TG4 meeting for July starts in about 10m

[15:33:08.0096] <Justin Ridgewell>
asumu: I'd like to make a couple of changes to the source map tests repo to make it easier to consume

[15:33:30.0535] <Justin Ridgewell>
Mainly getting it packaged into an npm module that I can import

[15:34:30.0419] <Justin Ridgewell>
With the inputs as `.map` and the outputs being Decoded Source Map Records

Justin Ridgewell: sure, would be happy to help integrate changes. I'd just like to make sure there's a way to keep it working with test suites in mozilla/source-map and WebKit.

Having an npm module might work well for the mozilla/source-map integration too.

[11:25:51.0897] <Justin Ridgewell>
I think we might be able to integrate the tests similar to Web Platform Tests

[11:26:31.0944] <Justin Ridgewell>
So we wouldn’t maintain patches, the browser team would just update their dep on our tests

fwiw, node.js uses the test suite like how wpt is been tested in node.js: https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/main/test/test426

[14:06:05.0879] <Justin Ridgewell>
Yah, that's essentially what I'm about to do with a git submodule because there's not a npm package

[14:06:36.0571] <Justin Ridgewell>
It'd be a little nicer if I could just `import {tests} from 'source-map-tests' with { type: 'json' }`

[14:07:52.0319] <Justin Ridgewell>
The biggest change would be making this useful to my codec package, which only understands `mappings` (and soon `scopes`) field and doesn't do anything with the larger map

[14:08:49.0585] <Justin Ridgewell>
I want to have a golden Decoded Source Map Record with decoded `mappings`/`ranges`/`originalScope` fields set appropriately

[14:09:18.0091] <Justin Ridgewell>
That'd allow me to test both decoding into the spec Record structure, and encoding from the Record into the string

[14:10:34.0685] <Justin Ridgewell>
I can build a small adapter library that converts the spec Record to/from my decoded format, and automate tests based on the shared golden files
