I'm reading the rules on how to write standards that ECMA has

ECMA? That's an ISO/IEC document

[06:50:37.0223] <Nic>
Well, that's what is recommended to follow from the documents in the Ecma drive

[06:54:10.0950] <Richard Gibson>
huh, interesting

[08:55:41.0880] <Nic>
This came out quite nice

[08:55:43.0466] <Nic>
Using some magic

[08:56:07.0856] <Nic>
I'll submit a PR with instructions on how to do it

Nic: if you use ecmarkdown (even if you don't use specific algo elements) I can automatically produce a PDF that fully complies with TOOLS-11 & TOOLS-17

Unfortunately we use bikeshed so that doesn't work for us

[11:58:58.0772] <Nic>
(or I could look into an automatic converter between bikeshed and ecmarkup)

I also can produce a compliant PDF from html

[09:59:02.0921] <Aki>
I did 402 & 262 this year, I'm going to work on 424 next.

[11:58:28.0182] <littledan>
424 being CycloneDX?

[11:58:36.0273] <littledan>
and probably source maps is 425?

Simon and Asumu have very similar profile pictures on GitHub, this is very confusing in reviews :P
