Good morning folks, we have a TG4 monthly meeting today for anyone interested: https://bloomberg.zoom.us/j/97901112561?pwd=TlNyeW8ycGlaMk9BTmUxMHZrcE11dz09

I'm reading the rules on how to write standards that ECMA has

> <@nribaudo:igalia.com> I'm reading the rules on how to write standards that ECMA has

ECMA? That's an ISO/IEC document

[06:50:37.0223] <Nic>
Well, that's what is recommended to follow from the documents in the Ecma drive

[06:54:10.0950] <Richard Gibson>
huh, interesting

[08:55:41.0880] <Nic>
This came out quite nice

[08:55:43.0466] <Nic>
Using some magic

[08:56:07.0856] <Nic>
I'll submit a PR with instructions on how to do it

Nic: if you use ecmarkdown (even if you don't use specific algo elements) I can automatically produce a PDF that fully complies with TOOLS-11 & TOOLS-17

[11:58:25.0890] <Nic>
Unfortunately we use bikeshed so that doesn't work for us

[11:58:58.0772] <Nic>
(or I could look into an automatic converter between bikeshed and ecmarkup)


2024-09-17
[09:58:13.0105] <Aki>
I also can produce a compliant PDF from html

[09:59:02.0921] <Aki>
I did 402 & 262 this year, I'm going to work on 424 next.

[11:58:28.0182] <littledan>
424 being CycloneDX?

[11:58:36.0273] <littledan>
and probably source maps is 425?

Simon and Asumu have very similar profile pictures on GitHub, this is very confusing in reviews :P

[03:42:28.0624] <jkup>
hahah I was literally just about to complain about that

[03:42:31.0627] <jkup>
little yellow blobs

[03:46:01.0830] <jkup>
I'm honestly happy to close https://github.com/tc39/source-map/pull/96 if no one is interested, but would love to close it or merge it before plenary!

[05:13:47.0262] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
I uploaded a profile pic xD

[09:19:57.0548] <jkup>
Simon ZÃ¼nd: Hello! Two things:

1. There are 2 PRs that I think are maybe good to merge on the repo right now? Did you want a chance to review them again, or should I just merge them in?
2. For the Scopes PR, how is that going? I was sort of maybe hoping we could have at least an early version of the PR up sometime soon for when we add ourselves to the plenary agenda (in case people click through) but no pressure!

Something I'm curious about. Do we care at all about "source map" vs. "Source Map" vs. "sourcemap" vs. "source-map"? Should we specify in the spec? 

[02:50:02.0899] <Nic>
We should be consistent within the spec, but eventually that's probably our of our control

[02:51:19.0417] <Nic>
Like, if we go with "source map" (my preference) but then I'm writing a title with all words capitalized, I'd write "Source Map", and if it's a filename I'd write "source-map"

[02:52:03.0893] <littledan>
also consider "source maps" (I avoided using the plural in the charter and such, at Chris de Almeida - ðŸŒ´ Returning 09-23 's suggestion, but somehow when I think/talk about the topic I always end up wanting to use the plural, idk why)

[02:52:29.0449] <littledan>
(I'm fine with sticking with the current convention of singular btw, just mentioning)

[02:52:42.0439] <littledan>
I'm a partisan of two words, in any case

[02:52:50.0549] <littledan>
 * I'm a partisan of two space-separated words, in any case

[02:52:51.0288] <jkup>
hmm yeah the one I struggle with most is the title case

## Source Maps

vs.

## Source maps

[02:53:35.0494] <littledan>
I guess that's easy to answer when it's the title of the whole article, but harder when it's just talking about A Thing

[03:10:45.0452] <littledan>
so far what I've been doing about the "A Thing" case is, entirely lowercase. nbd! (not sure if this is the right answer)

[03:33:19.0914] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
FWIW in the DevTools UI we are moving towards "Title case" for all the things. So we'd spell it "Source map" at the beginning of a sentence or heading and "source map" in a sentence.

[03:36:36.0815] <Simon ZÃ¼nd>
Which ones in particular? The "mappings" one has landed and for the "names" one I'm addressing comments now and refining it a bit.

For the scopes PR I didn't start anything yet, as I want to mirror a bit what Nic is doing for mappings and decoding but I'm hoping to get started on that on Monday :)

(I was on vacation last week and this week so didn't make progress on anything)

[05:48:34.0187] <jkup>
Hey! Hope vacation was great! I was curious about https://github.com/tc39/source-map/pull/114 and curious if we were hoping to land https://github.com/tc39/source-map/pull/75 before plenary!
