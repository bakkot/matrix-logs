Holger Benl: I'm taking a look at your branch there and I'm wondering what do you consider it mostly hack there. Is it because it is doing an additional pass on each original and another on generated AST to get scopes info, or is there anything else?

I'm wondering here if it's possible to embed original scopes while traversing for parsing and generated scopes when traversing for optimizing/printing, but I particularly like that it's a separated pass.
