I would like to present a new proposal at this week's call, for which I'm looking for approval to present to TG1 at the upcoming meeting:

https://github.com/eemeli/proposal-intl-keep-trailing-zeros

The very short description of the proposal is to make it so that this happens:

    const nf = new Intl.NumberFormat("en");
    nf.format("1.0") === "1.0";

    const pr = new Intl.PluralRules("en");
    pr.select("1.0") === "other";

This is a follow-up to discussions at the last tc39-numerics call.

I would also welcome co-champions for the proposal.
