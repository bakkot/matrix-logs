> <@sffc:mozilla.org> I added the ECMAScript label to the issue. They will triage it soon

sffc: That CLDR bug (https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-16243) is still not triaged yet. Expected?

I think they haven't had much time to triage things over the holidays, but I can put the ticket on the agenda

That'd be great, thanks Shane!
