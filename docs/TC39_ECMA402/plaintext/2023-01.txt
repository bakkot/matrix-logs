> <@sffc:mozilla.org> I added the ECMAScript label to the issue. They will triage it soon

sffc: That CLDR bug (https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-16243) is still not triaged yet. Expected?

I think they haven't had much time to triage things over the holidays, but I can put the ticket on the agenda

[20:22:51.0619] <justingrant>
That'd be great, thanks Shane!

They accepted the ticket for CLDR 43

Also: Richard Gibson filed a few more issues against NFv3. I want to put it up for Stage 4 at TC39 this month, and the last TG2 meeting before then is tomorrow, so if anyone has any lingering NFv3 issues, please file them today so we can discuss them

Hey dminor or anyone else who knows: which versions of Firefox are supporting NFv3? I checked today and FF 108 does not seem to support it at all, but I definitely recall seeing an FF version that supported it recently.
