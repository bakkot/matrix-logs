How did we end up in a situation where `islamic-rgsa` is exposed to the Web? AFAICT, the provenance is LDML is that Oracle requested it and ICU4C says it's not implementable and just delegates the internal to `islamic`.

Also, how did we end up with in a situation where `islamic` is exposed to the Web? AFAICT, it's not well defined what location on Earth is used for simulating the observation. ICU4X uses Cairo. ICU4C isn't clear about what location it uses, but it appears it is using _a_ location.
