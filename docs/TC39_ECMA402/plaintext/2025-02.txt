How did we end up in a situation where `islamic-rgsa` is exposed to the Web? AFAICT, the provenance is LDML is that Oracle requested it and ICU4C says it's not implementable and just delegates the internal to `islamic`.

Also, how did we end up with in a situation where `islamic` is exposed to the Web? AFAICT, it's not well defined what location on Earth is used for simulating the observation. ICU4X uses Cairo. ICU4C isn't clear about what location it uses, but it appears it is using _a_ location.

Can we consider a normative change to get stop exposing `islamic-rgsa`, given it's not implementable? I'd say that `islamic` sounds pretty questionable without providing an API to specify the location at which the observation is being made.

Well, looking at the list of calendar preferences, I don't see a region that prefers `islamic` ahead of at least one other non-gregorian calendar, so maybe this is something that could be proposed
