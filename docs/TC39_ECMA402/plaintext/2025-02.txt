How did we end up in a situation where `islamic-rgsa` is exposed to the Web? AFAICT, the provenance is LDML is that Oracle requested it and ICU4C says it's not implementable and just delegates the internal to `islamic`.

[09:50:32.0553] <hsivonen>
Also, how did we end up with in a situation where `islamic` is exposed to the Web? AFAICT, it's not well defined what location on Earth is used for simulating the observation. ICU4X uses Cairo. ICU4C isn't clear about what location it uses, but it appears it is using _a_ location.

Can we consider a normative change to get stop exposing `islamic-rgsa`, given it's not implementable? I'd say that `islamic` sounds pretty questionable without providing an API to specify the location at which the observation is being made.

Well, looking at the list of calendar preferences, I don't see a region that prefers `islamic` ahead of at least one other non-gregorian calendar, so maybe this is something that could be proposed
https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/1be37933f617c6eb312675c04244a17f3c28906b/common/supplemental/supplementalData.xml#L4867

[09:12:02.0014] <sffc>
Same with `islamic-rgsa`

[09:12:45.0853] <sffc>
Actually also `islamic-tbla`

[09:13:21.0405] <dminor>
Interesting, thank you for having a look.

[09:14:30.0441] <sffc>
It looks like in regions that use a Hijri calendar, their preferred one is either Umm-al-qura, Civil, or Persian (solar Hijri)

[09:16:31.0497] <sffc>
Only possible exception is in Egypt and Israel which have "Coptic" and "Hebrew" ahead of Hijri, but have "Islamic" as their first choice Hijri

[09:18:22.0643] <sffc>
It's possible that if PS were listed separately from IL, it would have `islamic` as the first choice

[09:20:31.0151] <sffc>
So we might want to be careful here to avoid putting SA's calendar in 402 but not PS's calendar if that hypothesis is true

[09:23:17.0993] <dminor>
But is the islamic calendar really well defined without specifying an observation location?

[09:24:06.0860] <dminor>
Would PS want Cairo, for instance?

[09:26:09.0361] <sffc>
Cairo might not be a bad choice since it is geographically near Jerusalem, certainly closer than other reasonable choices like Mecca or Baghdad or something. But my sense is that this needs more research

[09:29:15.0194] <dminor>
I would agree with that assessment
