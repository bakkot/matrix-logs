benallen: looks like SpiderMonkey is alphabetic while Graal and JSC and V8 are... something else
```
$ eshost -se 'Reflect.construct(globalThis.Intl?.PluralRules || class {}, ["ar"]).resolvedOptions?.().pluralCategories'
#### GraalJS, JavaScriptCore, V8
few,many,one,two,zero,other

#### SpiderMonkey
few,many,one,other,two,zero
```

I'm guessing "something else" is a "the arbitrary order of a hard-coded list in the spec"?

[01:33:12.0873] <Richard Gibson>
no, the [spec](https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-intl.pluralrules.prototype.resolvedoptions) just says "_a List of Strings containing all possible results of PluralRuleSelect for the selected locale_" (until [PR 918](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/918) gets TG1 approval and nails it down to precisely such a hard-coded list)

can someone let me in to the 402 mtg?

[10:05:50.0591] <eemeli>
We're working on it.

29:00 :)

[08:18:16.0568] <ptomato>
is that a typo, or intentionally meaning "05:00 the next morning"?

[08:19:35.0927] <Michael Ficarra>
the latter

[15:36:35.0155] <rkirsling>
yup, totally intentional

[15:37:38.0203] <rkirsling>
I think that's the longest one I've seen though

[16:40:06.0341] <Michael Ficarra>
off topic, but I really wish I could've experienced a Shibuya Halloween before they shut that down

[16:57:57.0220] <rkirsling>
I dunno man, that place is already pretty intense on the average evening

Hmm if you work the graveyard shift and work from 11pm to 7am, do you say you work from -01:00 to 07:00 or from 23:00 to 31:00?

[17:53:07.0480] <rkirsling>
heh, definitely haven't seen a negative one

[17:53:30.0415] <rkirsling>
also haven't heard these used in speech

[17:54:08.0009] <rkirsling>
 * also haven't heard these used in speech (except maybe if a restaurant were reading off its hours aloud)

basically the above image raises the question of when you'd call it quits and why

[17:57:01.0874] <rkirsling>
I feel like 29 is okay because (1) it still starts with a 2 and (2) 5:00am is still easy to view as belonging to the previous night

[17:58:08.0281] <rkirsling>
those two factors are actually an interesting coincidence -- viewing 6am as the beginning of the day is natural and viewing 30:00 as "too far because of the 3" is also natural

[18:03:37.0498] <rkirsling>
but I think a restaurant/bar open 'til 5am is still far more likely to write ...〜翌5時 ("next (day) 5 o'clock")

[18:04:44.0889] <rkirsling>
oh whoa TIL. it actually is referred to as a 30-hour clock: https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/30時間制

[18:04:52.0891] <rkirsling>
there's no English article for this, it seems
