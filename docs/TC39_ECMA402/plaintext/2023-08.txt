Is anyone aware of any language tags that would return "bottom-to-top" when passed to icu4c's `uloc_getLineOrientation()` function?

[11:31:18.0020] <ramsey>
For example, I've tried `pgl-Ogam` (Primitive Irish, Ogham script), but that returns "top-to-bottom" (which maybe is wrong?)

Also, I know this is a channel for ECMA-402, but I was looking into the Intl Locale Info Proposal, which has a `getTextInfo()` method that includes (character) `direction`, and I was wondering why "line direction" was left out, but maybe it's because there are no language tags that would produce "bottom-to-top" in ICU

Wow, this is a pretty advanced question. I wonder if people over on the Unicode Slack would have that background, about what's in CLDR

[11:36:11.0758] <ramsey>
I wasn't aware of the Unicode Slack. I had gone looking for some chat channel for them on IRC or Matrix. Do you have a link?

See some previous discussion on this topic here: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale-info/issues/59

"textInfo.direction is a very simplified model of reality"

sffc: Thanks!

Does there exist stated design rationale for why `Intl.Collator` (which, unlike many other APIs, doesn't format anything) falls back to the host locale instead of falling back to `und`? Considering that the root collation is more likely to be valid for a language that isn't explicitly listed in CLDR than a non-root host-language collation, the specified behavior seems unfortunate. Moreover, it's bad that the distinction isn't visible in the typical CI locale of en-US.

Everything in Intl falls back to the host locale… I think that’s the extent of the rationale.

[05:37:56.0327] <littledan>
If we wanted to work on Intl.Collator, we should probably address the thing where the design forces a bunch of recalculation of the collation key to do any sorting…
