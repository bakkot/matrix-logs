Is anyone aware of any language tags that would return "bottom-to-top" when passed to icu4c's `uloc_getLineOrientation()` function?

For example, I've tried `pgl-Ogam` (Primitive Irish, Ogham script), but that returns "top-to-bottom" (which maybe is wrong?)

Also, I know this is a channel for ECMA-402, but I was looking into the Intl Locale Info Proposal, which has a `getTextInfo()` method that includes (character) `direction`, and I was wondering why "line direction" was left out, but maybe it's because there are no language tags that would produce "bottom-to-top" in ICU

Wow, this is a pretty advanced question. I wonder if people over on the Unicode Slack would have that background, about what's in CLDR

I wasn't aware of the Unicode Slack. I had gone looking for some chat channel for them on IRC or Matrix. Do you have a link?
