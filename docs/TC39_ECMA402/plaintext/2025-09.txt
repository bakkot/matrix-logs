I don't suppose someone could merge https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/1011 ? I'm antsy to cognitively unload some open PRs 

[06:45:51.0450] <ryzokuken>
thanks for the reminder Aki I'll review it and merge it ASAP

I'm sure we discussed this as part of DurationFormat design planning, but is it expected behavior that the following options using `digital` style will display hours too, even if the duration only has minutes and seconds?

```js
{ style: 'digital', minutesDisplay: 'always', secondsDisplay: 'always' }
```

With the default options I would expect to see hours (because otherwise the output would be ambiguous between mins/secs and hours/mins) but if the caller explicitly asks for mins/secs it was surprising that it didn't yield only mins/secs in the output.

Yeah there's ambiguity between hh:mm and mm:ss in many locales, but both are valid formats 

[14:03:10.0655] <justingrant>
So is it a bug if an implementation is given the options above but the output is h:mm:ss instead of mm:ss?

I read these [TG2 meeting notes](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/blob/main/meetings/notes-2022-09-01.md#the-output-of-minutes--seconds-and-hoursminutes-in-digital-format-could-be-the-same-54) which conculded that the default would be h:mm:ss, but I assumed that this default could be overridden. Was this assumption incorrect?

We spent a lot of time on this when writing the spec; what does the spec say to do?
