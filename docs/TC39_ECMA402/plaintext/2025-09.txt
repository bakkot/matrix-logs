I don't suppose someone could merge https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/1011 ? I'm antsy to cognitively unload some open PRs

I'm sure we discussed this as part of DurationFormat design planning, but is it expected behavior that the following options using `digital` style will display hours too, even if the duration only has minutes and seconds?

```js
{ style: 'digital', minutesDisplay: 'always', secondsDisplay: 'always' }
```

With the default options I would expect to see hours (because otherwise the output would be ambiguous between mins/secs and hours/mins) but if the caller explicitly asks for mins/secs it was surprising that it didn't yield only mins/secs in the output.
