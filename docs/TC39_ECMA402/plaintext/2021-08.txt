Richard Gibson: was going through the segmenter spec today, was just curious why the internal slot is called `SegmenterGranularity` and not just `Granularity`...

> <@usharma:igalia.com> Richard Gibson: was going through the segmenter spec today, was just curious why the internal slot is called `SegmenterGranularity` and not just `Granularity`...

ryzokuken: if I remember correctly, it's because I liked the searchability of that prefixing pattern that was already used with Segment Iterator objects, derived from the similar pattern in ECMA-262 (that was itself ultimately replaced with CreateIteratorFromClosure by https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/commit/5f4be6e41ce9f6e1997f5e1e42af253145c6c885 )

nope, I'm wrong... it was there from the beginning: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter/commit/7284bfa9a8a39244735aed65f5397b9e23f0fee0#diff-181371b08d71216599b0acccbaabd03c306da6de142ea6275c2135810999805aR44

[08:02:10.0358] <ryzokuken>
it just sounds a wee bit redundant, but I don't feel too strongly about it anyway... was just curious.

Richard Gibson: Thank you for your JSFiddle!  Very useful

Hey folks, I’m closing in on finishing a fleshing-out of the MDN content for `Intl.Segmenter`: https://github.com/meyerweb/content/tree/intl-segmenter/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/intl/segmenter
What I really could use (besides feedback on whatever I’ve gotten wrong!) is code examples of:

* How using different values for `localeMatcher` would yield different results for locale when constructing an `Intl.Segmenter`.  The expected results can be browser-specific, as I’ll note that in the example text.
* A compact (if possible) example of using `.next()` for the `Segments[@@iterator]()` page; two or three examples would be even better.

I know it’s almost (or already, depending on your time zone) the weekend, but I thought I’d re-up my previous request for code samples.  These are just base examples, nothing fancy or particularly clever needed.  URLs to existing examples (other than https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter/blob/master/README.md; I already mined that document out) are most welcome, as is any assistance on this.  Thanks!

Eric Meyer: how should we give feedback? I can look at https://github.com/mdn/content/compare/main...meyerweb:intl-segmenter , but cannot leave comments on a non-PR compare view

[14:14:39.0044] <Eric Meyer>
Oh, good point.  I made it a draft pull request so comments and contributions should be easier now.

ryzokuken: the work looks great! I need to review the specs but otherwise I have no concerns

[08:19:06.0072] <ryzokuken>
leobalter: sounds awesome, let me know if I can help you review in any way!

[11:21:33.0316] <Eric Meyer>
Thanks to suggestions from Richard Gibson , the Segmenter pages are in better shape.  I do still need:
* An example of different values of the option `localeMatcher` yielding different results for the locale when constructing an `Intl.Segmenter`.
* A compact (if possible) example of using `.next()`. This is for the `Segments[@@iterator]()` page, which is still unwritten. Two or three examples would be even better, but I’ll take what I can get.
