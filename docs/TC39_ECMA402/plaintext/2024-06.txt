Hello TG2 friends!  Following up from May's TG2 meeting, here's the final state of the PR to tighten the spec around which time zone IDs are primary vs. non-primary: https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/877

As discussed in May, this PR was approved with two conditions:
* Editors needed to approve the final PR, which Richard Gibson did last week
* Needed to resolve the question of legacy IDs like EST5EDT, which was resolved upstream in IANA by deprecating these legacy IDs so this text was removed from the PR.

So I think the conditions are satisfied, and I'm planning to present this in Helsinki as a needs-consensus PR. 

If you have concerns about this PR, please let me know ASAP so I can address them before we get in front of the big plenary meeting!  Thanks!

Here's the slides:
