Is the next call a week from now on 21 March, or in two weeks on 28 March? The TG1 April meeting's deadline for advancement eligibility is 29 March, and I continue to be interested in getting Intl.MessageFormat to Stage 2.

It's on the last Thursday every month so I assume on the 28th

To be more specific the meeting is scheduled every four weeks
