sffc: I added "Amount for Stage 2" to the TG2 agenda.

It's not (only) and Intl proposal, but it does include proposed changes to Intl.NumberFormat.

Is this difference in behaviour intentional?
```
new Intl.NumberFormat('en', { minimumSignificantDigits: 1 }).format(1.2345678) // '1.2345678'
new Intl.NumberFormat('en', { minimumFractionDigits: 1 }).format(1.2345678) // '1.235'
```

yes, the first one uses significant digit rounding, where max digits defaults to 21, and the second uses fraction digit rounding, where max digits defaults to 3

I get that that's why we have the behaviour, but I don't understand why the maximums are so different.

sffc: My informed guess of the history of why `islamic` meant `tbla` in Trident is that the behavior that was later named tbla in CLDR was initially the only Hijri calendar in Microsoft software and Microsoft later added Umm al-Qura for Saudi Arabia. Even later Microsoft started using ICU4C (both inside and outside Chromium).
