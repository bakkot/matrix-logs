> <@gibson042:matrix.org> ryzokuken ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· sffc I've been thinking about Temporal, and would like to be more specific about the relationship between ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 in general. What are your feelings on proposing something formal like the following at the upcoming plenary?
> > 1. Any behavior specified in ECMA-402 (including circumstances that require throwing an exception) must be valid in an ECMA-262 implementation that does not support ECMA-402, allowing any ECMA-262 implementation to adopt it incrementally.
> > 2. ECMA-402 must not prohibit any behavior that is specified in ECMA-262 as available to implementations other than introduction of new built-in values and use of reserved function parameters, allowing any ECMA-262 implementation to adopt it without introducing backwards incompatibility.

Sorry for my excessive comments in plenary. I'll try to give that sort of feedback offline in the future.

I just got emotional about it because I caused a lot of people confusion due to spec refactorings in the past

(and, you know, I just started working again so I didn't do the kind of review before committee that I should've done)

[12:05:42.0057] <ryzokuken>
no issues

[12:05:49.0165] <ryzokuken>
it was a useful suggestion
