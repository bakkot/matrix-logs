Should we use labels instead of prefixes for tracking the type of PRs?

[21:44:55.0705] <ryzokuken>
or I suppose we could do both like 262.

[21:45:12.0544] <ryzokuken>
I'm adding the labels now, since I doubt someone would mind them, but let me know if anyone has any concerns

[21:49:35.0169] <leobalter>
I use prefix as it follows the commit message but thatâ€™s more up to you 

[21:49:51.0970] <ryzokuken>
oh right, the commit message needs to have it too, makes sense.

[21:49:52.0923] <leobalter>
No One Will mind the labels for sure 

[21:50:06.0690] <ryzokuken>
no, you're right. Let's just do both like 262 does

[21:50:52.0822] <ryzokuken>
I like labels, since github lets me use them to do filtering and stuff, but prefixes are important too I just realized

[21:50:55.0485] <ryzokuken>
thanks leobalter  ðŸ˜€

leobalter: Richard Gibson sffc https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/584 seems like an important issue to have some discussion on. Would you folks mind a small meeting next week to discuss this and a few other similar issues or should we try to cover this in the TG2 meeting instead?

[22:13:18.0686] <ryzokuken>
specifically, that issue plus https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/580 and https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/588

Is that a dupe of https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/105 ?

Looks like it, yes. 

[01:19:27.0875] <zbraniecki>
Sorry, that's for 580

[01:19:58.0194] <zbraniecki>
ryzokuken is there something we can do to make existing issues easier to find?

[02:22:40.0299] <ryzokuken>
580, 584 and 105 are all mostly similar

[02:23:01.0910] <ryzokuken>
zbraniecki: for some reason, we don't use the "featured issues" feature of GitHub

[02:23:24.0944] <ryzokuken>
I think maybe putting up these common/big-picture/existential issues up there would improve their discoverability.

[02:23:58.0848] <ryzokuken>
actually, I will do that right now, until someone objects. Please feel free to unpin issues that you think are less relevant and replace them with others.

[08:29:11.0101] <sffc>
We have the "priority issues" list in the agenda board for this purpose

[08:29:58.0811] <sffc>
Though I don't really see how these three issues are "existential"
