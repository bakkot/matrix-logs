It looks like the ICU 74 update may break the web again a bit: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1864612

Oh sv-SE breaks finally? I've been tracking the multiple Stack Overflow answers that suggest this hack to get ISO date formats for some time now

Some examples, and these are not the only ones:

I think browsers should patch their data narrowly to revert this one change (for both sv and sv-SE) and otherwise proceed with the ICU 74 rollout.

Once Temporal is widely available, we can maybe revisit removing the patch.

This time, it [looks like](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1864612#c8) it's a bug in ICU rather than the underlying CLDR data.

For those interested, I'm putting together an incubator call for the Stable Formatting proposal. See here for an agenda and a Doodle poll for figuring out the date & time: https://github.com/tc39/incubator-agendas/pull/35
