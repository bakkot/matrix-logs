littledan: I see that https://github.com/tc39/proposal-idl is from 6 years ago. Has there been progress since then in another repo? If not, why did it stall?

hsivonen: Sorry about that. I gathered that people wouldn't want to do another ES6-style set of minor changes all over the semantics of how certain casts work; it was unclear whether this should end up being WebIDL literally or not. Anyway I just didn't put more work into it; someone else could pick it up.

I would be happy to consult with anyone interested in this task

Thanks. At this point, I'm trying to understand why things are the way they are and am not proposing concrete changes.

should it be possible to observe the change of system default locale over the course of a single program execution?

I don't see any constraint on deterministic behaviour of https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-defaultlocale
