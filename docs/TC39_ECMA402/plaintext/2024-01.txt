littledan: I see that https://github.com/tc39/proposal-idl is from 6 years ago. Has there been progress since then in another repo? If not, why did it stall?

hsivonen: Sorry about that. I gathered that people wouldn't want to do another ES6-style set of minor changes all over the semantics of how certain casts work; it was unclear whether this should end up being WebIDL literally or not. Anyway I just didn't put more work into it; someone else could pick it up.

[09:15:48.0764] <littledan>
I would be happy to consult with anyone interested in this task

Thanks. At this point, I'm trying to understand why things are the way they are and am not proposing concrete changes.

should it be possible to observe the change of system default locale over the course of a single program execution?

[10:41:31.0063] <Michael Ficarra>
I don't see any constraint on deterministic behaviour of https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-defaultlocale

I don't believe so

[10:55:52.0530] <Michael Ficarra>
ryzokuken: where is that constraint expressed?

[10:56:02.0882] <Richard Gibson>
right, there are no constraints and the specification text is analogous to that of [SystemTimeZoneIdentifier](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-systemtimezoneidentifier). I'd expect most if not all implementations to reflect changes.

[10:56:06.0892] <ryzokuken>
I think on the web platform side 

[10:56:29.0691] <ryzokuken>
There was this PR Frank wax working on to address that 

[10:56:36.0852] <ryzokuken>
On the whatwg side if I remember correctly 

[10:56:42.0484] <ryzokuken>
Let me try to find it now 

[10:56:46.0520] <Richard Gibson>

I'd expect most if not all implementations to reflect changes (but they should not be required to do so).

Frank was working on an ontimezonechange event. I recall discussion of a onlocalechange event but I'm not sure what came of that

[10:57:50.0240] <sffc>
It might not work for locale-change since it is intended to be consistent with the Accept-Language header

[10:58:42.0567] <ryzokuken>
> <@sffc:mozilla.org> Frank was working on an ontimezonechange event. I recall discussion of a onlocalechange event but I'm not sure what came of that

It was discussed but I don't remember it moving forward, there was something it was blocked on

[11:00:13.0331] <Michael Ficarra>
okay so it sounds like it's not a JS constraint but a web constraint because of that header consistency
