What should I read to learn why ECMA-402 `DisplayNames` has both "short" and "narrow" style when the expected data source (CLDR) seems to have only one kind of short?

There's nothing forbidding engines from obeying a request for a narrow width if they have data for it, and there is data in type: "currency". In previous versions of the proposal, date fields like type: "weekday" were included, which definitely have narrow width, but type: "weekday" was removed before the proposal reached Stage 3.

In Firefox 115:

```
["long", "short", "narrow"].map((style) => new Intl.DisplayNames("es-MX", { type: "currency", style }).of("USD"))
Array(3) [ "dólar estadounidense", "USD", "$" ]
```

Note: Chrome doesn't seem to respect `style` with `type: "currency"`?

what's the expected result?

Chrome 127:
```
["long", "short", "narrow"].map((style) => new Intl.DisplayNames("es-MX", { type: "currency", style }).of("USD"))
Array(3) [ "dólar estadounidense", "USD", "$" ]
```

Thanks. So it's for currency and for the rest just the same API shape.

In general, the definition of Long/Short/Narrow is

- Long: the full name of the entity
- Short: the shortest name of the entity that is not ambiguous
- Narrow: the shortest name of the entity, even if ambiguous

So for something like the region name, it would be valid for an implementation to return "France", "Fr.", and "F" for region FR and "Finland", "Fi.", and "F" for region FI, even though the narrow names are ambiguous with each other.

Interesting history of the Chinese calendar, Jesuits, Galileo, and more. https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1729600511031037988?s=46&t=QSggAfTZ89VDmJRcZoeQ0A
