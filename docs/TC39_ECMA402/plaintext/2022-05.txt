Does anyone have any experience converting canonical language tags from ICU to ECMA402?

And, more to the point, if so, is the code/algorithm you used to perform the conversion publicly available?

ICU has functions that output BCP-47 identifiers, which are compatible with 402

Do you know which functions output BCP-47 identifiers? For example, I'm looking at `uloc_canonicalize()` which, given a value like `EN-US`, will output the canonical value `en_US`, but if you pass `en_US` to `Intl.getCanonicalLocales()` (in every implementation I've tried), you get a `RangeError`. https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/uloc_8h.html#a69b148194cf57ac40d4bb15c5b905260

Ha ha! Found it. It's `uloc_toLanguageTag()`

ryzokuken ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· sffc I've been thinking about Temporal, and would like to be more specific about the relationship between ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 in general. What are your feelings on proposing something formal like the following at the upcoming plenary?
> 1. Any behavior specified in ECMA-402 (including circumstances that require throwing an exception) must be valid in an ECMA-262 implementation that does not support ECMA-402, allowing any ECMA-262 implementation to adopt it incrementally.
> 2. ECMA-402 must not prohibit any behavior that is specified in ECMA-262 as available to implementations other than introduction of new built-in values and use of reserved function parameters, allowing any ECMA-262 implementation to adopt it without introducing backwards incompatibility.

Seems reasonable; I would support it
