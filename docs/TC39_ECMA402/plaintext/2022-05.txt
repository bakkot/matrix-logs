Does anyone have any experience converting canonical language tags from ICU to ECMA402?

And, more to the point, if so, is the code/algorithm you used to perform the conversion publicly available?

ICU has functions that output BCP-47 identifiers, which are compatible with 402

Do you know which functions output BCP-47 identifiers? For example, I'm looking at `uloc_canonicalize()` which, given a value like `EN-US`, will output the canonical value `en_US`, but if you pass `en_US` to `Intl.getCanonicalLocales()` (in every implementation I've tried), you get a `RangeError`. https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/uloc_8h.html#a69b148194cf57ac40d4bb15c5b905260
