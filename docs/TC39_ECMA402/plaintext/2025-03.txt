sffc: Did you overlook this line: https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/9931b3281c82cf82f267c12d732f4e207fd4bff3/common/supplemental/supplementalData.xml#L4869 ? Anyway, as I asked on the ICU4X issue: What does `islamic` in CLDR data really mean: Does it mean the behavior in ICU4C or does it mean more generally that a local-to-region observation is used or something else? FWIW, https://web.archive.org/web/20170508214424/http://www.moonsighting.com/calculation-or-sighting.html from 2016 does not match CLDR.

I think it would be a good exercise to try to write an MDN explanation for what `islamic` does and when one would use it instead of `islamic-umalqura`, `islamic-civil`, or `islamic-tbla`.
