the "New Contributors" list is funky but seems like we need a start for better lists in the further releases.

thanks, agreed. The PDFs look better than I ever remember seeing, although there is moderate difficulty with whatever row of Table 12 (Numbering System) is split by a page break (the data can be copied, but I wouldn't have confidence in reading the right data from a printout). The issue seems to be caused by the great width of the Digits column (due to hanidec) squeezing the Numbering System column so much that its header cell is broken into multiple lines. 

I think it could be fixed by updating the CSS for `emu-table th, emu-table thead td, table.real-table th` (which currently defines the gray background) to include `white-space: nowrap`, but that seems likely to exacerbate the already-too-wide layout of Table 14 (Plural Rules Operands Record Fields), which itself would need to be addressed by something like `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on the cells and/or changing from a table to another format and/or renaming the [[NumberOfFractionDigitsWithoutTrailing]] slot to something shorter.

Does anyone have a preference regarding those three options, or an alternative?

btw leobalter, thanks so much for landing those pending PRs

fwiw it would be great if any PDF-specific changes yall make could be shared by 262, and vice versa :-)

for 262, i do `npm run build-for-pdf`, and then i open it in safari, and i print to pdf. and then i open it in Adobe Acrobat and add the first 4 pages, and then add the autonumbering for the rest.
