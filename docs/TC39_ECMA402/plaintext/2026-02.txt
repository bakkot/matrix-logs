This channel is for ECMA-402, but Explicit Resource Management is an ECMA-262 proposal

Sorry about that!

@sffc:mozilla.org do you know when Chrome plans to ship throwing RangeError in `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for legacy non-IANA tzs?

[12:38:33.0172] <sffc>
You mean the Time Zone Canonicalization proposal? I don't think throwing in that circumstance is part of the proposal

[12:56:25.0448] <shu>
i mean i mean https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/test/intl402/DateTimeFormat/timezone-legacy-non-iana.js, i don't think that's the time zone canonicalization proposal

[12:57:48.0011] <sffc>
I see. I was unaware of this issue.

[12:57:59.0001] <sffc>
Is there a crbug for it?

What is the context around this request?  Did these non-IANA names previously work in Chrome?  If so, how did they work?

I ask because I don't see "JST" in https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/bcp47/timezone.xml which is AFAIK the data source for time zone IDs used by ICU4C.

And, aside from naming, where does the time zone rules for each of these non-standard zones come from? Are each of these simply aliases to an IANA zone or do some/all have distinct rules?

[20:40:43.0771] <justingrant>
Oh, I didn't see the link in the test the first time I read it. Now I understand. 

Are we seeing customer complaints about these zones?

Does Firefox currently pass this test, and Chrome fails? Where does Safari land?

[21:10:01.0254] <justingrant>

Are we seeing customer complaints about (the lack of) these zones?

[21:10:29.0136] <justingrant>
Current Safari accepts these legacy zones. 


2026-02-06
[11:28:37.0799] <shu>
Safari wants to align with Firefox and would like signals from Chrome

[11:29:49.0479] <shu>
yeah, this broke some stuff internally; unclear to me extent of web breakage

[11:30:31.0459] <shu>
namely i suspect PST is gonna break stuff

[11:37:03.0121] <shu>
"wants to" is perhaps too strong: we prefer to be standards compliant given this is the current behavior, but chrome has not yet shipped so we want to know either that they plan to implement, or they plan to propose to change the spec

[11:38:09.0690] <justingrant>
I would not want to change the spec here: requiring all implementations to support time zone names that have been deprecated for many years (decades?) seems like a bad idea. 

[11:40:05.0802] <shu>
i also haven't filed a bug against chromium for this, @sffc:mozilla.org mind filing one?


2026-02-07
[17:35:47.0228] <sffc>
I feel like the chances someone wrote code saying time zone: "PST" and never thought of testing it in Firefox is pretty high

[17:36:47.0750] <sffc>
But I suspect Chrome has been out of conformance here for quite some time

[17:37:11.0980] <sffc>
The next step is to file a crbug

Firefox only implements https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-lookupmatchinglocalebyprefix . I hear from sffc that Chrome doesn't implement it and only delegates to ICU4C's lookup as https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-lookupmatchinglocalebybestfit . What does Safari do for lookup?

[10:24:47.0798] <hsivonen>
It looks to me that Chromium does have two distinct lookup algorithms.

[11:17:13.0439] <hsivonen>
Looks like WebKit/JSC does what Gecko/SpiderMonkey does.

[11:17:35.0587] <hsivonen>
I.e. https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-lookupmatchinglocalebyprefix only.


2026-02-20
[22:14:37.0128] <sffc>
"prefix only" is not a good algorithm because it doesn't handle parent relationships and multi script locales well

[22:17:06.0178] <sffc>
I assume it was added because the authors wanted to define an algorithm that could be reasonably implemented without ICU, not because they thought anyone should actually use it.

[22:22:00.0897] <sffc>
A specific flaw with "prefix only", as I mentioned to Henri earlier, is it doesn't allow for engine optimizations like making Chinese Hans/Hant inherit from a common ancestor for collations.

[13:48:36.0945] <justingrant>
FWIW, we ran into a case where a developer on Linux wrote code that parsed the output of the `date` command and assumed that they could pass that output's time zone acronym (e.g. EST) to Temporal.

This broke for Pacific time because EST and MST are valid IDs in IANA but PST and CST are not. Also not EDT, CDT, MDT, PDT.

Not sure what to make of this. On one hand, using those acronyms is hugely fragile, won't work worldwide, and we don't want anyone to use them in Temporal/Intl. On the other hand, crashing is bad.
