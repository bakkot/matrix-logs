This channel is for ECMA-402, but Explicit Resource Management is an ECMA-262 proposal

@sffc:mozilla.org do you know when Chrome plans to ship throwing RangeError in `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for legacy non-IANA tzs?

[12:38:33.0172] <sffc>
You mean the Time Zone Canonicalization proposal? I don't think throwing in that circumstance is part of the proposal

[12:56:25.0448] <shu>
i mean i mean https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/test/intl402/DateTimeFormat/timezone-legacy-non-iana.js, i don't think that's the time zone canonicalization proposal

I see. I was unaware of this issue.

[12:57:59.0001] <sffc>
Is there a crbug for it?

What is the context around this request?  Did these non-IANA names previously work in Chrome?  If so, how did they work?

I ask because I don't see "JST" in https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/bcp47/timezone.xml which is AFAIK the data source for time zone IDs used by ICU4C.

And, aside from naming, where does the time zone rules for each of these non-standard zones come from? Are each of these simply aliases to an IANA zone or do some/all have distinct rules?

Oh, I didn't see the link in the test the first time I read it. Now I understand. 

Are we seeing customer complaints about these zones?

Does Firefox currently pass this test, and Chrome fails? Where does Safari land?

Are we seeing customer complaints about (the lack of) these zones?

Current Safari accepts these legacy zones.
