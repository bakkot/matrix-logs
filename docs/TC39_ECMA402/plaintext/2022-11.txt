Is there a DurationFormat polyfill?

I don't think so. There are too many open questions about it to start one yet

[20:46:47.0146] <sffc>
The proposal is implementable in a polyfill ever since it reached Stage 3. There haven't been architectural changes; just details around the edges

[20:47:57.0926] <sffc>
It should actually be an easy polyfill to write, since it can be largely composed on top of ListFormat and NumberFormat

yusukesuzuki eemeli Frank found the following issue when integrating ICU 72 which may cause web compat concerns https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=13494

I have some colleagues at Bloomberg who were looking for a polyfill project in TC39; should I direct them to DurationFormat?

[17:41:33.0690] <sffc>
Yeah! Most ECMA-402 polyfills have been landing in format.js, although they could go anywhere. I think format.js has a lot of the infrastructure for polyfills already set up. Might be good to start by checking if they already have an issue open for this.

Nice catch!

It reminds me of https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/commit/1dc01f753d89a85ee19df8e8bd75f4aece80c594 :)

Thank you for the heads-up. Firefox is fixing that the same way as Frank proposes: https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D160188

https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/6556 JSC change will be integrated too.

should the fixes be broadened from special treatment of only U+202F to [Space_Separator](https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:General_Category=Space_Separator:]) or all [horizontal white space](https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:blank=Yes:]) (which differ only by the latter including U+0009 tab per [UTS #18](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#blank))?
