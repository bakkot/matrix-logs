Is there a DurationFormat polyfill?

I don't think so. There are too many open questions about it to start one yet

The proposal is implementable in a polyfill ever since it reached Stage 3. There haven't been architectural changes; just details around the edges

It should actually be an easy polyfill to write, since it can be largely composed on top of ListFormat and NumberFormat
