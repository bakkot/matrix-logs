I looked for the `islamic` and `islamic-rgsa` calendars in HTTP Archive. Most matches were bundlers including a chunk of CLDR data. Then false positives (not calendar) for "islamic" in quotes. Finally, I narrowed the list to 6 URLs that might actually be about relevant usage. None show `islamic-rgsa`. All 6 are either under .sa or .ae. Of these, 5 seem to format a date using `islamic`. I can't tell if these pages get the results they want, because today `islamic` agrees with `islamic-umalqura`. Need to re-test on a day when they don't. Anyway, I'm pretty sure at least the .sa pages would be better off using `islamic-umalqura`.

CLDR says .ae prefers Umm al-Qura, too.

[06:21:50.0277] <hsivonen>
Interestingly, mapping the calender by region might make more of a mess, since I see pages under .sa use ar-FR-u-ca-islamic and ar-TN-u-ca-islamic. No idea why.

Also, earlier today, I opened https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/39012

FWIW, ar-FR is not a thing in CLDR, but ar-TN is. Furthermore, ar-TN affects how month names are formatted in some cases.

sir, you can't just say things like "USA is down" in these times

[06:54:08.0325] <Jesse>
I think he meant the shitcoin, which is indeed down: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/american-coin

Here are my slides on the non-binding Intl Era Month Code Stage 2 Update: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wvJoRFa8nRjlYSHuVLpxx-wCfwt4H9NIw2fsGJ72gxs/edit#slide=id.p

Thanks. I've noted slides 8 and 9 for Gecko patch review purposes.

[03:30:51.0257] <eemeli>
sffc: On slide 9 you have `new Intl.DateTimeFormat('und-SA', ...)`, but AFAIK no runtime does anything with the region there. Is that intentional?

[03:33:50.0722] <eemeli>
Though `Intl.Locale` does maximise that to `ar-Arab-SA`. For a locale tag like that, that does feel like it'd be closer to what the user wanted in this case.

[03:40:12.0527] <eemeli>
Also, "Anno Minguo" is pretty apt.

[04:59:54.0026] <eemeli>
Actually, should we consider a new `localeMatcher` option value that did apply maximization to the selected locale? Or is that something that's technically already allowed with `"best fit"` locale matching?

[06:00:29.0398] <sffc>
It is intended for locale extension resolution, i.e. mapping `u-ca-islamic` to `u-ca-islamic-umalqura`. (We should make sure the spec allows this)

[06:00:56.0822] <sffc>
* It is intended for locale extension resolution, i.e. mapping `u-ca-islamic` to `u-ca-islamic-umalqura`. Some other region might map to `islamic-tbla` or `islamic-civil`. (We should make sure the spec allows this)

[06:01:15.0638] <sffc>
* It is intended for locale extension resolution, i.e. mapping `u-ca-islamic` to `u-ca-islamic-umalqura`. Some other region might map to `islamic-tbla` or `islamic-civil`, but this is an open question. (We should make sure the spec allows this)

[06:03:45.0221] <sffc>
I read that some countries are working on launching a satellite to observe the crescent, and presumably after that happens, there might be another reliably predictable islamic calendar, say `islamic-satellit`, that some regions might start using.

[06:20:43.0015] <eemeli>
I'm pretty sure that the spec does not currently support that, unless an implementation specifically includes `und-SA` in _availableLocales_, or with "best fit" matching matches that to something like `ar-SA`.

[06:21:30.0756] <sffc>
Acknowledged

[06:23:22.0683] <sffc>
I'll change the slide to ar-SA to avoid this question during the presentation
