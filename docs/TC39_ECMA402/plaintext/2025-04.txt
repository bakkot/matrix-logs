I looked for the `islamic` and `islamic-rgsa` calendars in HTTP Archive. Most matches were bundlers including a chunk of CLDR data. Then false positives (not calendar) for "islamic" in quotes. Finally, I narrowed the list to 6 URLs that might actually be about relevant usage. None show `islamic-rgsa`. All 6 are either under .sa or .ae. Of these, 5 seem to format a date using `islamic`. I can't tell if these pages get the results they want, because today `islamic` agrees with `islamic-umalqura`. Need to re-test on a day when they don't. Anyway, I'm pretty sure at least the .sa pages would be better off using `islamic-umalqura`.

CLDR says .ae prefers Umm al-Qura, too.
