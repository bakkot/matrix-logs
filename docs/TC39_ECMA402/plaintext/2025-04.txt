I looked for the `islamic` and `islamic-rgsa` calendars in HTTP Archive. Most matches were bundlers including a chunk of CLDR data. Then false positives (not calendar) for "islamic" in quotes. Finally, I narrowed the list to 6 URLs that might actually be about relevant usage. None show `islamic-rgsa`. All 6 are either under .sa or .ae. Of these, 5 seem to format a date using `islamic`. I can't tell if these pages get the results they want, because today `islamic` agrees with `islamic-umalqura`. Need to re-test on a day when they don't. Anyway, I'm pretty sure at least the .sa pages would be better off using `islamic-umalqura`.

CLDR says .ae prefers Umm al-Qura, too.

Interestingly, mapping the calender by region might make more of a mess, since I see pages under .sa use ar-FR-u-ca-islamic and ar-TN-u-ca-islamic. No idea why.

Also, earlier today, I opened https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/39012

FWIW, ar-FR is not a thing in CLDR, but ar-TN is. Furthermore, ar-TN affects how month names are formatted in some cases.

sir, you can't just say things like "USA is down" in these times

I think he meant the shitcoin, which is indeed down: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/american-coin

Thanks. I've noted slides 8 and 9 for Gecko patch review purposes.

[03:30:51.0257] <eemeli>
sffc: On slide 9 you have `new Intl.DateTimeFormat('und-SA', ...)`, but AFAIK no runtime does anything with the region there. Is that intentional?

[03:33:50.0722] <eemeli>
Though `Intl.Locale` does maximise that to `ar-Arab-SA`. For a locale tag like that, that does feel like it'd be closer to what the user wanted in this case.

Also, "Anno Minguo" is pretty apt.
