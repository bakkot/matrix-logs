someone asked me about adding watt/joule/watt-hour units to https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-issanctionedsingleunitidentifier

[09:24:54.0565] <Michael Ficarra>
it should be easy to do via needs-consensus PR since CLDR already has them, right?

[09:25:15.0735] <Michael Ficarra>
if so, I'll ask them to write up a couple paragraphs of justification and open a PR

[09:29:11.0702] <sffc>
Please have them write it up as an issue or up vote one of these issues: https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22new%20unit%22

I wish we could add all the units but if we can't and all the units we've ever been asked for because of engine payload size

* We can't and all the units we've ever been asked for because of engine payload size

[09:33:00.0699] <sffc>
But when there's a strong signal of a unit being broadly applicable to many users of the Web platform, at least as useful as other units we already have, then we should add it

I personally think energy units are getting more important with electric vehicles so there's probably a good case to be made

[09:34:17.0195] <Michael Ficarra>
üëçÔ∏è me too

[09:34:27.0607] <Michael Ficarra>
I'll let them know about the existing issues, thanks @sffc:mozilla.org
