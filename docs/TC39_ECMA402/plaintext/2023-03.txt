> <@justingrant:matrix.org> Thanks so much to 402 team for taking the time today to discuss time zone canonicalization! üôè Proposal coming soon.

Proposal is started here: https://github.com/justingrant/proposal-canonical-tz#readme

I just filed a [PR](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/pull/1339) to put this on the agenda for Stage 1 in the upcoming plenary meeting later this month.   

Feedback and issues are welcome! I'm happy to make changes before the meeting, or even to pull it from the agenda if there's something wrong.
