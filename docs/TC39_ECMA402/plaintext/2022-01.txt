Hello!

[10:40:21.0428] <ryzokuken>
You folks attending this item?

[10:40:33.0283] <ryzokuken>
Would someone like to get this tool working with 402? 

[10:40:47.0002] <ryzokuken>
Perhaps we could even make it work for newer proposals, not sure yet

Hi 402 friends, we recently had two bugs reported on the Temporal polyfill which turned out to be caused by Firefox regressions in DateTimeFormat#formatToParts output.
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1751833
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1752253

What's a good way to find out if these are problems caused by the latest ICU data or if the issues are limited to Firefox's implementation so the other browsers won't be affected? If the former, then what's the best way to ensure that the same bugs won't show up in Chrome and Safari?
