The September 2021 TC39-TG2 meeting begins in ~14 hours.  Looking for note-takers!

@sffc: I think the necessary changes are in IsSanctionedSimpleUnitIdentifier, which should reference CLDR (common/validity/unit.xml) and not imply that UTS #35 itself contains the list of units

 * @sffc: I think the necessary changes are in IsSanctionedSimpleUnitIdentifier, which should reference CLDR (common/validity/unit.xml) and not imply that UTS #35 itself contains the list of units

[13:07:20.0155] <Richard Gibson>
it would also be nice to reference the specific tokens of UTS #35, e.g. core_unit_identifier and/or simple_unit

[13:10:55.0297] <sffc>
Sounds good; can you post that in the issue thread?

Can someone confirm that all options(emoji ...) https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/latest/common/bcp47/collation.xml#L13-L31  are compatible with ECMA402? Except "standard" and "search"  as the spec describe

[06:03:07.0587] <Richard Gibson>
that may depend upon what you mean by "compatible". The whole list and even made-up values are accepted by https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-initializecollator , but are not guaranteed to make it through ResolveLocale on any given implementation

[06:05:10.0781] <Romulo Cintra>
Thanks Richard Gibson , I was looking at https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-intl-collator-internal-slots

[06:06:40.0255] <Romulo Cintra>
but was unsure if only  those two must not be used or there is any other

[07:38:02.0130] <Richard Gibson>
no, those two are singled out because the Collator constructor uses a `usage` property
