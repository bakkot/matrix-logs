Hmm, I may be open to considering if DTF *always* throws on ZDT, or perhaps any Temporal object, if the time zone is not undefined, because if you're using Temporal, you shouldn't get your time zone from Intl

There are three cases:
- `Instant` - time zone is unknown, so no potential for conflict. `Instant` has the same data model as `Date`, so they should behave identically in `format`.
- `ZonedDateTime` - time zone is known, so there's potential for conflict. This is the focus of the PR linked above. 
- `Plain*` types - time zone is excluded from the data model, so currently the 402 section of the Temporal spec doesn't include the `[[timeZoneName]]` in the [list of supported fields](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/#table-temporal-patterns). We could discuss changing this behavior, but IMO this should be a separate PR and discussion.

So the issue at hand is really focused on how to handle `ZonedDateTime` output only.
