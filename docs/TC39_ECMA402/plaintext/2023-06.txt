> <@dminor:mozilla.org> My colleague Sean Burke is interested in attending the meeting tomorrow. He's not yet an official Mozilla delegate, I wanted to double check there's no problem with him attending.

I believe it should be fine. Hasn't Sean attended previously as well? I feel like I remember them from a previous meeting but am not sure.

They were an observer at the last TC39 meeting as well, I'm not sure about TG2.

[05:40:27.0095] <ryzokuken>
ah, I see

[05:40:30.0019] <ryzokuken>
that might be it

[05:41:06.0152] <ryzokuken>
I think there's no issue on the TG2 side, and Mozilla has signed an org-wide IP release with ECMA so I see no reason why there might be issues

Great, thanks!

dminor: technically any mozilla employee is automatically a delegate as long as the company POC doesn't object

 * dminor: technically any mozilla employee is automatically a delegate as long as the company POC doesn't object (they'd still need an onboarding issue but they can participate just like anyone else)

ljharb: Thanks for the clarification :)

Well, Ecma does maintain a list of members of TCs and TGs (the word “delegate” is our invention) but the bottom line is it’s fine to participate 

[09:46:02.0612] <littledan>
This is one of those not-100%-formal things which is sort of fine that way, as long as we eventually get good lists for reference

I observed this in V8 and JSC but haven't investigated yet; does anyone know what's going on?
```
(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en", { hour: "numeric", fractionalSecondDigits: 2 })).format(0);
// => `7 PM ├F14: 00┤`
```
interestingly, SpiderMonkey seems to handle it better: "7 PM (Fractional Second: 00)"
