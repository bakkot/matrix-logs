> <@dminor:mozilla.org> My colleague Sean Burke is interested in attending the meeting tomorrow. He's not yet an official Mozilla delegate, I wanted to double check there's no problem with him attending.

I believe it should be fine. Hasn't Sean attended previously as well? I feel like I remember them from a previous meeting but am not sure.
