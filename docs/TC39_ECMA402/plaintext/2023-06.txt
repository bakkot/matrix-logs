> <@dminor:mozilla.org> My colleague Sean Burke is interested in attending the meeting tomorrow. He's not yet an official Mozilla delegate, I wanted to double check there's no problem with him attending.

I believe it should be fine. Hasn't Sean attended previously as well? I feel like I remember them from a previous meeting but am not sure.

They were an observer at the last TC39 meeting as well, I'm not sure about TG2.

ah, I see

[05:40:30.0019] <ryzokuken>
that might be it

[05:41:06.0152] <ryzokuken>
I think there's no issue on the TG2 side, and Mozilla has signed an org-wide IP release with ECMA so I see no reason why there might be issues

Great, thanks!
