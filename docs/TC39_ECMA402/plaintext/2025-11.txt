I missed the call yesterday as I'm in Japan already, and the meeting starts at 3am local time, but have now caught up with the notes. In line with what was discussed (also previously on the numerics call), I've now added a keep-trailing-zeros update to the plenary agenda: https://github.com/tc39/agendas/pull/1991
