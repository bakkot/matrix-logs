Looks like DefaultTimeZone() is failing on Chromium on MacOS 14.0 Sonoma. I don't see anyone on the Chromium side assigned. Any Googlers (or Apple folks if it needs to be fixed on the MacOS side) know if there's a plan to fix this? https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1473422

Also, this is marked as Pri 3. Is that the right priority for a regression in an important API?

I imagine this is around difficulty to reproduce

Right I guess the question was the opposite: why ever opt out of smarter behavior?

[07:27:52.0106] <littledan>
I think, historically, there was an interest in everything being as well-defined as possible. Maybe we have all gotten past that now.

> <@sffc:mozilla.org> For both this and `localeMatcher: "lookup"`, it's not clear to me what the motivation was to write what are essentially reference algorithms in the spec when most everyone will be using the alternative implementation-defined routines anyway

Yeah I think this comes down to “be specific but don’t cite Unicode algorithms either” which, maybe we should just get over

After more digging, it looks like one of the dupes of this bug (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1487920) has been escalated to P0, thanks to Mathias Bynens.

It looks like the root cause was upgrading ICU from 72 to 73.1: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=14285. This V8 bug was reported back in August, it's a bummer that we didn't fix it then. Now lots of users are breaking. 

[18:29:48.0839] <justingrant>
I don't know enough about the bug to know for sure, but looking at the symptoms it could be that ICU is not updating its internal timezone ID when the system timezone ID changes. This might explain why it wasn't reproduced in testing, because the bug would only show up when the system timezone changed, and only on MacOS 14. (And perhaps on some Linux distros?)

For those interested, I'm putting together an incubator call for the Intl.MessageFormat proposal. See here for an agenda and a Doodle poll for figuring out the date & time: https://github.com/tc39/incubator-agendas/pull/32
