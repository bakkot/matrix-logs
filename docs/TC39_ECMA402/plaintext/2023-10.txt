Looks like DefaultTimeZone() is failing on Chromium on MacOS 14.0 Sonoma. I don't see anyone on the Chromium side assigned. Any Googlers (or Apple folks if it needs to be fixed on the MacOS side) know if there's a plan to fix this? https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1473422

Also, this is marked as Pri 3. Is that the right priority for a regression in an important API?
