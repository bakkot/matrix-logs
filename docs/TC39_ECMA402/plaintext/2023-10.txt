Looks like DefaultTimeZone() is failing on Chromium on MacOS 14.0 Sonoma. I don't see anyone on the Chromium side assigned. Any Googlers (or Apple folks if it needs to be fixed on the MacOS side) know if there's a plan to fix this? https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1473422

Also, this is marked as Pri 3. Is that the right priority for a regression in an important API?

I imagine this is around difficulty to reproduce

Right I guess the question was the opposite: why ever opt out of smarter behavior?

I think, historically, there was an interest in everything being as well-defined as possible. Maybe we have all gotten past that now.

> <@sffc:mozilla.org> For both this and `localeMatcher: "lookup"`, it's not clear to me what the motivation was to write what are essentially reference algorithms in the spec when most everyone will be using the alternative implementation-defined routines anyway

Yeah I think this comes down to “be specific but don’t cite Unicode algorithms either” which, maybe we should just get over
