I've added the "epics" topic to the agenda and will get some slides together.

I just added an agenda item to the SES meeting schedule for next week, to discuss some module instance functions that might help to avoid reentrancy between C++ and JS during instantiation / linking time

[11:00:03.0305] <guybedford>
if the meeting is still on, would be great to discuss it further

hi sorry I don't engage the meeting recently

[08:40:50.0191] <Jack Works>
hope I can caught up what happened these days

[09:01:53.0851] <littledan>
@room modules call now

[10:05:58.0308] <Jack Works>
I'm worried because to support dynamic import we need a import hook

[10:07:33.0215] <Jack Works>
but for static import maybe we can bundle them into a single userland call, since the reflection information is available 

[10:55:22.0832] <annevk>
It would help me a lot if there was some amount of agenda sharing before the meeting. Perhaps we covered all pertinent topics already though.

[11:34:20.0867] <littledan>
That’s a good point; let’s try to formulate the agenda ahead of time next meeting.

[11:35:25.0698] <littledan>
Something which we touched on this meeting which I would like to revisit with the group including Annevk, is how expressive the import hook/module linking API should be.

question: does defer import support re-export?

[05:29:20.0573] <Jack Works>
export defer * as ns from "spec"

[05:32:03.0282] <Jack Works>
and I think disallowing normal exports makes this feature harder to adopt. I know using namespace is easy because it's easier on the spec work, but it's also technically possible to allow named imports
