oh have any interesting topic?

Talking about next steps with import assertions and integrations with the other proposals

not coming I need to get up early tomorrow ðŸ‘€ have a nice day!

Justin Ridgewell: what happens with:
```js
import module mod from "./foo";
mod instanceof Module;
await import(mod,  { with: { foo: "bar" } }); // should this throw? I think so!
```

dynamic import must not support `with` while loading a `Module` object instead of a specifier

[09:35:44.0456] <Luca Casonato>
if reflection is a `with` attribute, this would break if you dynamic defer import a module object. ie `await import mod, { reflect: "defer" })` vs `await import mod, { with: { reflect: "defer" } })`

because resolution and loading has already occured. the dyn import is a purely ecma262 behaviour.

[09:37:51.0719] <Luca Casonato>
shoehorning `reflect` into `with` would mean that `with` would have a million edgecases related to `reflect`. like for example `reflect` would be the only `with` attribute allowed on a dynamic import of a module object. this is very confusing
