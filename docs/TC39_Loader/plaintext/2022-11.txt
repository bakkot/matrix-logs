nicolo-ribaudo: I got a question from guybedford and want to confirm we’re on the same page: reflective import would advance the module to loaded but not to linked and its dependencies won’t be loaded.

I can easily imagine `import(x, {reflect: true, state: 'linked'})` or some such would load transitive dependencies without initializing or executing.
