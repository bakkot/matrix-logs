So, my big take away here is that we need a Shark Week but Modules.

[07:04:06.0365] <Kris Kowal>
And we’re back to having a lot to discuss.

lol I'm going to be extremely dead at our meeting tomorrow, after a whole-day Ecma GA meeting

[13:42:04.0984] <littledan>
Anyway I'd like us to discuss this somewhat urgent issue of the relationship between import assertions and HTML--the web platform might not actually support module types in the "assertion" style we were imagining. https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions/issues/125

[13:42:29.0933] <littledan>
I've invited Anne van Kesteren as our special guest (now of WebKit, formerly Mozilla)

[13:43:07.0297] <littledan>
This is time-sensitive both because the proposal is already at Stage 3 and because it's under consideration for "Interop 2023", which would accelerate its implementation in other browsers

[13:43:41.0025] <Kris Kowal>
Always good to cross paths with Anne. Thank you for reminding me that this is an odd-numbered week.

[13:43:56.0521] <littledan>
Fundamentally, the problem is: The Web actually wants to make requests to the server in different ways depending on which kind of resource is anticipated. That changes the interpretation of the module and is not consistent with the "assertion" invariant.

[13:45:10.0093] <littledan>
I'd add: the fact that HTML folks have been discussing this idea for a year and didn't notice the mismatch is kinda a mark against the "assertion" mental model. (The initial discussion was about CSP checks on the response, but the HTML people should've been thinking about the effects on the request too, which isn't as obvious to us humble TC39 folks)

[13:45:52.0024] <Kris Kowal>
In my estimate, that will force our hand into incorporating the type in the module instance’s memo. At least we can be explicit about that in 262 now that we’ve borged the logic for loading.

[13:46:11.0578] <littledan>
well, it'd be as simple as deleting a line

[13:46:18.0190] <Kris Kowal>
And if we entertain this, I’m in favor of renaming `assert` to `with` as soon as possible.

[13:46:27.0970] <littledan>
but, we'd have to think about the implications...

[13:47:05.0280] <littledan>
yes, certainly the keyword `assert` doesn't make any sense at all if we made that simple change you're thinking of

[13:47:19.0590] <littledan>
we'll need to think about whether this is the change we want to make

[13:47:25.0986] <Kris Kowal>
It’d imply that `importHook` needs to accept the `type` as an optional argument. We would want to be very clear that this is the only additional term of the module memo keyspace we’re considering.

[13:48:22.0298] <Kris Kowal>
As a safety, we’d probably also want the `Module` to have a `type` so the importing `Module` can make sure it gets what it asked for.

[13:48:58.0486] <Kris Kowal>
Otherwise we have a maybe-ignore-the-requested-type footgun.

[13:49:41.0119] <Kris Kowal>
It’s a considerable complication, but if it’s table stakes, we can do it.

[13:49:54.0210] <littledan>
The two things which would be strongly dispreferrable to me are:
- If HTML gets to have special rights around how to use the type (or other arguments) that  other environments/hooks don't see, assuming HTML uses them in a significant-enough way
- If HTML does a willful violation (or violates a _should_ recommendation) around how assertions are used--we're designing this largely for HTML, so everything really should match up

[13:50:09.0196] <littledan>
I actually noticed that the HTML spec says it is a willful violation when it actually isn't! I need to file an issue on that

[13:50:46.0218] <Kris Kowal>
How is it not a willful violation if the author knew to write that it was a willful violation (as opposed to accidental?)

[13:51:09.0267] <Kris Kowal>
Change of authors?

[13:51:31.0473] <littledan>
I'd categorize HTML's current use of the assertion--just to duplicate a cache entry but not to actually make the request differently--as a not-significant-enough way of using the type which makes it not so bad that it's omitted from the import hook 

[13:51:58.0870] <littledan>
it was a willful violation in a previous draft. We went out of our way to make it not a violation, but I guess that wasn't noticed by the editors of HTML.

[13:52:17.0575] <Kris Kowal>
I must have missed that gambit.

[13:52:26.0481] <littledan>
and there were lots of strong opinions flying around, including strong expectations that we wouldn't ever have alignment (from both sides!)

[13:53:22.0097] <Kris Kowal>
I agree creating a duplicate cache entry as a side-effect is expressible with an importHook without threading the `type`, and is at least required for other kinds of redirects.

[13:53:34.0153] <littledan>
oh it is?

[13:53:43.0761] <littledan>
that's not what I was saying but it's sort of a relief if so

[13:54:14.0681] <Kris Kowal>
Ah, well, maybe not so great for `type` not to be virtualizable.

[13:54:26.0863] <littledan>
> <@kriskowal:matrix.org> It’d imply that `importHook` needs to accept the `type` as an optional argument. We would want to be very clear that this is the only additional term of the module memo keyspace we’re considering.

We will need to think about whether we want to just thread through one parameter or multiple. If it's just one, maybe we should go back and think about that nice-looking `as` syntax which Guy initially used to present import reflection...

[13:54:42.0969] <littledan>
we tried to be super general with import assertions but then we don't really have enough supporting use cases

[13:54:52.0862] <Kris Kowal>
But `importHook` does need to make notes about redirects and symbolic links in some cases, so it produces consistent results for all ways to address an identical module.
