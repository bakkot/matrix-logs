So, my big take away here is that we need a Shark Week but Modules.

[07:04:06.0365] <Kris Kowal>
And weâ€™re back to having a lot to discuss.

lol I'm going to be extremely dead at our meeting tomorrow, after a whole-day Ecma GA meeting

[13:42:04.0984] <littledan>
Anyway I'd like us to discuss this somewhat urgent issue of the relationship between import assertions and HTML--the web platform might not actually support module types in the "assertion" style we were imagining. https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions/issues/125

[13:42:29.0933] <littledan>
I've invited Anne van Kesteren as our special guest (now of WebKit, formerly Mozilla)

[13:43:07.0297] <littledan>
This is time-sensitive both because the proposal is already at Stage 3 and because it's under consideration for "Interop 2023", which would accelerate its implementation in other browsers

[13:43:41.0025] <Kris Kowal>
Always good to cross paths with Anne. Thank you for reminding me that this is an odd-numbered week.

[13:43:56.0521] <littledan>
Fundamentally, the problem is: The Web actually wants to make requests to the server in different ways depending on which kind of resource is anticipated. That changes the interpretation of the module and is not consistent with the "assertion" invariant.
