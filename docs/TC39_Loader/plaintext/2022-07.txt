Caridy (and by association Daniel) have convinced me that we can use `importMeta` as in `new Module(source, importHook, importMeta)` and in `importHook(importSpecifier, importMeta)` to stand in for a “referrer” and that every host environment would still be able to emulate every other host environment. The key is that `importMeta` is object identical in these cases so can be used to carry a gensym or as a key in a WeakMap, even though it’s not identical to the `import.meta` that the evaluated module sees (unless we change that in ecma262 too!).

Caridy and I have also come to an agreement that the next revision of the compartments proposal will reify the constructor named `Module` since we believe module harmony will likely mean `module {} instanceof Module`, where `Module(source, importHook, importMeta)` generates unlinked, linkable, initializable instances of modules.

I’ve also agreed that there’s no need for the module constructor to _ever_ have an option to override the execution context of the module instances it creates. We can carve out a supplemental proposal for a reified `new ExecutionContext()` that would carry new evaluators `eval`, `Function`, and `Module` bound to the same \[\[Realm\]\]. Between `Module`, `ModuleSource`, and `ExecutionContext`, we would have everything we need to build compartments in user code. We could still go on to provide a `Compartment` constructor in the language, but the motivation would be ergonomics and performance, and would be entirely orthogonal to these primitives, which we agree ought to be exposed.

I’ve also convinced myself that, if module instances locally memoize the results of their `importHook` for both static and dynamic import, and since the import hook returns module instances, we can induce that import is sufficiently idempotent in aggregate to prevent all useful surprises. Compartments allow for those memos to be slightly more economical with memory, but probably not in any meaningful way in practice. Again, no reason we couldn’t have both in the fullness of time, but I’m convinced we should focus on the `Module` and `ModuleSource` primitives.

I also believe that there is no better contender for the enormously self-assured name `Module`. My expectation is that `Module` will be backed by the Last Module Record type we ever need and that all meaningful extensions to the module system are different kinds of module source, not new kinds of module instance.
