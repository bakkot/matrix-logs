Caridy (and by association Daniel) have convinced me that we can use `importMeta` as in `new Module(source, importHook, importMeta)` and in `importHook(importSpecifier, importMeta)` to stand in for a “referrer” and that every host environment would still be able to emulate every other host environment. The key is that `importMeta` is object identical in these cases so can be used to carry a gensym or as a key in a WeakMap, even though it’s not identical to the `import.meta` that the evaluated module sees (unless we change that in ecma262 too!).

Caridy and I have also come to an agreement that the next revision of the compartments proposal will reify the constructor named `Module` since we believe module harmony will likely mean `module {} instanceof Module`, where `Module(source, importHook, importMeta)` generates unlinked, linkable, initializable instances of modules.
