Let's declare this time cancelled, if Yulia is also sick

[06:47:58.0400] <littledan>
also let's invite Anne tot his room

Do we have an agenda today 

[09:01:11.0009] <Kris Kowal>
We do not. I concur with the overall sentiment. We’ll convene in two weeks. I’ll invite Anne to this room.

[09:02:42.0966] <Jack Works>
Ok (btw I'm also on a sick leave until Jan 16)

For agenda building for N*2 weeks from now, I’d like for us to plan to meet with bakkot to improve our understanding of the feedback from the previous plenary. That may be an opportunity to prepare and dry-run a module harmony presentation-of-presentations.

[09:06:02.0440] <Kris Kowal>
I still am on the hook to refactor the compartments proposal into epic-module-harmony and proposal-module-constructor etc.

[09:19:23.0229] <Kris Kowal>
Until then, @bakkot, your feedback from plenary, if memory serves is, “no new path to eval”, and when we convene again, we are going to want to break that down and examine whether `import(new Module(new ModuleSource(text)))` qualifies as a new path to eval in the sense that you mean, and whether it’s fatal given the mitigations we have in mind. Not looking to dig in now, since we’ve got a lot of folks away, but I’d like to prime the pump for the next meeting (or a meeting thereafter).
