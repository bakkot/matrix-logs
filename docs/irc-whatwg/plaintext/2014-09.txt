hey there folks, is there any info on why there are html5 specs on whatwg and 5.1 on w3c and the relation between them?

[19:50:32.0000] <zewt_>
w3c wants their specs to look newer, so they use a bigger number

[20:23:12.0000] <tripu>
jxs: here is some information about that: http://www.w3.org/html/landscape/

[20:26:20.0000] <jxs>
thanks :)

[22:05:14.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I think the HTML spec should explicitly disallow comments in the media attribute

[22:05:27.0000] <MikeSmith>
If you want, I can file a bug for it

[22:06:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
or come to think of it maybe I already did (at least I know I did for sizes)

[22:09:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: and to be clear I mean the document-conformance criteria

[22:11:21.0000] <MikeSmith>
there's no good reason for Web developers to put CSS comments into attribute values

[22:12:10.0000] <MikeSmith>
but if/when some developers find out they're allowed, they'll start putting some in just because they can

[23:52:20.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26195

[00:44:37.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: various github.io things get CSS blocked as mixed content for me

[00:44:54.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: not exactly a run-of-the-mill FOUC

[00:57:26.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: annevk the http://sideshowbarker.github.io/console-spec/ FOUC is just due to respec I think

[00:58:16.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: ah ok thanks (/me is not caught up on e-mail)

[00:59:50.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess my answer to the question "what's the value of disallowing them?" is "what's the value in allowing them?"

[01:00:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
an HTML attribute value is not a CSS stylesheet

[01:03:25.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith, annevk: Maybe https everywhere rewrites github.io to https for me

[01:03:58.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: and yes, it seems more plausible that the non-http FOUC would be respec than Gecko

[01:04:29.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: oh yeah, it's definitely respec; I just meant to point out it still exists

[01:04:48.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: seems that HTTPS Everywhere is doing that for you

[01:05:25.0000] <hsivonen>
does html5lib have tests for https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=17924 yet?

[01:06:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: that sort of existence is quite a bit different than the sort of existence I meant

[01:10:32.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests/blob/master/tree-construction/tests9.dat#L34 maybe?

[01:10:58.0000] <MikeSmith>
<!DOCTYPE html><math><annotation-xml><svg><u>

[01:13:17.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: that's a full doc

[01:13:23.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders if gsnedders and jgraham__ think that the html5lib test files having names like tests9.dat is any better than bad 001.html naming convention

[01:13:25.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: looking for fragment parsing tests

[01:13:28.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ah yeah

[01:15:22.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: grepping through the tests localy I find probably there are none

[01:42:24.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: wanna drop <isindex> parsing in gecko?

[01:57:48.0000] <foolip_>
zcorpan: great success: http://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/426

[01:57:59.0000] <foolip>
your move

[01:58:19.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: thanks!

[01:58:36.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: it's data from stable i assume?

[01:58:42.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan: yes, it was in M37

[01:58:50.0000] <foolip>
it would have moved by now if it was going to

[01:59:02.0000] <foolip>
but it may just rise to something like 0.0001% in the coming week

[01:59:12.0000] <foolip>
in any event, ~0

[01:59:38.0000] <foolip>
this is what another M36 counter looks like: http://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/427

[02:00:41.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: what does the @charset counter look for again?

[02:02:42.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan: CSSCharsetRuleEncoding counts any read or write to CSSCharsetRule.encoding

[02:03:21.0000] <foolip>
it doesn't directly prove that removing the entire CSSCharsetRule is safe, but makes it seem plausible

[02:06:27.0000] <zcorpan>
the problematic bit is likely sites doing indexed access to other rules

[02:08:32.0000] <zcorpan>
i can look into the spec side of this next week

[02:14:02.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan: yep, that's the risky bit, and with no good way of measuring AFAICT

[02:15:37.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[02:55:45.0000] <Ms2ger>
zcorpan, r? https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/r/2485

[02:57:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: done

[02:57:16.0000] <Ms2ger>
Ta

[02:59:04.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/2014Sep/0002.html lol

[02:59:58.0000] <Ms2ger>
TL;DR sounds like "I didn't read the email I replied to"

[03:02:52.0000] <Ms2ger>
MikeSmith, if you have better names for tests#.dat... ;)

[03:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
math-svg.dat

[03:04:16.0000] <Ms2ger>
Well, sure

[03:04:23.0000] <Ms2ger>
But they're not all that clear-cut

[03:04:29.0000] <MikeSmith>
sure

[03:12:15.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, the tests-*.dat aren't grouped in any particular way so in general it's hard to name them. I think the first is the real problem

[03:22:14.0000] <zcorpan>
your license doesn't say i can't put dogshit on your doormat

[03:35:11.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, I wonder if people are guenuinely unable to understand the difference between the spirit and the letter of a license or if they're just being disingenuous

[04:05:13.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: I think neither. I think they've rationalized it because they don't want to think of themselves as people who do hostile, hypocritical things. Therefore because they're good people, what they're doing can't actually be bad.

[04:05:51.0000] <MikeSmith>
there must be some clinical term for that kind of thinking

[04:06:29.0000] <MikeSmith>
in other news, "Nicholas Cage is no replacement for kittens"

[04:41:03.0000] <hsivonen>
should I be reading public-w3process?

[04:41:49.0000] <hsivonen>
gmail decided to land that thread (that annevk linked to above) in my inbox despite my filters saying it belongs under W3C

[05:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm so behind the times that my html5lib checkout has a .hg directory :-(

[05:21:12.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I don't see dropping <isindex> as a particular win at this time

[05:21:33.0000] <hsivonen>
though it's kinda sad that it's one more thing the Tor Browser Bundle folks need to worry about

[05:22:33.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ok. yeah i don't disagree

[05:23:48.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't dare to just review that SVG innerHTML stuff by reading the patch

[05:23:54.0000] <hsivonen>
time to write some tests

[05:24:19.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: well the html5lib tests don't have any meaningful division, so while the tests could do with being rearranged it's not really high priority

[05:24:46.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: and it means files can't just be renamed

[05:25:11.0000] <Ms2ger>
hsivonen, sounds like a good outcome :)

[05:26:26.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like Blink doesn't actually have code for http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=7917&to=7918

[05:26:37.0000] <hsivonen>
at least I'm not the only one failing to track the spec

[05:28:05.0000] <Ms2ger>
:/

[05:28:41.0000] <Ms2ger>
I've thought about having a bot just file a "write a test for this" for every changeset

[05:28:55.0000] <gsnedders>
Somewhere a long way down on my to-do list is writing test cases for all changes to the parser

[05:30:55.0000] <hsivonen>
where does blink deal with putting the innerHTML of SVG elements into the SVG namespace?

[05:40:24.0000] <hsivonen>
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/a8a0a83498e1d5f7014c79cffa7e45fda6a8b08a%5E!/#F18

[05:42:31.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm unamused by http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=7767&to=7768 . Clearly, I've had the parser swapped out for too long.

[05:48:07.0000] <hsivonen>
I was about to complain that the Blink developer didn't add html5lib tests for that changeset and then I realized the html5lib test format's existing harnesses probably don't support non-HTML context elements

[05:52:16.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: we should probably just support the svg:foo syntax there, I guess

[05:52:44.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: there's also a lot of blink html5lib tests that need upstreamed, but it's a bit ambiguous as to license in the Blink (and WebKit) repo so I don't want to just grab them myself

[05:54:27.0000] <zcorpan>
context element is the #document-fragment in https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests/blob/master/tree-construction/tests_innerHTML_1.dat ?

[05:54:36.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah

[05:56:22.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: isn't it better to use a space like in the expected output?

[05:56:48.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: I was meanaing the same as the expected output, just misremembering what that was :)

[05:56:54.0000] <zcorpan>
ah

[05:57:20.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is on pretty poor on-train wifi

[06:18:16.0000] <foolip>
hsivonen: thanks!

[06:23:05.0000] <foolip>
I don't understand how annevk has the energy for participating in these kinds of discussions

[06:29:31.0000] <annevk>
foolip: cute baby helps

[06:29:45.0000] <foolip>
:)

[07:35:57.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: is implementation of the URL spec in blink stalled on something?

[07:36:22.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=303152 with no updates for more than 2 months

[07:37:40.0000] <MikeSmith>
and https://codereview.chromium.org/143313002/ waiting on action from sof? or review?

[07:42:12.0000] <smaug____>
MikeSmith: wouldn't it be better to ask arv?

[07:44:46.0000] <MikeSmith>
smaug____: I can't tell from chromium bug tracker and review tool who's the assignee, reviewer

[07:46:15.0000] <MikeSmith>
the UI of that stuff seems to be some kind of (reverse) intelligence test

[09:20:44.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: there's many different parts of the URL spec

[09:21:35.0000] <annevk>
But e.g. new URL("test:test") works in dev

[10:53:45.0000] <smaug____>
HTML spec's attribute handling is so hard to follow

[10:54:42.0000] <smaug____>
"Each input, select, and textarea element has an autofill hint set, an autofill scope, an autofill field name, and an IDL-exposed autofill value." but then..."The subsections that define each type also clearly define in normative "bookkeeping" sections which of these feature apply, and which do not apply, to each type."

[10:55:10.0000] <smaug____>
and "autocomplete" doesn't apply to type="hidden"

[10:55:43.0000] <smaug____>
Hixie: ^

[10:56:53.0000] <smaug____>
ahaa, "When an attribute doesn't apply to an input element, user agents must ignore the attribute, regardless of the requirements and definitions below."

[10:56:59.0000] <Hixie>
yes?

[10:56:59.0000] <smaug____>
almost unreadable spec

[10:57:05.0000] <Hixie>
file bugs

[10:57:06.0000] <smaug____>
but nothing new there :)

[10:58:43.0000] <Hixie>
https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25471 may be of relevance for the specific case you are referring to, btw

[10:58:57.0000] <Hixie>
i'm half-way through the relevant edit

[10:59:06.0000] <Hixie>
(it's unlikely to make the spec any clearer though)

[11:45:56.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: with DreamHost VPS do you still have their control panel or is it very low-level?

[11:46:19.0000] <annevk>
I'm somewhat curious whether I should get a VPS somewhere so I have more low-level control

[11:46:21.0000] <Hixie>
yes, it's identical except you get an additional control for how much extra money to give them, essentially

[11:46:26.0000] <Hixie>
and you get root

[11:46:43.0000] <Hixie>
(the control is really about how much RAM to reserve)

Is there yet something like requestAnimationFrame that lets me specify a frame rate that will attempt to correct itself? Ala http://www.andrewduthie.com/post/a-self-correcting-setinterval-alternative/

marcosc_: "Just because you can stab someone with a kitchen knife in the face doesn't mean you should.

I'm pretty both the letter and the spirit of the law is to disallow that

http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/browsers.html#read-html "After creating the Document object…" on navigation, why do we create the new document before unloading the old one?

[02:19:10.0000] <annevk>
Presumably for more seamless transitions

[02:28:16.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: means we can't activate a serviceworker script between navigations

[02:28:33.0000] <annevk>
wait why not?

[02:29:10.0000] <JakeA>
Because if the new doc overlaps with the old one, there's no point the old serviceworker script isn't in use

odinho: Ms is more neutral than Mrs

Ms2ger: at least that's terminology used in normative parts

[05:56:25.0000] <zcorpan_>
how about we use fetch-* that can be converted into JSON by like this <img src="foo" fetch-priority-dependency-id="i1" fetch-priority-weight="8"> -> {"priority":{"dependency":{"id":"i1"}, "weight":"8"}}

[06:36:55.0000] <Domenic>
So am I crazy in thinking ARIA is supposed to be an abstraction layer on top of native accessibility APIs? e.g. as in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2014Sep/0003.html

[06:38:06.0000] <Ms2ger>
... crazy ... public-html ...

[06:38:10.0000] <Ms2ger>
Sounds right

[06:42:09.0000] <Domenic>
indeed :-S

[06:53:43.0000] <zcorpan_>
Domenic: it doesn't sound crazy, but i don't know about the details

[07:02:22.0000] <MikeSmith>
Domenic: what zcorpan_ said

[07:03:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Domenic: I don't understand myself why it's not actually defined that way

[07:04:27.0000] <jgraham>
/me kind of assumed it was defined that way

[07:05:15.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: I wanted the accessibility tree exposed.

[07:06:08.0000] <Domenic>
tobie: what does that mean, exactly...

[07:06:52.0000] <MikeSmith>
Domenic: but I can say from experience that among bad side effects it has is that when you contribute tests to a browser project for a Web-platform feature that affects how Web content ends up getting exposed to accessiblity software, you have to write tests that are completely platform-specific, and that rely on building and using special testing tools that run outside the browser binary

[07:07:18.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: it's not defined as such in any kind of testable way

[07:07:51.0000] <MikeSmith>
if there is any such abstraction, it's an abstract abstraction -- an untestable abstraction

[07:07:52.0000] <tobie>
MikeSmith: right, this would not be the case if an accessibility tree was agreed-upon and tested.

[07:08:19.0000] <tobie>
MikeSmith: it depends precisely what you want to test though.

[07:08:21.0000] <MikeSmith>
tobie: right and I myself don't understand why it's not what way

[07:09:06.0000] <tobie>
MikeSmith: my understanding is players in the field don't want standardization at that level

[07:09:14.0000] <MikeSmith>
really?

[07:09:30.0000] <MikeSmith>
I hadn't heard that at least

[07:10:36.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think SteveF at least has been advocating for an actually useful abstraction layer to be defined -- one that's exposed to JS and testable

[07:11:00.0000] <tobie>
yes please.

[07:15:08.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: ~ same as the DOM but for Aria roles.

[07:15:38.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: at least that's how I understand it.

[07:28:46.0000] <SteveF>
Domenic: suggest talking to Dominic Mazzoni at Google or pop into the irc://irc.mozilla.org/accessibility and talk to Dave bolter or Marco Zehe or alex surkov (to name a few) they all work on implementation side

[07:37:06.0000] <Domenic>
Thanks SteveF

[07:37:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan: According to my experience, adding open-ended attributes is just playing twisted games with the web for my own amusement.

[07:38:34.0000] <zcorpan>
TabAtkins: elaborate?

[07:38:48.0000] <TabAtkins>
The attempt to do src-n. ^_^

[07:40:51.0000] <zcorpan>
ah

[07:41:16.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: Disallowing comments in media requires a special switch in the CSS parser for no good reason, and forks syntax.

[07:42:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
Comments are only an added difficulty if you're writing your own custom CSS "parser" that doesn't attempt to be complete or actually follow the Syntax spec.

[07:42:19.0000] <TabAtkins>
In Syntax it's just a few lines of code to handle them.

[07:42:26.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm not writing a CSS parser at all

[07:42:28.0000] <Ms2ger>
TabAtkins, no

[07:42:40.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't need to write a parser

[07:42:43.0000] <Ms2ger>
TabAtkins, UA conformance != author conformance

[07:43:25.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ms2ger: Sure. I'm not clear on whether MikeSmith is advocating just a user-conformance restriction or not.

[07:43:44.0000] <Ms2ger>
The logs seemed quite clear on yes

[07:44:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm reading backwards, and hadn't read the entire thing yet.

[07:45:53.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Should anyone be concerned? This seems like a sad thing. http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/08/google-to-drop-microsoft-designed-touch-web-spec-stick-with-apple-tech/

[07:46:34.0000] <TabAtkins>
No.

[07:47:10.0000] <Domenic>
SteveF: is there a document like http://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/html-aam/html-aam.html that maps ARIA roles/etc. to platform accessibility stuff, instead of mapping HTML to platform accessibility stuff?

[07:47:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's an attempt to converge, it was discussed in a meeting with all browsers. MS isn't quite ready to drop pointer events yet, but we'll see.

[07:48:58.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins: is there a desire by implementers to normalize events? If so, where is the traction these days; touch events?

[07:49:29.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, the hope is to have everything settle into one type of input-device-neutral event.

[07:51:31.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I was developing for a touch TV last week and handing off my work to other devs. I normalized all the touch/mouse/pointer events into pointer events, figuring that, by now, it was settled as the future.

[07:51:40.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: right now I'm just advocating for a document-conformance ban (aka authoring conformance), on CSS comments in HTML attributes (@sizes & @media)

[07:51:45.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Not a big deal to normalize them to some other convention, but still kind of a bummer.

[07:52:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: I'm just with Hixie on this - I don't understand why they're bad.

[07:52:43.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: my understanding it that's precisely the part there's no agreement to standardize.

[07:52:59.0000] <SteveF>
Domenic: core mappings http://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/implementation/aria-implementation.html SVG mappings http://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/svg/svg-implementation.html

[07:53:57.0000] <tobie>
My understanding is obviously completely incorrect.

[07:54:22.0000] <Domenic>
SteveF: nice. So my job ... if I choose to go that route, which I am unsure on ... is to diff the capabilities provided by the latter with the the ones HTML uses, and get implementer buy-in to fill in the gaps.

[07:58:37.0000] <SteveF>
domenic: sounds about right note gaps include html specific accessible name calculation  http://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/html-aam/html-aam.html#accessible-name-and-description-calculation which is not covered in ARIA also note the svg and html acc specs are very much work in progress, and the core mappings will also be changing as language specific stuff gets moved out

[07:59:27.0000] <Domenic>
SteveF: cool... the accessible name calculation thing is also important to note.

[08:01:17.0000] <SteveF>
Domenic: the html name calc has never been defined until i started to test and document and talk with implementers (still much to do on that) which unsurprisingly resulted in interop issues

[08:04:49.0000] <Domenic>
SteveF: awesome, this is real hard-core archeology work you are doing...

[08:09:28.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: outside of the document-conformance part I'm not sure why you have a hard time understanding why I'm not happy about needing to write and maintain and bugfix several hundred lines of code to implement a full CSS tokenizer when I'm not implementing a CSS parser nor processing CSS stylesheets but instead only want to help authors catch mistakes in one single HTML attribute value

[08:09:40.0000] <MikeSmith>
in other words, overkill

[08:09:49.0000] <MikeSmith>
in yet other words, code bloat

[08:12:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: To properly parse an MQ, you have to implement most of Syntax already.  And if you have a hacked-up parser, it's not hard to do a pre-pass to find and eliminate comments from the value, since they don't nest or do anything tricky.  It's literally something like str.replace(/\/\*.*?\*\//g, "").

[08:21:22.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: yeah in fact that pre-pass to just get rid of the comments is pretty much what I ended up doing. And it seems to working fine. I just get a little exhasperated sometimes with you continuing to tell me you don't understand why I don't deal with comments by writing a full CSS tokenizer, which is trivial to implement, etc. (if I just read and follow N different CSS specs)

[08:22:46.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw I think the way the microsyntax for @sizes is currently defined for authors in the HTML spec -- by referencing a CSS spec that references several other specs is also not exactly optimal either

[08:23:39.0000] <Hixie>
if i reference other specs, people complain it makes it hard to read. if i don't, people complain i'm making up new things instead of reusing existing things.

[08:23:42.0000] <Hixie>
i'm doomed either way.

[08:24:39.0000] <Hixie>
wait wait hold on

[08:24:45.0000] <Hixie>
do you mean <link sizes> or something else

[08:24:57.0000] <Hixie>
oh you mean the <picture> sizes

[08:25:26.0000] <Hixie>
blimey, yeah, that's quite the syntax right there

[08:25:36.0000] <Hixie>
i vote we don't support that use case natively

[08:25:39.0000] <Hixie>
do it with web components

[08:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: A CSS parser is exactly one spec - Syntax.  The definitions of various things, like <length>, are in other specs, but parsing is localized.

[08:28:44.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Presumably authors care about things like length

[08:32:18.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: MikeSmith already has to care about those.  He's complaining about correct parsing, though, which is located entirely in one spec.

[08:32:34.0000] <TabAtkins>
(As long as you're not trying to parse a selector, which hasn't yet been updated away from the 2.1 grammar.)

[08:32:43.0000] <TabAtkins>
(But he's not, as selectors dont' appear in MQs.)

[08:34:35.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Luckily we routed around you, because "just use Javascript" isn't an acceptable answer for that use-case.

[08:34:45.0000] <Hixie>
"luckily"

[08:34:54.0000] <Hixie>
you routed the web into a ditch imho :-)

[08:36:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
You're free to feel that; you also don't build responsive sites with variable-width images.

[08:37:05.0000] <Hixie>
not everything that someone does is something that should end up in the spec

[08:37:11.0000] <Hixie>
as people keep telling me :-)

[08:37:20.0000] <odinho>
Well, but this one thing is huge.

[08:37:26.0000] <Hixie>
huge is right

[08:38:10.0000] <odinho>
I will probably start up again a magazine website I was creating that I put on ice since that part of the site was so tricky.  Now it is simple :)

[08:38:19.0000] <Hixie>
(just so we're clear, i'm ok with supporting responsive images. i just think <picture> is a terrible design.)

[08:38:39.0000] <Hixie>
"simple"

[08:39:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
The srcset syntax is much larger than the sizes syntax (because it's custom, while sizes is just a fairly simple syntax definition).

[08:40:09.0000] <Hixie>
/me pats TabAtkins on the head

[08:40:12.0000] <TabAtkins>
(The algo required for sizes parsing is just for forwards-compat, so we can fail on any one entry without accidentally invalidating the entire attribute for not matching the grammar.)

[08:40:29.0000] <Hixie>
this is all moot, since y'all are doing this anyway

[08:40:58.0000] <Hixie>
but just because i've given up arguing doesn't mean i think it's right :-)

[08:41:10.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie, HTMLWG would disagree

[08:41:19.0000] <TabAtkins>
I find it easier to convince myself whatever decision was taken was right, unless I plan on correcting it in the future.

[08:41:38.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: wow

[08:41:45.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: that way lies madness

[08:41:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, I've got the escape-hatch.

[08:41:59.0000] <Ms2ger>
"lies" is a good choice of word

[08:42:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
But more importantly, I've got better things to care about most of the time.

[08:42:16.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: there are plenty of things on the web that can never be changed that are nonetheless dumb

[08:42:21.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: e.g. "Referer:"

[08:42:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
"right" includes "eh, don't care".

[08:43:38.0000] <Hixie>
i think it's better to keep caring and keep thinking its wrong, so that the next time something comes along and someone says "hey, let's copy this existing solution", you can say "no, that solution was dumb"

[08:43:54.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. the way that when someone wanted to copy the <video> solution, i said "no, that's dumb"

[08:44:24.0000] <Hixie>
maybe if you had not convinced yourself <video>/<source> was either "eh, don't care" or "right", you wouldn't think <picture>/<source> was ok either :-)

[08:45:17.0000] <odinho>
<picture>/<source> is imho not really that important. It's @sizes and the new @srcset behaviour which is the important part.

[08:45:48.0000] <Hixie>
the fact that the design is so large that different people can care about different parts is kinda more evidence for my point that the design is poor

[08:45:59.0000] <odinho>
But <picture><source> just being a metadata driver for <img> is quite a nice way to it.

[08:46:07.0000] <odinho>
Hixie: They are for different things.

[08:47:16.0000] <Ms2ger>
One is for responsive images, one is for messing with browsers?

[08:48:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't think <video>/<source> is right, which is why I think it was correct to oppose the original <picture> that copied it.

[08:49:41.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's been explained to you how new <picture> doesn't fail in the same ways.

[08:49:52.0000] <jgraham>
"this is big and ugly, you should do it with web components instead" <- I see Hixie has a finely developed sense of irony

[08:49:53.0000] <odinho>
@sizes+@srcset is for responsive images, -- <picture> enables format switching and forced art direction.

[08:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: :-)

[08:50:20.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: it has multiple elements. that is the same way. :-)

[08:53:52.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know of any reason i shouldn't post a blog post encouraging people to sign the url standard patent commitment form?

[08:54:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
No.

[08:56:15.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: I was going to but then I saw you say in IRC "I don't know why anyone would sign that form"

[08:56:26.0000] <Hixie>
when did i say that?

[08:56:31.0000] <Domenic>
I'll find the log...

[08:57:17.0000] <ShaneHudson>
TabAtkins: Have you been following Mark Boulton's thread on Twitter? https://twitter.com/markboulton/status/506832781092343808 A lot of people aren't happy with the grids spec

[08:57:58.0000] <TabAtkins>
ShaneHudson: I haven't, but I have been responding with Rachel.

[08:58:25.0000] <ShaneHudson>
TabAtkins: Ah excellent :) Just wanted to make sure you're aware of it

[08:58:35.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: ah, this is what I was thinking of. http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20140829#l-918

[08:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: right i was saying that without an announcement, it's unclear to me why anyone joined the cg

[08:59:22.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: I think I mentally did s/would/should

[08:59:25.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: especially before the url standard patent commitment form was up (it's not like those 50 people joined because of the url standard)

[09:01:33.0000] <Hixie>
ok, i've published the blog post

[09:08:38.0000] <annevk>
darobin: I don't follow

[09:08:52.0000] <annevk>
darobin: the second paragraph does not state that the table that states that it's not GPL compatible is wrong

[09:09:33.0000] <annevk>
darobin: CC-BY not being GPL compatible is a deal breaker, I don't see why this is different

[09:09:53.0000] <tantek>
ooh more license fun

[09:10:00.0000] <annevk>
darobin: CC0 however has less hassle

[09:10:18.0000] <annevk>
tantek: "fun"

[09:10:24.0000] <tantek>
/me is really confused about all the objections to CC0 by people who don't actually write specs.

[09:10:34.0000] <annevk>
I wonder why I'm even replying at this point. This clearly wasn't though through

[09:10:46.0000] <annevk>
thought*

[09:10:48.0000] <tantek>
annevk - you're replying because you haven't documented an FAQ on a wiki? ;)

[09:11:00.0000] <tantek>
(happy to help with that btw - not just being snarky)

[09:11:13.0000] <annevk>
I have http://annevankesteren.nl/2013/03/zero

[09:12:02.0000] <tantek>
annevk - that's a good summary of the general "why" - I think we need specific FAQs now for the silly threads that keep popping up like the back/forth with glazou

[09:12:19.0000] <annevk>
tantek: oh my, those emails :-(

[09:12:34.0000] <annevk>
tantek: this was re https://twitter.com/robinberjon/status/506829057540243456

[09:12:43.0000] <tantek>
annvek, you can also point to this, https://wiki.mozilla.org/Standards/license#CC0_OWFa_Preferred which has more weight since it is backed by Mozilla legal (I made sure of that)

[09:13:28.0000] <tantek>
wow darobin is confused - that's a nonsensical question

[09:14:02.0000] <annevk>
neat

[09:14:31.0000] <Ms2ger>
Who wants GPL compat?

[09:15:10.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: hsivonen

[09:15:20.0000] <Hixie>
anyone with gpl-licensed code, e.g. mozilla

[09:15:22.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: I think it was use case 0 in the long HTML WG licensing debate

[09:15:23.0000] <tantek>
Ms2ger - Mozilla *needs* GPL/MPL compat

[09:15:34.0000] <Ms2ger>
MPL, yes

[09:15:46.0000] <tantek>
per https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html#Licenses_Compatible_with_the_MPL

[09:15:47.0000] <Ms2ger>
I guess that implies GPL too

[09:16:08.0000] <tantek>
nope, don't make any "implies" such statements about licenses unless you're a lawyer

[09:16:27.0000] <Ms2ger>
Okay

[09:16:39.0000] <Ms2ger>
Then I'm not sure why we need GPL compat [IANAL]

[09:16:52.0000] <tantek>
/me has already had to do all the due diligence here. If you need a reference for folks, send them this: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Standards/license#CC0_OWFa_Preferred

[09:17:05.0000] <Hixie>
does glazou really not understand the difference between "legally permissible" and "bad idea"?

[09:18:10.0000] <Ms2ger>
It appears that he's trying to ignore the difference to fit his world view that the W3C is doing the right thing

[09:18:47.0000] <tantek>
seems too nuanced to interpret from an email thread IMO.

[09:19:50.0000] <Domenic>
need @WHATWG to tweet blog post, Hixie annevk

[09:20:06.0000] <Hixie>
ah, yeah, annevk, tweet tweet!

[09:20:18.0000] <tantek>
/me looks at blog.whatwg.org

[09:20:20.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: link?

[09:20:30.0000] <annevk>
oooh

[09:20:33.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: http://blog.whatwg.org/make-patent-commitments

[09:21:10.0000] <Domenic>
Well gosh I hope my AC rep approves my request to be nominated to participate in the WHATCG...

[09:21:29.0000] <tantek>
/me wonders if he ever signed up for the CG

[09:21:54.0000] <annevk>
tweeted

[09:22:12.0000] <tantek>
apparently I'm in the CG! woo!

[09:22:40.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: I can't talk to our AC rep anymore, since anything I ask to be in, he tries to insist I sign up for with my @google.com address, rather than the @gmail.com one I've used for nearly a decade.

[09:23:20.0000] <Sample>
Q: Was not enabling instantiation of the File() object (Blob subclass), or the file type input being the only input that doesn't allow its value to be set, a conscious decision? I both can't comprehend why nor find any archived backstory online

[09:23:27.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: uh oh, I will likely be in a similar boat

[09:23:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
The file type input, yes, that was a conscious security decision.

[09:24:34.0000] <TabAtkins>
Otherwise you could set it to well-known files, then submit a (hidden) form programmatically, and you get free access to the user's file system!

[09:24:41.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: is TV your AC rep?

[09:24:45.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Yup.

[09:25:56.0000] <Sample>
TabAtkins: set "what" to well-known files? I'm considering programmatic file creation (think instantiating an image binary through Blob of a dataURL) and populating the file input with that image. Yes, the form will submit to the SERVERS filesystem and the server can choose how to handle it

[09:26:05.0000] <Sample>
but what does that have to do with access to a user's file system?

[09:26:45.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sample: The value of <input type=file> is a path in the user's filesystem, and its contribution to submission is the file pointed to by that path.

[09:27:21.0000] <Sample>
ah, that's unfortunate =/

[09:27:22.0000] <TabAtkins>
You can submit a programatically created image yourself, without use of <input type=file>.

[09:27:45.0000] <Sample>
TabAtkins: you can submit it in a SEPARATE request, which is unfortunate

[09:28:14.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sample: Nah, just jam the data url or a base64 or some other text-version of the image into an <input type=hidden>.

[09:29:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: If you can get TV to accept your pre-existing email, let me know, so I can bludgeon him over the head with it.

[09:30:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: If he tries to fob off "legal concerns" on you, I've talked to our legal, and they say that as long as it's clearly indicated that I'm a Google rep (and it is, there's a publicly-accessible list of W3C reps with their company affiliation), we're fine.

[09:31:15.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: fun times. We'll see how it goes.

[09:31:57.0000] <TabAtkins>
(They *prefer* the added clarity of an @google.com address attached to my W3C emails, but don't require it.)

[09:34:08.0000] <Sample>
TabAtkins: in that case it's also unfortunate, the server does not receive a standard multipart request

[09:34:45.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sample: True fact.

[09:35:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: There's some way with your file submission API to trigger a multipart request with a blob, right?

[09:35:33.0000] <Sample>
TabAtkins: in a separate request, yes

[09:35:36.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: x = new FormData(); x.append("test", blob)

[09:35:42.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: xhr.send(x)

[09:35:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: That's what I thought, cool.  Sample: ^^^

[09:36:15.0000] <Sample>
TabAtkins: ideally a file input would accept a binary string so it could behave in a similar fashion to all other inputs and allow programmatic input population (like all other fields), sending a "normal looking" form request without violating any security concerns

[09:36:42.0000] <Sample>
TabAtkins: your example helps to demonstrate the problem however

[09:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sample: Unfortunately, legacy means it can't.  Possibly you could add a new input type designed for that, though.

[09:37:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
<input type=blob>

[09:39:18.0000] <Sample>
perhaps. but just as easily a file input could parse its value for a "pointer" or a string representation of the data itself

[09:42:55.0000] <TabAtkins>
Having a bimodal input value is not generally a great idea.

[09:43:37.0000] <Sample>
yeah, I'd probably agree with you on that one. it's certainly unorthadox. in the case of <script> type identifies the MIME type, not so with inputs however

[09:45:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
In the case of <script>, type just tells you whether it's a JS file that should be executed or plain uninterpreted text, in practice.

[09:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: i agree entirely with your last e-mail, but not sure what to make of it. do you think it contradicts something i said?

[09:45:08.0000] <Sample>
the unfortunate aspect of that though is that what we're really needing is input file to behave like other inputs and send its actual VALUE to the server

[09:46:31.0000] <Hixie>
Sample: what's the issue here? sorry, i wasn't paying attention earlier.

[09:47:32.0000] <Sample>
Hixie: you kind of have to scroll up (not too far). I'd summarize by repeating this line:

[09:48:19.0000] <Sample>
ideally a file input would accept a binary string so it could behave in a similar fashion to all other inputs and allow programmatic input population (like all other fields), sending a "normal looking" form request without violating any security concerns

[09:49:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: He wants to make an image (in <canvas>, I presume), and then submit it in a standard multipart/form-data request.

[09:50:18.0000] <Hixie>
seems reasonable

[09:50:32.0000] <Hixie>
we can probably support that. there's no security issues that i can see.

[09:50:45.0000] <Hixie>
Sample: file a bug? whatwg.org/newbug

[09:50:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
Right, agreed.  It's just the fact that <input type=file> doesn't handle it.

[09:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we can get browser vendors on board, it seems relatively straightforward

[09:51:22.0000] <Sample>
awesome =)

[09:51:29.0000] <Hixie>
oh actually nevermind

[09:51:32.0000] <Hixie>
there's already a bug

[09:51:39.0000] <Hixie>
https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=22682

[09:51:50.0000] <Hixie>
just looking for browser vendors

[09:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
in fact...

[09:52:10.0000] <Hixie>
looks like the problem isn't even that they don't want to implement it

[09:52:17.0000] <Hixie>
it looks like the problem is that they've implemented it in different ways

[09:52:42.0000] <Sample>
interesting

[09:52:47.0000] <annevk>
fortunately we're very good at handling those kind of problems

[09:52:55.0000] <annevk>
just takes us a decade

[09:53:08.0000] <Hixie>
by what criteria are you measuring "good"? :-)

[09:53:37.0000] <annevk>
fair, s/good/experienced/

[09:57:49.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[09:57:53.0000] <Hixie>
that, certainly

[09:57:59.0000] <Sample>
isn't the point of specification to constrain the implementers, not visa versa?

[09:58:17.0000] <Hixie>
there's unfortunately a large gulf between the theory and the reality

[09:58:19.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: I guess it contradicts the idea that the text in HTML's ARIA section should be preserved, which was implicit in your desire to move both the UA and author requirements at once

[09:58:20.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sample: Welcome to the web. ^_^

[09:58:32.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: i don't care what the text is

[09:58:42.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: (that's part of why i'm fine with it leaving the HTML spec entirely)

[09:58:52.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: OK, got it

[09:58:56.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sample: Specs are only as good as implementations allow them to be.  Sometimes specs lead impls, other times they follow.  When neither happens, they're specifictions, not specifications.

[10:00:41.0000] <jgraham>
Another way to look at it is that specifications can only constrain people who are happy with the constraints. We could, for example, write a specification saying "applications MUST be written in HTML

[10:00:45.0000] <jgraham>
"

[10:01:17.0000] <jgraham>
But the relevent people (non-HTML application authors) would ignore us. Or possibly laugh at us.

[10:01:30.0000] <Hixie>
"even the scripted parts and the parts on the server. no JS. no C++ or anything. Only HTML. And.... go."

[10:13:20.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26182

[10:13:36.0000] <annevk>
I could tweet "Should we define window.console? {link}"

[10:15:21.0000] <Hixie>
"should we" is not at question

[10:15:26.0000] <Hixie>
the question is who "we" should be :-P

[10:15:37.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: "Who wants to define window.console? {link}"?

[10:15:46.0000] <Hixie>
more like it, yeah :-)

[10:15:56.0000] <Hixie>
i'm happy to do it, fwiw

[10:16:09.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, it would just start off as a no-op console.log() probably

[10:16:15.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[10:16:15.0000] <Domenic>
It *is* kind of a good teeth-cutting exercise for budding standards-people.

[10:16:22.0000] <annevk>
I'll tweet

[10:16:26.0000] <annevk>
give it a couple of days

[10:16:28.0000] <annevk>
if nobody bites...

[10:16:37.0000] <Hixie>
yeah it's a good one to do as your first spec

[10:16:54.0000] <Hixie>
because it's pretty non-controversial, the spec requirements are nearly void, and it's useful

[10:17:09.0000] <caitp>
until you bring console.table and other wackiness into it

[10:17:47.0000] <annevk>
https://twitter.com/WHATWG/status/506853217092001792

[10:17:55.0000] <annevk>
Added the good place to start bit as a linked tweet

[10:18:22.0000] <Hixie>
wtf is console.table

[10:18:36.0000] <Hixie>
it's not in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console

[10:18:54.0000] <caitp>
some of the super extensions that people actually use in production

[10:18:56.0000] <caitp>
with polyfills

[10:19:32.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I talked to Mike West, we should be able to get the certificate through StartSSL; a wildcard certificate for whatwg.org, with alternative name spec.whatwg.org

[10:19:47.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: then we can simply plug it across all our various domains

[10:19:50.0000] <Domenic>
oooh

[10:20:12.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: how much is that gonna cost and how hard will it be to renew?

[10:20:16.0000] <Domenic>
Is Mike West pulling the "I am talking with the W3C too; wouldn't it be nice if you guys were first?" trick on you? I found that funny.

[10:20:44.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: ?

[10:21:05.0000] <Sample>
I wish there was a way of creating an enhancement proposal for this file input implementation problem that the 5(?) vendors could "sign off on", make it into the specification, and be implemented in the near future

[10:21:09.0000] <Domenic>
Mike is trying to encourage better SSL hygeine via a little friendly competition between standards orgs

[10:21:18.0000] <Hixie>
good luck with _that_

[10:21:33.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: afaict 60 USD, can have 2 year validity, so less renewing

[10:21:40.0000] <Domenic>
Sample: there is; it is called emailing whatwg@. Usually you get one or two vendors at a time.

[10:21:43.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: well if mike's paying...

[10:21:48.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I can pay

[10:21:48.0000] <Sample>
it's really unfortunate instead that someone has submitted some request to the vendor bugtracker and been implemented in some solitary arbitrary way

[10:22:13.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I'll buy you something from your Amazon wishlist or some such :p

[10:22:38.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: just send me the cert, i'm not doing any of this other than plugging it into the dreamhost control panel :-P

[10:22:52.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: but you already have the account

[10:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
paying money for whatwg ssl certs imho is dumb

[10:23:15.0000] <Hixie>
what's the attack scenario we're worried about?

[10:23:20.0000] <annevk>
well, you designed our multi-level subdomain structure

[10:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
i can send you the credentials. here, i can even send them to you over IRC, to demonstrate the pointlessness of this entire exercise.

[10:24:15.0000] <jgraham>
I don't think there is an actual attack people are worried about, but they want to be seen to promote good practice (I am dubious that people are actually worried about "someone might MITM your content!" attack)

[10:24:15.0000] <annevk>
hehe

[10:24:45.0000] <annevk>
it makes sense for the wiki/forums/main spec; people tend to reuse passwords even though they know better

[10:24:48.0000] <Hixie>
hm, looks like startssl uses a client cert of some sort

[10:24:51.0000] <Hixie>
i've no idea where i put that

[10:25:22.0000] <annevk>
but yeah, promoting good practice and showing we can do this decade's utf-8 well

[10:25:27.0000] <jgraham>
Actually that's a fair point, there are some parts of the site with actual credentials

[10:25:39.0000] <Hixie>
let's shut them down :-P

[10:26:10.0000] <jgraham>
Seems strange ot shut the blog down minutes after you posted to it for the first time in over a year :p

[10:26:28.0000] <jgraham>
Also the mailing list

[10:26:44.0000] <Hixie>
well the people who have blog credentials all use good passwords, right? you're not reusing a password for the blog?

[10:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
the mailing list mails the passwords in the clear and they're not user-selected

[10:27:20.0000] <Hixie>
and, additionally, i have no control over that subdomain anyway.

[10:27:37.0000] <Domenic>
mailmain raaaaaage

[10:27:46.0000] <jgraham>
eah, mailman is pretty terrible

[10:27:52.0000] <Domenic>
the first time it sent me my password like that (for es-discuss) i flipped out

[10:28:10.0000] <Domenic>
https://twitter.com/esdiscuss/status/297336193429958658

[10:28:15.0000] <jgraham>
If it wasn't then it would be a legitimate concern. I'm not really sure why it's still the last word in mailing list software

[10:28:24.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: then you realised that it was a mailing list password and you realised it was a waste of rage? :_)

[10:28:42.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: I am not good at apportioning my rage

[10:28:48.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[10:29:57.0000] <Domenic>
we got a biter https://twitter.com/terinjokes/status/506856084452040704

[10:30:26.0000] <caitp>
a w00ter

[10:32:49.0000] <zcorpan>
w00t

[10:43:24.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: "The only person from a W3C Member that can make this commitment is the Advisory Committee Representative." Seems at odds with the fact that lots of other Googlers have committed?

[10:46:56.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: all googlers have committed. because our AC rep did.

[10:47:26.0000] <Hixie>
(members of w3c members can't commit patents, only their AC rep can)

[10:47:49.0000] <jgraham>
What if the employee personally held a patent?

[10:48:30.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: ask the w3c :-)

[10:49:13.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: ah got it. I guess it is just being eventually consistent. ("Domenic Denicola / Google, Inc. / No reply received ")

[10:49:39.0000] <Hixie>
might just be cos you joined after TV hit the button

[10:49:59.0000] <Domenic>
ya. i may be forever left out of the party :(

[10:50:10.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't really matter

[10:50:41.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't mean anything for us to be a "yes"

[10:51:17.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if I should try to count how many times figure heads promised to do something about URLs to each other

[10:51:36.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[10:52:20.0000] <annevk>
I talked with the IETF, I was nominated to be an IETF chair, I talked with the IESG (I don't think they ever got back to Ian and I in the end), Larry Masinter offered to do it, W3C and IETF had high-level talks without inviting people who know what is going on

[10:53:23.0000] <annevk>
There have been many many email threads, both public and private, just about jurisdiction. Meanwhile I wrote a specification and a basic test harness and they get all upset...

[10:53:31.0000] <annevk>
And then they plot to steal my work

[10:53:51.0000] <annevk>
Worse books have been written

[10:53:55.0000] <jgraham>
(technically not stealing)

[10:54:01.0000] <caitp>
if you turn it into a feature film, all your problems will be solved

[10:54:44.0000] <annevk>
Charles offered to do it, now Daniel Appelquist

[10:55:03.0000] <jgraham>
Turn it into a feature film?

[10:55:33.0000] <annevk>
Adam Barth got bogged down in politics trying to do it

[10:55:38.0000] <caitp>
the tone really doesn't come across on irc does it

[10:55:45.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: even before that there was DanC's copy of the HTML spec's URL text and his work on it

[10:55:52.0000] <annevk>
DanC!

[10:55:53.0000] <annevk>
Yes

[10:55:59.0000] <annevk>
How many people suffered, geez

[10:56:36.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. The URL standard now has more meaningful patent coverage than it ever did at the IETF

[10:56:55.0000] <Hixie>
so... now it's really just about the W3C being jealous or something.

[11:06:26.0000] <annevk>
Lol, "we cannot find consensus on your complaint so we decided to declare it off-topic" (paraphrasing) http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/2014Sep/0019.html

[11:18:51.0000] <annevk>
http://www.google.com/enterprise/ uses both for and For; do people just not care anymore?

[11:19:12.0000] <annevk>
(same with that email, first correct, WHATWG, then WHAT-WG o_O)

[11:20:41.0000] <caitp>
well they say variety is the spice of life

[11:21:10.0000] <annevk>
but but but

[11:21:16.0000] <caitp>
sitting in front of a computer screen criticising the spelling of strangers, probably not so much

[11:28:13.0000] <terinjokes>
interested in helping out with the window.console spec

[11:29:00.0000] <caitp>
w00t

[11:29:10.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: ^^

[11:29:14.0000] <zcorpan>
wasn't danc's goal basically to rename url to web address?

[11:30:07.0000] <zcorpan>
terinjokes: awesomeness

[11:30:19.0000] <daurnimator>
terinjokes: *hi*

[11:30:36.0000] <terinjokes>
hrm, you seem like a familiar nick ;)

[11:31:21.0000] <Domenic>
terinjokes: I am happy to mentor on technical aspects of getting set up to produce WHATWG-style specs

[11:31:35.0000] <Domenic>
given that I recently went through similar stuff for streams and can help you avoid all my mistakes :)

[11:31:48.0000] <Domenic>
https://github.com/sideshowbarker/console-spec has not much content, but lots of good discussion in the issue tracker

[11:32:46.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i think chaals intentionally misspells it just to annoy you

[11:33:27.0000] <terinjokes>
Domenic: taking a look now

[11:33:28.0000] <annevk>
*shudder*

[11:34:19.0000] <Domenic>
terinjokes: Hixie and annevk probably have more info on what they were thinking for the spec to define.

[11:34:41.0000] <Domenic>
hmm that issue tracker is empty

[11:34:48.0000] <Domenic>
i thought i saw a full issue tracker somewhere...

[11:37:42.0000] <MikeSmith>
Domenic: I thought paul_irish and some others had already set up another repo

[11:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe I imagined that

[11:38:02.0000] <Domenic>
Ah, found it. https://github.com/DeveloperToolsWG/console-object

[11:38:29.0000] <terinjokes>
looking at that on too

[11:38:31.0000] <daurnimator>
btw, I just sent this: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2014-September/039071.html

[11:39:19.0000] <Domenic>
ok this has lots of stuff https://github.com/DeveloperToolsWG/console-object/blob/master/api.md

[11:39:59.0000] <Domenic>
too many SHOULDs

[11:43:26.0000] <caitp>
huh I didn't know console.log supported formatting specifiers, neat

[11:44:21.0000] <terinjokes>
caitp: it indeed does, at least in some places

[11:44:33.0000] <terinjokes>
(that was actually something I wanted to make sure was specified…)

[11:45:24.0000] <caitp>
it's kind of unfortunate that ES doesn't have something builtin for that sort of thing though, it would be useful for exception messages

[11:46:10.0000] <terinjokes>
I've notice that I pull in some printf implementation fairly often. When I need to generate a line, but not something that's exactly a template

[11:46:39.0000] <Domenic>
If the algorithm gets specified in enough detail and implemented interoperably, maybe it can be moved to ES.

[11:47:03.0000] <caitp>
String.prototype.format.call("Hello, %s!", "world")

[11:49:40.0000] <terinjokes>
Domenic: i'd gladly accept your advice :)

[11:50:57.0000] <Domenic>
terinjokes: for streams I am using TabAtkins's bikeshed preprocessor. You create a file like https://github.com/whatwg/streams/blob/master/index.bs and it spits out http://whatwg.github.io/streams/

[11:51:26.0000] <Domenic>
terinjokes: I automate the deploy to gh-pages using Travis + a shell script. https://github.com/whatwg/streams/blob/master/deploy-gh-pages.sh https://github.com/whatwg/streams/blob/master/.travis.yml

[11:51:50.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bikeshed located at github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed

[11:51:51.0000] <Domenic>
terinjokes: I would advise not doing things in Markdown, as tempting as it is. Just go straight to Bikeshed. Otherwise you end up with a lot of stuff that you need to port later, which is a pain :(

[11:52:04.0000] <terinjokes>
i noticed when I did the Stickers API

[11:52:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Bikeshed is growing more and more Markdown. ^_^

[11:52:18.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: yaaaaay is there a changelog?

[11:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
terinjokes: sweet, thanks!

[11:53:11.0000] <Hixie>
terinjokes: let me know if you need any help with anything

[11:53:26.0000] <Sample>
TabAtkins: tangentially to where we left off, do you know at all why a File (Blob subclass) cannot be instantiated?

[11:53:31.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: No (and I haven't updated docs yet), but this test more or less covers all of our support: https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/blob/master/tests/markdown001.bs

[11:54:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sample: Presumably for the same reasons as why <input type=file> can't be editted.

[11:54:39.0000] <Domenic>
terinjokes: I haven't figured out what I want to do to get from the default github pages URL to streams.spec.whatwg.org. But I'm OK with that since my spec is not very presentable yet.

[11:56:20.0000] <terinjokes>
coolio. will get started on that this afternoon

[11:57:59.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: you should reply with "We don't have consensus that the W3C should continue copying the WHATWG's specs, so the copying will have to stop."

[11:59:06.0000] <Domenic>
oh burnnnnn

[12:00:00.0000] <boogyman>
It would be better if the two organizations could work out their differences so we have a unified specification, instead of a gobbled mess that implementors and authors wont need to "choose" one.

[12:00:14.0000] <boogyman>
s/wont/so

[12:00:18.0000] <Sample>
TabAtkins: hm, yeah you'd think they would go hand in hand somehow, but I absolutely don't see how they do. the (w3c) File API spec even seems to imply they can be instantiated I believe http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#file-constructor

[12:03:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sample: Ah, it can only be constructed from a Blob. That's fine.

[12:03:09.0000] <Sample>
though Chrome nor FF seem to allow it. Can't make sense of it

[12:03:21.0000] <Sample>
correct, Blobs can be constructed, which adds to my confusion

[12:03:22.0000] <TabAtkins>
Spotty support isn't a surprise. File bugs?

[12:03:39.0000] <TabAtkins>
Blobs can't be constructed *from a file path*, which is why it's safe to make a File from a Blob.

[12:03:57.0000] <caitp>
there was a blink-dev thread on shipping the File constructor recently, no?

[12:03:59.0000] <Sample>
Yeah, perhaps. I was just considering you guys might have some idea. Can't find any material on why it seems to be suggested in spec. but disallowed in practice

[12:04:06.0000] <caitp>
I recall that from the past 30 days

[12:04:26.0000] <Sample>
caitp: shipping as in getting rid of?

[12:04:31.0000] <caitp>
no

[12:04:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
The opposite.

[12:05:01.0000] <Sample>
ohh, as in it's simply not ready yet?

[12:05:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
"shipping" as in "making up fanfic about who you think they'd be best in a relationship with"

[12:05:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, still opposite. ^_^

[12:05:13.0000] <Sample>
they implemneted File without constructability due to lack of time?

[12:05:25.0000] <TabAtkins>
"shipping" means "putting it in a stable brwoser"

[12:05:32.0000] <caitp>
"intent to ship" as in, make it usable by default, no prefix, no pref flag

[12:06:03.0000] <Sample>
so is our assumption here that the lack of being able to construct a File isn't intentional?

[12:06:22.0000] <caitp>
let me see if I can find the thread

[12:07:06.0000] <caitp>
you know that apple Mail is literally the worst thing ever?

[12:07:36.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: how can I use the bilio.json with the curl bikeshed

[12:07:43.0000] <caitp>
Sample: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/intent$20to$20ship$20file$20constructor/blink-dev/81ihRnwHnoQ/gQnI8jFKbeQJ

[12:08:19.0000] <Sample>
caitp: Mission Control is also amazingly "one-button-mouseish"

[12:08:26.0000] <caitp>
give it a few weeks, it will probably be in the next milestone

[12:09:15.0000] <Sample>
caitp: Ah, nice. Thanks for finding that. I have no idea which lists/trackers to be searching for these kinds of answers

[12:26:06.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: no kidding

[12:26:09.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: any ideas how to do that?

[12:28:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: You can't, which is why I have a bug on me to allow <pre class=biblio> inline.

[12:28:29.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's an easy patch, if you're so inclined.  Otherwise I'll try to get to it soon - I'm doing a biblio refactoring right now.

[12:31:26.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: I'll let you do it :P

[12:31:55.0000] <Domenic>
The reason I'm using curl anyway is because I haven't gotten all the Python and related thingies set up on my Windows machine...

[12:35:31.0000] <TabAtkins>
Makes sense.

[12:35:43.0000] <TabAtkins>
Protip: dont' use a windows machine (at least not exclusively)

[12:36:41.0000] <boogyman>
Hixie: Right now? have discussions about whom will be the primary contributor/spec maintainer for the different pieces, and work collaboratively.

[12:37:54.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: as far as i can tell, the w3c doesn't want there to be _any_ spec that the whatwg maintains and that they don't

[12:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
publish

[12:38:39.0000] <boogyman>
so it's a philosophical difference. darn

[12:40:19.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, the url spec is the best example. Anne wrote that at the WHATWG after the W3C and the IETF both declined to write that spec.

[12:40:30.0000] <Hixie>
then once he was done, the W3C said "ok, now we'll publish it as our own"

[12:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: honestly though, i would love to have a way out of this mess. Having multiple variants of specs for a technology is only mildly better than having one terrible spec for the technology.

[12:45:22.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: i've tried various things over the years, but none have worked.

[12:49:26.0000] <Sample>
sounds like WHATWG has been assigned the role of the unattributed heros of web standards =D

[12:49:50.0000] <Sample>
very magnanimous

[12:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think anyone here considers themselves heroes

[12:51:05.0000] <caitp>
but that's no reason not to wear underwear outside of your trousers

[12:51:15.0000] <Sample>
I'm being facetious, but yeah in a sense at least you're enabling movement within the w3c, unfortunately to do so they're duplicating the standard they wouldn't have built without you and thus probably/possibly killing it's momentum

[13:46:38.0000] <Hixie>
/me finds himself in the department of redundancy department

[13:46:47.0000] <Hixie>
"Example: For instance, in the following example..."

[13:53:15.0000] <Hixie>
is it "each apple and each orange has" or "each apple and each orange have" ?

[13:54:13.0000] <Hixie>
http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1472/each-apple-and-each-orange-has-have suggests "has" but the reasoning is a bit dubious

[13:55:35.0000] <ShaneHudson>
I agree with the accepted answer. Has for singular, have for plural.

[13:56:11.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i agree with the answer too

[13:56:15.0000] <Hixie>
but i can't figure out why it's right

[13:56:40.0000] <Hixie>
i guess it's a magical property of "each" that transcends the "and"

[13:57:08.0000] <jgraham>
"each apple and orange have"

[13:57:33.0000] <Hixie>
the specific case i have is "each input element to which the autocomplete attribute applies, and each select element, and each textarea element"

[13:57:44.0000] <Hixie>
uh, remove the first "and"

[13:58:04.0000] <jgraham>
I was going to say :)

[13:59:45.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe has is also OK

[13:59:56.0000] <Hixie>
i'm pretty sure "has" is technically correct

[14:00:10.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't see why

[14:00:13.0000] <Hixie>
other than "magic"

[14:00:17.0000] <ShaneHudson>
I think it depends on what comes after the has/have, but has would almost certainly work

[14:00:25.0000] <ShaneHudson>
That's the English language for you :P

[14:01:26.0000] <jgraham>
Well the claim about each being singular makes sense, but generally arguing about language on the basis of logic rather than "what sounds right to a native speaker" doesn't work

[14:01:35.0000] <jgraham>
c.f. double negation

[14:04:07.0000] <Hixie>
yeah...

[14:06:15.0000] <caitp>
then again native speakers don't really agree on this stuff very often

[14:06:21.0000] <caitp>
unless they live within a few blocks of each other

[14:08:46.0000] <gsnedders>
caitp: there's normally a lot more consensus than you might think

[14:09:27.0000] <caitp>
oh, I don't think I'd go that far. especially if you ever are in the business of dealing with the language of french canadians

[14:09:38.0000] <caitp>
there are just too many dialects

[14:10:25.0000] <gsnedders>
But most people have a concept of a standard form of whatever language — and can tell whether something is dialectal or not.

[14:10:55.0000] <caitp>
most people believe that their own dialect is the norm, and that other peoples dialects are dialects :p

[14:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
There are certainly limits to this, mostly because languages and dialects are just both points on a continuum

[14:11:12.0000] <caitp>
it's kinda off topic for this channel though

[14:11:42.0000] <gsnedders>
traditionally this channel has been as much a social channel as it has been one for the web platform :P

[14:13:00.0000] <caitp>
well, I used to work for a company whose product would automatically telephone people to deliver messages (not for spam, but things like notifications of emergencies and stuff)

[14:13:14.0000] <caitp>
and the french canadians, they would be upset every week

[14:14:36.0000] <caitp>
you learn very fast that people are pretty bad at concensus --- one town will use different words, or stress the wrong syllables, or have a slgihtly different accent

[14:14:46.0000] <caitp>
and it just makes them unhappy about it :(

[14:15:54.0000] <Hixie>
this channel has no topic

[14:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: to try and rationalise this, consider the question here is really whether "each apple and each orange" is plural. it's the same as "each apple and orange" (given determiners can be moved outside of groups if they apply to all), and it's relatively obvious that that is singular (it's talking about each item, and each one is singular)

[14:16:29.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: (each apple) and (each orange) being the same as each (apple and orange) is interesting

[14:16:30.0000] <gsnedders>
caitp: varying that much and having that much disagreemnt? wow, that's unusual

[14:16:58.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I'm sure Chomskyans have invented some ridiculously over-complicated logic for that ;P

[14:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
contrast (an apple) and (an orange) vs an (apple and orange)

[14:17:11.0000] <caitp>
welll, I guess you could argue that the unhappy minority is louder than the apathetic majority

[14:17:18.0000] <caitp>
but you hear from them very often :x

[14:17:43.0000] <gsnedders>
caitp: it's actually pretty hard to do any real linguistic study by asking people, because they'll say all kinds of things are wrong while frequently using them themselves

[14:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: those are the same to me

[14:18:35.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: what do you think the difference is there? in both cases that means to me you have one of each

[14:24:38.0000] <gsnedders>
caitp: equally, basically all written speech (inc. scripted stuff that's then spoken!) is totally different to all other speech

[14:24:42.0000] <gsnedders>
caitp: language is weird

[14:24:59.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: {an {apple and computer}} is not valid english, is it?

[14:24:59.0000] <caitp>
definitely

[14:25:20.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i mean, {an {apple-and-computer}} is fine, but it means something different than {{an apple} and {a computer}}

[14:26:03.0000] <caitp>
there are some great books on the subject, I've read a good number of them. but despite the fact that you can usually get english speakers to agree on what a written english phrase means, you're still going to see disagreements about the wording

[14:26:27.0000] <gsnedders>
caitp: so you just get a huge corpus and see what most people do and run with it ;P

[14:26:48.0000] <caitp>
pretty much the best you can do, really

[14:26:54.0000] <caitp>
since concensus in language is a myht

[14:26:58.0000] <caitp>
or myth

[14:27:22.0000] <gsnedders>
well it's pretty obvious there is some concensus, as otherwise we wouldn't be able to communicate anything

[14:27:39.0000] <gsnedders>
but total consensus? I don't think anyone would ever claim there is.

[14:28:01.0000] <caitp>
there are levels of agreement, but it can still isolate you geographically

[14:28:23.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I dunno, looking through a few corpora, "an {noun} and {noun}" is always used with two related nouns

[14:28:32.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: in the same category

[14:28:38.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: for some definition of "category"

[14:29:35.0000] <Hixie>
example?

[14:30:59.0000] <gsnedders>
"education and training", "air and sea", "arts and crafts", "oil and gas", "understanding and appreciation", "orc and goblin", "ebb and flow", "explosion and fire"

[14:31:39.0000] <gsnedders>
(those are the most common hits in the BNC, excluding a couple of set phrases in certain types of language!)

[14:32:05.0000] <gsnedders>
they're all combinations where the two words have some obvious connection

[14:32:12.0000] <jgraham>
"orc and goblin"?

[14:32:18.0000] <gsnedders>
yes!

[14:32:31.0000] <jgraham>
Is most of this corpus actually the D&D rulebook?

[14:32:38.0000] <gsnedders>
High elves. King, Bill and Chambers, Andy. Nottingham: Games Workshop, 1993, pp. 4-81. 2395 s-units.

[14:32:48.0000] <gsnedders>
Warhammer armies: orcs & goblins. Nottingham: Games Workshop, 1993, pp. 3-97. 2333 s-units.

[14:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, so pretty much yes

[14:33:03.0000] <gsnedders>
that's where all four usages of that phrase comes from

[14:33:23.0000] <gsnedders>
none of these are used that much ;P

[14:34:19.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: the BNC is 100 million word corpus which is meant to be a representative sample of spoken and written British English of the time it was made (in the early 90s)

[14:34:44.0000] <gsnedders>
Getting ever moreso dated, though, obviously.

[14:35:39.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: but I guess we really want something more than this, really {pronoun} {noun} and {noun} {verb}

[14:38:03.0000] <gsnedders>
like we want the noun phrase to not be contained within another noun phrase

[14:38:15.0000] <gsnedders>
(like "an accident and emergency room")

[14:42:58.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: none of those are what i was saying

[14:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: since none start with "an"

[14:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: :-)

[14:43:15.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I just omitted the an

[14:43:21.0000] <Hixie>
"an air and sea"?

[14:43:33.0000] <Hixie>
where do you see "an education and training" as a complete noun phrase?

[14:43:47.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't, hence why I started changing what I was looking for

[14:43:48.0000] <gsnedders>
;P

[14:43:59.0000] <Hixie>
o_O

[14:44:22.0000] <Hixie>
"an understanding and appreciation" is a good one though

[14:44:52.0000] <Hixie>
though that's usually {an {understanding and appreciation} of ...}

[14:44:58.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[14:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
english is weird, news at 11

[14:45:09.0000] <gsnedders>
here's a better list: "a horse and card", "a husband and wife", "every nook and cranny", "a wife and mother", "a knife and fork"

[14:45:28.0000] <gsnedders>
s/card/cart/

[14:46:51.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[14:50:11.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i don't understand your definition of blob: origin

[14:50:43.0000] <Hixie>
what is a URL's scheme data. Is it just the URL?

[14:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
i get so confused by the way the URL spec uses the same term for the string and the object

TabAtkins: are you noticing elsewhere that the creative commons logo doesn't seem to load?

[16:40:24.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: Yeah, it's not loading on any of the specs I use it in.

[16:40:35.0000] <terinjokes>
it seems to have resolved recently

[16:40:39.0000] <terinjokes>
at least from this location

[16:41:31.0000] <TabAtkins>
https://creativecommons.org/ seems to have trouble loading as well.

[16:41:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, it's Chrome's mixed-content policy.

[16:42:36.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that's why they're not loading in my specs either.

[16:43:21.0000] <terinjokes>

[17:32:17.0000] <terinjokes>
TabAtkins: is there a format for editor notes?

[17:32:23.0000] <terinjokes>
in bikeshed?

[17:32:30.0000] <TabAtkins>
What do you mean by that?

[17:33:00.0000] <terinjokes>
i guess some sort of warning/note that explains something inline during the drafts

[17:33:46.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, if you want them visible, just start a paragraph with "Note:"

[17:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wasn't sure if you meant notes just to yourself (use HTML comments) or not.

[17:34:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
There's Note: for informative notes, Issue: for issues that you want to track (they're also collected into an index at the end of the spec), and Advisement: for things you want to draw special implementor attention to.

[17:35:16.0000] <TabAtkins>
Plus <details class=why> if you want to embed a longer explanation in, but don't want it to distract the casual reader.

[17:36:31.0000] <terinjokes>
ah nice, get an arrow ;)

[18:09:16.0000] <caitp>
why is dev.w3.org down what happened ;-;

[18:09:57.0000] <tantek>

/me is asking his colleagues

[18:13:26.0000] <tantek>
hello tripu, I just noticed myself

[18:17:58.0000] <tantek>
tripu - btw who is "we"? are you w3c staff? sorry I don't recognize your handle.

[18:18:37.0000] <tripu>
tantek: Antonio Olmo Titos here -- I joined W3C's systems team a month ago

[18:18:42.0000] <tantek>
/me waits to see if https://twitter.com/w3c will tweet something.

[18:18:51.0000] <tripu>
/me should have introduced himself earlier in this channel...

[18:19:52.0000] <terinjokes>
naturally, while I was refreshing a page

[18:51:28.0000] <tripu>
caitp, tantek: W3C's web pages and IRC server are running again

[18:53:26.0000] <tantek>

Sample: file was only made constructable in the spec relatively recently

[00:37:45.0000] <zcorpan_>
what are people's thoughts on adding JSON5 to the web platform? or replacing JSON with JSON5? (iirc browsers already deviate from strict JSON a bit)

[00:38:20.0000] <foolip>
are the differences interoperably implemented and what are they?

[00:38:21.0000] <Ms2ger>
They do?

[00:38:39.0000] <foolip>
I'm guessing things around single/double quotes and comments?

[00:39:22.0000] <zcorpan_>
Ms2ger: at least at the time it was implemented in presto we had to make a few violations because other browsers were even more lax and content depended on it. not sure what the situation is like today

[00:39:35.0000] <Ms2ger>
Interesting

[00:41:24.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: i don't know about JSON5 interop

[00:41:45.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: http://json5.org says the new features are optional which seems problematic

[00:43:22.0000] <zcorpan_>
unquoted keys seems nice if we're going to have it in attributes

[01:01:51.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan_: oh I had no idea JSON5 was a real thing, I thought it was code for "JSON with error handling for browsers"

[01:02:48.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: yeah we should trademark the 5 :-)

[01:03:23.0000] <zcorpan_>
although i guess we don't use the 5 so much anymore

[01:13:15.0000] <foolip>
Is Web* still cool?

[01:16:26.0000] <odinho>
lol

[01:17:16.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: naw, just the relevant name without fluff is the new black

[02:47:52.0000] <annevk>
hard to turn that into a buzzword

[03:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
Disappointed we haven't managed to use "web" and "5" together. Like WebURL5

[03:43:37.0000] <Ms2ger>
jgraham, sounds like a Chrome component

[03:49:31.0000] <annevk>
WTFURL2

[03:54:30.0000] <jgraham>
WTFW3C^N

[04:03:04.0000] <smaug____>
URL5.1, obviously

[04:03:23.0000] <Domenic>
SJON5 is not a real thing

[04:03:37.0000] <Domenic>
some people made some parsers. it has no real adoption.

[04:04:32.0000] <jgraham>
That's how most technologies start out

[04:34:59.0000] <foolip>
jgraham, zcorpan_, do you have recommendations for test bisect tools that are able to parse HTML, JS and CSS sufficiently to not spend time trying bisect steps that will obviously fail, i.e. things like omitting </style>, </script> or cutting JS such that it's a syntax error?

[04:35:12.0000] <foolip>
test minimizer I should say perhaps

[04:35:50.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: I don't know that exists

[04:36:23.0000] <foolip>
in your long QA experience, is this something that sounds good in theory but in practice it's fast enough to just try manually?

[04:36:25.0000] <jgraham>
There's a tool for pure js at Opera

[04:36:39.0000] <jgraham>
"it depends"

[04:37:15.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: for crashers or in general?

[04:37:41.0000] <jgraham>
The tools are helpful, but unless the failure mode is very obvious it can be difficult to write a correct pass condition

[04:37:41.0000] <Ms2ger>
Our security people might have something, but I don't know if they share

[04:37:57.0000] <foolip>
in general, just reducing a test case, whether or not the reduced test case is pass or fail would be up to the layer invoking the script

[04:38:51.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: i'm not aware of such scripts but there might be something out there

[04:38:54.0000] <jgraham>
Right, generally you need to know if it passed or failed in order to decide which reduction to try next

[04:39:45.0000] <zcorpan_>
i always did it manually or used devtools to find the problem, or a combination

[04:40:07.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway, I am aware of syntax-unaware tools, and language-specific tools, but nothing that can deal with all of HTML+CSS+JS in an intelligent way

[04:40:07.0000] <foolip>
yeah, it seems like that's what we all do :)

[04:41:06.0000] <foolip>
ok, I guess that might make a fun side project then, but since it doesn't exist people probably don't really need it that badly

[04:41:47.0000] <foolip>
(I'm reading a book called Why Programs Fail and the example used is from the old Gecko BugAThon, but the test case reducer used is completely generic.)

[04:41:59.0000] <jgraham>
Lithium?

[04:42:19.0000] <annevk>
Does JSON5 allow comments and single quotes?

[04:42:26.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: yeah

[04:42:34.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: the tool in the book is ddmin: https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/whyprogramsfail/code/dd/ddmin.py

[04:42:36.0000] <annevk>
Actually just allowing comments is probably enough to win

[04:42:57.0000] <annevk>
I never understood why TC39 did not just add that

[04:43:10.0000] <annevk>
And now they have this weird mentality of not being able to make a forward compatible change

[04:44:09.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: Oh, wow that's very simple

[04:44:23.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: Lithium is http://www.squarefree.com/2007/09/15/introducing-lithium-a-testcase-reduction-tool/

[04:44:34.0000] <foolip>
Yeah, that looks like it's trying to improve upon ddmin

[04:45:07.0000] <foolip>
but any non-language-aware tools seems like it's going to waste too much time on stupid things

[04:46:25.0000] <jgraham>
It's not too bad

[04:46:53.0000] <jgraham>
There's also reducio at Opera for js, if the QA server is still running

[04:51:38.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: found it, and it looks like you wrote a Reductor, "Testcase reduction tool optimised for HTML files", but that seems to have gone poof

[04:51:43.0000] <foolip>
was that any good?

[04:55:03.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: I don't think it was

[04:55:18.0000] <jgraham>
I don't think it really got used

[05:03:25.0000] <zcorpan_>
can someone run http://jsperf.com/animated-box-using-left/2 in different browsers and see if you reproduce my results? (requestAnimationFrame gets better score than setTimeout only in Safari)

[05:04:55.0000] <odinho>
I used Reductio not too long ago.  A year I think :P

[05:05:06.0000] <odinho>
Reducio, always write that wrong

[05:11:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
Sounds like a spell

[05:15:29.0000] <tobie>
annevk: https://plus.google.com/+DouglasCrockfordEsq/posts/RK8qyGVaGSr

[05:24:50.0000] <odinho>
Ms2ger: It's supposed to be ;)

[06:11:54.0000] <annevk>
tobie: ta

[06:12:11.0000] <annevk>
tobie: bit sad

[06:57:18.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: do we have any restrictions or expectations on URL schemes that can be put in Cache?

[06:58:07.0000] <caitp>
kAllowedSchemeRegexp = /s$/;

[06:59:24.0000] <wanderview>
I know ServiceWorkers scripts themselves are required to be https, but I thought Cache worked http as well... and I guess I'm asking how well do we need to support things like ftp:, file:, etc

[06:59:59.0000] <caitp>
it was a joke, I have no idea

[07:00:04.0000] <wanderview>
:-)

[07:01:52.0000] <wanderview>
mainly the ignoreSearch query param is problematic if I have to fully parse all URL schemes to implement it... I'm inclined to make ignoreSearch work for http/https and a no-op in other URL schemes... at least in the first version

[07:02:11.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: let's say http & https only

[07:02:26.0000] <caitp>
isn't it only an issue for weird schemes like data ?

[07:02:31.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: those are the schemes serviceworker gets fetch events for

[07:02:33.0000] <caitp>
maybe ldap-ish stuff too

[07:03:03.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: and while caches can be used independent of serviceworker, it's a good starting point that we can expand on later

[07:03:41.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: should the spec be updated to say http/https only?  or just an implementation detail to start?

[07:03:47.0000] <wanderview>
I can write an issue

[07:04:17.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: An issue would be great :D

[07:04:42.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: thanks... will do... and sorry for the problem on this :-\

[07:04:45.0000] <caitp>
in my opinion which nobody asked for, it makes sense for URLs which are actually locations of resources, where search queries make sense

[07:04:59.0000] <caitp>
which probably includes most custom schemes, if custom schemes are supported

[07:06:05.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: I feel guilty with how off-the-ball I've been with this stuff the past week or so. Especially as right now I'm using SVG path animations to make it looking like Mumm Ra the Ever Living is using his magic powers to control many documents at once.

[07:06:33.0000] <wanderview>
caitp: the custom schemes are the problem for me... as we allow js scheme implementations which in turn requires parsing URLs on the main thread :-(

[07:06:42.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: that sounds like an awesome talk!

[07:07:08.0000] <caitp>
yeah, that is a bit of a pickle for SW isn't it

[07:08:08.0000] <JakeA>
caitp: although the cache can be used from window. But applying .match semantics to non-http resources is problematic

[07:09:42.0000] <caitp>
well anyways, it's not like there isn't a bit of a precedent for mixing work between main thread and (at least non-SW) worker threads

[07:10:12.0000] <caitp>
if the api doesn't have to be synchronous it can probably be worked around

[07:10:37.0000] <caitp>
but i'm just blabbing, haven't even read the cache stuff =) back to work~

[07:11:04.0000] <JakeA>
caitp: confused about the sync vs async stuff… I don't think we have a problem there

[07:11:19.0000] <JakeA>
ahh I see

[07:11:20.0000] <wanderview>
caitp: it can be worked around, yes... but it pains me to jump threads just to parse a string :-(

[07:11:30.0000] <JakeA>
missed that comment

[07:11:37.0000] <caitp>
well if you're jumping between a worker thread and main thread, you're going to have some issues with sync

[07:15:28.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: Cache can't do http

[07:15:35.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: that would violate MIX

[07:16:34.0000] <wanderview>
annevk: you mean because SW script is https only, all resources placed in Cache from SW must be https?

[07:16:42.0000] <zcorpan_>
apparently json5 didn't have anything optional for implementers

[07:17:04.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: I don't see why cache can't be used from http pages, just like idb

[07:20:08.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: if a serviceworker-controlled page contains an http img, and I respondWith(event.default()), what happens?

[07:20:39.0000] <JakeA>
Weird if that fails. Also weird if respondWith(fetch(event.request)) fails

[07:21:07.0000] <JakeA>
If it doesn't fail, I don't see why I can't put it in a cache

[07:25:29.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/440

[07:25:52.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: I'm going to internally propose this limitation for gecko implementation even if we don't add it to the spec

[07:26:43.0000] <JakeA>
worksforme

[07:28:52.0000] <wanderview>
thanks

[07:44:52.0000] <annevk>
wanderview: yeah

[07:45:32.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: fetch() would definitely fail

[07:45:37.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: can't allow MIX

[07:45:45.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: even no-cors?

[07:45:50.0000] <annevk>
correct

[07:46:56.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: this isn't already the case in Chrome? I'd think Mike West would see to that

[07:47:41.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: also, I wouldn't mind restricting Cache to TLS as well, otherwise we'll get weird service worker polyfills

[07:47:54.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: non-TLS polyfills that is

[07:48:01.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: there was a discussion at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2014Jul/0049.html

[07:49:17.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: then you'll just get cache polyfills based on idb

[07:49:40.0000] <annevk>
if that were the case we would've seen one by now I think

[07:49:57.0000] <JakeA>
we used one in our I/O talk

[08:27:59.0000] <annevk>
wanderview: we should really fix our URL parser :-(

[08:28:28.0000] <wanderview>
annevk: yes... its ridiculous

[08:30:57.0000] <JakeA>
Y'know, once you clear away all the events from indexeddb, it's not too bad

[08:32:01.0000] <JakeA>
Switch them out for promises, some kind of async iterator for cursors, use a promise to define the lifetime of a transaction…

[08:32:24.0000] <JakeA>
Dunno if that can be done on top of the current API though

[08:35:54.0000] <Domenic>
transactions are the tricky bit

[08:36:08.0000] <Domenic>
I believe the node-LevelDB folks when they say a batch API is good enough for 99% of use cases

[08:36:40.0000] <Domenic>
I also now understand how slightlyoff says that is not the best primitive, especially when dealing with other related mutexes in the system.

[08:37:11.0000] <JakeA>
Yeh

[08:47:30.0000] <terinjokes>
hello, non San Franciscians

[10:29:52.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: should :enabled match :link? Your feedback would be very useful on https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26622

[10:30:23.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie_, fwiw, it might only be abinader who's implemented that so far :)

[10:30:39.0000] <Hixie_>
in chrome, you mean?

[10:30:59.0000] <abinader>
Hixie_: yes

[10:31:18.0000] <Hixie_>
ah, excellent, you are here :-)

[10:31:48.0000] <Hixie_>
abinader: sorry to flip flop the spec on you like this. If you think there's a good reason why we should get the other browsers to change rather than reverting Chrome (and the spec), please do comment on that bug.

[10:32:01.0000] <Hixie_>
abinader: (or let me know here)

[10:32:03.0000] <abinader>
Hixie_: currently Blink, WebKit and Servo have this implemented

[10:32:09.0000] <Hixie_>
webkit as well?

[10:32:15.0000] <abinader>
yeah

[10:32:55.0000] <Hixie_>
is that not in the nightlies yet?

[10:33:10.0000] <Hixie_>
oh, i have a pending update

[10:33:12.0000] <Hixie_>
/me applies

[10:33:12.0000] <abinader>
lemme just have a double check

[10:34:04.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie_, and Servo :)

[10:34:42.0000] <Hixie_>
ah, yes, webkit does do this too now

[10:34:52.0000] <Hixie_>
Ms2ger: servo has 0% market share. so it's not exactly on my radar.

[10:34:58.0000] <Hixie_>
no offense :-)

[10:35:15.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me is offended

[10:35:28.0000] <Ms2ger>
It's a pretty recent change everywhere, I think

[10:35:39.0000] <Hixie_>
clearly, since i had to update my nightly :-)

[10:38:47.0000] <Hixie_>
abinader: did you have a particular motivation for this change other than it being what the spec says?

[10:39:01.0000] <Hixie_>
gah, i hate changing the spec on people like this

[10:39:25.0000] <Hixie_>
but on the other hand, it's a change to the platform and i hate doing that to web devs too

[10:40:29.0000] <abinader>
Hixie_: nope, no particular reason

[10:41:28.0000] <abinader>
Hixie_: but wouldn't it be reasonable to anchors, areas & links w/o an href to become disabled, then?

[10:41:53.0000] <abinader>
if that is what's missing

[10:42:21.0000] <Hixie_>
well, those just aren't links

[10:42:34.0000] <Hixie_>
i think we could imagine a world where we have <a href="..." disabled>

[10:42:49.0000] <Hixie_>
especially for links that are basically just hooks for javascript to change the display

[10:43:01.0000] <Hixie_>
but i haven't seen much demand for that, if any

[10:43:42.0000] <abinader>
indeed

[10:43:43.0000] <Domenic_>
I have tried to do that and been disappointed when it doesn't work

[10:43:49.0000] <Domenic_>
so, um, i demand it

[10:44:52.0000] <Domenic_>
it's useful for things where the designer wants it to look like a button but it navigates to a different URL so you use an <a>. But then you are sad that your CSS [disabled] style doesn't work. And then you have to change your CSS to [disabled], .disabled and you have to use class="disabled" and change your JS and stuff

[10:44:54.0000] <Domenic_>
I have lived this

[10:51:01.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: If I have a url object & set .search to "", the href has "?" at the end. Is there any way to prevent this?

[10:51:42.0000] <Ms2ger>
.search = null?

[10:51:54.0000] <annevk>
no

[10:51:57.0000] <Ms2ger>
No

[10:51:59.0000] <annevk>
setting to the empty string should do it

[10:52:23.0000] <JakeA>
ah yes

[10:52:31.0000] <annevk>
see step 2 of setting http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-url-search

[10:53:03.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: yeah, I see it now, I was looking at just the serializer & thought the same as Ms2ger

[10:53:10.0000] <JakeA>
Chrome does it wrong, will file a bug

[10:54:39.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: annevk: setting .search to "" should leave the # ref section intact, right?

[10:54:49.0000] <annevk>
yes

[10:54:50.0000] <JakeA>
yeah

[10:54:52.0000] <wanderview>
k

[10:55:05.0000] <annevk>
it manipulates the query component, nothing else

[10:55:08.0000] <wanderview>
k

[10:57:42.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic_: what was the reason for disabling the link?

[11:12:18.0000] <Domenic_>
Hixie_: it wasn't applicable in the current state of the UI, for some reason... maybe some stuff had to be filled out first before they could move on the next page or something

[11:15:20.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic_: if it's just a link (something you can open in a new tab, for example), it's not clear how that would work

[11:15:35.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic_: i guess maybe you could have a link to a preview page that involves information the user has to offer, or something

[11:16:01.0000] <Domenic_>
yes, it wasn't a security disabled, just a "don't do this right now, it doesn't make sense" disabled

[11:19:42.0000] <Hixie_>
yeah

[11:20:05.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic_: well, if you think we should keep that door open, comment on the bug saying you want :enabled to keep applying, i guess :-)

[12:02:29.0000] <TabAtkins>
Btw, I don't have an opinion on that bug, and am happy to edit in whatever direction is necessary.

[12:09:33.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: can you explain what the purpose of this is in BatchCacheOperations 3.3.5.1?  "If any of the values in addedRequests matches requestResponse[0], then: Throw an "InvalidStateError" exception."

[12:10:44.0000] <wanderview>
oh... is it saying if we delete one of the requests we just added in a single batch operation?

[12:10:49.0000] <wanderview>
then thats illegal?

[12:11:16.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: yep!

[12:11:20.0000] <JakeA>
Felt like the right thing to do

[12:11:32.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: and it leaves the batch operation partially applied?

[12:11:46.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: nah, it should abort the transition & revery

[12:11:48.0000] <JakeA>
revert*

[12:12:04.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: is that covered by running the steps "atomically"?

[12:12:08.0000] <wanderview>
in spec-speak

[12:12:10.0000] <JakeA>
transaction*

[12:12:43.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: it's intended to, although it probably should be more specific

[12:13:19.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: so this can only happen in the addAll() case currently

[12:13:25.0000] <wanderview>
right?

[12:13:27.0000] <JakeA>
yeah

[12:13:32.0000] <wanderview>
k

[12:14:06.0000] <wanderview>
thanks

[12:14:10.0000] <JakeA>
np

[12:14:42.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: is there a definition of "match" in that case?  I assume it should be doing something similar to [[QueryCache]] logic

[12:15:41.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: yeah, it should. Hmm, the spec is a little patchy here.

[12:15:51.0000] <wanderview>
k, I'll write an issue

[12:15:56.0000] <JakeA>
Cheers

[12:15:59.0000] <JakeA>
Sorry about htat

[12:16:01.0000] <JakeA>
that*

[12:16:05.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: also, why only the first element in the response array?

[12:16:06.0000] <JakeA>
gah, can't type tonight

[12:16:09.0000] <wanderview>
np

[12:16:54.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: yeah, that's wrong, it should be checking all the items added so far

[12:17:30.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: should it be inside the deletion loop? so as we delete each item we first check to see if it matches?

[12:19:36.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: yeah, that works

[12:19:47.0000] <wanderview>
great, thanks

[12:19:52.0000] <wanderview>
https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/444

[12:19:56.0000] <caitp>
are you trying to add more confusing syntax that is totally bonkers compared to other languages with similar syntax domenic

[12:20:47.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: I was working on an idb polyfill earlier & I just did the check up-front, but I was only implementing multi-put, so for every item about to be put, check items earlier in the array, if there's a match, reject

[12:21:11.0000] <wanderview>
ah

[12:22:00.0000] <JakeA>
"about to be put", I mean "every item in the to-put array", I did the check before putting any items

[12:22:42.0000] <wanderview>
I guess that would work for addAll also

[12:25:01.0000] <caitp>
because it looks like you're saying `<context>::<token>(<...args>)` is a syntax sugar for `<token>.call(<context>, <...args>)`, but that's not how it feels to cplusplusy people imo

[12:44:02.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: could you reply to bz on the closest() / matches() thread? Would be nice to move on. Or should I prepare some examples first so we can judge better?

[12:44:36.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, sorry, I'm only half-in due to a head-cold.  I was trying to think of some examples, but if you have some for either way, that would be helpful.

[12:46:45.0000] <Hixie_>
can anyone think of a part of the web platform that compares two URLs for common path segments?

[12:46:52.0000] <Hixie_>
cookies have something similar

[12:46:59.0000] <Hixie_>
but not on URLs

[12:47:04.0000] <Hixie_>
document.domain has something similar for hosts

[12:47:36.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: CSS's :local-link() pseudo.

[12:48:54.0000] <Hixie_>
is that specced anywhere? i can't find it in selectors

[12:50:10.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sorry, it got punted: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors/deferred-for-level-5

[12:50:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Because we weren't sure on what the right semantic was for comparing path segments.)

[12:51:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
The issue at the bottom really captures the problem.

[12:51:59.0000] <Hixie_>
heh

[12:53:23.0000] <Hixie_>
well i guess i'll just have to spec my own algorithm then

[12:53:24.0000] <Hixie_>
bummer

[12:55:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
The algorithm itself isn't the problem, it's figuring out the defaults. If you can do that, we can match.

[12:55:58.0000] <TabAtkins>
What is your context here?

[13:17:20.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: FALLBACK in manifests has to only work in a subpath of the manifest's path

[13:17:28.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: it's similar, but probably not identical enough

[13:17:41.0000] <TabAtkins>
Mm, yeah, probably.

[13:17:48.0000] <Hixie_>
anyway it's not a big deal, i was just hoping there might be something i could point to instead of having to do the work myself :-)

[14:05:33.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: ServiceWorkers should now be allowed over http on localhost in FF nightly:  https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/cea25477ad0f

[14:06:09.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: just saw the ticket, excellent!

[14:06:45.0000] <wanderview>
oh yea.. forgot you reported that one :-)

[16:41:06.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: is there a canonical test suite for the URL standard, specifically for the parsing algorithm?

[16:41:42.0000] <othermaciej>
one of my planned hobby projects is to implement its parsing rules, but I might need to start by making a test suite

it really took me some time to find out that it has not moved around or something

[19:57:44.0000] <erlehmann>
because of software changes

[19:57:47.0000] <erlehmann>

Hixie_ where can i file bug?

[19:59:32.0000] <erlehmann>
i'll try to figure it out

"This is not enough quorum to discuss anything meaningful so we ended the call after 15 minutes."

[23:42:09.0000] <Ms2ger>
One wonders how it takes 15 minutes to figure that out

[00:33:23.0000] <ato>
Ms2ger: Maybe only non-meaningful things were discussed.

othermaciej: http://w3c-test.org/url/

[01:22:30.0000] <annevk>
ah, was just about to answer that :-)

[02:28:34.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: are you going to a do a blogpost on DNSSEC one day?

[02:31:34.0000] <foolip>
annevk: do you know which spec defines how Web browsers detect the encoding of text/plain input, i.e. the heuristic that looks for a UTF-8 BOM, valid UTF-8 sequences and that kind of thing?

[02:32:50.0000] <jgraham>
HTML, I imagine

[02:33:30.0000] <annevk>
foolip: currently we don't have sniffing for text/plain

[02:33:37.0000] <foolip>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#encoding-sniffing-algorithm seems relevant

[02:33:49.0000] <annevk>
foolip: if user agents employ sniffing for text/plain, that should probably be defined in HTML

[02:34:18.0000] <foolip>
I said text/plain because I'm interested in a good heuristic that isn't HTML-specific

[02:34:35.0000] <foolip>
for a non-Web, non-work thing

[02:34:56.0000] <annevk>
the current rules are only checking BOM for text/plain

[02:34:57.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: detecting the encoding of files loaded in Critic, in fact

[02:34:59.0000] <jgraham>
From a web-browser point of view text/plain is very like HTML

[02:34:59.0000] <annevk>
no hueristics

[02:35:56.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: Ah. Isn't the canonical solution there to use chardet, or something?

[02:36:18.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: dunno, molsson asked me and all I know is Web stuff :)

[02:36:23.0000] <jgraham>
Heh

[02:36:46.0000] <Ms2ger>
def detect_charset(content):

[02:36:51.0000] <Ms2ger>
    return "utf-8"

[02:37:13.0000] <foolip>
Ms2ger: that is a serious option, yes :)

[02:39:12.0000] <jgraham>
try: input.decode("utf-8"); except UnicodeDecodeError: review.add_issue("Your source is in the wrong encoding. Please use UTF8.")

[02:39:51.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: yes, or input.decode("utf-8", errors="replace") :)

[02:41:32.0000] <Ms2ger>
Nah, what jgraham said

[02:41:33.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: maybe. more likely if my domain experiences "DNSSEC suicide" for the third time...

[02:41:58.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: DNSSEC is probably the fourth post in my queue of blog post ideas

[02:42:51.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: ah shit, I just changed the Preface

[02:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(the three ahead of it are: "You should work on Firefox OS and self-hostable services if you want Software Freedom for phones", "You only need 3 or 4 ciphersuites" and "Character Encoding Menu in 2014")

[02:45:31.0000] <annevk>
those are all great, please take a week to write them :)

[02:46:28.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: very productive to try to use a religious snowclone to end a bikeshed about wordsmithing non-normative text not to be offensive

[02:47:19.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me appears to be missing context on that one

[02:47:58.0000] <hsivonen>

annevk: the new text is good. gives less rationale than my suggestion, but the less you say, the less text there is for people to complain about

[02:53:24.0000] <annevk>
I'll see about integrating some of it, the extra rationale is actually nice

[02:55:42.0000] <hsivonen>
now that I'm disillusioned about DNSSEC, maybe I should ask my ISP to support IPv6

[02:56:26.0000] <annevk>
Did you see http://tack.io/ btw?

[02:56:49.0000] <annevk>
Although https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/tack/2014-01/msg00001.html suggests it might be dead

[02:57:16.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I'm aware of TACK

[03:00:08.0000] <jgraham>
Wow, GitHub finally got side-by-side diffs

[03:01:10.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: you think it might work for replacing CAs?

[03:33:21.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: thanks!

[03:36:53.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: it seems to me that TACK still needs CAs for the first connection

[03:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: if you are looking for encoding permathreads to debate, Thunderbird just improved its encoding UI but shows both windows-1252 and iso-8859-1 as distinct items: https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/f2a455fd8e80

[04:08:34.0000] <JakeA>
Any indexeddb experts awake? If I have an index with two keys, say ['name', 'birthdate'], how do I open a cursor for a specific name but any birthday (but in birthdate order)

[04:08:46.0000] <JakeA>
?

[04:13:18.0000] <hsivonen>
it's been too long since I've paid attention to html5lib tests

[04:15:10.0000] <hsivonen>
please remind my what happened to the SVG filterRes attribute

[04:15:58.0000] <hsivonen>
html5lib explicitly tests for it *not* getting camelCased

[04:20:50.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. awesome. the html5lib test format has changed

[04:20:56.0000] <hsivonen>
that's why things are failing

[04:21:38.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Blame Hixie

[04:21:55.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: for test format or filterRes?

[04:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
Test format

[04:22:10.0000] <jgraham>
But maybe both! Who knows :)

[04:22:13.0000] <hsivonen>
/me blames Hixie

[04:29:59.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is quite unamused by the #script-on / #script-off stuff

[04:42:20.0000] <hsivonen>
/me finds https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=24900

[04:51:35.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. great. there are three other attributes that got un-camelCased

[05:06:57.0000] <caitp->
how about element names?

[05:47:56.0000] <Domenic>
I forget ... did anyone propose measuring DOMRectList.prototype.item usage to see if we can remove it in favor of Array?

[05:50:51.0000] <Ms2ger>
You did just now

[05:51:16.0000] <Domenic>
I don't want to re-propose it if someone already found a bunch of popular GItHub libraries using it...

[05:54:24.0000] <foolip>
Domenic: do you mean measuring ClientRectList.item in Blink?

[06:04:13.0000] <Domenic>
foolip: yeah

[06:06:54.0000] <foolip>
Domenic: I can make it so if the relevant spec editors want it. zcorpan?

[06:07:15.0000] <Ms2ger>
Make it sp

[06:07:16.0000] <Ms2ger>
so

[06:08:05.0000] <foolip>
Domenic: or are you already a Chromium/Blink committer?

[06:08:10.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: want what? nuke ClientRectList?

[06:08:24.0000] <Domenic>
foolip: I am definitely not a committer, although I really should start committing some stuff sometimes soon :)

[06:09:18.0000] <jgraham>
It's a little known fact that in his high school yearbook foolip was voted "Person most likely to go on to measure web platform feature usage"

[06:09:20.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan: whatever it is one does to make it Array-like I guess.

[06:10:06.0000] <Ms2ger>
zcorpan, yeah, nuke

[06:10:09.0000] <Ms2ger>
If possible

[06:10:18.0000] <Domenic>
zcorpan: the proposal on the table is to use-counter ClientRectList.prototype.item and if it's not used then DOMRectList can die in favor of plain old Array.

[06:10:35.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/geometry/#DOMRectList already has [NoInterfaceObject, ArrayClass]

[06:11:00.0000] <foolip>
interesting

[06:11:09.0000] <zcorpan>
it should make it array-like as i understand it but item() is still there

[06:11:13.0000] <foolip>
so is ClientRect and ClientRectList a WebKit-only thing?

[06:11:24.0000] <Ms2ger>
foolip, they got renamed

[06:11:31.0000] <zcorpan>
no it was Client* in the spec earlier

[06:11:55.0000] <Ms2ger>
It would be nice to go arraylike -> array

[06:12:03.0000] <foolip>
best outcome is adding DOMRect and then failing to remove ClientRect :)

[06:12:26.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: sure

[06:12:59.0000] <Domenic>
foolip: oh god now i am afraid that will happen :(

[06:13:21.0000] <foolip>
:)

[06:13:48.0000] <jgraham>
s/best/most likely/

[06:14:21.0000] <Ms2ger>
Gecko's already killed ClientRect

[06:15:12.0000] <foolip>
if you want to talk to someone with an actual clue about where Blink is going with these interfaces, jinho.bang⊙sc and Rik Cabanier seem to be the relevant people

[06:15:52.0000] <zcorpan>
i think i tried to research usage of ClientRect/ClientRectList and, iirc, there was some item() usage but people didn't rely on the name of the interface object

[06:15:59.0000] <foolip>
/me wishes "Gecko doesn't have X" would automatically count as justification for removing X

[06:16:40.0000] <Ms2ger>
Make it so

[06:18:23.0000] <foolip>
Here are a few silly things in that category: Event.srcElement, Event.cancelBubble, Window.offscreenBuffering, Document.charset, Document.defaultCharset

[06:18:52.0000] <foolip>
offscreenBuffering is my favorite, it's always true and enjoys ~0.2% usage

[06:19:14.0000] <Ms2ger>
Nice

[06:19:32.0000] <Ms2ger>
Sadly, browser sniffing makes that argument invalid :/

[06:19:52.0000] <foolip>
Indeed

[06:20:32.0000] <Domenic>
we should all copy IE11 Mobile's user agent string

[06:20:48.0000] <Domenic>
Or, perhaps more realistically, all desktop browsers should have the same UA string.

[06:21:43.0000] <zcorpan>
Domenic: it is indeed a race to the bottom, except there is no bottom

[06:21:44.0000] <Ms2ger>
Except that the first browser to copy another UA string disappears from statistics

[06:21:57.0000] <Domenic>
Ms2ger: oh, I didn't think of that :(

[06:22:37.0000] <Ms2ger>
And there's an argument to be made that statistics are a legitimate use case

[06:22:42.0000] <Domenic>
yeah

[06:23:08.0000] <jgraham>
Presumably statistics are the intended use case

[06:23:17.0000] <jgraham>
Otherwise wtf were they thinking?

[06:23:42.0000] <foolip>
when the UA string can't be trusted you get something equally horrible: https://github.com/zynga/core/blob/cd2a5e639a603d4d327fea57fa3bb6c3b554d5d0/src/core/detect/Engine.js

[06:24:03.0000] <foolip>
sorry Gecko, you don't get to remove XULControllers, whatever that is

[06:24:22.0000] <foolip>
although this one did have a fallback that may work, I don't know

[06:25:18.0000] <jgraham>
That sounds like a thing we tried to remove and couldn't because of UA detection

[06:25:49.0000] <foolip>
I found it because of WebKitPoint, a recent removal I'm hoping won't get reverted because of nonsense like this

[06:25:49.0000] <Domenic>
IE mobile' strategy is a nice try though, I must say. I love how on my phone simultaneously a bunch of sites looked a lot better, and a bunch of sites started offering "install app from the Google Play Store" buttons.

[06:30:03.0000] <Ms2ger>
foolip, yeah, we tried to remove it, there's a shim in its place

[07:29:59.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: baby steps, seems like

[07:47:16.0000] <zcorpan>
wait... standard markdown has processing instructions and CDATA blocks?

[07:50:54.0000] <jgraham>
?!

[07:53:37.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I guess "PIs" are for PHP

[07:54:07.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah. and CDATA for "XHTML" probably

[07:54:08.0000] <jgraham>
Because obviously using markdown to generate PHP to generate HTML is sensible

[07:55:31.0000] <jgraham>
Pretty sure that it should be a requirement that if you use either of those features the markdown processor will uninstall itself from your system, or refuse to grant you further access (if remotely hosted)

[07:56:35.0000] <caitp>
hah

[08:20:22.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie_: looking at web-apps-tracker, maybe we should drop google-gears and add blink? or is "opera" code for blink now? :-)

[08:25:19.0000] <Ms2ger>
Heh, google gears

[08:25:42.0000] <ondras>
q

[08:25:46.0000] <ondras>
oops typo.

[08:26:57.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i don't follow how web-apps-tracker works :-(

[09:08:52.0000] <Hixie_>
hsivonen: i believe i tried to get your feedback on all those issues, fwiw :-)

[09:11:35.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: what do you need guidance on?

[10:18:36.0000] <Sample>
/me thinks if anyone is trying to grab a filename from a file inputs value attribute their code -should- break/be inherently considered broken

[10:33:23.0000] <jgraham>
Sample: That's a fine thing to think, but if your bank is doing it, browsers change their behaviour, and you lose access to your account in a way that costs money, it feels like you aren't going to go "oh my bank had inherently broken code, so this is quite a reasonable outcome"

[10:44:13.0000] <Sample>
jgraham: yeah, unfortunately as well they had followed a specification at some point when they wrote that =/ sad

[10:44:21.0000] <Sample>
this must be the story of your guys' life

[11:15:52.0000] <caitp>
annevk, what if we had a way to do a better job of url resolution? like, a base content attribute for any elent, which if specified, would use a base tag with an appropriate id

[11:16:29.0000] <caitp>
(and by default, would use the first <base> tag in the document, or the usual url resolution procedure)

[11:17:57.0000] <caitp>
or maybe even automatically figuring out which base to use based on the element type or namespace or something

[11:20:19.0000] <caitp>
i'm just throwing ideas around, but it really sucks that you can only have one base that applies to all types of content :(

[11:28:11.0000] <annevk>
there was xml:base, but it was pretty terrible perf-wise and not really implemented well

[11:28:20.0000] <annevk>
in any event, you should start with use cases

[11:31:23.0000] <caitp>
well, the use cases are many, but there are some big ones --- SPA frameworks tend to give a second meaning to <base> tags, and unfortunately angular now requires it (the alternative was just too problematic for browsers that didn't support history), so people now have issues because they need to use one <base> for angular, and then have to specify all of their other content using fully qualified URIs

[11:32:00.0000] <caitp>
but I mean, I've had other use cases for it myself, like just generally needing to look for assets on a different domain while generally using the current domain and default base for everything else

[11:32:13.0000] <caitp>
fully qualified URIs kind of suck in case domain registration or other deployment details change

[14:02:10.0000] <mathiasbynens>
why is `<body id=b onload=b.innerHTML=1>` not equivalent to `<body onload=innerHTML=1>`? i’d expect both to set `document.body.innerHTML` to `1`

[14:02:25.0000] <mathiasbynens>
does the latter assign to `document.innerHTML` instead?

[14:07:37.0000] <Hixie_>
mathiasbynens: "this" in both cases is the global object (window)

[14:07:54.0000] <Hixie_>
mathiasbynens: so in the latter case you're doing window.innerHTML = 1

[14:09:38.0000] <mathiasbynens>
but for inline event attributes like that there are three ‘scopes’, right? the element itself, the parent form (if any), and the global object

[14:11:06.0000] <mathiasbynens>
for example, <p onmouseover=innerHTML=1>. does set the innerHTML of the `<p>` to `1` on hover

[14:11:27.0000] <Hixie_>
mathiasbynens: <body onload> (along with several other <body> event handlers) are special cases

[14:11:36.0000] <Hixie_>
mathiasbynens: in that they're not body's event handlers, they're window's event handlers

[14:11:48.0000] <Hixie_>
mathiasbynens: but since there's no <window> element, <body> acts as a convenience proxy for them

[14:12:05.0000] <Hixie_>
setting body.onload or <body onload> is equivalent to setting window.onload

[14:12:06.0000] <mathiasbynens>
ah, that explains it – thanks Hixie_!

[14:12:27.0000] <Hixie_>
note that this means you can't catch an event 'load' that bubbles through a <body> element with an onload handler

[14:13:01.0000] <Hixie_>
which leads to funny results when your markup is <html onload="t(event)"> <body onload="t(event)"> <div onload="t(event)"> and you fire a bubbling 'load' event at the div

[14:13:53.0000] <mathiasbynens>
hah

[14:44:01.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: is there a specific spec i should reference for display: newline? I'm update the <br> default stylings per our last conversation on the matter back in july

[14:45:02.0000] <Hixie_>
i guess i don't actually ref specs in the rendering section's style sheets actually

[14:46:26.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: hm, looks like 'display-box' has gone away

[14:46:36.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: what property should i use for br's newline behaviour?

[14:49:36.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: display-box changed name to box-suppress (but it's not what you want for newline)

[14:49:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: If you're going to assume it exists, it's a display-outside value.

[14:50:01.0000] <Hixie_>
k

[14:50:37.0000] <Hixie_>
do you want me to reassign the bug to you once i've done my side?

[14:50:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure.

[14:51:17.0000] <Hixie_>
k, will do. Thanks. If things change, feel free to reassign to me again.

[15:24:01.0000] <Hixie_>
does nobody yet implement hit regions on canvas?

[15:25:24.0000] <Hixie_>
i see bugs suggesting people have implemented it...

[15:26:22.0000] <Hixie_>
/me wonders what he's doing wrong

[15:26:32.0000] <Hixie_>
cabanier: didn't you implement hit regions in mozilla at least? i can't get it to work

[15:26:59.0000] <Hixie_>
i found a bug where you checked code in, and that was months ago

[15:27:04.0000] <Hixie_>
more than a release cycle, at least

[15:27:44.0000] <cabanier>
Hixie_: you need to turn it on in about:config

[15:27:53.0000] <Hixie_>
aah

[15:28:10.0000] <Hixie_>
is it still buggy?

[15:28:13.0000] <cabanier>
canvas.hitregions

[15:28:24.0000] <cabanier>
Hixie_: yes.

[15:28:27.0000] <Hixie_>
ah, ok

[15:28:49.0000] <Hixie_>
cabanier: do you know anything about clearHitRegions() ?

[15:28:53.0000] <cabanier>
Hixie_: I need to finish it but keep getting pulled away.

[15:29:04.0000] <cabanier>
Hixie_: I didn't implement that one yet

[15:29:12.0000] <Hixie_>
cabanier: like, why it was proposed? i'm trying to work out if it's something i should spec. i can't work out what it's for and nobody seems to implement it.

[15:29:22.0000] <cabanier>
ah

[15:30:20.0000] <cabanier>
Hixie_: the hit regions are not removed by drawing over them so there needs to be a way to remove them from the canvas

[15:30:39.0000] <Hixie_>
oh this is for people who just draw opaque stuff and never clearRect() ?

[15:31:11.0000] <cabanier>
yes

[15:31:38.0000] <Hixie_>
and it just clears the entire list?

[15:31:41.0000] <cabanier>
Hixie_: a clearRect on the entire canvas should have the same effect

[15:31:43.0000] <cabanier>
yes

[15:31:50.0000] <Hixie_>
fair enough

[15:32:09.0000] <Hixie_>
seems a bit blunt but i guess why not if people don't need to call clearRect()

[15:32:19.0000] <cabanier>
yeah

2014, where it's a search engine hunt just to figure out how to fix the bug where firefox doesn't bother to ask where you want to download a file

[17:31:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hello again.

[17:31:31.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Our family moved to Georgia over the weekend, and I had to stop work on the table sortable polyfill. Did someone else wrap it up or is it still needed?

[17:41:06.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hixie_: is there a table sortable polyfill?

[18:00:35.0000] <caitp>
there was almost a real implementation, almost ;) but it was not to be

[18:02:04.0000] <Hixie_>
JonathanNeal: not to my knowledge

[18:02:14.0000] <JonathanNeal>
caitp: how so?

[18:02:24.0000] <Hixie_>
JonathanNeal: but there's plenty of sortable table scripts, which is what the spec was based on

[18:02:41.0000] <caitp>
blink folks didn't like the idea of making it a core platform feature

[18:03:37.0000] <caitp>
gecko is slightly further along (in that they've got microdata which is tangentially used by the sorting api), but they haven't really started it either and it's not clear if they'd want to

[18:04:51.0000] <caitp>
i guess you could always ask ms2ger or someone if they'd be willing to let you implement in gecko

[18:09:18.0000] <caitp>
without an intent for having core implementations, it's not clear that a polyfill is any more meaningful than another sorting library --- but I guess the world could always use another sorting library, for when they decide they didn't like the previous one

[18:11:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yea, I made it almost as far as the complex magic that changes based on the kinds of elements you have, but Hixie gave me some great data to work with. If it’s okay for it to be public and there isn’t a test already, we should write a test.

[21:59:44.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i was checking if it would be trivial to fix https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26121 but i don't know what to do

[00:31:38.0000] <boogyman>
zcorpan: how do you define "changes" in the context of that report?

[00:32:24.0000] <zcorpan>
boogyman: commits for https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/picture-element/blob/gh-pages/source

[00:34:48.0000] <boogyman>
that appears as if it's documentation related to some specification, but not necessarily directly impacting the <picture> element (per se)

[00:54:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: so web-apps-tracker has a local git checkout and does its comparisons on that

[00:54:31.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: ok

[00:55:21.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: most of that logic is at the end, at the start it's formatting functions

[01:44:50.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: second commit in that GitHub blog post is Servo implementing a recent change to DOM

[01:45:38.0000] <annevk>
W3C DOM was last updated mid-April, so much for keeping it up to date

[01:56:03.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: I guess I should make the change for .bodyUsed and .json() etc. right?

[01:56:08.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: nobody commented on the thread

[01:57:51.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/445 needs your review

[02:01:19.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: I'm happy with the .bodyUsed changes

[02:01:26.0000] <JakeA>
Will read that thread now

[02:01:37.0000] <JakeA>
The ticket I mean

[02:02:22.0000] <annevk>
Thanks. I'll look into obsoleting FetchBodyStream now then. Should have a bit of time today and during the weekend

[02:43:40.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: should we have response.xml() so we don't regress on XHR

[02:43:46.0000] <JakeA>
Or does no one care?

[02:43:51.0000] <JakeA>
I don't know if I care

[02:43:57.0000] <JakeA>
XML is dead to me

[02:44:57.0000] <jgraham>
heh

[02:46:24.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: no, that's a layering violation

[02:46:47.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: at some point we might want an async XML parser API that takes a response

[02:52:29.0000] <jgraham>
Or we might "put XML out to pasture" (i.e. shoot it in the head and boil it's carcasds to make glue)?

[02:52:37.0000] <jgraham>
*carcass

[02:55:45.0000] <Jirka_>
There are many APIs which provide only XML, not JSON. And JSON is not the best format for all use-cases. So droping XML seems silly.

[02:58:22.0000] <JakeA>
jgraham: I approve of the glue approach

[02:58:52.0000] <Ms2ger>
Why not lasagna?

[02:59:38.0000] <JakeA>
Jirka_: there'll always be https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser

[03:00:14.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: where's the violation (not disagreeing, just curious)

[03:00:27.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: making Fetch dependent on XML

[03:00:51.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: JSON is arguably on that line too, but since it's built into JavaScript...

[03:01:12.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: also formData & blob?

[03:01:20.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: see a thread about adding asHTML() or some such on WHATWG a while back

[03:01:54.0000] <annevk>
there's even a note under FetchBodyStream explaining this

[03:04:01.0000] <JakeA>
gotcha

[03:10:58.0000] <Jirka_>
I understand layering doubts, but if there is asJSON(), having asDocument() for HTML/XML would be very convenient

[03:12:49.0000] <annevk>
I'm not inclined to reopen http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2014Jun/thread.html#msg72

[03:17:00.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: should fetch() do anything in particular if it's passed a request whose bodyUsed returns true?

[03:18:41.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: should reject

[03:18:57.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: it needs to read the body & can't

[03:19:19.0000] <annevk>
I guess that's fair, the alternative was to just assume the body was empty

[03:19:35.0000] <annevk>
but rejecting makes it prolly clearer you want to clone your Request first or some such

[03:20:06.0000] <annevk>
oh right, .clone()

[03:20:10.0000] <annevk>
sadness

[03:20:20.0000] <annevk>
this is going to be quite a bit of work

[03:20:53.0000] <JakeA>
Yeah, I'd rather every method that needs to read body rejects if the bodyUsed is true

[03:21:14.0000] <annevk>
ooh :(

[03:21:24.0000] <annevk>
fetch() is defined as invoking Request's constructor

[03:22:02.0000] <Jirka_>
annevk: fair enough, I missed that thread

[03:22:27.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: yeah, imagine .clone is tough to define, although I think this stuff is *huge* for the platform

[03:22:40.0000] <annevk>
well it's a huge hack :p

[03:23:03.0000] <annevk>
clone() should be okay, defining fetch() with less trickery might be hard

[03:23:14.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: got https://jakearchibald.github.io/trained-to-thrill/ working offline yesterday & it felt like THE FUTURE

[03:23:36.0000] <JakeA>
(in Chrome Canary anyway)

[03:25:00.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: so... you used to be able to do new Request(request, dict)

[03:25:43.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: that was basically clone(), with restrictions so you can't end up with privileged Request objects

[03:26:16.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: maybe we should just keep that as a way of doing a tee?

[03:30:55.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: new Request(request, dict) - it feels like this would exhaust bodyUsed

[03:31:22.0000] <annevk>
that seems fine too

[03:31:38.0000] <annevk>
and throws if bodyUsed is set?

[03:31:42.0000] <JakeA>
I prefer .clone, but I can live with new Request(request, dict) as a way to clone

[03:31:47.0000] <JakeA>
yeah

[03:31:57.0000] <annevk>
ah okay, that actually makes this change easier :-)

[03:32:08.0000] <annevk>
we'll leave clone() distinct

[03:42:52.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: I get the feeling this is all coming together nicely. Some bikeshedding needed with the cache API todo, but it's really getting there. Who'd have thought it.

[03:46:11.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: if I respondWith an opaque response to XHR, XHR should onerror. How do you want to do this? Should XHR reject the response it gets back, or should it be a fetch flag such as "requires-untainted-response"?

[03:46:40.0000] <JakeA>
So fetch would send back a network error to XHR

[03:46:55.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: my idea was that we'd update all APIs to deal with the new response primitive

[03:47:28.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: implementations however might prefer that flag variety, but it doesn't seem as nice

[03:47:49.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: works for me. Will feed that back into https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=411151

[04:36:58.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: jgraham: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/commit/a898f9a2941350aa625aa79b24673628ac2b2a8e

[04:38:44.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Nice

[04:42:11.0000] <annevk>
I called it a mixin, anticipating a matching IDL change

[04:55:17.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess now it's my turn to extend the html5lib test format

[04:56:44.0000] <hsivonen>
proposal: the line following #document-fragment can be prefixed with "svg " or "math " to indicate the non-HTML namespace of the context node

[04:57:12.0000] <hsivonen>
using space instead of colon is consistent with the format for expected test output

[04:57:17.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I suggested that just after you went afk when you discussed this before :)

[04:57:21.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: so +1 for that

[04:57:24.0000] <hsivonen>
and makes it possible to test names with colon

[04:57:30.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: ok. thanks

[04:58:05.0000] <gsnedders>
(or rather I suggested using a colon and zcorpan pointed out that's not what the expected format was, but as mentioned that was me misremembering it rather than anything else)

[04:59:21.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: lgtm

[05:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: thanks

[05:02:52.0000] <zcorpan>
i think #document-fragment is a bit cryptic but i guess it would be work to change it and people don't care

[05:03:11.0000] <zcorpan>
#context-element would be clearer

[05:04:25.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I'd prefer to avoid the churn of changing it

[05:04:49.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[05:25:10.0000] <hsivonen>
so fragment parsing turns off the foreign lands breakout weirdness

[05:25:34.0000] <hsivonen>
but the <p><table> thing still varies by quirks mode in fragment parsing

[05:47:30.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: \o/

[05:47:55.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: Regarding the XHR opaque response stuff, could you update the XHR spec? https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=411151#c4

[05:51:50.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: perhaps we should do this in Fetch...

[05:52:37.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: XMLHttpRequest's request mode is CORS or CORS-with-forced-preflight, so if the SW returns something that contradicts the mode, make it a network error

[05:53:02.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: respondWidth() could even error

[05:53:09.0000] <annevk>
respondWith()

[05:53:54.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: but a request to the same origin won't be CORS, it still needs to reject an opaque response

[05:54:05.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: mode is still CORS

[05:54:30.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: see http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-mode

[05:54:42.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: only a couple of APIs actually use the same-origin mode

[05:55:19.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: ohhh! I thought a same-origin XHR would be no-cors

[05:55:29.0000] <JakeA>
if it's CORS, then I agree, we can handle it all in fetch

[05:55:31.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: no, <img> is no-cors

[05:55:44.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: document.load() is same-origin

[05:55:52.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: <img crossorigin> is CORS

[05:56:10.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: file a bug on Fetch I guess, not sure I can fix it today

[05:56:29.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: Cool. I'd had the same idea as you but thought it wouldn't work because of local requests. Doh. That makes things a lot easier then.

[05:56:31.0000] <annevk>
I have an enormous backlog and I'm not actually supposed to be working

[05:56:42.0000] <JakeA>
no worries, not urgent

[06:09:48.0000] <Ms2ger>
zcorpan, around?

[06:10:20.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: for a few more minutes yes

[06:10:43.0000] <Ms2ger>
When POSTing to a data url with XHR, what should .status return?

[06:10:53.0000] <Ms2ger>
Or annevk ^

[06:12:40.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: dunno

[06:13:06.0000] <Ms2ger>
Alright, thanks

[06:24:59.0000] <Ms2ger>
(Figured it out)

[06:33:37.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: Fetch

[09:06:13.0000] <annevk>
jgraham+++++++

[09:06:21.0000] <annevk>
that might not actually work

[09:06:28.0000] <annevk>
jgraham+=10

[09:07:18.0000] <jgraham>
Heh

[09:07:28.0000] <jgraham>
I don't think the first one parses

[09:08:16.0000] <annevk>
I guess it's not the thought that counts when you hit a compiler error

[09:12:06.0000] <caitp>
would it be a bad thing to have a method of HTMLFormElement which assembles a FormData object automatically? that seems like a nice feature that people have already polyfilled a lot

[09:12:07.0000] <jgraham>
Certianly not from the point of view of the compiler :)

[09:12:29.0000] <caitp>
and pretty trivial to implement in a private script, for that matter

[09:13:53.0000] <jgraham>
caitp: Seems like a reasonable idea

[09:31:03.0000] <arunranga>
annevk, the underlying model of file reading now should be reusable by Fetch. The problems are in synchronous access in the API, but I think that’s a small difference; you should always use it asynchronously I think.

[09:33:05.0000] <arunranga>
Hixie_, there’s some ‘spec bugs’ to make ES’s function Realm reusable for script origin purposes. An example is: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1058470 which refers to https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26603 .

[09:40:50.0000] <annevk>
caitp: new FormData(<form>) does that

[09:53:04.0000] <caitp>
I suppose it does, but it doesn't do the rest of it

[09:54:41.0000] <caitp>
somehow things keep being done in weird ways in this platform rather than how you'd expect it to be done :)

[10:04:22.0000] <caitp>
like, suppose you wanted a list of VIN numbers parked in a given parking lot --- the `new FormData()` option is like going to the paper factory and asking them to create a set of papers containing vin numbers from <parking lot>, whereas my suggestion is more like asking the parking lot manager for a list of vin numbers in the lot

[10:04:31.0000] <caitp>
the first option is just totally backwards =)

[10:05:51.0000] <annevk>
no disagreement

[10:06:26.0000] <annevk>
I recommend reviewing APIs that are still in their infancy to make sure we don't make similar mistakes elsewhere

[10:11:25.0000] <smaug____>
hmm, which spec defines offsetTop these days?

[10:11:47.0000] <annevk>
smaug____: hasn't changed: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/

[10:12:31.0000] <smaug____>
thanks

[10:34:12.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie_ i have done an art (is there prior art?) http://news.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/bin/mimesniff.html

[10:34:41.0000] <erlehmann>
i need some algorithm to perform the pattern mask stuff in shell

[10:34:45.0000] <erlehmann>
have not figured that out

[10:34:51.0000] <erlehmann>
JonathanNeal how is your table sort going?

[10:41:28.0000] <Hixie_>
erlehmann: ?

[10:41:44.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie_ i have started implementing the mime sniffing in bourne shell.

[10:41:51.0000] <erlehmann>
are you aware of any other implementations?

[10:42:07.0000] <Hixie_>
i but what why why would you do that in a shell

[10:42:26.0000] <Hixie_>
browsers all implement some variant of that spec

[10:42:32.0000] <Hixie_>
but dunno how closely

[10:42:33.0000] <erlehmann>
my blog software, hipster news, is a shell script. its only dependency is busybox or coreutils

[10:42:38.0000] <erlehmann>
and file(1) is not among busybox

[10:43:19.0000] <erlehmann>
i thought it would be a good thing if i had a command line tool that matches what browser think

[10:43:22.0000] <Hixie_>
you wrote web-facing software using a shell script?

[10:43:31.0000] <Hixie_>
oh man, that's a security nightmare waiting to happen

[10:43:54.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie_ it is a *static site generator*

[10:43:57.0000] <Hixie_>
that amost beats the guy i know who wrote a functioning vt100 emulator in bash script

[10:44:05.0000] <Hixie_>
oh, static

[10:44:06.0000] <Hixie_>
ok

[10:44:12.0000] <erlehmann>
it is invoked from a git hook.

[10:44:13.0000] <Hixie_>
that's still crazy but far less so

[10:44:32.0000] <erlehmann>
http://news.dieweltistgarnichtso.net is regenerated every time i git push to one of its repositories

[10:44:47.0000] <erlehmann>
most files are html or plain text

[10:45:04.0000] <erlehmann>
but i am working on media support, so i can just throw binaries in there and make it do *the right thing*

[10:46:40.0000] <erlehmann>
whole blog software is 250 LOC and i aim for less.

[10:46:49.0000] <JonathanNeal>
erlehmann: haven’t worked on it since moving to Georgia!

[10:47:45.0000] <JonathanNeal>
But I got a chance to pull the project to my wife’s laptop last night, so now I can continue. I just wasted my time in specification, too, so I’m definitely ready to tinker. http://discourse.specifiction.org/t/extending-classlist-methods-to-allow-regexp/585/5

[10:47:48.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie_ people build static site generators in less than 100 LOC http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/colophon.html

[10:47:59.0000] <erlehmann>
the most complexity with mine is figuring out how to manage atom ids

[10:48:09.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I love specification, even though it’s way more dead now. I wish I could get paid just to play there.

[10:48:24.0000] <erlehmann>
i even have XSLT that creates HTML out of feed :3 http://news.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/bin.atom

[10:48:34.0000] <erlehmann>
but i have to go!

[10:51:49.0000] <Hixie_>
all the sites i write these days are just static data that communicates over websocket to a server somewhere

[10:52:12.0000] <Hixie_>
no static code generation, just static code :-)

It's like kids say the most embarassing things, but not kids

[13:14:05.0000] <Sample>
This w3c and whatwg civil war is crazy

[13:14:42.0000] <Sample>
this seems to have the ease of resolution as a religious conflict

[13:15:14.0000] <Hixie_>
there's not really a civil war

[13:15:26.0000] <Hixie_>
there's a bunch of people doing good work at both the w3c and whatwg

[13:15:40.0000] <Hixie_>
and then there's a small number of people at the w3c, copying the work from those at the whatwg, and publishing it at the w3c.

[13:15:54.0000] <Hixie_>
and a small number of people at the whatwg who are frustrated by this and asking for them to stop

[13:15:57.0000] <Hixie_>
that's pretty much it

[13:20:11.0000] <Sample>
okay, so long as the people who direct the small number of w3c people are in agreement with whatwg this sounds pretty non-problematic/resolveable

[13:20:42.0000] <Hixie_>
there are no people who direct the small number of w3c people in question

[13:20:45.0000] <Hixie_>
it's, like, the w3c ceo

[13:21:02.0000] <Sample>
that's an unusual hierarchy

[13:21:16.0000] <Hixie_>
what is?

[13:21:42.0000] <Sample>
employees of an organization with no organization

[13:22:20.0000] <Sample>
they just do whatever they please?

[13:23:19.0000] <caitp>
the political landscape of the web is probably too complicated to really accurately draw up in an irc conversation

[13:23:30.0000] <caitp>
or book

[13:27:48.0000] <Sample>
do members/employees of these organizations all work remotely? I presume there isn't a physical headquarters where everyone sits together in a cubicle all day

[13:29:25.0000] <Hixie_>
i'm confused

[13:29:33.0000] <Hixie_>
the w3c is a pretty normal organisation as far as this goes

[13:29:50.0000] <Hixie_>
they have a CEO and people who work for the CEO, and there's also people for other companies who work with them

[13:29:58.0000] <Hixie_>
those are the people who do the aforementioned copying

[13:30:28.0000] <Hixie_>
the WHATWG isn't an organisation in the same sense, it's just a bunch of people, most of which work for various companies, who work on specs in a common venue

[13:31:11.0000] <Hixie_>
these people all work On The Internet, some in similar locations as others, but spread all over the world

[13:31:20.0000] <Hixie_>
(except africa, mostly)

[13:31:28.0000] <Hixie_>
(and very few in south america)

[13:51:04.0000] <Sample>
btw someone should submit <something>/form-data to the IANA to at least allow people to start choosing to out out or migrate away from the specification breaking x- prefixed and overly verbose application/x-www-form-urlencoded that I suppose Tim Berners-Lee is responsible for

[13:51:17.0000] <Sample>
opt out*

[14:17:08.0000] <hober>
Sample: application/x-www-form-urlencoded is here to stay. why do you think we can move away from it?

[14:22:46.0000] <caitp>
speaking of things which are a bit underspecified, wouldn't it be great if the interpretation and serialization of query parameters were stronger --- or rather, if it existed at all? I mean sure a lot of webservers would do the wrong thing, but it would be just beautiful if there were an expected behaviour other than "make it work the way jquery does it"

[14:23:39.0000] <caitp>
heck, would make things easier for URLUtils too

[14:30:35.0000] <Sample>
hober: I do think we can, yes. the burdeon would only lie on those whose primary job is to ensure their webservers are standards compliant

[14:31:10.0000] <caitp>
deprecating things is hard :(

[14:31:24.0000] <caitp>
removing things is even harder :( it would be lovely if it were easier

[14:34:09.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: just imagine "x-" means "excellent-" instead of "experimental-"

[14:34:25.0000] <Sample>
x-www will never be removed but we can enable application developers to move away from it

[14:34:29.0000] <Sample>
lol

[14:39:23.0000] <hober>
why? what would moving away from it get them?

[14:39:34.0000] <caitp>
but in practice, clients aren't going to start sending whatever-new-mimetype unless servers understanding it, and servers aren't likely to start understanding whatever-new-mimetype unless clients send it

[14:39:43.0000] <Sample>
hober: standard compliance with the MIME spec? sanity?

[14:40:01.0000] <hober>
how is application/x-www-form-urlencoded not sane?

[14:40:10.0000] <Sample>
rehtorical question

[14:42:42.0000] <caitp>
you could also reframe http://xkcd.com/927/ to apply to this, for better or worse

[14:43:00.0000] <caitp>
if you were to consider a specific mimetype to be a "standard"

[14:45:05.0000] <Sample>
caitp is at least making a point. and that's totally true and understood. but if "Server X" values standards and does the likely simple implementation of understanding the new mime type in the same manner it understands the original, what's the loss

[14:46:03.0000] <Sample>
additionally those who write backends can now in a compliant manner opt to use something that seems less totally antiquated/accidental/incidental

[14:47:42.0000] <hober>
the loss is the engineering required to implement/test/etc a redundant value.

[14:48:00.0000] <Sample>
I'm not suggesting anything backwards incompatible. it's the same premise as a company developing an internal tool and using API's that don't exist in IE9, they are targeting towards modern implementation

[14:48:06.0000] <hober>
would this new media type actually do anything different than the one we already have? if not, there is no reason to mint it

[14:48:14.0000] <Sample>
it would absolutely not

[14:48:29.0000] <caitp>
the point being made is that it's pretty cosmetic

[14:48:54.0000] <Sample>
or that it offers the use of something compliant with the MIME spec

[14:49:05.0000] <Sample>
with extraordinary little overhead

[14:49:32.0000] <Sample>
purely opt-in

[14:50:23.0000] <hober>
i must be missing something

[14:50:25.0000] <Sample>
it's slightly odd to me that this is an issue of "good enough"

[14:51:53.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: standard compliance with the MIME spec is not a goal in and of itself. Standards compliance is a tool, the goal being interoperability. We have interoperability here (quite a lot of it, considering).

[14:51:59.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: also, re sanity... see /topic

[14:52:56.0000] <Sample>
we don't need an actual IANA approved and spec compliant mime type for this because what we have is "not bad enough". if it were x-IlllIlIlIl it would cross the threshold of "bad enough"

[14:53:45.0000] <caitp>
if anyone had the chance and ability to do so without negative consequence, they'd throw away the status quo and replace it with something that was well-designed and built to last, where nothing ever needed to be thrown away or replaced

[14:53:58.0000] <Hixie_>
it could x-\0\0\0 and be "good enough" -- the criteria isn't based on what hte name looks like, it's based on how interoperable it is.

[14:56:43.0000] <Sample>
I may totally be off basis and I value your guys judgements immensely. It is polish, I agree. But I don't think that righting this wrong is any more abusive than creating new APIs. They exist for a better future. In this case, it would be trivial to support

[14:57:46.0000] <hober>
synonyms are not zero-cost

[14:57:54.0000] <Sample>
I agree

[14:58:04.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: why is it a "wrong"

[14:58:24.0000] <Sample>
if no single web server implementer chose to support it it wouldn't matter

[14:58:48.0000] <caitp>
wouldn't it though? if clients were sending it?

[14:58:56.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: the x- prefix

[14:59:04.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: Why is the x- prefix wrong?

[15:00:06.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: it carries the implication it's not a standard type

[15:00:23.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: why is the implication that it's not a standard type a bad thing?

[15:01:07.0000] <Sample>
because it clearly is. there is a standard to that type. it should be recorded through IANA and documented as such

[15:01:18.0000] <Sample>
I didn't make up these rules =P

[15:01:36.0000] <caitp>
but it's cosmetic because people treat it as a standard type

[15:01:56.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: it's not clearly a bad thing. You think it's a bad thing. Others don't. Hence my question: why do you think it's a bad thing that there is an implication that this standard type is not in fact a standard type?

[15:03:45.0000] <Hixie_>
caitp: it _is_ a standard type. It's specced at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#application/x-www-form-urlencoded and was sent to the ietf/iana in http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-types/current/msg01711.html and is listed in http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml

[15:04:05.0000] <caitp>
yes, in spite of the implication

[15:04:11.0000] <caitp>
that is what I'm saying

[15:04:59.0000] <caitp>
although picking through the ietf cardboard boxes to find evidence of it, yikes :p

[15:08:23.0000] <Sample>
oh that's interesting, I didn't realize they accepted it as a standard and kept the prefix

[15:08:40.0000] <Hixie_>
(even if they hadn't it would change nothing to my argument)

[15:08:55.0000] <Hixie_>
my point is that standards don't matter

[15:09:02.0000] <Hixie_>
interoperability is what matters

[15:09:08.0000] <Hixie_>
standards are nothing but a tool to help that along

[15:09:24.0000] <Hixie_>
if we have interoperability, then the job of the standards is done

[15:09:37.0000] <Hixie_>
and any additional change could only lead us away from interoperability, which is a bad thing

[15:10:46.0000] <Sample>
I suppose Chrome could start only sending application/form-data headers on form submissions which only "Google Web Server" would accept but... seems rather far fetched =D

[15:11:01.0000] <caitp>
which brings up the point I mentioned earlier, why can't we have specific rules for serialization and interpretation of search queries in urls, because there are so many inconsistent and non-interoperable ways to do it ;-;

[15:11:11.0000] <caitp>
sigh, websites >:(

[15:12:22.0000] <Sample>
I write code that IE9 never knew about. Hell I can choose to write code that IE10 should have but didn't implement because it's more elegant. I should also be able to write a server knowing exactly what application will send to it that accepts a non RFC contradicting beautiful mime type

[15:12:33.0000] <Sample>
just my two cents. I realize that there is some seriously vehiment opposition to the notion

[15:12:56.0000] <caitp>
nah, tbh it's a friday afternoon, it's hard to be particularly vehement about anything

[15:13:38.0000] <caitp>
heck, still procrastinating on preparing for my conference talk in 2 weeks

[15:14:08.0000] <Sample>
hober will die on his sword before the day he seems a mime type that conforms to RFC 1521 as an alternative to the incidental original =P

[15:14:12.0000] <Sample>
sees*

[15:14:19.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: i'm just trying to understand why you think it's a bad thing that there is an implication that this standard type is not in fact a standard type

[15:14:53.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: bad is totally subjective. I'm trying to simply say that having a standard prefixed with an x- violates RFC 1521

[15:15:06.0000] <Sample>
that's my only argument

[15:15:31.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: ok. Why is having a type that violates RFC 1521 a "wrong" that needs to be righted?

[15:17:25.0000] <caitp>
> to indicate its non-standard status and to avoid a

[15:17:25.0000] <caitp>
   potential conflict with a future official name. --- maybe they should replace "indicate" with "connotate"

[15:17:37.0000] <caitp>
that would make everything better

[15:18:41.0000] <hober>
Sample: I will? Why does everyone always refer to my death in standards discussions?

[15:18:59.0000] <hober>
( this actually has happened more than once. e.g. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-admin/2014Feb/0062.html )

[15:19:57.0000] <hober>
I think the conclusion here is that 1521bis should allow application/x-www-form-urlencoded since it is interoperable.

[15:20:06.0000] <Hixie_>
the existence of that entire thread is such a sad reflection of humanity

[15:20:29.0000] <Sample>
lol

[15:21:25.0000] <Sample>
/me looks suspiciously at Hixie_'s trick question =P

[15:21:44.0000] <Sample>
did you ask why is violating the RFC considered a wrong that needs to be righted?

[15:21:49.0000] <Hixie_>
yes

[15:21:57.0000] <Sample>
it's like the philosophical dicussion of why is murder considered bad

[15:22:08.0000] <jgraham>
…

[15:22:13.0000] <caitp>
*headscratch*

[15:22:52.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: this implies that for you, standards-compliance is a goal in and of itself, with no ulterior motive. is that right?

[15:23:22.0000] <Sample>
bad is a violation of the law?

[15:24:07.0000] <Sample>
I get what you're saying though. The fact that it works supercedes the fact that it violates RFC

[15:24:28.0000] <Hixie_>
personally i'm saying the fact that it violates the RFC is literally of no consequence whatsoever.

[15:24:47.0000] <Sample>
Non-conformance with specs is totally okay

[15:24:53.0000] <hober>
it's only evidence that the rfc should be updated to reflect interoperable reality

[15:25:09.0000] <Hixie_>
sample: imho, conformance with specs is not a goal.

[15:25:10.0000] <hober>
specs that don't reflect reality are the most boring form of science fiction

[15:25:22.0000] <jgraham>
hober++ :)

[15:25:26.0000] <Sample>
that's cute =P

[15:25:43.0000] <jgraham>
Sample: hober is quoting something Hixie said some years ago I believe :)

[15:26:15.0000] <Hixie_>
i wish it had convinced more than like the four of you who hang out here regularly. :-P

[15:26:20.0000] <Sample>
I guess all I'm left ot wonder is how would adding a mime type which is both (subjectively) more sane and actually abides by the RFC going to cause a pandemic of interoperability

[15:26:35.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: it isn't. It will cause no benefit and minimal harm.

[15:26:43.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: but no benefit and minimal harm is still a net harm.

[15:27:05.0000] <Hixie_>
see also http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Where.27s_the_harm_in_adding.E2.80.94

[15:27:13.0000] <caitp>
unless nobody ever implemented it

[15:27:56.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: to put it another way. There's two ways we could fix this. We could add a new type, which requires changing a spec and multiple implementations, or, we could change the one spec that says x- is bad, which would require nothing but changing that spec.

[15:28:05.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: how do you determine which of these options is the better option?

[15:28:31.0000] <jgraham>
Well if no one ever implements something, someone wastes some time trying to specify it. Which could be a useful educational exercise. People possibly also waste some time deciding to not implement it, which probably isn't

[15:28:53.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: adding a new type would NOT require ANY implementations

[15:28:57.0000] <Sample>
it is simly an allowance

[15:29:27.0000] <Sample>
and you cannot change x- without causing serious problems to everyone who uses the header as intended

[15:29:33.0000] <caitp>
but if nobody was going to implement it, what would be the point in specifying it

[15:29:55.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: i'm not sure i understand your proposal exactly. Can you elaborate?

[15:31:41.0000] <Sample>
leave the glaring problem. leave the RFC as-is. admit the misake and the (necessary) violation. add application/form-data which is a content type with a standard expectation (defined in the HTML specification)

[15:32:01.0000] <Hixie_>
anyone know anything about the interaction of Exposed and Global in WebIDL? Do I really need to say Global=Foo,Exposed=Foo? Or does Global=Foo imply Exposed=Foo?

[15:32:06.0000] <Sample>
and we've given birth allowance

[15:32:07.0000] <Hixie_>
i can't tell from reading the webidl spec

[15:32:20.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: when you say

[15:32:23.0000] <Hixie_>
uh

[15:32:36.0000] <Sample>
to* allowance

[15:32:50.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: when you say "with a standard expectation", what is that expectation? like, what would it mean for someone to use this type? where would we see it?

[15:33:26.0000] <Sample>
in the same way that the ever evolving ECMAScript specification does. it allows you to use something more elegant, to fix mistakes, but it isn't necessary. and you must known your target

[15:33:37.0000] <Hixie_>
no i mean concretely

[15:33:40.0000] <Hixie_>
where would it be used?

[15:33:55.0000] <Sample>
if I use something new I must have a reasonable expectation that I know exactly what client will be consuming my work

[15:33:55.0000] <Hixie_>
is this a type a server sends to another server? a browser posts to a server? what?

[15:34:46.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: it doesnt matter

[15:35:05.0000] <caitp>
doesn't heycam sit in here?

[15:35:18.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: well if you want me to spec something it kinda matters that i know what you want me to spec

[15:35:29.0000] <caitp>
might be a good person to ask re: webidl confusion

[15:35:57.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: the standard expectation for application/form-data is the expectation of how the data will arive/can be parsed, as defined in the HTML specification

[15:36:23.0000] <Sample>
it doesn't matter how you use the content type, it's just a content type

[15:36:39.0000] <Sample>
there is no requirement "this must only be used by proxies"

[15:36:44.0000] <Sample>
or some such

[15:36:45.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: it matters if it's a type that browsers are required to send or a type that servers are allowed to send

[15:37:12.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: because if it's a type that browsers are required to send, then it's a non-backwards-compatible breaking change

[15:37:57.0000] <Sample>
does any mime type demand it's requirement? it's just a suggestion of how to understand the payload

[15:38:16.0000] <Sample>
there is of course absolutely no requirement the browers send it

[15:38:29.0000] <Hixie_>
well for example the x-www mime type we were talking about earlier is the type we require that browsers send when you do a form submission

[15:38:33.0000] <Sample>
it would be a terribly bad idea for them, I think the browser would immediately significant popularity =P

[15:39:09.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: is it really mandated somehow? or is it a suggestion for how to encode data

[15:39:12.0000] <Hixie_>
so if we're trying to provide a new type for x-www-..., and we require that browsers keep using the old x-www-... type, then the entire exercise is rather pointless

[15:39:20.0000] <Hixie_>
it is what the HTML spec requires

[15:39:30.0000] <Hixie_>
but more importantly

[15:39:36.0000] <Hixie_>
it's what's needed for interoperability

[15:41:58.0000] <Sample>
no I'm definitely not suggesting we're trying to do-away with the x-www

[15:42:07.0000] <Sample>
as I said leave the glaring problem. leave the RFC as-is. admit the misake and the (necessary) violation. add application/form-data which is a content type with a standard expectation (defined in the HTML specification)

[15:42:29.0000] <Hixie_>
so what are you suggesting? we introduce a new type that does nothing useful? (as in, since browsers never send it, and nobody else ever has a reason to send it?)

[15:43:00.0000] <Sample>
I would rephrase that to say, that does nothing new, yes

[15:43:24.0000] <Hixie_>
ok so what is the value here?

[15:43:45.0000] <Sample>
what is the value to being able to forEach a NodeList? old code doesn't need it

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie_>
i don't know. I'm not proposing that we be able to forEach a NodeList.

[15:44:01.0000] <Sample>
it's an allowance

[15:44:27.0000] <Hixie_>
an allowance to whom? we've just established that we're _not_ going to allow browsers to send it.

[15:44:30.0000] <caitp>
that has been proposed though (making HTML collections inherit from Array)

[15:44:32.0000] <Sample>
and I can decide to do something more properly or more elegantly. oops, we made a mistake. instead of forcing that upon you, here's an alternative. langauges do it all the time

[15:44:36.0000] <Hixie_>
there's nobody else who ever needs to send this type.

[15:44:54.0000] <Hixie_>
but you said we _should_ keep forcing the old type on browsers

[15:45:07.0000] <Hixie_>
i'm not understanding who this is an allowance for.

[15:45:43.0000] <Sample>
programmatic form submission

[15:45:49.0000] <Sample>
I'm obviously not talking about what the web browsers do

[15:46:24.0000] <caitp>
but if servers don't understand application/form-data, then the browser would have to translate it before sending

[15:46:35.0000] <Sample>
browsers use content types too, yes

[15:46:46.0000] <caitp>
and i'm not sure that would go over very well

[15:46:56.0000] <Sample>
caitp: I'm not suggesting browsers send anything but x-www (for a long while)

[15:47:12.0000] <Hixie_>
wait you want this type just so that one server can talk to another server? nothing to do with browsers?

[15:47:16.0000] <caitp>
you're saying "let people specify it programmatically" :z

[15:47:26.0000] <caitp>
which means that someone would have to translate it back in order to ensure that it's understood

[15:47:40.0000] <Sample>
yes, browsers use Content types, that's completely irrelevant to my discussion =P

[15:47:45.0000] <Sample>
they are ONE of the things that use content types

[15:47:57.0000] <Hixie_>
if you just want a new type for server-to-server communication, then (a) just go ahead and use the type, nobody else will be affected, and (b) if you want to register it, go ahead, nobody else will be affected :-)

[15:48:13.0000] <Sample>
lol okay

[15:49:07.0000] <Sample>
I forsee a world where we all rejoice knowing that we've enabled a more beautiful future some fine day, far, far away =P

[15:49:40.0000] <caitp>
that's what they said when they invented top 40 radio, and look how that turned out

[15:49:49.0000] <Sample>
whatwg doesn't think only through the lens of a web browser do they? =P

[15:49:54.0000] <Sample>
especially when it breaks nothig a web browser does

[15:50:21.0000] <caitp>
well there's a distinction between the internet and the world wide web, I guess

[15:51:12.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: having two types to do the same thing is not more beautiful than having one, imho :-)

[15:51:32.0000] <caitp>
but what if it were a rainbow of seven types

[15:51:46.0000] <caitp>

Plus you never actually reach the beautiful future because more cruft accumulates as you try to get there

if you won't believe us, believe this season's doctor who opener. there is no promised land.

[15:54:12.0000] <Sample>
I think enabling a compliant choice of beauty outside the realm of the browser is better than a mandate of (what is liekly subjectively agree'd upon) ugly

hey guys I can't save the world but I can pick up some litter and hope that we at least do that much in the face of a chaotic world =P

[15:55:45.0000] <hober>
i don't think that analogy works. a better analogy is that minting a redunant type is littering

[15:56:00.0000] <hober>

https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/create surely if obama says to do it, everyone will have to do it

[15:56:19.0000] <jgraham>
Even if you think this is a real improvement, it seems hard to justify putting any effort at all into fixing it giving how many more serious issues there are for the internet in general and the web in particular

[15:56:43.0000] <Sample>
jgraham: that's my point, like Hixie said, there isn't any effort involved. I should just submit it to IANA (somehow)

[15:56:54.0000] <caitp>
(how is the webmata petition coming? that was an amusing one)

[15:57:04.0000] <jgraham>
Well the oppertunity cost of this conversation is non-zero

[15:57:33.0000] <Sample>
jgraham: agreed! feel free to move onto more important matter at any time =)

[15:58:20.0000] <Sample>
i was just curious to poll you guys on this topic

[15:58:42.0000] <caitp>
https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/help-fund-new-w3c-distributed-web-webmata-wwwwebmataorg/P0THLXWH still sitting at just one signature, aww

[15:58:51.0000] <Sample>
my other form suggestions went over very well =P

[15:59:18.0000] <tantek>
/me perks up at "distributed web"

[15:59:34.0000] <tantek>
/me notes http://www.webmata.org/ …. is a PDF. #dogfoodfail

[15:59:45.0000] <caitp>
I'm pretty sure it was created as a joke

[15:59:54.0000] <caitp>
because the authors signature is just too suspect

[16:00:06.0000] <tantek>
"Furry Baby Boo" ?

[16:00:28.0000] <tantek>
perhaps this is one of those machine-generated papers

[16:01:28.0000] <tantek>
where's the button to "Report Petition as fake" ?

[16:02:18.0000] <caitp>
do they have one? i'm not sure anyone at the whitehouse actually moderates or reads the petition site at all

[16:02:31.0000] <caitp>
or in DC, or in the country

[16:26:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, wow. That webmata thing... It's like a Markov Babbler, but just sensical enough to have clearly been written by a real person.

[16:26:37.0000] <TabAtkins>
It trips all of my "schizophrenic crackpot" alarms, though.

[19:26:28.0000] <erlehmann>
mimesniff now can into text/html http://news.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/bin/mimesniff.html

[19:26:39.0000] <erlehmann>
regarding features, it is only missing the bitmask.

[19:26:45.0000] <erlehmann>
anyone having an idea how to do this in shell?

[21:21:05.0000] <terinjokes>
Domenic: should I bother IDLing any of this?

[21:21:23.0000] <terinjokes>
getting the hang of the document formatting

[21:21:56.0000] <caitp->
console is an interface, so you probably do want to IDL it

[21:22:23.0000] <terinjokes>
wonder if my choice of "any" for most of the arguments is acceptable

[21:33:34.0000] <terinjokes>
and does specifying a type as "array of arrays" even make sense?

[21:50:20.0000] <terinjokes>
(i ask because it doesn't seem possible to inlcude such a thing)

[21:56:20.0000] <caitp->
you might be able to do (type[])[]

[21:56:30.0000] <caitp->
I'm not sure if anyones idl compilers would need updates for that

[21:56:57.0000] <caitp->
well

[21:57:01.0000] <caitp->
it would be a syntax error i think

[22:00:28.0000] <terinjokes>
also thinking about other ways to write out the IDL

[22:03:57.0000] <caitp->
in blink, the idl uses extended attributes that don't exist in the spec, but it's probably the only way you can really do it

[22:14:40.0000] <terinjokes>
yeah, i'd noticed the extended stuff when hunting down docs

[00:31:24.0000] <annevk>
terinjokes: yeah, for the console API I expect most of it to take any

[00:31:52.0000] <annevk>
caitp-: http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#application/x-www-form-urlencoded is the query format

[00:32:32.0000] <terinjokes>
annevk: yep, that's what i've got so far

[00:32:51.0000] <caitp->
that's not "the query format", because it leaves many things unspecified (which is where the whole "jQuery style vs PHP vs ...." nonsense comes from, which is driving me crazy on bug trackers and why am I still awakeohgod)

[00:33:18.0000] <annevk>
terinjokes: what's mostly important about this API spec is that it clarifies what kind of methods are exposed

[00:33:19.0000] <caitp->
rules for interpreting things like repeated query strings, or query[], or query[a], etc

[00:33:29.0000] <caitp->
that stuff is all totally unspecified anywhere

[00:33:32.0000] <annevk>
caitp-: there are no rules for those

[00:33:38.0000] <annevk>
caitp-: that's application-layer stuff

[00:33:39.0000] <caitp->
exactly, and that is what sucks

[00:33:43.0000] <annevk>
meh

[00:34:14.0000] <caitp->
for one thing if there were rules, URLUtils's search object would be a lot more useful

[00:43:34.0000] <Ms2ger>
   if (navigator.userAgent.match('Gecko/(\\d+)') && RegExp.$1 == '20060217' && RegExp.$1 != '00000000') {

[00:43:37.0000] <Ms2ger>
Guess the site

[00:48:27.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: google.com

[00:49:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
Actually, the live dom viewer

[00:49:20.0000] <annevk>
Now I'm curious :-)

[00:50:39.0000] <annevk>
I don't really see what difference that causes

[00:51:28.0000] <Ms2ger>
Oh, I guess the tree view styles were really broken in Gecko back then

[06:51:18.0000] <erlehmann>
i think i understand the pattern mask

[06:51:20.0000] <erlehmann>
>>> chr(0x41), chr(0x61), chr(0xDF & 0x41), chr(0xDF & 0x61)

[06:51:20.0000] <erlehmann>
('A', 'a', 'A', 'A')

[06:51:47.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie_ is the mime sniff algorithm normative or descriptive? i may be trying to detect text/tab-separated-values

[06:53:39.0000] <erlehmann>
oh, you are not the current editor

[06:53:51.0000] <erlehmann>
whom of you is Gordon P. Hemsley <me⊙go>?

[06:54:07.0000] <erlehmann>
anyone knows why the mp4 matching is so weird? http://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#signature-for-mp4

[07:31:34.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: dude, https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/508258170398343168 is so true

[07:31:48.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: one of the reasons I'm afraid of background updates going wrong

[07:32:18.0000] <JakeA>
G+ did the same until a couple of months ago

[07:32:21.0000] <annevk>
erlehmann: don't do MP4 :-)

[07:32:30.0000] <JakeA>
I guess it's still an area of UX newness

[07:32:32.0000] <annevk>
erlehmann: algorithms are meant to be normative however

[07:32:47.0000] <JakeA>
(my trains demo did it too, just fixing it up now)

[07:33:26.0000] <erlehmann>
annevk i probably will not do mp4, yes. do you have any idea how to do the bitmasking in shell script, btw? http://news.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/bin/mimesniff.html

[07:33:33.0000] <erlehmann>
thx

[07:34:31.0000] <erlehmann>
“Hey I've got some new data, you're probably not reading the stuff currently on screen right?" *replaces everything*” is one of the reasons i seldom allow js for social media sites

[07:35:24.0000] <erlehmann>
whomever came up with that (and infinite scrolling, hey, lets allocate memory forever) needs to be subjected to the savage beatings antipattern

[07:36:40.0000] <annevk>
erlehmann: I can recommend stackoverflow :-)

[07:37:43.0000] <erlehmann>
standard stackoverflow or common stackoverflow? ;----DDDDD

[07:37:57.0000] <erlehmann>
they should rename it to common stack!

[07:43:42.0000] <Ms2ger>
Tsk tsk

[07:43:48.0000] <Ms2ger>
We don't condone violence here

[07:53:32.0000] <erlehmann>
Ms2ger http://cssquirrel.com/blog/2012/10/01/the-savage-beatings-anti-pattern/

[07:53:34.0000] <erlehmann>
;)

[10:55:58.0000] <erlehmann>
mimesniff(1) can now do pattern masking http://news.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/bin/mimesniff.html

[10:56:14.0000] <erlehmann>
i must admit it is a bit slow

[11:48:32.0000] <Ms2ger>
Is that seriously written in shell?

[12:14:24.0000] <Ms2ger>
Nice: http://www.w3.org/mid/E1XPZQR-0002NO-U7⊙di

[12:41:09.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
does the whatwg or w3c define html5 spec?

[12:41:41.0000] <boogyman>
neither, because there is no "HTML5"

[12:43:37.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
there's just HTML as far as whatwg is concerned?

[12:44:18.0000] <boogyman>
HTML is a living document.

[12:44:49.0000] <caitp>
people do call it html5 though, whether they're talking about 2009 or 2015

[12:45:37.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
w3c thinks that there's an html5 tho

[12:49:24.0000] <Ms2ger>
The W3C HTML5 and 5.1 documents are both more and less out-of-date forks of the HTML Living Standard

[12:51:17.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
cool

[12:51:25.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
well, not cool, but thanks for the info :)

[12:51:44.0000] <Ms2ger>
Np

[12:57:03.0000] <smaug____>
caitp: "html5" is a buzzword and under that term there are plenty of other specs than just HTML. All the CSS stuff and XHR etc.

[12:57:32.0000] <caitp>
that's how the public recognizes it

[12:57:35.0000] <smaug____>
(mostly thanks to Google's pr )

[12:58:06.0000] <caitp>
and it's perfectly fair, because you're seldom going to see one without the other

[13:03:26.0000] <smaug____>
yeah, I guess so

[13:04:35.0000] <smaug____>
it is just confusing to have HTML5 spec, HTML spec, HTML 5.1 and then the HTML 5 which contains more than just HTML


2014-09-07
[17:06:23.0000] <JonathanNeal>
smaug____: well if they frustrate you, write your own.

[17:08:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
WYSIHTML Spec

[17:30:40.0000] <chrisdickinson>
has the CSS subject selector syntax been dropped? (summarized here, http://css4-selectors.com/selector/css4/subject-of-selector-with-child-combinator/ for lack of a better link)

[05:18:36.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie_: can haz *.html5.org SSL certificate?

[05:19:08.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I have to do that I think

[05:19:17.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: oh, okay. are you up for it?

[05:19:40.0000] <annevk>
I was planning on looking into StartSSL about now, but got distracted by something

[05:19:43.0000] <mathiasbynens>
specifically i have some tests are use the data in http://mathias.html5.org/data/unicode/, and i’d like them to work over HTTPS

[05:19:45.0000] <Ms2ger>
Anything there we shouldn't move to whatwg.org?

[05:20:42.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: there's a whole bunch of personal sites hosted there

[05:21:28.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: makes sense, I'll have a look

[05:22:10.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: ta!

[05:28:05.0000] <Domenic>
yay ssl

[05:28:26.0000] <Domenic>
chrisdickinson: it's become :has, which is equivalent in capability

[05:28:28.0000] <annevk>
Hmm, private key generation doesn't work in e10s

[05:28:54.0000] <Domenic>
chrisdickinson: also, last I heard from TabAtkins,  it will be implemented in stylesheets, not just in querySelector, yay!

[05:30:21.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: yeah there’s a bugzilla ticket for that iirc. opera has a similar issue

[05:31:06.0000] <annevk>
I hope they let me try this again in a window without e10s

[05:31:47.0000] <annevk>
looks like it

[05:38:22.0000] <annevk>
okay, so for this to work I have to make email addresses work

[05:43:00.0000] <mathiasbynens>
oh, right

[05:46:12.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: feel free to keep pinging me about this

[06:04:41.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I saw you hadn't blogged yet about your TLS transition

[06:04:44.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: in the works?

[06:05:32.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: didn’t plan to write about it – it was easier than expected

[06:11:59.0000] <annevk>
One thing that's unclear to me is how this works with content. Does DreamHost automatically mirror?

[06:12:17.0000] <annevk>
And then it's up to me to add redirects for non-TLS traffic plus HSTS?

[06:12:46.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: you basically tell Apache to listen on port 443 as well, and for each virtualhost (if you have more than one) point it to the cert + private key

[06:13:08.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: that last part is super easy

[06:13:15.0000] <mathiasbynens>
let me know if i can help with the Apache setup

[06:13:56.0000] <annevk>
I don't think I have direct Apache access, but DreamHost provides configuration per wiki.dreamhost.com/Secure_Hosting#Purchasing_a_Signed_SSL_Certificate but does not detail how it affects content

[06:14:17.0000] <annevk>
In any event, I'm still waiting for DNS propagation so email can work...

[06:16:32.0000] <mathiasbynens>
oh, I see

[06:16:51.0000] <mathiasbynens>
well each host can just do something like this in `.htaccess`:

[06:16:54.0000] <annevk>
Hmm, e10s address bar copy-and-paste :(

[06:17:23.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=13333337; includeSubDomains" env=HTTPS

[06:17:24.0000] <mathiasbynens>
RewriteEngine On

[06:17:24.0000] <mathiasbynens>
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off

[06:17:24.0000] <mathiasbynens>
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://foo.html5.org%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]

[06:18:46.0000] <annevk>
Is includeSubDomains needed if there are none?

[06:18:57.0000] <annevk>
I guess there's pretty much always www, so yes

[06:19:41.0000] <annevk>
Hmm, if you let DreamHost take care of that www to non-www redirect, they probably won't include that header. So you'd have to do that yourself perhaps...

[06:19:51.0000] <mathiasbynens>
`includeSubDomains` should be the default; not cool to have HTTPS only for one subdomain but not the others

[06:20:05.0000] <annevk>
Well I have some domains without subdomain.

[06:20:27.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: but then still you want them to get HTST

[06:20:41.0000] <mathiasbynens>
in case someone accesses foo.domainwithoutsubdomain.com

[06:20:57.0000] <annevk>
That would not resolve in DNS

[06:22:13.0000] <mathiasbynens>
…but it might in a MitM attack scenario

[06:22:30.0000] <annevk>
Good point

[06:22:33.0000] <mathiasbynens>
with HTTPS/HSTS that risk is avoided

[06:22:50.0000] <annevk>
They should have made that flag an opt out

[06:22:54.0000] <annevk>
Bad protocol design

[06:42:55.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie_: whatwg.org has a valid SSL cert, but most of its pages contain mixed content e.g. https://www.whatwg.org/specs/

[06:43:34.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie_: also sub-subdomains present a (different) default-Dreamhost cert that triggers a warning, e.g. https://url.spec.whatwg.org/

[06:44:10.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie_: anything we can do to help fix these issues?

[07:02:43.0000] <annevk>
Mike West is also interested in helping out I think

[07:11:53.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: does generating a private key generally take a long time?

[07:12:04.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: was picking a 4K key length a mistake?

[07:12:36.0000] <Ms2ger>
Yes and no

[07:13:05.0000] <annevk>
I've been waiting a couple of minutes on this website now I think, I guess I can just leave it open

[07:13:17.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: just create it yourself

[07:13:21.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: `openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private-encrypted.key 2048`

[07:13:50.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free#generating-the-certificate is more or less how i did it

[07:15:27.0000] <annevk>
that goes a lot quicker

[07:21:19.0000] <annevk>
however, startssl is still slow

[07:31:11.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: so I hit a problem

[07:31:18.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I can only get this for one subdomain

[07:31:35.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I need to be class2 to make this work for html5.org

[07:35:03.0000] <annevk>
ok, so that's USD 60

[07:36:51.0000] <mathiasbynens>
yep, *.domain.ext certs are not free :(

[07:37:30.0000] <annevk>
i'll start the process for that, why not

[07:38:57.0000] <annevk>
"The documents should be of high quality and high resolution, but not exceed 1400 x 1400 pixels and weigh less than 1 MB." geez

[07:42:16.0000] <mathiasbynens>
sorry for putting you through this, annevk :P

[07:44:26.0000] <annevk>
this UI is terrible

[07:53:39.0000] <annevk>
I guess I'll wait with anything until they verified me so I only have to do this every two years

[07:56:58.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: I don't know if this is feasible, but perhaps you could switch the whole TLS business for whatwg.org over to me so I can get us new certificates every two years.

[07:57:45.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: that way only one of us has to do this personal verification dance and since I'm already doing it, you don't have to bother. The only problem I see is that you already tied the whatwg.org domain to you. I'm not sure how strong of a tie that is.

[08:21:47.0000] <annevk>
So, passport and identity card or driver license; then either utility bill plus 5-10 days waiting for a letter or phone bill

[08:21:59.0000] <annevk>
I'm trying out if my phone contract works since I don't have a bill

[08:42:18.0000] <annevk>
And it didn't, because it lists the number from before they changed it back to my prepaid...

[08:45:52.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: this means we have to wait 5-10 business days

[08:55:27.0000] <Garbee>
Does anyone know if a fieldset element is actually supposed to have its name submitted with the form? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#the-fieldset-element

[08:55:46.0000] <Garbee>
I am not seeing the behavior in any browser, yet MDN and WPD both state that it should be submitted with the form.

[08:56:39.0000] <annevk>
Garbee: I recommend updating MDN

[08:57:12.0000] <annevk>
Garbee: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#category-submit

[08:57:31.0000] <Garbee>
ah! Thanks.

[08:57:56.0000] <Garbee>
I was looking over another section it looks like. Actually outlining what engines should do on submission.

[09:01:29.0000] <Garbee>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#dom-form-elements

[09:01:29.0000] <annevk>
That specifically defines the <form>.elements API

[09:01:29.0000] <Garbee>
I'll update WPD then, I don't have a MDN account nor do I care to make one just for one edit.

[09:01:30.0000] <annevk>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#concept-form-submit is the submission algorithm

[09:01:30.0000] <annevk>
Which uses the link I gave to determine what elements to construct form data from

[09:01:30.0000] <Garbee>
Sweet, thank you for the help!

[09:01:30.0000] <annevk>
WPD is still alive?

[09:01:30.0000] <annevk>
/me thought people gave up on that

[09:02:06.0000] <Garbee>
People just forget about it apparently.

[09:02:36.0000] <Garbee>
I talk about in in rooms from time-to-time, and there is always someone who doesn't know what it is. Then you tell them, and they are amazed. Three weeks later, oh they've forgotten again.

[09:06:46.0000] <annevk>
It would be nice if StartSSL just gave me a domain if they already verified an allowed email for the domain

[12:19:15.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: they're sending the letter tomorrow, but no idea whether it needs to come from the US or Isreal or how long that'll take, I guess 5-10 business days...

[12:20:02.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: gah

[12:48:50.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: let's blame it on Orange for not giving me a proper contract or not sending me a bill in time

[12:48:57.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: damn operators

"My same thoughts on "break the web" ... I think whoever put "use strict" in there would eventually never expect the `this` to be the global context." (on es-discuss)

[00:11:39.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: that guy routinely suggests breaking the web

[00:13:25.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: Web Platform Test integration with Gecko testing seems awesome. Thank you!

[00:22:28.0000] <annevk>
I wonder what simon.html5.org hosts that is so popular. 20GiB of bandwidth. philip.html5.org reaches 80GiB

[00:22:39.0000] <annevk>
html5.org itself meanwhile is at 23

[00:24:04.0000] <annevk>
dom.spec.whatwg.org is at 4

[01:33:22.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Great!

[02:15:27.0000] <Domenic>
zcorpan: yes, every message from that poster makes me question my subscription :(

[02:26:19.0000] <annevk>
krijnhoetmer: can haz /irc-logs in TLS?

[02:41:46.0000] <annevk>
mounir: did you just go back to my original strawman for sensor API design?

[02:41:52.0000] <annevk>
mounir: that thread went full circle fast

[02:42:43.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: It seems my blog.whatwg.org account is still jgraham⊙oc Can you fix it (or vend me a new account?) It seems like a good time to do a testing status update. For all 6 readers of the whatwg blog.

[02:43:10.0000] <Domenic>
it'd be cool to have more posts on the blog

[02:43:20.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: I'll have a look

[02:45:12.0000] <mounir>
annevk: not really

[02:45:30.0000] <mounir>
annevk: I just pointed an alternative

[02:45:53.0000] <mounir>
annevk: I thought the Rick W. was championing your proposal actually

[02:46:04.0000] <annevk>
he mocked it on Twitter

[02:46:09.0000] <mounir>
annevk: I think your proposal or Tim's are sensitive

[02:46:13.0000] <jgraham>
Domenic: Yeah, I guess we just need to wait until blogging becomes retro-cool

[02:46:28.0000] <mounir>
annevk: he did a mock of the proposal in 140 characters?

[02:47:19.0000] <annevk>
mounir: https://twitter.com/rwaldron/status/504355208315830272

[02:48:28.0000] <mounir>
annevk: oh, I thought that he mocked the fact that I pointed to the same thing as an alternative

[02:48:45.0000] <mounir>
annevk: note that without the mocking part I agree with him - as pointed in my email -

[02:49:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm no longer following

[02:49:01.0000] <mounir>
annevk: it's probably a bit painful to only expose an async api

[02:49:04.0000] <annevk>
But I'm not sure I need to

[02:49:17.0000] <annevk>
Oh man, WordPress updates...

[02:49:19.0000] <mounir>
annevk: did you look at Tim's proposal?

[02:49:54.0000] <annevk>
Yeah, but it didn't seem so nice

[02:50:05.0000] <annevk>
It has a factory design

[02:50:23.0000] <mounir>
how so?

[02:50:35.0000] <annevk>
getDeviceOrientationSensor()

[02:51:37.0000] <mounir>
annevk: it's not really a factory design if you return a very specific type out of it ;)

[02:51:54.0000] <mounir>
annevk: I hear your concern but it's only cosmetic to me

[02:52:24.0000] <annevk>
That's what C++ API designers say about JavaScript APIs too :-P

[02:53:40.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: hoppipolla?

[02:54:34.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: I went with that

[03:01:26.0000] <darobin>
wow, that became a meme fast!

[03:03:01.0000] <mounir>
darobin: a meme feast?

[03:03:12.0000] <darobin>
heh

[03:03:36.0000] <darobin>
there clearly is someone sitting on this channel and bored at a meeting — I suspect a CSS meeting :)

[03:03:51.0000] <mounir>
it can't be sgalineau

[03:04:20.0000] <darobin>
it can't be either sgalineau nor hober

[03:04:48.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Yeah

[03:05:29.0000] <hober>
/me whistles tunelessly

[03:06:05.0000] <annevk>
heh

[03:06:41.0000] <hober>
hello from sophia antipolis!

[03:07:20.0000] <TabAtkins>
hober: Your meme unfairly credits that line to annevk, when it was mounir.

[03:07:38.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: you're not reading it correctly

[03:07:49.0000] <mounir>
TabAtkins: I think anne is credit

[03:07:58.0000] <mounir>
... is credited what he should be credited

[03:08:38.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Hm, I guess so.  It's not super-clear, but I get it when I read it sufficiently closely.

[03:13:34.0000] <darobin>
you can't just read w3cmemes quickly like that TabAtkins

[03:13:40.0000] <darobin>
it requires exegesis

[03:13:59.0000] <TabAtkins>
I REFUSE TO EXPEND CRITICAL THOUGHT ON MEMES

[03:14:36.0000] <Domenic>
this article on google's sha-1 deprecation is really good https://konklone.com/post/why-google-is-hurrying-the-web-to-kill-sha-1

[03:23:57.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: 80GB over what time period?

[03:27:57.0000] <eto>
hello

[03:28:30.0000] <annevk>
Philip`: monthly

[03:28:43.0000] <annevk>
Philip`: it's not really a big deal btw, was mostly surprised

[03:29:23.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Seems a lot higher than I would expect too

[03:29:36.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe someone found the pirated movies I stored on that domain

[03:39:18.0000] <mathiasbynens>
for simon.html5.org it’s probably due to people ironically hotlinking http://simon.html5.org/valid-html5.png

[04:41:12.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a newbie guide for submitting html5lib-tests pull requests the Right Way?

[04:43:38.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: ^^

[04:43:39.0000] <Ms2ger>
hsivonen, I assume the same process as web-platform-tests

[04:45:06.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, same process, but to html5lib-tests rather than web-platform-tests mostly

[04:46:17.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: so 1) fork repo on github, 2) pull your own fork, 3) create a branch in the local repo, 4) commit changes to branch, 5) ???

[04:46:27.0000] <aleray>
hi, is this valid html? http://jsfiddle.net/pef48j5e/

[04:46:53.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: 5) Press the "create pull request" button in the GitHub UI

[04:47:10.0000] <aleray>
I want some content to be "centered and sized", and some other content to take the full width of the viewport

[04:47:14.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: OK. Should there be squashing before that?

[04:48:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Starting with a single commit is better, unless it's clearly logically seperate commits. Please don't squash after the initial submission though

[04:48:13.0000] <jgraham>
(it upsets the code review tool)

[04:48:28.0000] <hsivonen>
my understanding of the lifetime of feature branches in the PR-based workflow is still hazy

[04:48:40.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: ok. that differs from the Gaia guideline

[04:49:06.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: If you don't want to fork, you are welcome to have access to the main repo to push your branch

[04:49:29.0000] <jgraham>
This is better in several ways (notably that other people can more easilly push commits to fix review issues)

[04:49:31.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: thanks. that kind of thing is why I haven't learned the PR-based workflow :-)

[04:50:40.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: It's still a PR-based workflow

[04:50:49.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: oh

[04:50:57.0000] <jgraham>
You just push the branch to the main repo rather than to your fork

[04:51:15.0000] <hsivonen>
so far, I've had too much write access to learn how the real workflow works

[04:51:29.0000] <jgraham>
(under the covers it's actually even more similar than you would think given the UI)

[04:52:34.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: will the branch stay around forever or does it get flattened out somehow after the PR has been accepted?

[04:52:54.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: will future generations be able to laugh at my intermediate steps?

[04:53:31.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: You can rebase+squash once the review is accepted and delete the review branch

[04:54:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: ok.

[04:54:26.0000] <hsivonen>
/me still doesn't grok how "everyone has a copy of all data" and "you can delete a branch" interact

[04:57:21.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Well the branch is only a pointer to the commits. So you can delete the pointer without deleting the commits. Then after some time (90 days by default) any commits that aren't reachable from a pointer are discarded. Of course if someone else has cloned the repo, they might still have a pointer to your commits locally and they could push those commits back upstream. So you can't guarantee that they have been expunged forevermore, but it's n

[04:57:47.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: you got cut off at "but it's no"

[04:58:24.0000] <smaug____>
oh, git exposes gc behavior. boo

[04:58:47.0000] <jgraham>
"but it's not a scenario that happens much in practice becase there usually isn't any reason to push old commits that have already been merged."

[05:01:19.0000] <jgraham>
smaug____: Well that's a feature I think. The mercurial equivalent is either strip files or not actually deleting commits but marking them as hidden

[05:02:08.0000] <smaug____>
I would expect gc-able stuff to not show up anywhere, certainly not in clones

[05:02:19.0000] <smaug____>
so gc could run during cloning

[05:04:46.0000] <jgraham>
I don't know if gc-able stuff does show up in clones, actually. I was thinking of the situation where someone had already cloned and the commits were de-referenced upstream.

[05:19:48.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone want to bet whether Blink gets svg.innerHTML = "<frameset>" right?

[05:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone want to guess if the spec gets it right?

[05:20:10.0000] <hsivonen>
or what the spec says about it

[05:20:20.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hasn't read the spec on that point, yet

[05:26:47.0000] <TabAtkins>
hsivonen: Dunno what the spec says, but Blink just creates an <svg|frameset> element.

[05:27:46.0000] <Domenic>
hsivonen: out of curiousity why are you looking into this stuff? For Servo? Ran into similar stuff on jsdom recently.

[05:29:27.0000] <hsivonen>
Domenic: for Gecko.

[05:30:00.0000] <Domenic>
hsivonen: kk. is there a bug I can watch?

[05:30:07.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I accepted your invitation. Thanks

[05:30:24.0000] <hsivonen>
Domenic: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=886390

/me fantasai, your latest changes to default.css give all the links a double underline

[06:18:07.0000] <ondras>
so, web components/shadow dom

[06:18:13.0000] <ondras>
is this channel suitable or is there a better one.

[06:18:37.0000] <jgraham>
It depends on what you want to talk about, I guess

[06:18:38.0000] <ondras>
I am having an issue with createdCallback not called when the custom element in question is created inside a shadow root of another element

[06:20:56.0000] <ondras>
but this is for the first time I am digging deeper into this stuff, so the chance is the problem is somewhere between the chair and the monitor.

[06:22:17.0000] <TabAtkins>
ondras: Maybe ask in #polymer?

[06:22:40.0000] <ondras>
TabAtkins: well I would like to have this working without polymer at first, adding polyfills later

[06:28:16.0000] <TabAtkins>
ondras: I just meant that people in that room know quite a bit more about this specific topic.

[06:28:39.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I also suspect it's PEBCAK, but I can't help you any further than that.)

[06:28:58.0000] <ondras>
.)

[06:29:04.0000] <ondras>
okay, thanks, will try.

[06:31:59.0000] <TabAtkins>

thou shalt be blacklistored.

[07:12:39.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: RaA?

[07:12:48.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: did it work out with the blog?

[07:12:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
Reductio ad absurdum

[07:13:30.0000] <annevk>
I see

[07:13:55.0000] <annevk>
The situation seems fairly logical to me, and the person calling FUD is actually doing that himself

[07:14:05.0000] <annevk>
film at 11?

[07:15:35.0000] <darobin>
annevk: huh?

[07:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: interested in investigating the compat impact of changing (min-|max-)?device-(width|height) media features so they are equivalent to width/height?

[07:16:47.0000] <Domenic>
^ lol, the web

[07:17:25.0000] <annevk>
Didn't the "mobile web" ruin that?

[07:18:12.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Uh, I got distracted by actual bugs. And an inability to write through lack of practice. But I managed to reset my password, so yeah

[07:18:52.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: sounds good

[07:20:59.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Which situation?

[07:21:26.0000] <jgraham>
I'm pretty sure that any situation that's logical is offtopic, so we need to correct this as fast as possible

[07:21:44.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: heh

[07:21:46.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: https://twitter.com/domenic/status/508964136366391297

[07:26:14.0000] <hober>
Domenic: you keep referring to something the Director said, but i missed the relevant actual quote from him.

[07:26:45.0000] <Domenic>
hober: Art was referencing a conversation which I presume he did not take notes during.

[07:26:55.0000] <annevk>
hober: "However, based on my conversations with Consortium staff last week, the Director will NOT permit a Proposed Recommendation to include a normative reference to a WHATWG spec." from http://www.w3.org/community/w3process/track/issues/124

[07:27:36.0000] <hober>
annevk: ahh, thanks. so not only is there not a quote from the director, the conversation didn't even include him?

[07:28:33.0000] <annevk>
hober: depending on what the actual the Director said, a conversation with the Director does not have to include the actual the Director

[07:28:47.0000] <hober>
annevk: :)

[07:28:48.0000] <annevk>
hober: so I've no idea :-)

[07:29:11.0000] <hober>
i guess what i'm saying is that https://twitter.com/domenic/status/508977165028057088 is overstating the case

[07:30:16.0000] <jgraham>
Can we get a journalist to phone TimBL and get a quote

[07:31:14.0000] <jgraham>
Everyone knows that the best medium for relationship counselling is through the media

[07:38:53.0000] <darobin>
jgraham++

[07:39:07.0000] <darobin>
that is, indeed, not an actual quote from the Director

[07:40:03.0000] <darobin>
who, as far as I know, was not on the call being referred to

[07:40:24.0000] <darobin>
and therefore was unable to make quotes either way, irrespective of his opinion

[07:41:12.0000] <darobin>
but hey, it would be ridiculous to let facts get in the way of some good old fashioned standards drama

[07:42:12.0000] <hober>
s/standards drama/game of telephone/

[07:43:19.0000] <jgraham>
More worrying, tracker seems to think that reverse chronological order is a sensible way to sort email

[08:04:16.0000] <annevk>
Is TLS the new URI or ECMAScript, or actually a term we should favor over SSL?

[08:05:31.0000] <sgalineau>
darobin: well, the most recent game of standards drama worked out so well, why not have another round?

[08:12:54.0000] <annevk>
sgalineau: darobin will solve it soon by introducing something that is neither W3C nor WHATWG

[08:13:42.0000] <hober>
... and combines the problems of both

[08:13:51.0000] <sgalineau>
annevk: a third group could be the only way to make WHATWG and W3C agree on something "OMG NO"

[08:14:13.0000] <darobin>
/me soldiers on!

[08:14:34.0000] <sgalineau>
/me cue 'Object to this' meme

[08:16:54.0000] <annevk>
sgalineau: contrasted with the IETF, at least we can agree on Unicode and text/html (these days)

[08:17:58.0000] <sgalineau>
annevk: whoa. WHATWG agrees on *two* things with a standards body? Jesus. You guys are practically selling out.

[08:18:22.0000] <annevk>
sgalineau: did you hear we're publishing snapshots? http://blog.whatwg.org/make-patent-commitments

[08:19:03.0000] <sgalineau>
annevk: you can't fool me. you are the Tools Of Evil.

[08:27:40.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: you may enjoy https://github.com/domenic/ecmarkdown. For progress see https://github.com/domenic/ecmarkdown/tree/master/test/cases

[08:35:20.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: You should match CMD's list handling.

[08:35:35.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: this isn't meant to be a markdown dialect; much more restrictive.

[08:35:40.0000] <Domenic>
for algorithms only

[08:35:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
Right, I know, it's a subset and redefinition.

[08:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But insofar as you're copying MD, you should copy CMD.

[08:36:36.0000] <Domenic>
Part of the goal is uniformity. We don't want some parts of the spec using 0., 0., 0. and others using 1., 1., 1. and others using 1., 2., 3.

[08:41:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
???

[08:42:37.0000] <Domenic>
This is for ECMAScript which will have many contributors

[08:43:18.0000] <TabAtkins>
What I'm talking about is the indentation.

[08:43:53.0000] <Domenic>
Oh!

[08:44:09.0000] <Domenic>
I haven't read that, so perhaps I will.

[08:45:03.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: seen a good DNSSEC guide? TransIP seems to offer it, but I've no idea how to configure it

[08:45:14.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: nope

[08:45:29.0000] <annevk>
Also, it's a bit unclear to me what DNSSEC actually offers

[08:48:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Each list-item establishes a required indentation by the number of characters before it starts.

[08:49:00.0000] <annevk>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions seems fairly clear as to what it offers...

[08:54:29.0000] <jgraham>
These things annoy me: emails sent as both HTML and plain text where the plain text is missing substantial information compared to the HTML

[09:00:06.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: did you point tantek to that?

[09:00:33.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: context?

[09:00:41.0000] <Hixie_>
http://www.w3.org/community/w3process/track/issues/124

[09:00:55.0000] <Hixie_>
and yeah, if anyone ever wondered what the w3c's position on the whatwg was, the phrase "explicitly blacklist WHATWG" should pretty much put it to rest

I saw on Twitter the guy just lost his sandwhich, not sure I want to bring more bad news

[09:02:27.0000] <Hixie_>
lol

[09:03:27.0000] <Hixie_>
wait, where are you seeing that he lost his sandwich!

[09:03:29.0000] <annevk>
hober: http://googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=ssl&word2=tls

[09:04:11.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: https://twitter.com/adactio/status/508982320553283584

[09:04:27.0000] <Hixie_>
lol

[09:05:16.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie_: To be fair the phrase "explicitly blacklist WHATWG specs" came from Art; he pointed out that he disagreed with it as policy but believed it to be W3C's position, and further discussion suggested that it was not, in fact, W3C

[09:05:17.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: interesting, i did not expect that tls.

[09:05:34.0000] <jgraham>
's position (or hasn't yet been confirmed as such)

[09:05:57.0000] <jgraham>
So, all in all, it seems like a terrible way of infering what W3C's actual position is

[09:06:57.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: lots of non-web related results on first page. "Top law schools" "times literary supplement" other orgs with that acronym.

[09:06:57.0000] <Hixie_>
jgraham: yeah, their official position is "I think it would be inappropriate for the Staff to publicly speculate"

[09:07:22.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: SSL has a couple of those too though

[09:07:30.0000] <jgraham>
Right. I agree "we aren't going to tell you our position" is a pretty terrible position to take

[09:07:45.0000] <jgraham>
Hopefully it's shortlived

[09:08:07.0000] <Hixie_>
it's already not short-lived :-)

[09:09:30.0000] <jgraham>
compared to that email

[09:10:16.0000] <Hixie_>
btw i was earlier going to say that we should adopt a policy of not referencing stale specs

[09:10:22.0000] <Hixie_>
but then i realised we already have that policy

[09:10:28.0000] <Hixie_>
since we just reference ed drafts

[09:13:33.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: URI <> URL; Atom <> RSS are much more clearcut

[09:13:55.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic, annevk: what's the setup you want on streams.spec.whatwg.org

[09:14:08.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: sounds like Domenic wants an SSH account

[09:14:19.0000] <Hixie_>
basically there's two options. Domenic has an ssh account, annevk has an ssh account. :-)

[09:14:23.0000] <Hixie_>
k

[09:15:03.0000] <Domenic>
^ sounds good

[09:15:16.0000] <Hixie_>
username?

[09:15:23.0000] <Domenic>
domenic

[09:15:53.0000] <Hixie_>
you don't have any weird preferences for shell, do you

[09:15:57.0000] <Hixie_>
bash is ok?

[09:16:02.0000] <Domenic>
bash is superb

[09:16:15.0000] <Hixie_>
hm, looks like domenic is taken

[09:16:19.0000] <Hixie_>
(sorry, shared host)

[09:16:25.0000] <Domenic>
aw

[09:16:38.0000] <Domenic>
I think ddenicola will be easiest to remember

[09:16:59.0000] <Domenic>
(but nobody spells my name with an "e"... craziness!)

[09:17:10.0000] <Hixie_>
k... now the interesting part

[09:17:21.0000] <Hixie_>
how do i get this password to you with a theoretically secure chain of trust

[09:17:33.0000] <Domenic>
i was wondering that myself

[09:18:17.0000] <jgraham>
Write it down and go visit him?

[09:18:28.0000] <Hixie_>
you on hangouts? that's encrypted end-to-end, and i trust google not to steal these credentials since i already trust them not to use my e-mail to break into my dreamhost host

[09:18:35.0000] <Hixie_>
(and also, i am part of google.)

[09:19:53.0000] <Domenic>
Hangouts should work yeah

[09:20:08.0000] <Hixie_>
send one to ian.hickson⊙gc

[09:20:32.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: while i'm at the dreamhost panel, what's out story with this tls nonsense

[09:21:24.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: we have two options, either you get StartSSL verified, or I you hand over StartSSL WHATWG business to me somehow as I'll be StartSSL verified (class 2) within 10 business days

[09:21:36.0000] <Hixie_>
how do i do that second one?

[09:21:44.0000] <Domenic>
For future reference https://www.npmjs.org/package/cipherhub seems like a feasible solution for key exchange

[09:21:48.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: we need to be StartSSL class 2 for whatwg.org as we have a complex subdomain setup

[09:21:57.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: I guess I need to ask them

[09:23:07.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: now that I know you're okay with that, I'll look into it

[09:24:00.0000] <Hixie_>
i'm definitely ok with offloading as much work as possible :-)

[09:24:35.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic: ok, your account is set up on streams.spec.whatwg.org

[09:24:45.0000] <Hixie_>
might take a few minute for dns to propagate

[09:24:58.0000] <Hixie_>
let me know when to update the spec index

[09:25:34.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie_: awesome, thanks. And yeah, no need to update the spec index for a couple weeks probably; I just want to kill the URL I am currently using so nobody links to it.

[09:26:01.0000] <Hixie_>
i wonder how i do the wildcard stuff on dreamhost

[09:26:13.0000] <Hixie_>
do i have to manually add the same cert to each of these damn subdomians?

[09:26:16.0000] <Hixie_>
subdomains

[09:27:03.0000] <annevk>
Yeah you might have to, apparently if you have direct access to the server it's much more convenient

[09:27:28.0000] <Hixie_>
i technically do have root but i think the panel happily nukes my settings every now and then

[09:27:31.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk, Hixie_: btw iirc even class 2 only allows *.domain.ext, not *.*.domain.ext

[09:27:47.0000] <mathiasbynens>
re: *.spec.whatwg.org

[09:27:54.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: we don't need *.*, just *.spec.whatwg.org

[09:28:02.0000] <Hixie_>
i guess we'd need *.spec.whatwg.org and *.whatwg.org

[09:28:06.0000] <annevk>
right

[09:28:10.0000] <mathiasbynens>
and whatwg.org

[09:28:17.0000] <Hixie_>
that we actually have already

[09:28:46.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie_: did you see http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20140907#l-257?

[09:29:05.0000] <Hixie_>
yeah that's why we're doing this

[09:29:08.0000] <Hixie_>
amongst other reasons

[09:30:11.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie_: the mixed content issues can be fixed already, though

[09:30:32.0000] <Domenic>
Yeah I think just change the <base> to // instead of http://?

[09:30:44.0000] <mathiasbynens>
for example, yeah

[09:30:44.0000] <Hixie_>
/me discovers that dreamhost actually does support splitting one domain across multiple users after all

[09:30:55.0000] <mathiasbynens>
for that particular page

[09:31:02.0000] <Hixie_>
oh, i see

[09:31:16.0000] <Hixie_>
wait, what does that page reference that's explicitly by http://?

[09:31:25.0000] <Domenic>
the <base> tag

[09:31:31.0000] <mathiasbynens>
<base href="http://whatwg.org/specs/"> <!-- because it's also used on http://spec.whatwg.org/ -->

[09:31:33.0000] <Domenic>
fun fact, browsers let you type //example.com into the URL bar

[09:31:49.0000] <Hixie_>
ohh

[09:31:50.0000] <Hixie_>
right

[09:32:51.0000] <Hixie_>
actually whatwg.org is just a redirect to www.whatwg.org

[09:33:09.0000] <Hixie_>
so i'm not sure we can secure that one technically (given how dreamhost does things)

[09:33:12.0000] <Hixie_>
anyway. spec list fixed.

[09:33:17.0000] <Domenic>
boooo no www

[09:33:17.0000] <mathiasbynens>
isn’t whatwg no-www friendly?

[09:33:36.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie_: for other documents, it’s probably easiest to grep for 'http://whatwg.org' and go from there

[09:33:39.0000] <Hixie_>
it's www.whatwg.org because it's the domain for the world wide web's specs!

[09:33:54.0000] <Hixie_>
not because www. is our web server

[09:34:38.0000] <jgraham>
No, then it would be www.spec.whatwg.org Or sepc.www.whatwg.org

[09:34:41.0000] <jgraham>
*spec

[09:34:59.0000] <Hixie_>
url.spec.www.whatwg.org would have been too long

[09:35:16.0000] <Hixie_>
and dreamhost won't let us host www.spec.whatwg.org separate from spec.whatwg.org

[09:35:27.0000] <jgraham>
so which non www specs are you planning on writing there?

[09:35:28.0000] <Hixie_>
i tried to set that up for hixie.ch vs www.hixie.ch literally over a decade ago

[09:35:32.0000] <Hixie_>
and they wouldn't have any of it

[09:35:56.0000] <Ms2ger>
www.spec.whatwg.org is the HTML spec, right?

[09:36:04.0000] <jgraham>
(it seems like any non-www specs are also non-*w*hatwg-specs)

[09:36:08.0000] <Hixie_>
should be. sadly it's html.spec.whatwg.org

[09:36:23.0000] <Hixie_>
jgraham: the existence of a label doesn't imply the existence of other labels :-)

[09:37:26.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie_: No, but that situation does suggest redundancy :)

[09:37:44.0000] <Hixie_>
possibly

[09:37:45.0000] <Domenic>
lazyirc: i assume a bunch of tests exist in web-platform-tests for document.write?

[09:37:55.0000] <jgraham>
Domenic: "a bunch"

[09:37:57.0000] <Hixie_>
but redundancy in web hosting is good, it makes us more reliable! :-P

[09:38:21.0000] <Domenic>
jgraham: enough that we feel good about it, as opposed to most of the coverage in WPT?

[09:38:43.0000] <Domenic>
jgraham: I feel like document.write is such a hairy area but also a pretty interoperable one that someone must have tested it a lot....

[09:39:25.0000] <jgraham>
https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/13bff083fba249ed260966bca65319b1b35d3f34/html/dom/dynamic-markup-insertion

[09:39:46.0000] <Hixie_>
document.write is less interoperable than you might imagine

[09:39:54.0000] <Domenic>
jgraham: that looks very nice, thanks :D

[09:41:29.0000] <caitp>
it's interoperable enough for a react.js slide deck which will only ever be opened on chromium

[09:41:57.0000] <Hixie_>
Ms2ger: re https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26744

[09:42:01.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie_: fwiw there are some hardcoded `http://whatwg.org`s in https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/*.js

[09:42:22.0000] <Hixie_>
Ms2ger: the text you're talking about is three paragraphs from a heading that introduces the disabled attribute

[09:42:31.0000] <Hixie_>
Ms2ger: and the first list item there explicitly lists the elements

[09:42:36.0000] <Hixie_>
Ms2ger: what more can i do?

[09:42:39.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me looks

[09:42:51.0000] <jgraham>
caitp: So you're saying it's interoperable enough that Blink behaviour never regresses? I wonder if you have tested that when they actually made changes to the document.write code :p

[09:43:18.0000] <caitp>
well, being a slide deck, it stops mattering after a few weeks :>

[09:43:58.0000] <Ms2ger>
Oh, hm

[09:44:01.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: the text you cite in https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25099#c33 is exactly what i want to write, but that text doesn't work with the way you've defined events.

[09:44:26.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: (because it doesn't invoke the constructor, which would be a very weird thing to do in prose)

[09:44:34.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie_, okay, wfm

[09:44:56.0000] <caitp>
the joke is that it's interoperable enough to be used in situations where you don't care about interoperability

[09:45:06.0000] <Hixie_>
Ms2ger: cool

[09:45:09.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me was going to complain at Hixie_ about something, but can't remember what

[09:45:18.0000] <Ms2ger>
You get off this time!

[09:45:48.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: yeah fair, I wonder how we resolve the situation of not defining the global object for many objects

[09:46:50.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: ?

[09:46:55.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: how do you mean?

[09:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
Ms2ger: Come on? You can't think of anything to complain to Hixie_ about? localStorage? The ugly WHATWG green? His belief that cats make good pets?

[09:47:16.0000] <Hixie_>
cats make terrible pets

[09:47:21.0000] <Hixie_>
they make great housemates though

[09:47:30.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=24652

[09:47:32.0000] <Ms2ger>
WHATWG green isn't too bad

[09:47:53.0000] <jgraham>
/me finds something to complain at Ms2ger about

[09:48:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
But I was thinking something he didn't already know

[09:48:12.0000] <mathiasbynens>
/me randomly blames Ms2ger for the low-res WHATWG favicon.ico

[09:48:23.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: i don't understand the relevance of that to the event thing

[09:48:47.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: if we define things in terms of a constructor that we invoke, there'd be an associated realm

[09:49:09.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: why do we care about associated realms here

[09:49:25.0000] <annevk>
because otherwise it's unclear where the prototype comes from

[09:49:26.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: we create an object. creating an object is something we do all over the place in the specs.

[09:49:38.0000] <annevk>
yeah, this is a pretty big problem

[09:49:56.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: well we're not going to create constructors for everything we create objects for

[09:50:09.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: so whatever our solution is, it has nothing to do with constructors

[09:50:15.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: so again, i don't see how this affects the events issue

[09:50:36.0000] <annevk>
well for events constructors are nice because of the dictionary design

[09:50:53.0000] <annevk>
as spec authors have difficulty getting the prose right

[09:50:57.0000] <annevk>
IDL is much easier

[09:51:22.0000] <Hixie_>
if spec authors have problems writing prose, this is going to be the least of their issues

[09:56:27.0000] <annevk>
Is this issue high priority for you? I'd prefer to wait until IDL is revamped. Hopefully then we have a better idea of how to define objects. Provided real effort is put into that

[09:57:17.0000] <Hixie_>
given that i think that the resolution is for me to do nothing and you to revert the changes to DOM, no, not particularly urgent. :-)

[10:00:40.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: while i have you here, see my response on https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26103#c10

[12:55:56.0000] <jwalden>
peoples!  can someone explain to me why the searchParams serialization algorithm detailed for URLSearchParams would be totally unaware of anything but ASCII?  seems like that nonsense just shouldn't be, for new APIs

[13:02:18.0000] <jsbell>
jwalden: You mean http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-urlencoded-serializer ?

[13:02:40.0000] <jwalden>
jsbell: yes, that and http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-urlencoded-byte-serializer

[13:04:50.0000] <okj579>
that algorithm can use any encoding but defaults to utf8

[13:11:49.0000] <jwalden>
oh, am I misreading?  step 1 converts Unicode stuffs into byte arrays, then serialization individually converts each byte into +/percent-encoding/that code point?

[13:16:09.0000] <okj579>
yeah, i think so

[13:22:29.0000] <arunranga>
hi Domenic! heads up that domenic.me/2014/02/14/the-revealing-constructor-pattern/ results in 404

[13:23:08.0000] <Hixie_>
jorendorff: bz says that Firefox is going to "progressively parse scripts, and possibly progressively bytecode-compile, and possibly progressively native-code-compile". Do you know how this will interact with the ES6 moduel loader?

[13:44:45.0000] <jwalden>
Hixie_: what does "progressively" mean in these contexts?

[13:45:08.0000] <Hixie_>
did i delete the e-mail that explained that

[13:45:27.0000] <Hixie_>
ah, no, yoav explains it:

[13:45:33.0000] <Hixie_>
> If receiving multiple resources progressively provides better performance

[13:45:36.0000] <Hixie_>
> then having the server sending them one after the other, then the hint

[13:45:39.0000] <Hixie_>
> should be sent.

[13:51:25.0000] <jorendorff>
Hixie_: Hmm. It seems like there is a problem in the ES6 Loader design: that design requires parsing (the full module body) to succeed before starting work on dependencies

[13:53:02.0000] <jorendorff>
Hixie_: the normalize hook is called, for each import-declaration, after parsing --

[13:53:10.0000] <jorendorff>
seems like it is specified to NOT eagerly go after those dependencies before the first one is done loading

[13:54:38.0000] <Hixie_>
jorendorff: yeah, i've been trying to tell es-discuss this for like a month now

[13:56:21.0000] <jorendorff>
Hixie_: probably because if you *really* want that Loader to perform, you're not waiting around for all these round trips anyway

[13:56:55.0000] <jorendorff>
the server has to tell the app what it needs and push it -- which the model does kind of support

[14:03:02.0000] <Hixie_>
jorendorff: not really, unless you mean it supports it because the cache gets primed.

[14:03:19.0000] <Hixie_>
jorendorff: but in practice i don't think we can rely on servers like that

[14:03:27.0000] <jorendorff>
it "supports" it only in that it has appropriate hooks

[14:03:37.0000] <Hixie_>
jorendorff: i mean, it's been 24 years and people still can't set their mime types correctly

[14:03:58.0000] <jorendorff>
Hixie_: This is where I have trouble understanding what you're saying though

[14:04:23.0000] <jorendorff>
Hixie_: because if the client is to have any understanding beforehand of what is to be loaded... then it has to get that somewhere

[14:04:37.0000] <jorendorff>
from a manifest or "this needs that" declarations of some kind

[14:04:41.0000] <Hixie_>
sure. people are really good at making their servers serve up static files.

[14:04:48.0000] <Hixie_>
url -> file

[14:04:55.0000] <Hixie_>
or url -> cgi script -> file

[14:05:09.0000] <Hixie_>
it's when you have to configure the server that things get dicey

[14:05:16.0000] <Hixie_>
url -> file + configured metadata

[14:05:20.0000] <Hixie_>
url -> multiple files

[14:05:42.0000] <Hixie_>
url -> redirect, even, in many cases

[14:07:58.0000] <jorendorff>
"asset pipeline" stuff exists though

[14:08:09.0000] <jorendorff>
it's not seen as configuration by the people who have to put up with it

[14:08:48.0000] <jorendorff>
it's just the way their platform does things, and they play along with a few rules

[14:10:21.0000] <Hixie_>
for some people, sure

[14:10:32.0000] <Hixie_>
most people, though, i doubt will ever get this working

[14:10:59.0000] <Hixie_>
just like now some people have CDMs that manage mime types correctly, but most people just ship their files with bogus default types that apache ships with

[14:11:45.0000] <Hixie_>
but unlike with mime types, where browsers just ignore them, if we don't provide a way around this, that long tail will either not be able to use es6, or they'll have terrible performance.

[14:16:13.0000] <Hixie_>
jorendorff: in any case, this is all moot relative to the point i was talking about above. Even if you only have one module, how can you parse it like bz describes if it has to go through the ES6 module loader pipeline?

[14:17:29.0000] <jorendorff>
Hixie_: oh, it can speculatively parse all it wants to, just like HTML, right?

[14:17:50.0000] <Hixie_>
not if the browser doesn't see a single byte until the translate hook has returned

[14:17:59.0000] <Hixie_>
which happens after the entirety of the fetch hook

[14:18:11.0000] <jorendorff>
Hixie_: sure, if you play by the rules

[14:18:15.0000] <Hixie_>
...

[14:18:27.0000] <jorendorff>
Hixie_: you can either speculatively parse or not. if you do speculatively parse, you have to not get caught

[14:18:31.0000] <jorendorff>
like every other optimization

[14:18:58.0000] <Hixie_>
so basically anyone who uses an ES6 loader is going to see their performance drop off a cliff?

[14:19:25.0000] <Hixie_>
we should design this so that using this correctly and fully is completely compatible with the optimisations

[14:19:31.0000] <Hixie_>
e.g. using streams instead of promises

[14:19:34.0000] <Hixie_>
imho

[14:20:44.0000] <jorendorff>
that's fine with me

[14:25:55.0000] <Hixie_>
jorendorff: you or bz or something should tell es-discuss :-)

[14:26:00.0000] <Hixie_>
i don't think people there are listening to me anymore

[14:46:21.0000] <caitp>
is it actually specified anywhere that SVG elements in an HTML document are supposed to have the `innerHTML` property?

[14:46:49.0000] <caitp>
the interaction between svg and html is just super confusing and hard to keep track of

[14:47:46.0000] <Hixie_>
it's currently defined that they should not, iirc

[14:48:04.0000] <caitp>
well, blink and gecko both expose it, and applications depend on it

[14:48:10.0000] <caitp>
but unfortunately those applications break in safari

[15:12:47.0000] <Hixie_>
are there any methods that take 'any...' arguments and then later try to coerce that to a dictionary?

[15:15:03.0000] <Ms2ger>
None that I know of

[15:18:07.0000] <Domenic>
I am afraid to ask why you're asking that...

[15:39:22.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic: to spec getContext()'s {alpha:false} feature which multiple browsers implement

[15:43:07.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic: btw, is it intended that the WebIDL conversion algorithm for jsval to dict doesn't throw if passed a promise?

[15:43:15.0000] <Hixie_>
(it does if passed a Date or RegExp)

[15:44:55.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie_: It's not intentional in that I don't believe anyone made a conscious decision

[15:44:59.0000] <Hixie_>
k

[15:45:28.0000] <Domenic>
IMO Date and RegExp are the weird ones out ... Map, Set, Array, Error, etc. all don't throw either.

[15:47:35.0000] <Hixie_>
true

[15:48:04.0000] <Hixie_>
Array and Error are less magical than Map, Set, and Promise though

[15:48:09.0000] <Hixie_>
and those are the only old ones there

[15:48:41.0000] <Domenic>
Eh, unclear. Array has some fun magic going on.

[15:50:20.0000] <Domenic>
argggh why did the ES spec suddenly get big enough to hang Firefox like the HTML spec

[15:52:44.0000] <Hixie_>
yay, it's not just me!

[15:54:41.0000] <caitp>
jorendorff's mirror, or some exotic secret future version with es7 stuff?

[15:54:59.0000] <jorendorff>
Domenic: ?

[15:55:15.0000] <Domenic>
jorendorff: filing an issue now

[15:56:04.0000] <Domenic>
https://github.com/jorendorff/es-spec-html/issues/78

[15:57:59.0000] <jorendorff>
hmm. current release ffox or Nightly?

[15:58:07.0000] <jorendorff>
/me hadn't noticed anything

[15:58:09.0000] <jorendorff>
thanks for the bug

[15:58:22.0000] <jorendorff>
probably it's just time to split it across some pages

[15:59:27.0000] <Hixie_>
nooooooo

[16:00:11.0000] <jorendorff>
orrrrrr, we could, like, fix whatever is busted in firefox

[16:00:35.0000] <jorendorff>
i don't think the ES spec got a lot bigger all of a sudden.

[16:05:15.0000] <Domenic>
I was thinking maybe the HTML got bigger even if the contents didn't

[16:05:52.0000] <Domenic>
jorendorff: I am only 50% sure I tested on Nightly, but definitely on current (and probably last?) stable.

[16:40:06.0000] <terinjokes>
i wish shims were more realible

[20:17:20.0000] <cabanier>
TabAtkins: with bikeshed, if the IDL syntax contains an unknown class it throws an error. Is there a way to import classes or define them?

[20:20:45.0000] <cabanier>
TabAtkins: never mind. figured it out :-)

[20:35:44.0000] <terinjokes>
:( IE9's console makes me sad

[20:37:37.0000] <caitp->
:(

[00:58:39.0000] <annevk_>
So https://readable-email.org/ looks pretty cool, but what's the expected lifetime of the URLs?

[01:03:08.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: so the way we make TLS work is that you forward hostmaster⊙wo email to me. Then when I'm class 2 verified I'll add whatwg.org to domains I'm responsible for and issue a certificate that we can use

[02:52:20.0000] <smaug____>
specs need  blame/annotations

[02:52:42.0000] <smaug____>
and commit messages would then hopefully have links to the relevant spec bugs or email threads

[02:53:46.0000] <TabAtkins>
smaug____: ANything on w3c has blame.

[02:54:16.0000] <darobin>
or rather, EVERYTHING on the w3c has blame!

[02:54:58.0000] <smaug____>
/me would require blame for XHR spec

[02:55:08.0000] <smaug____>
I guess it was in w3c at that time

[02:56:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
The W3C is to blame for everything?

[02:56:16.0000] <Ms2ger>
But all whatwg specs have blame, yes

[02:56:44.0000] <tripu>
W3C eat babies for breakfast

[02:57:22.0000] <annevk>
smaug____: what change are you thinking about?

[03:01:32.0000] <smaug____>
50ms

[03:01:54.0000] <smaug____>
I can't recall where that number came from

[03:02:04.0000] <smaug____>
was it something in dnd?

[03:05:25.0000] <TabAtkins>
What's the context?

[03:07:53.0000] <smaug____>
Ah, Takeshi found the links, https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26759

[03:09:05.0000] <smaug____>
and if was <video>, which then didn't quite work out, so lower number was used

[03:17:30.0000] <smaug____>
s/if/it/

[03:41:32.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: so you read https://www.feistyduck.com/books/bulletproof-ssl-and-tls/

[03:42:49.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I guess I could give it a go; I read https://www.crypto101.io/ on the subject

[03:43:04.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: but that was not quite finished and covered a lot of things I was not super interested in

[04:27:47.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I read Bulletproof SSL and TLS, yes

[04:28:04.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: it's a must-read for anyone who has a Web server

[04:28:16.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: since anyone who has a Web server should be deploying https

[04:28:33.0000] <annevk>
I don't have a server, but I'm renting some space on one

[04:28:54.0000] <annevk>
I will be deploying TLS soonish, waiting for a letter from StartSSL

[04:29:07.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: the first half of the book is basically a historical retrospective of browser vendors not fixing stuff until there's a proof of concept of an attack. Theoretical attacks always lose to "Don't break the Web"

[04:29:24.0000] <hsivonen>
(which is entirely unsurprising, but still something to think about)

[04:29:48.0000] <annevk>
That's interesting, browsers are mostly blaming CAs these days

[04:31:18.0000] <hsivonen>
another theme: If you work with Apache, if you want stuff to work, compile the httpd yourself with this or that patch

[04:31:31.0000] <hsivonen>
in other words: just use nginx if you want https

[04:33:20.0000] <annevk>
Hmm, DreamHost is Apache, but hopefully they are doing the right thing...

[04:33:34.0000] <hsivonen>
haha

[04:33:38.0000] <annevk>
I don't really want to start running and maintaining my own server

[04:33:44.0000] <annevk>
Yeah I know

[04:34:28.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: ignoring the mixed content for now, is there anything badly wrong with https://www.whatwg.org/ from a TLS perspective?

[04:34:57.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: the mixed content is an easy fix down the road, the TLS configuration is what DreamHost offers and would be hard to change

[04:50:49.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=whatwg.org

[04:51:04.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: many problems

[04:51:15.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: root cert sent by the server

[04:51:25.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: no TLS 1.2

[04:51:44.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: RC4 all over the place

[04:51:53.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: no Forward Secrecy

[04:52:17.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: unpatched OpenSSL

[04:53:32.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: also, SSL3 enabled despite requiring SNI

[04:53:47.0000] <hsivonen>
all in all, pretty embarrassing

[04:54:16.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: oh, and the server doesn't even support non-RC4 suites

[04:54:47.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: being one of the servers that's holding the Web back from browsers being able to remove RC4 support is not cool

[04:55:18.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: is this what you get automatically from Dreamhost's shared hosting, or is this Hixie's VM?

[04:55:30.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I suspect this is what you get by default

[04:55:47.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: :-(

[04:55:47.0000] <annevk>
but I'm not sure

[04:56:35.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: note that IE11 on Windows 8.1 will fail to connect on the first handshake

[04:57:11.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I'm not sure, but I *think* it takes multiple downgrades before IE11 on Windows 8.1 tries something broken enough to connect to www.whatwg.org.

[04:57:51.0000] <hsivonen>
or maybe it's just one downgrade here

[04:57:55.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, not cool

[04:58:04.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: annevk: it would be good to nag on dreamhost on fixing their defaults (or whoever has the wrong defaults)

[04:58:30.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=panel.dreamhost.com

[04:58:32.0000] <annevk>
:-(

[04:59:35.0000] <annevk>
Yes, I will file a support ticket. Leaving DreamHost would be a ton of effort.

[04:59:54.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: on a more positive note, if a provider as big as dreamhost is guilty of perpetuating RC4-only hosting, maybe the RC4-only numbers for the Web drop noticeably once someone manages to evangelize dreamhost to fix their ciphersuite spec

[05:00:28.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I guess I need to read that book. I don't even know what RC4 means, only that it's bad

[05:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: it's an old stream cipher that's been considered "broken" by the experts for a long time

[05:01:19.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: from time to time, someone shows results of it being even worse than previously thought

[05:01:44.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: Microsoft thinks it's so bad that IE11 on Windows 8.1 does not offer RC4 on the first connection attempt

[05:02:14.0000] <hsivonen>
but in order not to break the Web, IE11 on Windows 8.1 will try reconnect with RC4 enabled

[05:03:35.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: sadly, RC4 saw a resurcence when people used it to mitigate BEAST, which is an attack that RC4 is not vulnerable to

[05:05:24.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: if you don't care about IE on XP (which you implicitly don't if you require SNI), ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA goes a long way

[05:06:29.0000] <hsivonen>
ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 is slower than ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA and the book says ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 doesn't have a security benefit over ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA, but it doesn't explain why, so I haven't taken ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 out of my config yet

[05:08:35.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: also, if you don't care about IE*6* on XP, you can turn off SSL3.

[05:09:39.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. Dreamhost runs its own intermediate CA

[05:10:11.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I think all DreamHost allows is configuring the certificate

[05:10:42.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: which you can either get through DreamHost for USD 15 per domain (plus USD 60 if you want an IPv4 address), or somewhere else

[05:11:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: perhaps Hixie_ can configure more though since he has root

[05:11:07.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: at least I think he does

[05:11:47.0000] <jgraham>
It seems surprising if you can configure all this stuff in a shared host, but maybe I'm wrong

[05:12:06.0000] <jgraham>
(it also seems surprising that whatwg.org is sunning on a shared host)

[05:12:10.0000] <jgraham>
*running

[05:12:51.0000] <hsivonen>
if you assume a shared host that cares about IE on XP, ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA would be a lot better than the single RC4 suite that Dreamhost has

[05:13:41.0000] <hsivonen>
scoring A+ on slllabs.com is not really rocket science. My site was there before I even read the book. :-)

[05:14:50.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: You are not a typical end user

[05:15:03.0000] <jgraham>
Or even a typical server admin

[05:15:24.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm really bad at server admining

[05:15:32.0000] <jgraham>
(critic.hoppipolla.co.uk gets an A- now I installed the latest security updates)

[05:15:50.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: SSL Labs disagrees with your self assessment there

[05:16:23.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: there's more to sysadmining than configuring TLS

[05:16:35.0000] <hsivonen>
for a single nginx instance

[05:16:53.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: anyway, a shared host should have more reasonable defaults than dreamhost has

[05:17:05.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: you didn't want to get 100 x4?

[05:17:50.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: with SNI, there's no reason arising from TLS why this stuff couldn't be configured per-tenant, but Apache .htaccess probably doesn't support it

[05:18:05.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I don't understand the question

[05:18:24.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I don't understand what 100 x4 means here

[05:18:27.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=hsivonen.fi you don't score a 100 points for the four categories

[05:18:47.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: "not a typical" doesn't necessarily mean "better along all axes". I just meant that you are more interested in this stuff, and willing to invest time in understanding it and getting it right. Not that you would necessarily also be better at rolling out upgrades to 10,000 users, or whatever.

[05:18:52.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: oh, I don't see a point burning CPU over AES-256

[05:19:04.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: sure

[05:19:33.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I'm not sure why I don't get 100 on key exchange

[05:20:09.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I agree that Dreamhost's defaults suck and that it makes sense to push them to fix the defaults. But I wouldn't expect it to be possible to fix whatwg.org independent of that, necessarily.

[05:22:09.0000] <annevk>
I have asked DreamHost about this

[05:22:19.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: my non-expert reasoning is: 1) there's an academic paper showing that AES-256 isn't as strong as it's supposed to be (but the attack doesn't apply to AES-128), 2) running more rounds give more opportunity for timing differences and 3) the cert is 2048-bit RSA, so if you assume all the primitives are as strong as they are supposed to be, RSA 2048 should fall before any flavor of AES

[05:22:28.0000] <annevk>
I also asked them about encrypted connections to the MySQL backend

[05:25:10.0000] <hsivonen>
oh, and it seems ssllabs takes away points for disabling SSL3, which is backwards

[05:36:59.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: did critic.hoppipolla config come from linode defaults?

[05:40:20.0000] <annevk>
There's no wiki page documenting confusion caused by TR/?

[05:40:25.0000] <annevk>
I thought we had one

[05:40:41.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Well it's a VPS not shared hosting. But I don't remember changing too much compared to the stock packages

[05:41:08.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Me too. Checked the history for sabotage? ;)

[05:41:42.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: maybe the stock packages have sad defaults

[05:41:59.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I'm guessing you are running Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora and not the latest

[05:44:20.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: can't find anything

[05:45:58.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: oh, the server signature says Ubuntu

[05:46:05.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: weird

[05:46:37.0000] <hsivonen>
I thought it was something Red Hat-flavored because of the lack of ECDHE

[05:46:43.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: what's weird? It sounds like there's something you expect to be working that isn't

[05:48:28.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: your server config seems to be of the sort "enable everything that's not obviously weak or export crypto and don't make the server enforce an order of preference"

[05:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: yet, there are no ECDHE suites, which exist on Ubuntu but not on old Red Hat-lawyered distros

[05:51:52.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I see.

[05:55:36.0000] <ondras>
so, my customelements-related issue persists

[05:55:47.0000] <ondras>
noone on #polymer seems to interact

[05:55:49.0000] <ondras>
let me re-paste here.

[05:55:52.0000] <ondras>
I am having an issue with createdCallback not called when the custom element in question is created inside a shadow root of another element

[05:58:00.0000] <ondras>
ah, perhaps the issue lies elsewhere: the createdCallback is not called when the element in question is cloned from within a <template>.content

[06:07:42.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: thanks for the information on TLS. I doubt we'll move away from DreamHost as it has a ton of implications. I guess we should just advocate them to better themselves over time and hopefully uplift a ton of other sites in the process

[08:17:27.0000] <anarchist>
can anybody here say why Web Notifications might work in all cases except when you're in Full Screen mode (including if you F11 the same browser tab but also netflix, VLC player, etc.)?

[08:18:16.0000] <anarchist>
i do have a javascript intensive application with a thick client but not sure how that might factor in (meteor.js, large-ish code base)

[08:18:32.0000] <hober>
anarchist: which browser?

[08:18:57.0000] <anarchist>
chrome and firefox both

[08:19:23.0000] <anarchist>
been digging in with chrome but i think it's all the same in firefo

[08:20:24.0000] <anarchist>
it must be my application somehow but i don't even have the window object

[08:20:38.0000] <anarchist>
so it must not be my application?

[08:21:08.0000] <anarchist>
one interesting behavior is that the notification is saved/queued up when i get back out of full screen and refocus on the tab

[08:21:19.0000] <anarchist>
so i'll get a double behavior

[08:22:42.0000] <anarchist>
i can minimize the browser, put windows over the browser, etc. but if i'm in full screen the moment the Notification fires, i'll have to wait, come back, refocus, repeat the action and i get two notifications

[08:30:33.0000] <anarchist>
it's not working at all in firefox now, but still working in chrome, don't see how that just happened

[08:57:04.0000] <annevk>
anarchist: what OS is this?

[08:57:16.0000] <annevk>
anarchist: the browser typically dispatches the notifications through the OS

[08:57:33.0000] <annevk>
anarchist: so it might depend on the implementation of the OS and whether or not it wants to show notifications when you're fullscreen

[08:57:58.0000] <annevk>
anarchist: we can't really define any of this in the standard as this is mostly up to implementations to decide what would be best UI-wise

[09:05:07.0000] <anarchist>
i see, okay well it's windows 8

[09:05:17.0000] <anarchist>
i'll look around and see if that's my lead, thanks

[09:05:40.0000] <anarchist>
i'm thinking now it's gotta be OS specific because why should it matter if i've got the file system full screened?

[09:08:50.0000] <annevk>
Windows might have decided that you don't want to be distracted if you have something fullscreen

[09:09:02.0000] <annevk>
Does not seem entirely unreasonable to me

[09:13:50.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I got word from DreamHost. They are upgrading their OS from Debian to Ubuntu. They plan on hardening further. And noted panels from registrars.pir.org and idp.godaddy.com had similar issues and that it was hard to find many A-rated TLS.

[09:14:43.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: Not very committal, but I guess it means we should check again once everything is on Ubuntu. I also just suggested to Ryan that Google could use push its partners (of which DreamHost is one) to improve on TLS

[09:16:09.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: Also, connection to MySQL databases is without encryption. They claim such connections are all within the same controlled network though.

[09:16:20.0000] <annevk>
I should probably post about this

[09:18:13.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Their response was "we suck, but so does everyone else, so please don't think about migrating"?

[09:20:44.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: well, he will tell the security team, but he believes they're looking into it already. They are making some general improvements. And yes, that he concluded with others not doing so well was not great.

[09:23:19.0000] <anarchist>
annevk: apparently there was something called Chrome Rich Notifications which could bypass Full Screen mode

[09:24:12.0000] <Hixie_>
hsivonen: validator.nu does even more poorly :-)

[09:33:58.0000] <anarchist>
okay so this is a known chrome bug, well that answers that

[09:34:27.0000] <anarchist>
and then there's a known firefox bug that closes notifications without the user doing anything. damnit

[09:41:07.0000] <smaug____>
(I believe that is a feature)

[10:18:35.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: everything okay with URLSearchParams now?

[10:21:31.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: yeah, think so

[10:21:44.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: well, modulo it being screwball :-)

[10:22:06.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1064481 was the initial triggering thing, but it is in hand

[10:22:39.0000] <jgraham>
Oh look. HTML5 is going to ask to transition to PR at W3C. It seems that 0 implementors expressed any interest one way or another in this development.

[10:28:15.0000] <jwalden>
is PR a thing now, or just a CR typo?

[10:33:20.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: Proposed Recommendation

[10:33:29.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: has always been a thing

[10:33:34.0000] <jwalden>
huh

[10:33:41.0000] <jwalden>
guess I haven't paid enough attention

[10:33:46.0000] <jwalden>
or exactly enough :-)

[10:33:48.0000] <annevk>
CR -> PR -> REC

[10:34:05.0000] <jwalden>
huh, I thought it was CR -> REC

[10:34:11.0000] <annevk>
Well this happens on TR/ so it's of no use to implementers

[10:34:38.0000] <jwalden>
:-D

[10:35:04.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: but if you're curious, http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/

[10:35:41.0000] <jwalden>
about process?  haha, good joke

[10:36:02.0000] <jwalden>
/me should have known this from the days when ->CR(?) was when we unprefixed stuff

[10:36:26.0000] <jgraham>
Now *that* is a good joke

[10:37:26.0000] <annevk>
I have to admit I'm somewhat disappointed the new iPhone thingy only went up to 401ppi

[10:38:09.0000] <annevk>
Apparently there's some Chinese phone that has 538ppi on a 5.5'' screen

[10:39:52.0000] <annevk>
Given http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2364871,00.asp we still need a bit more before we have actual retina quality

[13:17:38.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic: so, i don't know what to do about this ImageBitmap constructor promise thing. IMHO returning a rejected promise for the case of bad arguments (type checking errors) is really bad language design.

[13:17:51.0000] <Hixie_>
( https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25662 https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26517 )

[14:15:03.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: nsEscape is this totally just-so thing that may or may not happen, in certain modes of calling, to match some sorts of URL escaping algorithms, but it's nothing that claims to implement any particular spec algorithm

[14:15:20.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: I understand that

[14:15:57.0000] <jwalden>
/me would not assume any particular code that uses nsEscape, actually matches the spec algorithms that are actually supposed to be used

[14:17:39.0000] <jwalden>
Swiss army knife utility methods that are used to implement spec methods are pretty much never trustworthy, faithful implementations, in my book

[14:25:01.0000] <annevk>
Yeah... Everything URL in any implementation is suspect, really.

[14:25:09.0000] <annevk>
Bit unfortunate that is still the case in 2014

[14:27:22.0000] <caitp->
well they are kind of ridiculously complicated for such a basic thing

[14:28:06.0000] <jwalden>
URL stuff is screwball, but nsEscape is merely one instance of a pattern that generalizes beyond URLs :-)

[14:41:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: At this point, doing anything else would be gratuitously different from every other promise-returning API, not to mention requiring dirty hacks in IDL to make it work.  Don't do it.

[14:51:09.0000] <caitp->
it doesn't make a lot of sense for a constructor to return a promise at all

[14:51:17.0000] <caitp->
other than a Promise constructor

[14:56:24.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: i'm utterly baffled by this approach

[15:25:20.0000] <jmrenner>
Hey everyone, I have question about CrossOriginRequest stuff. Is there any work being done on a way to make requests without maintaining cookies (or with a private set of cookies) to allow safe communication without needing modification to the server?


2014-09-10
[18:00:32.0000] <cabanier>
promises promises

[18:02:27.0000] <terinjokes>
i have a joke about promises

[00:15:59.0000] <hober>
Hixie_: just do it a sensible way and if that doesn't match the API fashion of the month, so be it

[00:17:35.0000] <TabAtkins>
hober: That's a great way to get implementors to willfully violate the spec, which is exactly what they've publicly said they'd do if Hixie did try and do a hack around WebIDL.

[00:28:48.0000] <annevk>
If that happens Hixie_ will change the spec, so nobody loses?

[00:29:28.0000] <hober>
annevk: indeed

[00:39:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, Hixie loses, because he has to edit twice, and implementors lose, because they have to violate the spec in an undefined way to get sane behavior; forcing implementors to violate the spec because the author doesn't agree with everyone else also just generally lowers respect without any benefit.

[01:09:52.0000] <annevk>
http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/05/13/how-certificate-revocation-doesnt-work-in-practice.html is this still the case?

[02:36:54.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk, http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/TR_strikes_again

[02:41:39.0000] <astearns>
the fullscreen/dialog entry on that page doesn't specify a particular problem, as far as I can tell

[02:42:22.0000] <annevk>
astearns: I think what it's trying to state is that it's very hard to determine what the latest state of a particular piece of layout is

[02:42:44.0000] <annevk>
astearns: e.g. if I were to implement a new box creation algorithm, where do I look?

[02:43:11.0000] <annevk>
astearns: or if I implemented stacking contexts, how do I learn about http://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#new-stacking-layer

[02:43:26.0000] <annevk>
astearns: CSS is still a rather monkey patched landscape

[02:44:06.0000] <astearns>
that's a fair point, but the other links are to specific instances of harm, not general difficulties that might someday result in a problem

[02:45:17.0000] <astearns>
and your point is more about CSS modularization than TR publication

[02:48:56.0000] <annevk>
I don't disagree, I didn't create that page

[02:49:21.0000] <annevk>
It could perhaps be reframed a bit better

[02:49:39.0000] <annevk>
Perhaps we should turn it into a page like http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IETF

[02:49:50.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: ^

[03:32:35.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hopes setting .innerHTML on annotation-xml doesn't depend on the attributes of the annotation-xml node

[03:32:42.0000] <hsivonen>
/me goes read the spec

[03:40:27.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. innerHTML now depends on the attributes of the context node

[03:40:34.0000] <hsivonen>
hooray for annotation-xml

[03:45:13.0000] <annevk>
Can't we just drop support for annotation-xml?

[04:15:46.0000] <ondras>
sooo

[04:15:53.0000] <ondras>
<input> elements inside a shadow dom

[04:15:58.0000] <ondras>
are they considered when submitting a form?

[04:16:12.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I think that would be a bit drastic and rather bait-and-switchy towards the math folks

[04:44:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
ondras: They are not, afaik.

[04:49:25.0000] <ondras>
TabAtkins: okay

[04:52:46.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: can we make the spec more stupid for innerHTML on annotation-xml? is there a use case for innerHTML on annotation-xml that needs to look at the attribute?

[05:00:10.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I don't know

[05:00:41.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: in principle, if you ever set innerHTML on annotation-xml, it would be weird for it to behave differently from a full-doc parse

[05:23:26.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: that's already the case for foreign stuff due to break-out tags

[05:23:43.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: but i agree with the principle

[05:58:08.0000] <Ms2ger>
zcorpan, do you know about the websocket tests?

[05:59:06.0000] <Ms2ger>
Or jgraham

[05:59:59.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: yeah

[06:01:11.0000] <Ms2ger>
/websockets/interfaces/WebSocket/close/006.html fails with a lot of complaining dumped to the console running wptserve

[06:05:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: the console complains because the test is closing the connection before it is established

[06:05:15.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: presto passes the test with complaining in the console

[06:07:07.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: i guess gecko fails because it sync fires a close event when calling close()

[06:07:16.0000] <Ms2ger>
Might be

[06:07:16.0000] <zcorpan>
or something

[06:07:22.0000] <Ms2ger>
Blink fails too

[06:08:07.0000] <Ms2ger>
Different way, though, maybe

[06:08:12.0000] <zcorpan>
blink seems to set readyState to CLOSED immediately

[06:08:51.0000] <Ms2ger>
Yep

[06:09:43.0000] <Ms2ger>
Oh, no

[06:09:57.0000] <Ms2ger>
Gecko has closed/fired the close even before the timeout

[06:11:38.0000] <Ms2ger>
So I guess I'll file a bug on Gecko

[06:12:29.0000] <hsivonen>
so Web Sockets without TLS had some deployability problems. What caused those to be resolved with a long process with delays instead of the HTTP/2 approach of hiding everything inside TLS?

[06:12:55.0000] <hsivonen>
(just wondering about what were all the things that went wrong with Web Sockets)

[06:13:17.0000] <hsivonen>
(and whether the thing that caused delays could have been avoided with a TLS-only policy)

[06:13:48.0000] <hsivonen>
or did the concerns that lead to long delays apply to wss, too?

[06:15:21.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: what delays do you mean?

[06:16:44.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: was it intermediaries hanging on to the response until it thinks it has a full response or some such?

[06:17:05.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: delays in the process of getting the spec done

[06:20:27.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ah. so what deployability problem do you mean?

[06:20:43.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i recall there being different success rates on different ports

[06:20:45.0000] <Ms2ger>
zcorpan, (r? https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/r/2542 https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/r/2556)

[06:22:32.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: didn't some intermediaries mess up the upgrade?

[06:26:46.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i don't recall the details

[06:28:51.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/r/2542 was 100% 1 issue

[06:29:05.0000] <Ms2ger>
Dammit

[06:29:17.0000] <Ms2ger>
The dashboard really needs to distinguish those

[06:35:03.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: fair, though perhaps a usage survey could help make our case?

[06:35:18.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: though I guess once you write the code to pass around some extra state, it's not too bad either way

[06:36:46.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I think Hixie_ thought requiring TLS was too hard on authors

[06:36:54.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: but don't take my word for it

[06:37:45.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: that was before http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7258 and therefore before everyone opened their eyes to what some had been saying for a long time

[06:41:54.0000] <annevk>
es-discuss is somewhat bad at not feeding trolls. And worse at not answering actual feedback. Wrong S/N ratio :-/

[06:45:52.0000] <zenparsing>
annevk yeah - i think it used to be better a couple of years ago

[06:46:57.0000] <zenparsing>
partly it's the release cycle - features for ES6 are either done, or so late that no one really wants to debate them

[06:47:40.0000] <zenparsing>
but i've noticed that ES7 features aren't really being discussed there, which might be a bad sign

[07:45:53.0000] <zcorpan>
at least csswg doesn't subscribe to forking whatwg specs

[07:55:55.0000] <Hixie_>
hober: APIs being inconsistent is even worse than being bad, IMHO.

[07:56:34.0000] <Hixie_>
hober: but it definitely does make me reluctant about using promises in general

[07:57:26.0000] <caitp>
bad apis and inconsistent apis are equally bad

[07:57:41.0000] <Hixie_>
not imho

[07:58:09.0000] <Hixie_>
a bad api that's consistent is easier to use than a variety of good apis all of which have different philosophies

[07:59:39.0000] <caitp>
the point is, you don't want to come up with bad apis, you want to come up with good apis which are adopted

[07:59:43.0000] <caitp>
being bad isn't going to help adoption

[08:00:30.0000] <Hixie_>
adopted by whom? implements or authors?

[08:00:52.0000] <Ms2ger>
The Promise fanclub

[08:01:13.0000] <zenparsing>
Hixie_ i'm sympathetic to your position wrt promise-returning functions throwing, but...

[08:01:41.0000] <zenparsing>
Hixie_ in the end, as users move to async functions, it will matter less and less

[08:02:01.0000] <Hixie_>
or more and more :-)

[08:02:09.0000] <caitp>
in the fuuuuuuuuture

[08:03:20.0000] <zenparsing>
less and less:  async function f() { await gimmePromise(x) } doesn't really matter if gimmePromise throws or rejects

[08:05:49.0000] <caitp>
from a programme correctness standpoint, you do want the early error, otherwise there's a chance you might not notice

[08:06:34.0000] <Hixie_>
zenparsing: i think that behaviour for async is dumb too

[08:07:12.0000] <Hixie_>
zenparsing: i fully expect authors to never check for these error conditions, which is going to lead to all kinds of bugs when their rejection handlers get called for reasons unrelated to what they're expecting

[08:07:28.0000] <Hixie_>
just like they never check them today, except today it's fine because it just aborts script execution

[08:10:52.0000] <caitp>
but even if async did make it better, who knows when a platform with the async sugar will exist, why design for a hypothetical future platform

[08:17:09.0000] <zenparsing>
Hixie_ once async functions are in, manually wiring up rejection handlers will be the exception i think

Hi guys! I was trying to implement CSS 'background-size' property in my project.

[22:30:10.0000] <kazi>
But that produced "unknown vendor extension" in a validator

[22:32:55.0000] <kazi>
I used "-moz-" and "-webkit-". Is there any suggestion to pass the validation process however.?

[22:33:06.0000] <kazi>
I need to have "background-size: cover;" in my CSS

[22:43:06.0000] <zewt>
not worth worrying about

[22:46:35.0000] <hemanth__>
has chrome implemented the Stream API?

[22:51:42.0000] <hemanth__>
I find a window.Stream not sure which Stream is that. [Didn't find any API docs for the same]

[23:28:32.0000] <cabanier>
TabAtkins: how can I link to a constructor with bikeshed? It doesn't seem to be working for me

[23:37:43.0000] <TabAtkins>
cabanier: Should just be linkable like any other function (though it has type "constructor", not " method "), but sometimes it generates weird titles; I need to fix that.

[23:38:21.0000] <cabanier>
TabAtkins: OK. I will experiment a bit more. It doesn't seem to link with a constructor in the idl

[23:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you force generation, see what title attr it gets.

annevk, sounds more like "I really don't have anything to back this up"

[01:29:21.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: well yeah, typical argument from authority fallacy

[01:34:11.0000] <MikeSmith>
when the list of standards you were the main force for starts with TTML I guess people have a right to question how much authority that merits you

[01:41:34.0000] <Ms2ger>
The refusal to let you find the children of a commit must be one of the most infuriating misfeatures of git

[01:59:21.0000] <jgraham>
Ms2ger: Not that surprising given the data model (but also possible with a little effort)

[02:05:32.0000] <Ms2ger>
jgraham, critic handles it fine

[02:08:24.0000] <jgraham>
Ms2ger: Right but critic presumably caches it locally

(e.g. in the database)

[02:17:54.0000] <Philip`>
Ms2ger: I think whenever I want to do that, I do something like "git branch -a --contains $REV" and choose which branch is the one I care about, then "git log $BRANCH" and search for $REV

[02:48:18.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: the resolution (which implies calling the onFulfilled callback defined above) is supposed to be async?

[02:48:31.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: because you set the isFulfilled flag *after* the .resolve() ends..

hmm. the spec defines the annotation-xml stuff in terms of the start tag token

Before "extensible Web" was cool, I (and others) argued for Web Audio to be low-level primitives we could build on with JS. Google pushed to standardize and ship what they'd already implemented --- the built-in functionality they knew audio professionals wanted.

[04:30:19.0000] <roc>
Google people including ... Chris Wilson.

[04:39:16.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests/pull/50 I have very little clue if I'm using this github thing right.

[04:40:55.0000] <jgraham>
roc: People rewriting history to make their own position seem like it has been logically consistent all along is a type of cognitive bias. They don't even necessarily realise that they're doing it, or to what extent.

[04:41:18.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: It seems like you are

[04:43:29.0000] <roc>
jgraham: yeah. And, people are allowed to learn and change their minds.

[04:43:33.0000] <roc>
it's just annoying.

[04:44:41.0000] <jgraham>
Well I don't know about this "letting people learn" theory. It's not something we look for in politicians!

[05:16:33.0000] <Domenic>
ondras: nope, it was in 1.0.

[05:16:48.0000] <ondras>
interesting.

[05:17:01.0000] <ondras>
my 1.0-compliant impl now fails due to sync fulfillment

[05:17:06.0000] <ondras>
well, time to fix the code.

[05:17:36.0000] <Domenic>
probably just better test coverage, sorry :P

[05:17:52.0000] <ondras>
yeah, np

[05:18:05.0000] <ondras>
/me is actually quite happy that there is about a bazillion tests now

[05:34:15.0000] <cwilso___>
roc: I know you did.  And in some ways, the media streams concept was quite right.  In others, it was not.  I still believe that offering ONLY those low-level primitives - i.e. expecting every developer to come up with their own convolution.js, dynamics.js, biquad.js - would have been a bad idea for the utility of audio on the web.  However, I will point

[05:34:15.0000] <cwilso___>
out...

[05:34:33.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: testing the number of getter calls for returnedValue.then seems a bit strict to me, though

[05:34:54.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: imagine a code "if (value.then) value.then(...)" which fails. is that really a mistake?

[05:35:03.0000] <Domenic>
ondras: yes

[05:35:18.0000] <cwilso___>
1) my first face-to-face contact with Chris Rogers was arguing with him to make worker-based script processors.  It took me another year or so to fully understand how broken the current script processors are.

[05:35:54.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: any usecase that will explain this particular scenario to me?

[05:36:06.0000] <Domenic>
ondras: interop in the face of poorly-behaved then methods

[05:36:19.0000] <Domenic>
we could either spec "access .then twice" or "access it once"; we chose the latter.

[05:36:32.0000] <ondras>
hmm.

[05:36:42.0000] <ondras>
what about "accessing .then is idempotent"... :-)

[05:37:25.0000] <cwilso___>
2) I was not rewriting history at all (presuming this is in ref to EWS) - I made it clear this journey of layering and attempt to architecturally layer Web Audio was in response to the TAG's review of about a year ago, not that it was that way all along.  If that did not come out in the notes, or if I was not clear enough about it, I apologize.

[05:40:50.0000] <darobin>
jgraham: how far do you reckon you are from landing your TestTWF docs improvements?

[05:42:59.0000] <cwilso___>
I hope that I've been clear, in my occasional nose-poking in the media list, that I do think we need to build that lower-level primitive set - for example, exposing multiple interfaces/devices.  Yes, in some ways that is backing into what you attempted to push several years ago.  I think there is more to it than that; but at any rate:

[05:43:00.0000] <darobin>
(people here at the EWS want to join but we don't want them to read the wrong crap)

[05:44:23.0000] <jgraham>
darobin: Umm, I think the update is basically done, but to actually land it I might need to either have access to the main repo or get someone who has access to do the landing (because some travis setup is needed)

[05:44:40.0000] <jgraham>
(also we need a new repo with the w3c account)

[05:44:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: new repo?

[05:45:30.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: The travis-based solution I have uses two repos, one for source and one for generated content rather than two unrelated branches in the same repo

[05:45:47.0000] <jgraham>
Seemed to work better with Travis and kind of seems cleaner

[05:46:11.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah I remember now

[05:46:40.0000] <darobin>
wait, which repo do you need access to?

[05:46:42.0000] <cwilso___>
yes you deserve credit for presciently pushing for low-level primitives.  I do still think providing the higher-level functionality audio professionals (and non-professionals) want is (and was) important; but that should not be the only level.  No, I do not claim to have always known all of this, nor am I attempting to say I've always felt precisely as I do

[05:46:42.0000] <cwilso___>
now.

[05:48:39.0000] <jgraham>
darobin: Let me think…

[05:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
darobin: So probably what I need is 1) to push the updates to the contributing file 2) For someone to create a testtwf-website-src repo (or to use the existing repo as the src repo and create a testtwf-website-generated repo and reconfigure the DNS stuff to use that) 3) Someone to generate an encrypted token to use for deployment on travis with the GIT_NAME, GIT_EMAIL and GH_TOKEN variables. This involves first deciding on a user to use (or creating

[05:56:07.0000] <jgraham>
... OAuth token for travis to use

[05:57:18.0000] <jgraham>
travis encrypt 'GIT_NAME="Your Committer Name" GIT_EMAIL=committer⊙ec GH_TOKEN=oAuthToken

[05:58:54.0000] <cwilso___>
roc/jgraham: in short, I'll stand by the "we needed to enable audio magic (cf https://twitter.com/brucel/status/510007267522256896), but yes, we should have looked more closely at the primitives."

[06:08:43.0000] <annevk>
I doubt roc was opposed to doing higher-level at some point, just opposed until some library work was done, which would be roughly in line with the extweb party line

[06:09:33.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if there is a scedule for a higher level API on top of IndexedDB…

[06:18:40.0000] <roc>
cwilso___: I wasn't accusing you of rewriting history , that was jgraham :-).

[06:21:36.0000] <roc>
Your position has obviously evolved, and that's cool.

[06:25:22.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure that I accused anyone of anything more than being human

[06:31:35.0000] <cwilso___>
My panties are not in a bunch here.  Just explaining the context of what I said, since I wasn't speaking at great length there, and I didn't want to be the source of your teeth-gnashing.  At least, not for that reason.

[06:32:12.0000] <roc>
ta

[06:33:53.0000] <cwilso___>
annevk: yes, if extweb had been a thing then, it might have swayed me to push Chris Rogers harder.  If I'd deeply understood the web audio architecture, at least.

jgraham: so, I'm being too distracted by the summit at the same time in order to properly process your needs here; but it sounds like something I could do. Do you mind sending me an email or some such?

[07:38:16.0000] <Ms2ger>
darobin, do you have any examples of kicking out jerks?

[07:38:33.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: from where?

[07:38:56.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: I'm not exactly sure what your question is

[07:39:04.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: there's ample precedent for conferences for instance

[07:39:11.0000] <jgraham>
darobin: Sure

[07:39:15.0000] <Ms2ger>
I saw the quote "If anyone acts like a jerk we kick them out" on twitter

[07:39:17.0000] <darobin>
jgraham: ta

[07:39:52.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: right, yes, the idea is that people who act like jerks, after fair warning and no matter how good they are at the tech, can get blocked

[07:40:19.0000] <darobin>
also, the idea is that you can tell someone "please stop being a jerk" and give them a chance to retract whatever

[07:40:21.0000] <Ms2ger>
In, say, HTMLWG or WebApps?

[07:40:41.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: oh, I wasn't talking about W3C (though I'd hope it'd move there too)

[07:40:55.0000] <darobin>
I meant in places like Discourse and the stuff we're looking at building around it

[07:41:00.0000] <darobin>
e.g. in GH comments on specs

[07:41:04.0000] <Ms2ger>
I see

[07:41:11.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: do you have a specific concern?

[07:41:20.0000] <Ms2ger>
I was thinking of one particular jerk

[07:41:30.0000] <darobin>
I won't venture a guess :)

[07:41:58.0000] <Ms2ger>
I'll just narrow it to someone with 40 years standards experience

[07:42:05.0000] <SteveF>
/me everybody has their own favourite jerk to kick

[07:42:30.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: somehow I was thinking you had that in mind :)

[07:42:50.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: he's certainly one of the use cases I have in mind

[07:43:18.0000] <Ms2ger>
Would be nice to have such a policy at W3C, of course

[07:43:54.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: https://github.com/webspecs/specs.webplatform.org/blob/master/src/render/policy/anti-jerk.html

[07:44:09.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: yes. My hope is that if we build something successful then the policy can spread

[07:44:13.0000] <darobin>
that's how it happened with conferences

[07:44:29.0000] <darobin>
a few cool conferences started having anti-jerk policies, and now most do (in our world)

[07:45:22.0000] <jgraham>
That policy is probably too "fun" to be useful.

[07:45:58.0000] <jgraham>
Most of the instances of disruptive behaviour I have witnessed haven't been harassment, which is the only thing really called out

[07:48:48.0000] <darobin>
jgraham: I am happy to refine it over time, this was just my first shot

[07:48:59.0000] <darobin>
that said, I don't want to make it a processy thing; it's a spirit thing

[07:49:37.0000] <darobin>
you can call out things the way you think they are already though, e.g. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014JulSep/0516.html

[07:50:37.0000] <Ms2ger>
darobin, ++, but I don't believe that'll change his behaviour

[07:51:24.0000] <darobin>
Ms2ger: yeah, I know — but if people start ignoring that sort of statement instead of starting useless threads from it (which I think can be a change of behaviour) then it works too

[07:51:43.0000] <darobin>
we can implement some form of social hellbanning

[07:51:55.0000] <darobin>
which is, after all, what "don't feed the troll" used to be for

[07:52:22.0000] <darobin>
/me wonders if Discourse supports hellbanning, needs checking

[07:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, so the problem with a "spirit" thing rather than a "clear guidelines" thing is that people who are determined will ignore the spirit and then when they are called out on their behaviour will complain that they are being silenced and argue that they didn't break any actual rules. Or there will implicitly be one set of rules for people that the list moderators know and like and a different set for everyone else.

[07:54:17.0000] <darobin>
jgraham: I know, but the alternative is bureaucracy

[07:54:28.0000] <darobin>
that said, I will absolutely take improvements

[07:55:46.0000] <SteveF>
> Or there will implicitly be one set of rules for people that the list moderators know and like and a different set for everyone else. - happens all the time

[07:56:10.0000] <darobin>
SteveF: that only happens if you formally have moderators

[07:56:34.0000] <darobin>
that said, I'd get more pissed off at someone I know who's supposed to know better than to troll, than at a newcomer who might not be familiar with the stuff

[07:57:04.0000] <jgraham>
I don't think it only happens if you formally have moderators at all

[07:57:31.0000] <jgraham>
It's just the halo effect

hsivonen: i noticed because the "HTML - <img>" component read "HTML -"

[09:04:42.0000] <zcorpan>
on the search page or so

[09:21:58.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: perhaps file a bug on Bugzilla?

[09:22:33.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: need to check if it happens in a newer bugzilla

[09:57:06.0000] <jgraham>
Anyone know if "bundle" is a thing that gets installed with ruby gems, or something you have to install seperately?

[09:57:38.0000] <jgraham>
Looks like it's seperate

[10:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: I think the only newer bugzilla you're likely to find is https://bugzilla.mozilla.org

[10:01:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm or I guess 4.4.5 is the more recent than the w3c instance but I don't know who might be running that or anything in between 4.4.2 and that

[10:09:03.0000] <annevk>
It's kind of annoying that with e10s all TLS dialogs are broken

[10:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Is there a bug?

[10:14:51.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: good question. I suspect there is, but have not looked

[10:16:12.0000] <annevk>
I cannot find anything, will file a bug

[10:21:22.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: checked with cpeterson, he's filing a bug

[10:26:46.0000] <jgraham>
ap: Great

[10:26:50.0000] <jgraham>
uh

[10:26:53.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Great

TabAtkins: could you please reply to the matches() / closest() thread?

[10:28:18.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: apparently we want to land our implementation but it's blocking on a decision on :scope in closest()

Philip`: I have a DNS entry "*.philip 	A 	92.243.11.39"

[10:59:25.0000] <annevk>
Philip`: that might cause problems with HSTS

[10:59:36.0000] <annevk>
odinho: same goes for you

[10:59:56.0000] <annevk>
odinho: "odinho 	CNAME 	html5.s0.no."

[11:08:08.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: how so?

[11:08:29.0000] <mathiasbynens>
http://odinho.html5.org/ would get SSL + HSTS; HSTS would not affect http://html5.s0.no/

[11:10:44.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: btw, *.html5.org is on a shared host, so we have to use SNI… which means no support for IE on WinXP

[11:11:41.0000] <mathiasbynens>
(i don’t really care, but it may affect people wishing to run *.html5.org-hosted tests on oldIE — they’d have to click through a few warnings)

[11:14:17.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I know, see my blog

[11:14:45.0000] <mathiasbynens>
/me had missed it!

[11:15:02.0000] <mathiasbynens>
/me still wishes for an @annevkbot twitter account

[11:15:05.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: hmm, I guess I can offer those people something else

[11:15:07.0000] <annevk>
heh

[11:15:32.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: it does seem bad to CNAME another server that does not use TLS and then claim stuff is secure

[11:18:17.0000] <mathiasbynens>
hmm

[11:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I have no idea what HSTS is, so I don't know if that matters

[11:19:21.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Philip`: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security

[11:19:28.0000] <annevk>
Philip`: perfect configuration requires all subdomains to use TLS

[11:19:29.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: It looks like the only subdomain that's still occasionally used is fonts.philip.html5.org

[11:19:49.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: (and that's an obsolete service anyway)

[12:51:58.0000] <odinho>
annevk: You can nuke mine, a few links will break and all, -- and it's a rather nice hostname, but I don't use it enough to hold off on your perfect rating :]

[13:31:26.0000] <kamome_>
 Hi, on schema.org, for openinghours, there is an example withe the time element: itemprop="openingHours" datetime="Tu,Th 16:00-20:00"

[13:32:00.0000] <kamome_>
But that doesn't validate (that datetime is not valid) - what would be the right way to mark this up?

[13:32:09.0000] <kamome_>
If there is such a way ...

[13:33:14.0000] <kamome_>
In fact, I'm looking for a solutionfor datetime="Mo-Su 07:00-22:00", if that makes a difference.

[13:36:13.0000] <Hixie_>
kamome_: use a <data itemprop="openingHourse" value="Tu,..."> instead of <time>

[14:30:30.0000] <kamome_>
<Hixie_>: Thanks, will try that.

[14:42:45.0000] <annevk>
odinho: Philip`: ok, I guess we'll see how it goes

[14:43:05.0000] <annevk>
odinho: Philip`: if those services break, you have been warned, if we can keep them working, so much the better

[14:48:02.0000] <thin>
Hello.

[14:48:19.0000] <thin>
Does anyone remember a proposal by a member of the Chrome team about

[14:48:28.0000] <thin>
using most semantic class names in your markup

[14:48:38.0000] <thin>
and then having a new kind of script halfway between js and css

[14:49:13.0000] <thin>
that you would use to select elements based on their semantic class name, and then on the fly add the truck load of OOCSS class names that are so popular lately

[14:49:25.0000] <thin>
and then after that the real css and js files are applied.

[14:49:31.0000] <thin>
Anyone remember? Have a link?

[14:51:38.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: It seems to me that sort of message is only important insofar as it stands in the way of whatever your actual goals are. If it doesn't it seems like the best thing is to ignore it

[14:52:53.0000] <Hixie_>
thin: i don't recall such a proposal, but fwiw the HTML spec a few years ago had something based on "semantic class names" and it didn't go down well

[14:54:35.0000] <thin>
I don’t think it was the kind of proposal to show up on the radar of the offical whatwg or w3c stuff but it was a seriously written blog post by someone who I think worked at google on chrome.

[14:56:57.0000] <thin>
I basically said. Avoid using classnames like .blue in your actual markup. Use .branding. Then in this new scripting language sandwiched after dom ready but before css or js is applied, you’d select dom nodes based on their sensible class names and add to them all the mess OOCSS class names you want. And then the css and js happen.

[14:57:02.0000] <thin>
Still doesn’t ring a bell?

[14:58:21.0000] <Hixie_>
thin: maybe try #chromium or #blink?

[14:58:23.0000] <jgraham>
thin: I don't know what OOCSS is, or what behaviour the "semantic" classnames would have beyond whatever the scripts/stylesheets applied

[15:01:04.0000] <thin>
jgraham: it’s an approach to css styling that promises flexibility through inheritance but to me it just looks like class=“blue-gradient-background white-text” all over again.

[15:03:50.0000] <jgraham>
thin: Well it sounds like what you're talking about is something a library would implement, not a browser

[16:04:51.0000] <Hixie_>
anyone got IE who can test http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=3099 for me?

[16:05:09.0000] <Hixie_>
i just need the output in the "Rendered view:" bit. This is for https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25929

[16:09:04.0000] <kamome_>
Hixie: Thanks again, data for openingHours works for validator.w3.org as well as for www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets

[16:09:11.0000] <Hixie_>
coolio


2014-09-12
[17:04:42.0000] <kamome_>
Hixie: Also reportet to schema.org (and answered a few questions on SE/SO)

[20:35:12.0000] <roc>
wow, James Salsman is still alive!

[20:37:26.0000] <roc>
at CMU in the mid-90s Salsman was already fading into legend

[23:13:09.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: I'm not sure I follow

[23:14:26.0000] <annevk>
Seems StartSSL and sleevi_ had a short Twitter exchange, lol

[23:30:07.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm somewhat uneasy about using StartSSL and going crazy with minting certs that cost nothing to mint after identity validation, because each cert minted there *might* cost $25 later if there's a need to revoke

[23:30:42.0000] <hsivonen>
still, for wildcards, $60 plus maybe $25 later is better than $150 up front

[23:31:14.0000] <hsivonen>
for non-wildcards, $15 up front may be better than $25 later if it happens to be a Heartbleed year

[23:32:19.0000] <hsivonen>
FWIW, the reason why my site doesn't have a StartSSL cert is that I got an "XMPP cert" from StartSSL for hsivonen.fi and then tried to mint a Web server cert for hsivonen.fi

[23:32:52.0000] <hsivonen>
StartSSL didn't allow me to mint two certs for hsivonen.fi and wanted me to revoke the first one

[23:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the revocation would have cost more than a new cert from Gandi

[23:33:23.0000] <hsivonen>
dunno if this works differently when you've been identity validated for $60

[23:39:47.0000] <annevk>
I think I would still have to pay for revocation

[23:40:41.0000] <annevk>
It seems like they could automate revocation as well though and make that free too

[23:41:25.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: charging for revocation is consistent with their business model of charging for things that cost them money

[23:41:36.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: the revocation infrastructure costs them money

[23:41:58.0000] <annevk>
Because of the traffic?

[23:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
which is sad, considering how useless the revocation infrastructure is currently

[23:42:06.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: right

[23:42:18.0000] <annevk>
I saw revocation basically only works if you use EV

[23:42:26.0000] <annevk>
At least in 2013

[23:42:35.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I believe that's correct

[23:44:29.0000] <hsivonen>
(I really need to find the time to add SNI support to Validator.nu)

[23:44:52.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: you implement TLS yourself?

[23:44:59.0000] <hsivonen>
(the main reason why validator.nu isn't behind https already is the ridicule of it not being able to validate itself if it were)

[23:45:19.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: no. I mean upgrading enough things to make SNI work

[23:45:37.0000] <annevk>
Why could it not validate itself?

[23:45:44.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: including upgrading HttpClient, whose new version is API-incomptabile and requires me to rewrite a bunch of stuff

[23:46:19.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I'm not going to buy IP addresses for each host name, so it would be SNI, but V.nu can't connect with SNI as a client

[23:46:52.0000] <hsivonen>
for the server piece, I'd probable terminate TLS in nginx instead of Java

[23:46:55.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: oh I see, so you could not validate whatwg.org once we'd add HSTS

[23:47:31.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: the validator doesn't know about HSTS, but it would follow a redirect and then fail

[23:47:46.0000] <annevk>
That's what I meant, yes

[23:48:49.0000] <hsivonen>
also, to make Java approximate browser behavior as a clien, I'd need to upgrade to OpenJDK 8

[23:49:26.0000] <hsivonen>
last I checked, it hadn't been packaged for Ubuntu yet

[23:49:27.0000] <hsivonen>
/me goes check again

[23:49:28.0000] <hsivonen>
(still better than implementing UTF-8 myself for PHP way back when)

[23:50:22.0000] <hsivonen>
still not openjdk-8 in trusty

[23:51:33.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: did StartSSL want you to mint a certificate for both XMPP and web usage?

[23:52:54.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: their UI suggests that XMPP certs and Web certs are different

[23:53:04.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: Prosody's tools suggest the same

[23:53:16.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I *think* XMPP certs have some weird OIDs

[23:53:21.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I don't know why

[23:53:33.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: agreed, so I'm wondering what they wanted you to do for the XMPP certificate

[23:54:06.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: probably the expectation was that I'd mint it for a different host name or something

[23:54:16.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: dunno if that part of the UI was well tested

[23:54:37.0000] <hsivonen>
the UI for sure doesn't warn you about stuff like this

[23:55:31.0000] <annevk>
It's interesting that there were still people involved for that part

[23:55:42.0000] <annevk>
I thought that once you had a domain validated, you could just issue away

[23:56:31.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I don't think there were any people involved

[23:57:06.0000] <hsivonen>
the UI just said that if I wanted a Web server cert for hsivonen.fi, I should revoke the XMPP cert I had already minted

[23:57:20.0000] <hsivonen>
with no UI warning about traps like this when minting the XMPP cert

[23:57:42.0000] <annevk>
That is really too bad

[23:58:52.0000] <annevk>
I think I only want web so I'm probably good. Although maybe at some point I can figure out email...

[00:09:03.0000] <annevk>
mounir: it's extremely unclear what commit actually fixed my issues with screen orientation

[00:09:20.0000] <annevk>
mounir: the handling of comments was rather terrible from a reviewer's perspective

[01:01:32.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: the "HTML - <img>" bugzilla bug doesn't reproduce in bugzilla.mozilla.org afaict

[01:06:48.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: ok

[01:07:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me considers looking through changelogs to see when it was fixed

[01:08:08.0000] <hsivonen>
Ubuntu Utopic has openjdk-8 in Universe

[01:08:33.0000] <hsivonen>
should I host V.nu on a prerelease OS?

[01:09:26.0000] <hsivonen>
surely it would be natural to backport openjdk-8 to Trusty

[01:09:30.0000] <hsivonen>
but it's not there

[01:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I run debian testing on my server, so I'd vote yes

[01:15:48.0000] <MikeSmith>
though if you do it I'd suggest you don't have it set to do (apt) autoupdate

[01:19:39.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: wow. living on the edge

[01:23:00.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: http://jiggity.com/steve.html is nice

[01:23:16.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: Steve Jobs fanfic

[01:26:58.0000] <tantek>
annevk that's amazing

[01:28:44.0000] <ondras>
  844 passing (35s)

[01:28:44.0000] <ondras>
  28 failing

[01:28:52.0000] <ondras>
promises tests be damned.

[01:38:22.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: so now my promise impl passes all 872 tests, but the test runner seems to "freeze" after reporting all success. Looks like there is an infinite eventloop (strace reports epoll_wait calls)...

[01:38:41.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: do you have any suggestion regarding this? Is it possible that this behavior is caused by my impl?

[01:39:00.0000] <ondras>
(I am using the "promises-aplus-tests" node package)

[02:04:30.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: ah, somehow "adopting state of another promise" results in an infinite settimeout loop (in my impl) while passing the test suite .)

[02:14:55.0000] <niloy>
Is there anyway I can get window.performace.timing info for ajax calls?

[02:28:15.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: the <hgroup> example in http://html5.org/r/8759 shows some unimplemented things in v.nu

[02:30:49.0000] <mounir>
annevk: sorry about that, I think I used another PR to fix the issue you pointed

[02:31:13.0000] <mounir>
annevk: I might have "CC'd" you, not 100% certain

[02:38:13.0000] <hsivonen>
Is this Blink behavior supported by the spec http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3177 ?

[02:38:43.0000] <hsivonen>
I want to argue we should put "bar" in the HTML namespace

[02:39:09.0000] <hsivonen>
/me goes read the spec

[02:43:30.0000] <hsivonen>
aargh. Blink's behavior is correct per spec

[02:43:37.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not sure I like this

[02:47:23.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie_: is it intentional that the HTML fragment parsing algorithm can now create nodes that aren't in any of the HTML, SVG and MathML namespaces?

[02:54:51.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Woah

[02:56:09.0000] <jgraham>
Although I guess it somewhat matches what you might expect

[03:13:29.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: that's not what i expected at least

[03:24:49.0000] <annevk>
It's somewhat unexpected that the <div> is still in the HTML namespace

[03:26:18.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, the fact that it's different for the two elements is pretty weird

[03:29:51.0000] <Domenic>
ondras: wow! If you can write a test that fails would love to have that in the suite :)

[04:00:02.0000] <annevk>
Anyone have a reference to that post where Hixie_ references all the editions of the <canvas> spec?

[04:04:28.0000] <Ms2ger>
Don't find anything in my inbox

[04:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Got any time for https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/r/2555 ? (seems to be a small XHR test fixup)

[04:20:43.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: done

[04:20:57.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: would be nice if it automatically merged afterwards if it could

[04:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, there was an idea to have a "Merge" button in the critic UI, but it didn't happen because I didn't figure out the permissions issues. Although maybe it could just work with the critic bot user.

[04:24:43.0000] <Ms2ger>
But travis

[06:49:30.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: about <hgroup> what's an example of something that's not implemented in v.nu?

[06:49:48.0000] <MikeSmith>
(the escaped markup in the source is pretty hard to read)

[06:50:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks at the corresponding rendered part in the spec

[06:50:51.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: onclose, method=dialog, inputmode, autocomplete

[06:51:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[07:16:23.0000] <MikeSmith>
where is onclose specified?

[07:17:29.0000] <MikeSmith>
nm

[07:18:15.0000] <Ms2ger>
What onclose?

[07:18:28.0000] <Ms2ger>
Oh, dialog

[07:19:01.0000] <foolip>
mounir: pong, a few days later :)

[07:39:22.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: one down https://github.com/validator/syntax/commit/759f868090c28137f420bde9b139ec6da21ef121 and looking at the rest now

[07:39:54.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: awesome!

[07:55:49.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/2014Sep/0099.html and this is only identified now?

[07:55:58.0000] <annevk>
o_O (need a bigger O)

[07:57:20.0000] <jgraham>
Well I think they got the wrong idea tbh. What they should work on is not having "errata" as a thing.

[07:58:42.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, "Bad value walletSetup.continue(this.returnValue) for attribute onclose on element dialog: missing name after . operator"

[07:58:59.0000] <jgraham>
It's probably worth considering why bz got that response when the same thing has been said in different ways for a number of years

[08:04:35.0000] <annevk>
Well yeah, errata as such is not really the problem. It's specifications being out of date

[09:06:53.0000] <Hixie_>
jgraham: he looks to me to have gotten the same response as everyone else

[09:07:29.0000] <Hixie_>
jgraham: "oh so problem is [restate problem in a way that's easier to do in a bureaucracy]*? *don't do anything*"

[09:07:39.0000] <Hixie_>
uh, with one less *

[09:08:37.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: http://damowmow.com/temp/canvas-specs but please copy-paste rather than referencing, and note that that is itself somewhat out of date now

[09:09:16.0000] <Hixie_>
hsivonen: it is not intentional that the HTML fragment parsing algorithm can now create nodes that aren't in any of the HTML, SVG and MathML namespaces, but i must admit to not having paid enough attention to the fragment case

[09:12:09.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie_: Perhaps. It seemed to me that there was a lot less denying that there was an issue when an implementor who is not noted as someone with a stake in the spec-political-process came along and said "the W3C is failing me". But I could just be projecting what I thought ought to happen.

[09:12:40.0000] <Hixie_>
i have often felt that, in the moment, jeff has completely agreed with what i've said

[09:12:42.0000] <jgraham>
s/failing me/failing me, and here's a specific example/

[09:13:11.0000] <Hixie_>
only to find that my request gets completely corrupted and turned into something much less useful over time, and eventually results in a change that is of no use to me

[09:13:32.0000] <Hixie_>
so the proof here will be in whether errata are trivial to issue six months from now

[09:14:16.0000] <jgraham>
It is certianly true that change has been somewhere between slow and non-existant

[09:14:19.0000] <Ms2ger>
That's not the question

[09:14:29.0000] <Ms2ger>
The question is if they are issued, not if they can be

[09:15:07.0000] <Hixie_>
that too

[09:15:20.0000] <Hixie_>
that's actually the key way in which jeff made it sound like he agreed with bz but didn't really

[09:15:40.0000] <Hixie_>
notice how he changed a question of fundamental priorities into a question of volume of red tape

[09:17:42.0000] <Hixie_>
zcorpan: man, you're awesome. thanks. (re https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26786 in this case, but also in general)

[09:25:22.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie_: thank you :-)

[09:27:54.0000] <Hixie_>
i wonder why </template> gives a parse error

[09:28:00.0000] <Hixie_>
it shouldn't, right...?

[09:28:29.0000] <Hixie_>
i should test this with my parser, see what i get there...

[09:35:29.0000] <Hixie_>
any IE users able to test http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=3099 for me?

[09:36:17.0000] <Domenic>
IE11 latest updates [object Event] (same task)

[09:36:18.0000] <Domenic>
[object PageTransitionEvent] (same task)

[09:36:27.0000] <Hixie_>
cool, thanks

[09:36:47.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: I removed the spec splitter from html5.org btw

[09:37:20.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: cool

[09:37:31.0000] <Hixie_>
spec splitting now happens inline with the spec generation

[09:37:41.0000] <Hixie_>
dunno if anyone's noticed, but that means the split version doesn't lag behind anymore

[09:39:51.0000] <Hixie_>
oh, same task / same task implies IE11 is buggy in its media element handling

[09:39:53.0000] <Hixie_>
great

[09:39:53.0000] <Hixie_>
ok

[09:46:35.0000] <Hixie_>
can anyone figure out why <!DOCTYPE HTML><template><li></template> has a parse error?

[09:47:52.0000] <caitp->
is that question going to be on the exam?

[09:47:57.0000] <Hixie_>
yes

[09:49:05.0000] <Hixie_>
woah

[09:49:09.0000] <Hixie_>
it's a bug in my parser

[09:49:15.0000] <Hixie_>
but that implies two browsers have had the same exact bug

[09:52:04.0000] <caitp->
a bug in the extremely complicated html parser doesn't seem unthinkable to me

[09:52:13.0000] <Hixie_>
this bug was trivial

[09:52:26.0000] <Hixie_>
i just hadn't included all the elements in the "generate all implied end tags thoroughly" logic

[09:52:29.0000] <Hixie_>
but i wonder why

[09:55:55.0000] <cwilso>
Hixie: just filed Web Audio issue on that HTML bug, feel free to close the HTML one.

[09:59:41.0000] <Hixie_>
coolio, thanks

[11:12:51.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: any idea how i should phrase http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content.html#concept-media-load-algorithm step 9:otherwise:1's "as nodes are inserted and removed" steps?

[11:50:30.0000] <dmurph>
annevk: I'm looking at the "clone" discussion in the fetch spec here: https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/372#issuecomment-52751957 Is the design is close enough to settled to start specing and implementing?

[11:51:43.0000] <slightlyoff>
Yes.

[11:53:55.0000] <dmurph>
cool, thx

[12:15:53.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic: i don't understand why an uncaught rejection should be a big deal

[12:16:53.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic: if you don't want to catch it, then it should surely just be ignored, just like if you don't hook the onerror handler on an <img> element.

[12:19:23.0000] <ehsan>
JakeA: ping

[12:20:45.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie_: onerror provides a global hook for sync errors, so you don't need a try { ... } catch (e) { ... } around every code entry point. We want the same for async errors.

[12:24:26.0000] <zenparsing>
Hixie_ promise rejections can also arise out of standard programming bugs, like identifier misspellings and such

[12:26:01.0000] <Hixie_>
zenparsing: that's a bug in the design of promises, though.

[12:26:21.0000] <caitp->
it is, but it isn't super likely to change

[12:26:27.0000] <zenparsing>
Hixie_ heh, you're not going to win that one : )

[12:26:48.0000] <Hixie_>
yeah. so now that bug is turning into me having to do work to work around the bad design i already complained about.

[12:26:51.0000] <Hixie_>
sigh.

[12:26:57.0000] <Hixie_>
it's <picture> all over again

[12:30:34.0000] <caitp->
:[

[12:43:55.0000] <JakeA>
ehsan: hey, I'm cramming for my jsconf talk right now, then sleep. I'll organise a call to go over the API generality stuff

[12:44:22.0000] <ehsan>
JakeA: sounds good, I commented on the issue fwiw, nothing urgent

[12:45:00.0000] <JakeA>
ehsan: will reply

[12:45:27.0000] <ehsan>
ta

[13:26:30.0000] <annevk>
dmurph: yeah, everything apart from the clone() method is defined now

[13:27:02.0000] <annevk>
dmurph: I expect to define clone() as creating a copy of everything and a tee of the stream (not sure what that means yet, waiting for the streams primitive to be better defined for that)

[13:27:22.0000] <annevk>
dmurph: ought to mean about the same as the request cloning that's already going on in UAs today

[13:28:58.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: the insertion and removing steps should give enough context to update the pointer

[13:34:18.0000] <zenparsing>
Hixie_ the problem is we have no usable definition of an "asynchronous program error" wrt promises (b/c a rejection could always be handled "later") - but i'm going to try anyway...

[13:34:29.0000] <zenparsing>
define a "user entry point" to be any function call where the host (HTML) is calling into user code

[13:34:35.0000] <zenparsing>
an "asynchronous program error" occurs when a user entry point returns a promise which rejects

[13:34:46.0000] <zenparsing>
so this triggers window.onerror:  elem.onclick = evt => Promise.reject(new Error("asdf"))

[13:34:58.0000] <zenparsing>
so does this: elem.onclick = async evt => window.loction = await somethingAsync();

[13:35:07.0000] <zenparsing>
(note async and the spelling error)

[13:36:08.0000] <zenparsing>
...probably doesn't work, but an interesting idea anyway

[13:37:15.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: What Twitter client do you use? Almost none of your replies are actually linked to the tweet you're replying to.

[13:37:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me just happens to be looking at your Twitter page today.

[13:38:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, never mind, those were just all the "fake replies" from several years ago. Whatever you were doing then was weird. Your replies work correctly now.

[13:51:04.0000] <annevk>
I think back then Twitter did not have threading

[14:11:14.0000] <TabAtkins>
That sounds crazy.

[14:45:56.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: just the web site

[14:50:49.0000] <Hixie_>
xhr with promises: would it be something like xhr.send(); xhr.ready.then(...); ?

[14:50:56.0000] <Hixie_>
or .loaded.then() ?

[14:52:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
.loaded, I guess?

[14:56:26.0000] <TabAtkins>
It turns out that running a single regex per line instead of 20, when processing a large file, actually saves a signfiicant amount of time.

[14:56:46.0000] <Hixie_>
that depends on the regexps in question

[14:57:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
This is a simple regex, I was just constructing them fresh every time.

[14:57:14.0000] <TabAtkins>
Basically I shaved a second off of Bikeshed running time.

[14:57:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because I finally put together some profiling.

[14:57:42.0000] <Hixie_>
ah, well, sure

[15:04:29.0000] <Hixie_>
man, desigining promise-based apis with this whole "exceptions result in rejection" thing is annoying

[15:04:43.0000] <Hixie_>
it just doesn't map to the existing model at all

[15:05:05.0000] <Hixie_>
like, consider XHR

[15:05:15.0000] <Hixie_>
you really want rejection to mean "the result was not 2xx"

[15:05:39.0000] <Hixie_>
but now it also has to mean "send() was called when the state was not OPENED"

[15:05:46.0000] <Hixie_>
since it's anathema to have send() throw, apparently

[15:06:19.0000] <Hixie_>
even though it's pointless for that to be in a promise rejection since you know it synchronously and aren't ever going to try to catch it

[15:07:32.0000] <TabAtkins>
I thought that we weren't promisifying xhr, we were replacing it with fetch(), which doesn't have the same state-management issues.

[15:08:23.0000] <Hixie_>
xhr's just an example, the same problem occurs with lots of things

[15:08:31.0000] <Hixie_>
e.g. requestAutocomplete

[15:08:45.0000] <Hixie_>
rejection can be for any of the reasons that autocompleteerror currently fires

[15:08:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[15:08:55.0000] <Hixie_>
but also for all the reasons that requestAutocomplete() currently throws

[15:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure.

[15:09:09.0000] <Hixie_>
which are currently separate for good language design reasons

[15:09:11.0000] <Hixie_>
but with promises...

[15:09:57.0000] <Hixie_>
and actually fetch() does have the same problem. it doesn't reject if there was a network error.

[15:10:43.0000] <TabAtkins>
Handling two kinds of errors with sync throwing and async error events have the same usability problems the promise people are complaining about.

[15:11:06.0000] <Hixie_>
no it doesn't, because you never need to worry about the sync exceptions

[15:11:14.0000] <Hixie_>
nobody ever tries to catch them

[15:11:30.0000] <Hixie_>
and if they occur, your code just ends, it doesn't start running random code with invalid input

[15:11:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then don't worry about them.

[15:11:40.0000] <Hixie_>
but with rejection, you have to!

[15:11:53.0000] <Hixie_>
because now your code expecting a string rejection reason might get an exception rejection reason instead

[15:11:56.0000] <Hixie_>
or whatever

[15:12:59.0000] <TabAtkins>
You'll just throw or something when you end up trying to operate on the weird error anyway.

[15:13:18.0000] <Hixie_>
not necessarily

[15:13:30.0000] <Hixie_>
(mostly that's a result of JS lacking type checking)

[15:13:43.0000] <Hixie_>
(which is another language bug imho :-) )

[15:13:56.0000] <TabAtkins>
Agreed.

[15:17:52.0000] <jgraham>
I think Hixie has a point; if you think that using exceptions for flow control is bad and that using rejections for flow control is good (which seems to be part of the promise model), then using rejections to replace exceptions is bad

[15:18:23.0000] <Hixie_>
oh, wait, fetch() does reject the promise for network error

[15:18:36.0000] <Hixie_>
so fetch() has _exactly_ the problem i described for xhr

[15:19:39.0000] <Hixie_>
if you call fetch({ method: 'get', url: '/' }).then(a, b); where b() is some function to handle errors, you'll appear to always get a network error

[15:19:44.0000] <Hixie_>
but actually, you're not getting a network error

[15:19:56.0000] <Hixie_>
you're getting a type error because the arguments were type checked as bad

[15:20:11.0000] <Hixie_>
and there's no way i can see to distinguish those two completely unrelated cases

[15:21:24.0000] <Hixie_>
even if there was, e.g. because fetch() rejected with NetworkError instead of TypeError, you'd still be SOL. (a) because you wouldn't be able to get the network error information (e.g. status code, which XHR gives you), and (b) because you would never think to check for TypeError, so you'd assume it was a NetworkError and would _still_ think you always had a bed network

[15:21:34.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic: ^ that's why you're wrong.

[15:22:58.0000] <Hixie_>
(the correct was to call it, for those who are wondering, is  fetch(new Request({ method: 'get', url: '/' })).then(a, b);  )

[15:24:03.0000] <Hixie_>
no wait, it's fetch(new Request('/', { method: 'get' })).then(a, b);

[15:24:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
How'd you get any network error information if it failed at the type-checking stage?

[15:24:29.0000] <Hixie_>
fetch() rejects with TypeError for a network error

[15:24:46.0000] <Hixie_>
and IDL rejects any promise-returning method with TypeError for an argument type error

[15:25:04.0000] <Hixie_>
either way, you get b() called with TypeError

[16:13:26.0000] <pdescham49>
Whats the deal with the picture element?

[16:13:26.0000] <TabAtkins>
pdescham49: What do you mean?

[16:13:26.0000] <pdescham49>
why are they addng styling logic in the dom?

[16:13:27.0000] <pdescham49>
when it can all be handled in css media queries?

[16:13:27.0000] <TabAtkins>
???

[16:13:27.0000] <pdescham49>
it seems crazy to me maybe I am a purist but i believe all styling should exist in css and not in the markup

[16:13:27.0000] <TabAtkins>
There's no styling in <picture>

[16:13:28.0000] <pdescham49>
i get that it's not really styling but it's ths styling conditions. min-width etc.

[16:13:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
...yes?

[16:13:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
Media Queries aren't CSS.

[16:13:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
They're used in various places.

[16:13:28.0000] <pdescham49>
but i am sorry I just don't see the advantage in a picture element when you can do it all in css

[16:13:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
You can't do responsive images in CSS.

[16:13:28.0000] <pdescham49>
yes you can.

[16:13:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
(You can do some of it via the image-set() function, but only 1x/2x style stuff.)

[16:13:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
CSS also isn't friendly with the preloader.

[16:13:29.0000] <TabAtkins>
You want images to start loading asap, and if you have to first wait for a stylesheet to load, that's a significant delay on mobile devices.

[16:13:29.0000] <TabAtkins>
pdescham49: I'm one of the editors of the <picture> spec, and let me tell you, "Why not Javascript?" and "Why not CSS?" are the most common questions we get. We, um, thought of it already.

[16:13:29.0000] <pdescham49>
Years of battling inline css in the dom has me jaded

[16:13:29.0000] <pdescham49>
i see a future of more and more styling in the dom.

[16:14:52.0000] <pdescham49>
startng with this pictue element.

[16:14:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's cool, but seriously, there's no way around the problems.

[16:15:25.0000] <TabAtkins>
Unless you're okay with images not even *starting* to download for a second or more.

[16:15:25.0000] <pdescham49>
What is the problem? short of prefetch.

[16:15:25.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's the problem.

[16:20:01.0000] <pdescham49>
correct me if i am wrong but the issue i saw it as described was that the browser is requesting more then in needs to.

[16:20:01.0000] <pdescham49>
in my css only solution in a responsice design with an image tag in only requests the resrouce as needed

[16:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Depends on how you're "solving" it. If you "solve" it by having a small source in the HTML, and then providing the info to select the proper source in CSS, you double-request.  If you do it entirely in CSS, you only send a single request, but you send it late.

[16:20:01.0000] <pdescham49>
anyhow. :) I've been a html developer for the last 20 years professionally. and this worries me :(

[16:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(After fetching/parsing/applying the stylesheet.)

[16:20:01.0000] <pdescham49>
can I send you some code / benchmarks next week?

[16:22:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
We are aware of the problems of having MQs duplicated between multiple <picture> elements and the stylesheets; changing one of your breakpoints means you have to update it in N places.  We plan to fix this with MQ variables, so you can set up the MQ once and then refer to it in every place you need it.

[16:22:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
Send it to the Responsive Images CG list.

[16:22:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
But fair warning, you're not raising anything new.

[16:22:24.0000] <pdescham49>
10-4

[16:22:24.0000] <pdescham49>
thank you sir for the chat..

Got a little further with StartCom / StartSSL

annevk, yt? Working on the clipboard stuff again

[06:30:07.0000] <hallvors>
I have a question: I'm removing the "default action of synthetic event" stuff, as requested

[06:30:55.0000] <hallvors>
so that also means dispatchEvent(copyEvt) will never cause the clipboard to be updated  - to be consistent

[06:31:01.0000] <hallvors>
right?

This media spec is giant. How much of it is implemented? How much has implementer interest? http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jan-ivar/mediacapture-main/promises/getusermedia.html

[07:13:05.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me wonders if the Specs page should be sectioned to differentiate the Web-crucial specs (Fetch, Encoding, DOM, HTML, etc.) from the feature specs (Books, Fullscreen, Figures, etc.)

[07:14:09.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me also wonders why the developer version of HTML uses such a different stylesheet that makes the spec unreadable

[07:20:09.0000] <Domenic>
The more important division for me is "ready" vs. "scratch work". DOM S&P and MIME Sniffing have so many red xxx's they are kind of embarrassing IMO :/

[08:58:10.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
is there any active discussion about how that UI should work? would that be at the HTML spec level, or is that an implementation detail for browsers to decide?

[15:08:44.0000] <mathiasbynens>
interesting that this keeps coming up


2014-09-14
[01:00:47.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: turned out that my broken promise impl was spinning the eventloop infinitely as a side effect, not necessarily against any "rules" or so, so I guess the behavior was not incorrect w.r.t. promises.

[01:01:02.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: I managed to hunt that down and submit a PR to the list of conformant impls.

[01:01:17.0000] <ondras>
Domenic: also, congrats on your new JIT t-shirt .)

[01:01:35.0000] <Domenic>
:D

[01:42:30.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: seems like we should solve it some how

[01:42:46.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: <a href=... target=_blank rel=noreferrer> is not exactly ideal syntax

[01:43:21.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: maybe something like target=_new or _safe

[02:12:11.0000] <Domenic>
I don't really understand why this is coupled to Referer? what if I like letting other sites see who linked to them?

[02:17:06.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: I don't think that was carefully thought out

[02:17:31.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if we can make CSP do this by default

[02:17:45.0000] <annevk>
At least for cross-origin .opener

[03:02:06.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: why does ssllabs.com not mark "RC4 	Yes" as a warning or even error?

[05:57:57.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: so for html5.org we only need html5.org and *.html5.org as far as I can tell

[05:58:13.0000] <annevk>
although I guess I could try to support Philip` and ask for *.philip.html5.org as well

[05:58:27.0000] <annevk>
though that'd require him installing certificates on that other server

[05:59:23.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: for HSTS max-age you want to recommend something like 31415926 btw, the value you gave is less than 180 days which makes ssllabs.com frown

[06:13:45.0000] <annevk>
Ok, asked for certificates for html5.org and whatwg.org

[06:14:04.0000] <annevk>
alt *.html5 for html5.org and *.whatwg.org and *.spec.whatwg.org for whatwg.org

[06:14:28.0000] <annevk>
Will take up to 3 hours per StartSSL, but have been waiting a bit longer for others already, so might not all be sorted today

[06:21:52.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Doing anything special for *.philip.html5.org probably isn't worthwhile

[06:24:30.0000] <Philip`>
(...and I'm unlikely to want to bother configuring anything on my server)

[06:32:10.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I have a new WHATWG certificate

[06:32:33.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I will test it on dom.spec.whatwg.org

[06:43:53.0000] <annevk>
Okay so that works, but there are some obvious issues with the subresources

[06:44:27.0000] <Ms2ger>
You'd say?

[07:03:39.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: fixed

[07:05:11.0000] <annevk>
Also added HSTS

[07:06:53.0000] <Domenic>
it's happening!! :O

[07:29:11.0000] <annevk>
Okay, so out of 9 certificates requested 2 have been issued thus far

[07:29:30.0000] <annevk>
Covering 15 domains

[07:29:47.0000] <annevk>
What's that, like 0% of the web?

[08:00:32.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#request-class - should fallbackCredentials be "same-origin"?

[08:00:43.0000] <JakeA>
Feels like fetch('/') should include credentials

[08:01:21.0000] <annevk>
It was something intentional to omit credentials by default as many people argue that's a saner default

[08:01:29.0000] <annevk>
"same-origin" is a really hacky thing

[08:02:11.0000] <JakeA>
Hmm, it just bit remysharp & I. Was really unexpected.

[08:02:29.0000] <JakeA>
Although it could be that we're just used to how XHR behaves

[08:03:28.0000] <JakeA>
But I think it's going to surprise many developers

[08:03:54.0000] <caitp>
it's not as though there's very many features of the platform that don't surprise people

[08:19:37.0000] <annevk>
Adding certificates to many subdomains on DreamHost is a bitch

[08:30:33.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: https://mathias.html5.org/

[08:31:10.0000] <annevk>
That was a lot of copy-and-pasting keys and certificates around... Bleh

[08:31:40.0000] <annevk>
I hope Hixie can do this easier with DreamHost VPS

[08:33:49.0000] <annevk>
Still need to make HSTS work btw

[08:34:07.0000] <annevk>
And request yet more certificates, man, I hope this situation improves for when I have to renew all this shit

[09:29:25.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: w000t

[09:29:30.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: you’re a hero

[09:48:31.0000] <Pantha>
anyone there?

[09:49:23.0000] <boogyman>
Pantha: negative.

[09:49:23.0000] <Ms2ger>
No

[09:49:59.0000] <Pantha>
i'm new in irc

[09:50:08.0000] <Pantha>
so........

[09:50:38.0000] <Pantha>
this is the irc channel of the WHATWG, right?

[09:51:05.0000] <boogyman>
yes

[09:52:18.0000] <Pantha>
i wanted to add proposal

[09:52:34.0000] <Pantha>
i mean request for a new elwment

[09:52:43.0000] <Pantha>
sry, element

[09:52:47.0000] <caitp>
it's one of those cool organizations where you have a way of contacting members and communicating with actual humans --- many government agencies could learn from the example

[09:53:01.0000] <Pantha>
thanks

[09:54:40.0000] <boogyman>
Pantha: can you describe the capability you're looking to add?

[09:55:39.0000] <Pantha>
there are many sementic elements in html5, like header, footer, aside. i think there should a new element for slider or slideshow like <slider>

[09:55:54.0000] <caitp>
most of those are really just HTMLElement

[09:56:08.0000] <caitp>
so technically <slider> already exists, as much as <main> or <aside> is defined

[09:57:10.0000] <caitp>
well, I guess that's not strictly true

[09:57:28.0000] <Pantha>
i don't understand

[09:57:48.0000] <Pantha>
if i just add a tag like <element>

[09:57:55.0000] <Pantha>
that is not correct

[09:59:50.0000] <Pantha>
i mean w3 need to make a new element for creating slider at web page

[10:00:05.0000] <caitp>
like input[type=range]?

[10:00:24.0000] <Pantha>
no

[10:01:10.0000] <boogyman>
Pantha: can you please describe what you mean by slider?

[10:01:10.0000] <Pantha>
i mean, if u wanna creat a slide show u choose a div like <div class="footer">

[10:01:25.0000] <Pantha>
slideshows at websites

[10:01:33.0000] <caitp>
like flexslider or whatever

[10:01:45.0000] <boogyman>
Ah, slide shows are a list <ol> of stuff.

[10:02:26.0000] <Pantha>
i mean, if u wanna creat a slide show u choose a div like <div class="footer">. we used to create header , footer like this also.

[10:02:42.0000] <Pantha>
so there is a new tag for slider

[10:03:03.0000] <Pantha>
sry. <div class=slider>

[10:03:37.0000] <Pantha>
it would be cool if we can use just <slider> </slider>

[10:03:40.0000] <caitp>
so, if I were going to propose this on blink-dev, I have a strong feeling the response I'd get is "we don't want this in the platform; implement it with web components"

[10:04:21.0000] <caitp>
(that seems to be the catch-all response for anything which has historically been implemented in scripts)

[10:04:45.0000] <boogyman>
Personally I think it's a bad idea. I think its a feature that's best created by authors, not the standards org.

[10:05:35.0000] <Pantha>
so where shoud i apply this proposal?

[10:05:41.0000] <Pantha>
w3?

[10:06:03.0000] <caitp>
what you want to do is get browsers to agree to implement it

[10:06:12.0000] <caitp>
being spec'd doesn't really accomplish that

[10:06:50.0000] <caitp>
i have a feeling you'd have trouble getting browsers to agree to that, as nice as it would be to have commonly used features like this baked in

[10:07:17.0000] <caitp>
because A) needs of different users vary a lot, it would be hard to implement it in a way which made everyone happy while still being a decent API

[10:07:39.0000] <caitp>
aw

[10:19:08.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: https://platform.html5.org/style.css loads an image from images.whatwg.org which is not yet available from TLS

[10:19:29.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I guess we can wait for images.whatwg.org to get TLS, but that link needs to be modified either way

[10:36:17.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: krijnhoetmer: jgraham: zcorpan: matijs: Philip`: gsnedder1: if you could include something like this in the .htaccess of your .html5.org domain, that'd be great: https://gist.github.com/annevk/3ec0c4cc129059eb567d

[10:36:36.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: ^ also applies to webm.html5.org

[10:41:05.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Pretty sure there isn't actually anything under james.html5.org

[10:41:07.0000] <matijs>
done, tah

[10:42:01.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: there's claims it's coming soon!

[10:42:22.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: I can make it a redirect to http://hoppipolla.co.uk/ (where's the TLS?) if you want

[10:42:28.0000] <matijs>
Hey I found those in mine too!

[10:42:49.0000] <annevk>
(DreamHost will keep adding those until you add some content...)

[10:50:02.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I have to say that not having tight control over the certificate is frustrating

[10:50:41.0000] <annevk>
E.g. StartSSL often picks a "Common Name" I don't think is all that common

[11:54:27.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: done

[12:04:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: can you also do it for forums.whatwg.org ?

[12:06:05.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: my browsers complain that https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/index.php is not trusted

[12:06:26.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: oh, might have to wait a couple of minutes

[12:06:27.0000] <Hixie>
give it a few minutes

[12:06:39.0000] <Hixie>
blog.whatwg.org works

[12:06:42.0000] <Hixie>
i'm going down alphabetically

[12:06:43.0000] <annevk>
we're doing it live :p

[12:06:47.0000] <zcorpan>
ah

[12:07:05.0000] <annevk>
/me is fixing mixed content warnings in specs

[12:07:06.0000] <Hixie>
i'm as far as help.whatwg.org

[12:07:20.0000] <Hixie>
we have SO MANY SUBDOMAINS

[12:07:32.0000] <annevk>
first thing I noticed is that namespaces will look weird five years from now

[12:07:38.0000] <annevk>
for other reasons than mostly being obsolete that is

[12:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
what, because they didn't look weird before?

[12:08:21.0000] <Hixie>
having "http://" in an opaque identifier is just dumb

[12:11:05.0000] <Hixie>
ok 18 subdomains to go

[12:12:05.0000] <annevk>
fair

[12:13:59.0000] <Hixie>
i have to go to lunch but will be back in a couple of hours

[12:14:07.0000] <Hixie>
there's 16 or so subdomains that are self-signed right now

[12:17:20.0000] <annevk>
I might be asleep, guess I'll put in place the HSTS switch for all specs tomorrow

[12:21:39.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: required attributes and <template> don't seem to go well together

[12:27:17.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26566 question from bz

[13:19:40.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Unfortunately I have no idea how to connect to Dreamhost to modify anything on my subdomain

[13:22:02.0000] <caitp>
iirc you should be able to do a lot of it from their web dashboard, and if not, you should be able to get shell access easily

[13:23:15.0000] <Philip`>
All I know is the server I last ssh'd to in 2011, which no longer seems to exist

[13:23:59.0000] <Philip`>
and if I ever had a password, I've no idea what it was

[13:27:11.0000] <annevk>
Philip`: I'll get you a new one

[13:28:07.0000] <caitp>
lives up to my claim of "get shell access easily"

[13:28:38.0000] <annevk>
yeah it's trivial

[13:36:55.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: i feel your pain re: CN having `www.` in it etc.

[13:37:39.0000] <annevk>
certs are far from neat

[13:37:52.0000] <annevk>
hopefully that can be fixed

[13:38:30.0000] <mathiasbynens>
only a matter of time until Google starts providing free wildcard certs

[13:39:34.0000] <annevk>
you think?

[13:39:43.0000] <zcorpan>
you get a wildcard cert! you get a wildcard cert! everyone gets a wildcard cert!

[13:41:52.0000] <annevk>
not needing CAs would be even nicer

[13:53:01.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I guess there's a tracking bug on TLS opera.com redirecting to non-TLS?

[15:09:21.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: yep

[16:37:22.0000] <Hixie>
ok, ssl certs are set up for *.whatwg.org and *.spec.whatwg.org


2014-09-15
[20:04:49.0000] <Domenic>
https://www.whatwg.org/ has mixed content

[20:05:13.0000] <Domenic>
and all the links go to http://

[20:05:21.0000] <Domenic>
I guess the //-ification of the homepage hasn't happened yet

[23:41:57.0000] <mathiasbynens>
links are not the problem; it’s the embedded resources

[23:42:10.0000] <mathiasbynens>
<object> <img> etc.

[23:43:17.0000] <Domenic>
the links are problematic if we want to encourage SSL usage

[23:43:36.0000] <mathiasbynens>
ofc

[23:44:19.0000] <mathiasbynens>
ah, i’d missed the “and” in your message

[23:47:39.0000] <mathiasbynens>
also the redirects in `.htaccess` (e.g. `/C`) are still hardcoded to `http://`

[23:49:40.0000] <mathiasbynens>
a server-wide search/replace for http://*.whatwg.org/ → https://\1.whatwg.org/ would be nice

[01:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: will fix the platform.html5.org image thing later today. (last day of vacation here in Berlin with Nao and the weather's beautiful so we're headed off to ride some bikes around a lake9

[01:18:05.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I just fixed it for you

[01:18:46.0000] <annevk>
I also updated all commit hooks on GitHub for my WHATWG domains to https:// and enabled HSTS

[01:21:48.0000] <annevk>
http://xkcd.com/1421/ :-)

[01:24:53.0000] <zcorpan>
is IndexSizeError in http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/geometry/#DOMMatrix et al right or wrong?

[01:29:10.0000] <annevk>
The reference it uses for it is almost certainly wrong

[01:30:32.0000] <annevk>
But yeah https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#indexsizeerror not sure

[01:33:34.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: ah ok -- thanks

[01:55:03.0000] <annevk>
https://blog.whatwg.org/rolling-out-tls-and-hsts

[01:56:08.0000] <mathiasbynens>
\o/

[02:06:52.0000] <annevk>
Guess I need to update my email signature

[02:34:07.0000] <annevk>
Security incentives are all wrong. Why is https a character longer?

[02:37:35.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: the Mozilla IETF crowd is scary. Cameras without TLS? How can that be something we aim for?

[02:42:01.0000] <annevk>
http://www.android.com/one/ "Always the latest software" such an odd marketing message coming from Google

[02:47:05.0000] <annevk>
By the way, if anyone in this channel wants to setup TLS, I'm willing to help out

[03:05:36.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: is it expected that webm.html5.org has changed its ssh host key in the last year or so?

[03:05:48.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: it says the current fingerprint is 68:36:d3:fa:a4:40:ae:1a:ae:38:b7:3a:83:34:8f:74

[03:08:32.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: you need to ask Ivan Ristić why ssllabs doesn't make more noise about RC4

[03:09:07.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: it does show IE11 on Windows 8.1 as failing to connect, though, if a site is RC4-only

[03:09:14.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: which should look pretty bad

[03:09:40.0000] <hsivonen>
(though it only simulates IE's first handshake attempt, so after downgrading, IE connects)

[03:12:57.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: OK. I'll file a bug about the fragment parsing algorithm and non-HTML/SVG/MathML context

[03:24:09.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Security_Maintenance_%28SSH_Key_Change_and_Fixes%29

[03:25:39.0000] <annevk>
I just had a thought. What if the better your TLS story was, the less UI clutter a browser would show. And the worse it was, the more it would look like something is wrong.

[03:27:01.0000] <annevk>
Compare the address bar UI for https://www.dreamhost.com/ with http://www.dreamhost.com/

[03:27:39.0000] <annevk>
The TLS UI seems more cluttered for the user while it should be more obvious

[03:31:17.0000] <roc>
I just though "what if, the better your TLS story was, the less ads the browser would show"

[03:31:23.0000] <roc>
and then I realized Comcast is already implementing that.

[03:32:09.0000] <espadrine>
because of injected ads?

[03:32:22.0000] <roc>
yeah

[03:32:33.0000] <jgraham>
heh

[03:32:51.0000] <annevk>
roc: hehe

[03:33:07.0000] <jgraham>
Given the density of ads on the internet in general I'm not sure it's possible to tell the difference :(

[03:33:20.0000] <annevk>
But I don't get why we'd show "https://" for TLS. No normal user is going to get that and it actually looks more confusing than the alternative

[03:33:44.0000] <annevk>
Safari on the iPhone doesn't do it...

[03:35:14.0000] <jgraham>
At this point it probably isn't viable to make the internet look broken for http

[03:36:46.0000] <annevk>
We could remove "https://" as a start

[03:37:00.0000] <annevk>
We could change the globe with an icon that indicates surveillance

[03:38:35.0000] <jgraham>
"look for https" might be one of the few things that people know

[03:38:54.0000] <jgraham>
Of course they would probably be confused by https.evilsite.com

[03:40:26.0000] <annevk>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1067293

[03:41:03.0000] <jgraham>
But yeah, I guess "[insecure] site.tld" might work

[03:48:04.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: it seems Ivan is on Twitter, he just retweeted Mike West who was challenging the W3C to follow the WHATWG in using TLS

[03:48:32.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: guess I might ask him about it later and maybe once more complain to DreamHost about RC4 and IE11

[04:15:23.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: So how far are we from having html.spec.whatwg.org work?

[04:15:50.0000] <jgraham>
By which I mean "not be a redirect"

[04:15:56.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: I think Hixie would like it to remain a redirect

[04:16:32.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: are you planning on updating the certificate for www.whatwg.org as well?

[04:16:40.0000] <jgraham>
I would like to voice my disapproval at this

[04:16:48.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: also, will you make HSTS work or can you add my public key so I can do it?

[04:17:02.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: perhaps file a bug on the spec?

[04:17:04.0000] <jgraham>
A naming scheme with [spec].whatwg.org I can get behind

[04:17:09.0000] <jgraham>
Uh

[04:17:17.0000] <jgraham>
[name].spec.whatwg.org

[04:17:29.0000] <jgraham>
One that requires me to remember anything else, not so much

[04:17:40.0000] <jgraham>
(particularly the difference between c and C)

[04:23:06.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: hmm. weird. webm.html5.org doesn't seem to know my ssh public key. I'm pretty sure I authorized my RSA key there when I migrated away from DSA.

[04:23:29.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: do you want me to generate a fresh password?

[04:23:44.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yes, that would work, too

[04:24:01.0000] <annevk>
see pm

[04:26:49.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: note that banks, etc., pay premium for UI clutter: EV

[04:27:10.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: so giving https sites less UI clutter might not be the winning strategy

[04:27:21.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I was thinking that once it gains acceptance that we don't show the path by default

[04:27:23.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: you may be interested in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=942136

[04:27:27.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: EV might not show the domain by default

[04:28:10.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: it would be pretty bad. you couldn't tell the difference between bugzilla.mozilla.org and www.mozilla.org then

[04:29:05.0000] <annevk>
oh ew

[04:29:33.0000] <annevk>
I'm not even sure why we decided to pay for EV, but yes, overall that would be an issue

[04:30:18.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: of the browser vendors, Mozilla made a big deal of pushing EV back when it launched

[04:31:53.0000] <annevk>
:(

[04:32:23.0000] <jgraham>
Not showing the path by default is what Opera 12 did. Not sure it worked that wekk

[04:32:27.0000] <jgraham>
*well

[04:40:23.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notices that StartSSL has decided to capitalize "Van"

[04:43:58.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: HSTS enabled for webm.html5.org

[05:08:40.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: do I need to take some action on https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/r/2564 ?

[05:31:37.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: No, you just need someone to review it. I guess I should be that someone. I'll have a look once I fix up Ms2ger's issues with the testtwf documentation

[05:34:14.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: OK. Thanks. I requested your review of the same .dat file over at bugzilla.mozilla.org, too.

[06:52:37.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: ta

[06:57:07.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: your bug report seems interesting, though I think making TLS UI as attractive as non-TLS should be higher priority

[06:57:19.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: also, the amount of issues you mention with EV :-(

[06:58:05.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: we should definitely do some kind of cert persistence and perhaps scope cookies / storage etc.

[07:56:17.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Critic review is done

[07:56:36.0000] <mathiasbynens>
woo, annevk.nl is now on TLS too

[07:57:08.0000] <jgraham>
One issue that I think you should fix, when that's done push a new commit (just the changes, don't try to squash history or anything) and it will appear on critic and I can review it

[07:57:24.0000] <jgraham>
Then assuming that's OK I'll merg

[07:57:26.0000] <jgraham>
e

[07:57:55.0000] <annevk>
The main problem with annevk.nl is that I've configured it as a redirect. I think I'd actually need to fully host the domain to give it a proper setup. Same for www.annevankesteren.nl which automatically redirects, but does not automatically redirect to TLS version afaict.

[07:58:44.0000] <annevk>
DreamHost needs HSTS support as an option. That would make all of that work automatically I think.

[07:58:56.0000] <annevk>
Well, if they implemented it correctly.

[09:12:28.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: https://twitter.com/ivanristic/status/511545125621993472

[09:22:41.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: Can we add Reponse as an alias to Response? I always type it wrong

[09:27:44.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: what would html.spec.whatwg.org host? the multipage spec or the single-page spec? and where would the other go?

[09:28:21.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: also, there's a lot of links to the old location

[09:28:57.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: are you ever actually obliged to revoke a cert? could you just take the attitude that it started out as HTTP so it's no more insecure than how it started out (obviously false sense of security, but…)

[09:30:37.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Single page. Multipage would be under some path or a seperate subdomain. The old location could redirect

[09:31:22.0000] <Hixie>
what's the impact of the old location redirecting on things like position in search results?

[09:31:48.0000] <Hixie>
i guess the domain name having "html" in it might make it a net positive...

[09:31:49.0000] <jgraham>
Dunno, ask someone that works for Google

[09:31:58.0000] <Hixie>
well not just in google

[09:32:13.0000] <Hixie>
i'm pretty sure the impact with google is google shunts the page rank along the redirect

[09:33:13.0000] <jgraham>
I think the net win of going form "url no one can remember" to "url anyone can remember" is big enough that I would be prepared to take a temporary hit in search engine ranking

[09:35:06.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough

[09:40:58.0000] <Hixie>
what's the magic i need for HSTS again?

[09:42:13.0000] <Hixie>
oh you only send it over HTTPS?

[09:42:16.0000] <Hixie>
that makes it easier

[09:42:24.0000] <Hixie>
/me sticks this in his global htaccess file: Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" env=HTTPS

[10:01:40.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: haha

[10:02:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: you also need a redirect from non-TLS

[10:02:14.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: https://gist.github.com/annevk/3ec0c4cc129059eb567d

[10:02:28.0000] <Hixie>
the redirects are going in already

[10:02:31.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: not sure how you can make that work globally

[10:02:33.0000] <annevk>
okay

[10:04:05.0000] <jsbell>
annevk: Any idea if/when FF will implement set/get/getAll/has/delete on FormData?

[10:04:28.0000] <annevk>
jsbell: I don't, I'm not even aware of a bug

[10:05:41.0000] <jsbell>
annevk: thx. I couldn't find a moz bug either.

[10:07:29.0000] <Hixie>
ok the www.whatwg.org home page is no longer mixed content

[10:07:34.0000] <Hixie>
let me know if there's other affected pages

[10:07:41.0000] <annevk>
Hixie++

[10:08:16.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: home page is not yet redirecting to https:// btw

[10:08:26.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i wanted to fix the mixed content issues first :-)

[10:08:54.0000] <Hixie>
are the forums ready to redirect? zcorpan is having trouble logging in but we're not ever up at the same time so i haven't been able to help troubleshoot

[10:09:43.0000] <Hixie>
anyone seen variable recently? (aka eitana)

[10:10:25.0000] <Hixie>
looks like he hasn't logged in since 2010

[10:10:31.0000] <annevk>
I don't know my Forums account anymore

[10:10:33.0000] <Hixie>
i'm calling that abandoned and deleting history.whatwg.org

[10:12:12.0000] <Hixie>
what's the story on html-differences.whatwg.org ?

[10:13:07.0000] <annevk>
maintained by zcorpan

[10:13:23.0000] <Hixie>
looks like it's having styling issues

[10:13:29.0000] <annevk>
I can fix the issues I guess

[10:13:37.0000] <Hixie>
oh it's mixed content issues i guess

[10:13:41.0000] <annevk>
yes

[10:13:46.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, i should be keeping this domain then right

[10:14:12.0000] <Hixie>
btw once i'm done here you should be able to remove your redirect thing

[10:14:19.0000] <Hixie>
the http sites are just going to not exist any more

[10:14:40.0000] <Hixie>
well, they'll exist in that they'll be hardcoded to redirect at the panel level

[10:14:51.0000] <Hixie>
but your .htaccess files won't be doing anything with them

[10:14:59.0000] <Hixie>
so they'll just be slowing down the https loads

[10:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: what's the story on help.whatwg.org?

[10:17:18.0000] <Hixie>
ooh

[10:17:21.0000] <Hixie>
http://n.whatwg.org/

[10:17:31.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i will _not_ in fact support https://n.whatwg.org/

[10:17:36.0000] <Hixie>
since that would just cause confusions

[10:20:40.0000] <annevk>
ooh, you have some kind of super powers even over the domains I host?

[10:20:49.0000] <annevk>
that sounds great

[10:21:03.0000] <annevk>
I guess it doesn't apply to dom.spec.whatwg.org yet, hopefully DreamHost can move that back as I requested

[10:21:24.0000] <Hixie>
well, i have the power to make you not host them :-)

[10:21:42.0000] <boogyman>
annevk: the primary owner of the acct has full access to all namespaces

[10:22:06.0000] <annevk>
boogyman: except for dom.spec.whatwg.org at the moment

[10:22:20.0000] <annevk>
I think, as that's a really weird hack

[10:22:20.0000] <boogyman>
whoever owns "whatwg.org" does

[10:23:12.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: he means control over how it's hosted at dreamhost

[10:23:17.0000] <Hixie>
obviously i could move the entire domain elsewhere

[10:23:21.0000] <Hixie>
that would be a hell of a mess

[10:23:21.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[10:24:11.0000] <boogyman>
Unless this is something new in their system, I am pretty sure you can change the location of the host between their hosted solutions.

[10:26:49.0000] <annevk>
I fixed html-differences

[10:27:06.0000] <annevk>
I guess I'll remove the HSTS stuff I did

[10:27:28.0000] <Hixie>
leave the header

[10:27:42.0000] <Hixie>
i can't affect your domains' headers with my .htaccess files

[10:29:15.0000] <annevk>
okay

[10:30:16.0000] <Hixie>
in setting up these redirects i'm sure i'm gonna get one wrong

[10:30:31.0000] <Hixie>
and we'll have http://figures.spec.whatwg.org redirect to https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org or some nonsense

[10:30:50.0000] <annevk>
are they all in one file?

[10:31:20.0000] <Hixie>
it's the web panel interface

[10:31:48.0000] <annevk>
your panel has separate controls for :80 and :443?

[10:31:58.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[10:32:11.0000] <annevk>
neat

[10:32:44.0000] <annevk>
ooh I see, I do too

[10:33:05.0000] <annevk>
I did not realize that when you add secure hosting, it's basically the same thing as web hosting

[10:33:10.0000] <annevk>
I thought it was just a way to add certificates

[10:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
something wacky is going on with my html.spec.whatwg.org setup

[10:35:25.0000] <Hixie>
oh, local caching problem

[10:35:25.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[10:36:34.0000] <annevk>
oh man, that separate hosting thingy is exciting, I'm going to use that too

[10:37:03.0000] <annevk>
and update my blog post draft to not put blame on DreamHost for this

[10:37:52.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[10:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
what were you blaming dreamhost for? not being able to control them separately?

[10:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh yikes

[10:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
don't forget the trailing /

[10:39:13.0000] <Hixie>
/me breaks whatwg.org

[10:49:24.0000] <annevk>
That www.* would redirect to * first before redirecting to TLS. I also blamed them for not having HSTS support as a configuration, which still seems fair

[10:55:42.0000] <Hixie>
well it's trivial to add headers to all your sites

[10:55:49.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, you put one line in one file and you're done for all your sites

[10:57:12.0000] <Hixie>
ok so now i need secure icons for the browsers

[10:57:22.0000] <Hixie>
i'm tempted to just drop the stuff that says which browser implements what

[10:57:28.0000] <Hixie>
is there some better solution we can roll out?

[10:57:38.0000] <Hixie>
based on caniuse or something?

[10:57:59.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: html5.org has secure icons

[10:58:11.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: see https://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker

[10:58:39.0000] <annevk>
Although I think the preferred term is authenticated, since we don't know whether html5.org is actually secure

[11:01:35.0000] <Hixie>
i guess

[11:01:45.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: still failing basic checks on https://hstspreload.appspot.com/

[11:01:47.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: seems hard

[11:02:51.0000] <annevk>
in particular they require the redirect to carry the HSTS header

[11:03:08.0000] <Hixie>
hstspreload.appspot.com is dumb. i tell it to check whatwg.org and it says i can't because it's a redirect. i tell it to check www.whatwg.org and it says i can't because it's a subdomain.

[11:03:27.0000] <Hixie>
oh well wait

[11:03:30.0000] <Hixie>
we don't want to be in that list

[11:03:36.0000] <Hixie>
not everything in whatwg.org is going to be HTTPS

[11:03:41.0000] <Hixie>
for example, n.whatwg.org

[11:07:37.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic_: I'm not sure I understand why you want ecmarkdown to mark all OL bullets with the same number. I cant' find any reasoning behind it in the issues list for ecmarkup.

[11:07:44.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: the problem with not everything being HTTPS is that then users can be spoofed

[11:07:57.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: how?

[11:07:59.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: it seems better to simply explain this on n.whatwg.org as a naming problem

[11:08:21.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: e.g. an attacker could make them visit secure.whatwg.org and present some login form

[11:08:28.0000] <Hixie>
login form to what?

[11:08:44.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: blog or wiki or forums

[11:08:59.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: the includeSubdomain directive is there to prevent this problem

[11:09:21.0000] <Hixie>
the blog and wiki and forums are open to everyone anyway

[11:09:23.0000] <Hixie>
they need but ask

[11:09:44.0000] <Hixie>
why would anyone go to the effort of somehow getting DNS to return a fake entry just to get someone's forum password?

[11:10:10.0000] <jgraham>
Well it's quite high probability that that user uses the pw elsewhere

[11:11:07.0000] <Hixie>
(that's why for the spec's own stuff i generate passwords instead of letting you set it)

[11:11:28.0000] <svl>
if the user is an admin, quite some damage can be done with that password

[11:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
if a whatwg blog admin can be phished in that way, we have bigger problems

[11:12:12.0000] <Hixie>
like, they're probably not qualified to be doing their job

[11:13:51.0000] <Hixie>
we also have company.demos.whatwg.org which isn't covered by a cert

[11:22:59.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: isn't there some way we can secure the DNS so that they can't do that, btw? It seems like if they can add DNS entries, they can probably get certs for them anyway.

[11:35:25.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: from what I read DNSSEC doesn't really cover anything on top of TLS

[11:35:47.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: and as long as they don't control whatwg.org they cannot issue certificates for it if the CAs are doing their job

[11:36:14.0000] <Hixie>
you want to bet that there's no CA that'll issue a cert for a subdomain?

[11:36:26.0000] <Hixie>
how do you do certs fro dyndns.org style setups then?

[11:43:33.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'm going for lunch. Other than HSTS headers not being included in the https://whatwg.org to https://www.whatwg.org redirect, the existence of *.demos.whatwg.org, and the status of n.whatwg.org, i'm not aware of any open issues with respect to our TLS conversion.

[11:44:27.0000] <mathiasbynens>
\o/

[11:49:31.0000] <annevk>
sounds great

[11:57:16.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: are you using PHP? Have you had problems with the Header set directive not affecting PHP scripts?

[12:13:25.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: yes and no

[12:16:14.0000] <mathiasbynens>
btw, time to change your freenode passwords everyone: https://blog.freenode.net/2014/09/server-issues-2/

[12:16:25.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: details?

[12:21:32.0000] <TabAtkins>
mathiasbynens: Thanks for the heads-up.

[12:30:22.0000] <mathiasbynens>
just updated https://javascript.spec.whatwg.org/ and auto-replaced all *.whatwg.org/*.html5.org/annevankesteren.nl links in my blog database — feels good

[12:32:22.0000] <caitp>
huh, what does sequence<T> mean when it's the return type of an idl-exposed method? is that somehow different from Array<T>?

[12:32:45.0000] <TabAtkins>
caitp: It means you're returning an array.

[12:32:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
Array<T> doesn't exist in WebIDL, does it?

[12:32:59.0000] <caitp>
I thought we already had an Array type in IDL

[12:33:23.0000] <caitp>
not Array<T> but T[]

[12:33:31.0000] <TabAtkins>
Those are different and terrible.

[12:34:30.0000] <TabAtkins>
I never remember exactly how/why.

[12:34:41.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've just learned over time that you should always use sequence<>.

[12:34:43.0000] <caitp>
nobody ever said webidl wasn't confusing :>

[12:36:48.0000] <TabAtkins>
Based on vague memories and reading the spec just now, T[] doesn't actually define a JS Array, just a look-alike.

[12:38:55.0000] <caitp>
I sort of thought it worked like rest parameters

[12:39:13.0000] <caitp>
sequence<> I mean

[12:39:30.0000] <TabAtkins>
?

[12:39:41.0000] <caitp>
"this is a list representing a sequence of arguments", but I guess that doesn't make sense for a return value

[12:39:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
foo(sequence<T>) just means it'll take an array-like.  It doesn't do any rest magic.

[12:40:10.0000] <TabAtkins>
IDL types in argument lists are just instructions for which conversion operation to do.

[12:40:27.0000] <TabAtkins>
They're actually "types" when used as return values.

[13:02:21.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I run PHP under DreamHost's FastCGI

[13:02:39.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: it does not seem to pick up on .htaccess' set headers

[13:02:50.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: evidence is annevankesteren.nl

[13:03:27.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: HSTS, you mean?

[13:03:35.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: yes

[13:03:35.0000] <mathiasbynens>
what does the .htaccess look like

[13:04:10.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" env=HTTPS

[13:04:14.0000] <mathiasbynens>
…is what i’m using

[13:04:50.0000] <annevk>
Yeah it looks like that, it's picked up by e.g. html5.org just fine

[13:05:16.0000] <mathiasbynens>
ah, indeed, and https://annevankesteren.nl/test/ has the correct header too

[13:05:22.0000] <mathiasbynens>
no clue tbh :/

[13:06:53.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: http://serverfault.com/a/383063/13896

[13:08:03.0000] <annevk>
Header always set then?

[13:09:04.0000] <mathiasbynens>
i’d give that a try

[13:10:16.0000] <annevk>
nope

[13:10:59.0000] <mathiasbynens>
:(

[13:17:30.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: https://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker which is a Python script includes the header regardless of the always setting

[13:18:29.0000] <annevk>
Reading those docs I wonder if Header unset X-Pad works

[13:30:29.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: yeah i think php doesn't do anything with headers set in htaccess

[13:31:12.0000] <annevk>
But all over the web it's suggested it should

[13:31:32.0000] <zcorpan>
oh. then i dunno

[13:31:49.0000] <mathiasbynens>
zcorpan: it does for me, but then again i’m not using php-cgi

[13:32:55.0000] <zcorpan>
might need to flip something in php.ini or whatever. php has lots of twiddles

[13:33:26.0000] <mathiasbynens>
P̆ͭ҉̭̗H̓͆҉̸͞Pͧ̄҉͖̱

[13:33:31.0000] <annevk>
There's https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libapache-mod-fastcgi/+bug/1368308

[13:34:06.0000] <mathiasbynens>
“This bug affects 1 person”

[13:35:03.0000] <annevk>
https://gist.github.com/mfdj/11122524 is someone with the same problem

[13:36:25.0000] <mathiasbynens>
give up and use `header()` i guess

[13:39:37.0000] <annevk>
Almost did configuration with a single file for a dozen domains, now I have to hack dozens of PHP files

[13:44:22.0000] <annevk>
If it would not be such a hassle to switch from DreamHost...

[13:56:50.0000] <jgraham>
There's an element of sunk cost fallacy about that argument :)

[13:57:47.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: fwiw opera hides https://

[13:58:44.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: it's opportunity cost I think

[13:58:53.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: since switching is non-zero-cost

[13:59:57.0000] <annevk>
Seems I already somewhat started on a common header include file, yay me

[14:00:22.0000] <annevk>
/me submitted a whole bunch of sites to https://hstspreload.appspot.com/

[14:01:03.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Right, but if the cost of switching in the long term is smaller than the cost of maintaining the DH setup it's a poor choice

[14:01:11.0000] <jgraham>
I have no idea if it is or not

[14:02:19.0000] <annevk>
I might try rent a VPS with TransIP at some point and play around to see if it meets my needs

[14:03:33.0000] <annevk>
Having full control over the server and DNS is somewhat enticing

[14:04:39.0000] <jgraham>
Seems kind of expensive after the first 3 months

[14:07:37.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: opera 12 showed the path, it just hid the query and hash (and scheme)

[14:08:45.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: I'm open to recommendations I guess

[14:09:15.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: ideally I'd have something managed, but also full control...

[14:09:36.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Yeah, you're right. I just remember it did something very annoying. And I spent a long time arguing with Sigbjørn that it would be very annoying and eventually I did indeed find it very annoying :)

[14:10:34.0000] <zcorpan>
i also find it annoying (hiding the scheme is ok so long as copy/paste includes it)

[14:11:21.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, the scheme is fine, I don't really use it to locate myself. But the query is the most important thing on many sites

[14:19:33.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: does n.whatwg.org need to exist?

[14:19:59.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Well I have used Linode who seem to be OK

[14:21:16.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: is it a problem if n.whatwg.org doesn't use TLS?

[14:31:39.0000] <jgraham>
I think that "does it need to exist" is a better question

[14:35:47.0000] <zcorpan>
seems like it's a problem if the HSTS header for whatwg.org says includeSubDomains? but yeah

[14:36:31.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: well, it's a minted namespace.

[14:36:35.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: so some people think it should

[14:37:31.0000] <Hixie>
the HSTS header for whatwg.org doesn't currently includeSubdomains because of n.whatwg.org and company.demos.whatwg.org

[14:38:52.0000] <annevk>
See also http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-14.4 for why includeSubdomains exists

[14:40:04.0000] <jgraham>
What is company.demos.whatwg.org?

[14:40:18.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: seems like a serious problem to me if people can add new subdomains

[14:40:39.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i'm also confused as to how dyndns.org and local intranet sites (e.g. printers) are supposed to get certs

[14:44:07.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: you need to get public names for your local intranet starting November 2015

[14:44:31.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I hope we can find something better than this CA system though

[14:44:46.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: there's http://tack.io/ but it seems dormant

[14:45:11.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean, "you need to get public names for your local intranet starting November 2015"

[14:45:58.0000] <Hixie>
and are you saying that you can't host web sites using TLS on *.dyndns.org ?

[14:52:10.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: some demo site linked to from http://whatwg.org/demos/

[14:52:17.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: do you like the new html spec url btw?

[14:52:23.0000] <willchan>
if you can prove ownership of the {x}.dyndns.org hostname to a SSL CA doing domain validation, then you can serve https for it

[14:52:56.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: see e.g. https://www.digicert.com/internal-names.htm for the November 2015 change in CA policies

[14:53:30.0000] <annevk>
I wish I had a better reference, maybe something on https://cabforum.org/

[14:53:53.0000] <annevk>
I said the other day something about TC39 being bad, CA|B is worse

[14:54:00.0000] <annevk>
Or CA/B

[14:54:58.0000] <willchan>
annevk: there's hpkp (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning) which is supported today (whereas tack is still a WIP). it's fairly high maintenance though.

[14:55:28.0000] <annevk>
https://cabforum.org/internal-names/ looks like a more formal announcement of the November 2015 thing

[14:57:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: annevk: ok added a header for forums.whatwg.org

[14:58:09.0000] <Hixie>
willchan: if you can do that, what's stopping you from doing that to {x}.whatwg.org, thus enabling fishing within the whatwg.org domain even with subdomain-hsts?

[14:58:31.0000] <zcorpan>
should the initial http->https redirect include the HSTS header?

[14:58:52.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: no, HSTS header is only for TLS resources

[14:59:17.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: wait, what? not only do you have to use a publicly registered domain name, but you even have to use a public IP range?!

[14:59:30.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: HSTS is ignored on non-authenticated connections

[14:59:53.0000] <zcorpan>
k

[15:00:13.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I guess so, not sure how that's going to work for private networks then

[15:00:43.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I guess I better remove the batteries from my scale

[15:01:29.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I'm fairly new to this, but I'll try to find answers I guess

[15:03:04.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, the rfc says that includeSubdomains is to protect against cookie theft, not phishing

[15:03:11.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really understand how it does that either

[15:03:15.0000] <Hixie>
but that's a separate issue

[15:03:22.0000] <Hixie>
we don't have any domain cookies

[15:03:40.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens suggested the phishing angle

[15:04:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I'd imagine blog/wiki/forums all issue cookies

[15:04:13.0000] <Hixie>
sure but not domain cookies

[15:04:31.0000] <annevk>
if you omit domain, what is it scoped to?

[15:05:06.0000] <Hixie>
current host

[15:05:24.0000] <annevk>
anyway, I was mostly interested in getting us in the TLS-only list

[15:05:36.0000] <willchan>
hixie: do you allow any rando to create a subdomain on whatwg.org? if so, then yeah, if they can prove ownership of that hostname, then they may be able to convince a SSL CA to issue them a cert.

[15:06:36.0000] <Hixie>
willchan: we do not

[15:06:58.0000] <Hixie>
willchan: but anne was saying that without includeSubdomains, maybe people will be able to fake a subdomain anyway somehow

[15:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure how

[15:07:34.0000] <willchan>
hixie: i think that's wrong

[15:07:45.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, have a proposal for a bank: custom scheme on the forums. https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5216 (basically for QR on bills instead of typing in the details)

[15:08:28.0000] <willchan>
hixie: hsts includeSubdomains is to force HTTPS on the subdomains too, so you don't have to visit the specific subdomain first in order to prevent ssl stripping attacks.

[15:11:05.0000] <annevk>
is there some way to pin a cert?

[15:11:17.0000] <Hixie>
pin it to what?

[15:11:24.0000] <Hixie>
i mean you could print it and pin it to a corkboard pretty easily

[15:11:29.0000] <annevk>
one thing I'm surprised about is that www.whatwg.org and dom.spec.whatwg.org use different certificates, but both certificates claim to cover www.whatwg.org

[15:11:33.0000] <Hixie>
also you could take a picture of it and pinterest it

[15:11:34.0000] <annevk>
why are there no warnings?

[15:11:44.0000] <Hixie>
why would there be warnings?

[15:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
what would the warning be for?

[15:12:09.0000] <willchan>
annevk: yes you can pin a cert, use hpkp

[15:12:27.0000] <willchan>
but yes, in absence of pinning, you can have multiple certs cover a name

[15:12:50.0000] <annevk>
I'd think it's more indicative of an attack, but perhaps it's totally fine...

[15:12:55.0000] <willchan>
which is why rogue/compromised CAs are a big deal, since they can issue certs for basically any name

[15:13:28.0000] <Hixie>
i think the solution for my home network is for me to be my own CA

[15:13:42.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: serious? :-(

[15:13:47.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: so dreamhost seem to be using OpenSSL 0.9.8o

[15:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: want to try to convince them to update to OpenSSL 1.0.1c+?

[15:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
then we can get forward secrecy

[15:14:54.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I have emailed them, they say they'll likely issue updates once they have migrated towards Ubuntu

[15:15:03.0000] <willchan>
annevk: have you seen https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatwg.org%2F?

[15:15:21.0000] <annevk>
willchan: yeah I know

[15:15:26.0000] <annevk>
willchan: DreamHost :-(

[15:16:12.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: great

[15:16:21.0000] <Hixie>
willchan: yeah, looking at it now, hence my comment just above :-)

[15:16:26.0000] <annevk>
nn

[15:16:51.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[15:21:10.0000] <Hixie>
oh we're on apache 2.2, so we'd need to update that too

[15:23:21.0000] <willchan>
annevk: the www.whatwg.org cert chain is a little weird too

[15:24:13.0000] <willchan>
don't need to include the self-signed root cert in the chain, since they're baked into browsers already

[15:28:35.0000] <willchan>
hixie: for your home network, browsers should remember your clicked through warning for a period of time and temporally "pin" that cert (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=262615). i believe firefox does this today.

[15:31:24.0000] <Hixie>
willchan: looks like i'm not allowed to see that bug

[15:31:34.0000] <Hixie>
but why temporarily?

[15:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
shouldn't it be for the lifetime of the cert? which should itself probably be forever, since the device ain't getting updated, realistically?

[15:33:31.0000] <willchan>
hm, silly bug is locked down. probably could be opened.

[15:33:39.0000] <willchan>
here's a public CL that describes lots of it: https://codereview.chromium.org/369703002

[15:37:30.0000] <Hixie>
you gotta love https://github.com/w3c/html/commit/15eb97cfc8b7fc97c2dcceaf92c748a2c1ae2e78

[15:37:55.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if now that the types are registered, and now that the reference is obsolete, the whatwg should contact the ietf to have them updated... ---

[15:37:58.0000] <Hixie>
-_- even, not ---

[15:38:10.0000] <willchan>
hixie: i believe people have differing opinions on the lifetime, and i'm not well-informed on that aspect, so i won't chime in on it. it's possible that if we can identify the local network (perhaps via IP, a la https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/#private-url), it'd be reasonable to extend the lifetime. i dunno though.

[15:38:29.0000] <Hixie>
willchan: ah, yeah, not knowing if it's local would be an interesting issue

[15:53:36.0000] <zcorpan>
btw, JAB Creations is awesome for cleaning up spam on the forums. too bad there is almost zero non-spam

[16:04:33.0000] <Hixie>
so...

[16:04:40.0000] <Hixie>
if you fullscreen an element

[16:04:43.0000] <Hixie>
then remove its parent

[16:04:45.0000] <Hixie>
what happens?

[16:04:47.0000] <Hixie>
and why?

[16:05:23.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me says the fullscreen goes away

[16:05:33.0000] <zcorpan>
ALIENS

[16:06:07.0000] <zcorpan>
/me needs sleep

[16:08:19.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: do any specs actually say that?

[16:08:35.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me is not a spec

[16:08:36.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean, that's obviously what needs to happen. Dunno if it's written anywhere.

[16:15:11.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: More detailed opinion: Destroying the parent fires a no-more-fullscreen event to all children

[16:15:13.0000] <GPHemsley>
or somesuch

[16:16:51.0000] <GPHemsley>
wait... don't we have the Fullscreen spec?

[16:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/ doesn't seem to answer this question

[16:18:30.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bug Anne, then.

[16:18:30.0000] <Hixie>
unless "removign steps" are run for descendants of removed nodes?

[16:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
no, doesn't seem like it...

[16:29:36.0000] <Hixie>
JakeA: ping https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/410 ?

[16:29:43.0000] <Hixie>
(just added my comment)

[16:29:57.0000] <Hixie>
(but if you're around we can chat here)

[16:37:16.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: I would imagine it has something to do with this: https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#fully-exit-fullscreen


2014-09-16
[23:42:40.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie: `includeSubdomains` makes sure that once the user visits https://whatwg.org/, *.whatwg.org is in the HSTS cache, and so entering `http://somesubdomain.whatwg.org/` or even `http://idontexist.whatwg.org/` in the address bar would go to HTTPS instantly without ever making a connection over HTTP

[23:43:44.0000] <mathiasbynens>
that’s important, because as soon as you hit HTTP a MitM attacker can just strip the redirect to HTTPS, or send a response that they control (e.g. phishing page)

[23:44:43.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: how cna they hijack idontexist.whatwg.org?

[23:47:03.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: if `includeSubdomains` is not set, and the user enters the non-HTTPS URL

[23:47:38.0000] <mathiasbynens>
or another (attacker-controlled) page includes a resource from that domain or links/redirects to it over HTTP etc.

[23:51:15.0000] <mathiasbynens>
with `includeSubdomains`, as soon as the user visits any page on `whatwg.org`, HSTS kicks in for the entire domain including subdomains, and all future requests will go over HTTPS (even for subdomains that haven’t been visited before or that don’t resolve)

[23:52:48.0000] <mathiasbynens>
to get to the same level of safety when `includeSubdomains` is not set, the user would have to visit all the existing *.whatwg.org domains, including those that don’t even exist (→ ∞), assuming all subdomains send HSTS headers as well

[00:12:37.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: is there some documentation on how an attacker would do that?

[00:12:48.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: the RFC only mentions a cookie attack

[00:18:46.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: it’s just a plain old MitM attack

[00:19:26.0000] <mathiasbynens>
moxie’s sslstrip talk explains the whole thing much better than i ever could http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/

[00:19:57.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: not really, they'd have to MitM the DNS query

[00:20:30.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: dns cache poisoning attacks are a thing

[00:22:05.0000] <annevk>
okay, so if we deployed DNSSEC we would not need includeSubdomains

[00:22:45.0000] <annevk>
of course, people could still be MitM for several subdomains that we chose not to have TLS on and DNSSEC doesn't actually work...

[00:29:58.0000] <mathiasbynens>
why can’t we switch all subdomains over? i missed this discussion

[00:36:11.0000] <zcorpan_>
mathiasbynens: namespaces

[00:37:17.0000] <mathiasbynens>
oh my

[00:43:25.0000] <zcorpan_>
there was also a demo page but i don't know why that can't be switched over or just nuked or moved to whatwg.org/demos

[00:47:38.0000] <annevk>
foolip: I think html-mirror might be down

[00:47:52.0000] <annevk>
foolip: I think the problem might be TLS

[00:49:28.0000] <annevk>
foolip: if you're using Python 2, the problem is Python not supporting SNI

[00:50:15.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20140915#l-649

[00:51:59.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: also http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20140915#l-918

[00:52:09.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: IIRC, the StartTLS ToS (which is called something other than ToS has subscriber obligations and, IIRC, you have the obligation to revoke if you believe the private key has been compromised)

[00:52:20.0000] <hsivonen>
oops. bad placement of )

[00:53:23.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: https://spec.whatwg.org/ has a TLS error

[01:01:31.0000] <hsivonen>
oops. I almost removed an Encoding Standard encoding by accident

[01:01:44.0000] <hsivonen>
good thing I re-read my patch

[01:26:45.0000] <foolip>
annevk: yes, the git-svn stuff blew up, I'm looking at it now

[01:27:06.0000] <foolip>
because the URL changed, it can't figure out how to put it back together again :)

[01:27:24.0000] <foolip>
looking for a change other than rewriting the entire history

[01:31:04.0000] <annevk>
foolip: thanks, and sorry about that, unintended side effects

[01:31:13.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: which bug is this?

[01:31:58.0000] <foolip>
annevk: do you know if Hixie rewrote everything to include data-revision="$Revision: 8770 $" at the top?

[01:32:51.0000] <foolip>
because my old mirror of that commit has that diff compared to a checkout of the same revision from https://...

[01:33:09.0000] <foolip>
or is $Revision$ some kind of magic that gets rewritten on the client only?

[01:33:40.0000] <annevk>
foolip: I doubt it, but I don't know for sure

[01:33:51.0000] <annevk>
foolip: I can tell you that on the WHATWG server SVN hasn't changed since 2011

[01:34:02.0000] <annevk>
foolip: the SVN software that is

[01:34:39.0000] <annevk>
foolip: wait, did you not rewrite history to include those?

[01:34:50.0000] <annevk>
foolip: to keep web-apps-tracker working

[01:35:48.0000] <foolip>
annevk: I haven't noticed these $Revision$ things before

[01:36:16.0000] <foolip>
in the existing html-mirror, index and complete.html just say data-revision="$Revision$"

[01:37:07.0000] <foolip>
I guess this could be because I'm comparing a git-svn checkout with a plain svn checkout, maybe svn expands these things on the client side

[01:37:23.0000] <foolip>
I'll try a new git-svn clone to see what it looks like

[01:37:56.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: if you traffic from 37.139.17.34 is too much, let me know

[01:38:17.0000] <annevk>
foolip: I thought you added revision annotations in the git so I could extract them

[01:38:46.0000] <foolip>
annevk: you're probably thinking of the git-svn-id: http://svn.whatwg.org/webapps@8770 340c8d12-0b0e-0410-8428-c7bf67bfef74 line

[01:38:59.0000] <annevk>
ah yes

[01:39:02.0000] <foolip>
git-svn adds that by default, sadly it wasn't specially for you :)

[01:43:50.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: SVN does http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.advanced.props.special.keywords.html on the client side, if the file has the property svn:keywords="Revision"

[01:45:00.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: thanks

[01:46:03.0000] <Philip`>
$ svn propget svn:keywords index

[01:46:06.0000] <Philip`>
Revision

[02:13:05.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: Philip`: jgraham: krijnhoetmer: mathiasbynens: gsnedders: matijs: zcorpan_: I take care of the http->https redirect now for all html5.org domains. You only have to set the HSTS header. Sorry for not figuring out I could do that earlier on.

[02:13:52.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: thanks (and done)

[02:16:51.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: writing a series of posts on TLS btw, thanks for the help so far :-)

[02:29:32.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: should I go and remove the redirect from .htaccess?

[02:29:44.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: yeah you can

[02:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: ok.

[02:30:11.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: the charset bug is https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=997133

[02:34:52.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: ah so yeah, cyrillic should not be removed

[02:35:25.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: right

[02:38:54.0000] <foolip>
annevk: I think I'll have it sorted soon. note that the http will change to https in the git-svn-id line, so make sure you're not matching on that

[02:42:49.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I removed the redirect and kept HSTS

[02:42:56.0000] <mathiasbynens>
^ same here

[02:43:19.0000] <zcorpan_>
seems i had done it already

[03:02:54.0000] <annevk>
foolip: I think I am

[03:03:01.0000] <annevk>
foolip: I guess I can fix that somehow

[03:03:28.0000] <annevk>
foolip: https://github.com/whatwg/web-apps-tracker/blob/master/web-apps-tracker#L275

[03:33:59.0000] <annevk>
foolip: fixed by adding a second --grep that checks for https, couldn't figure out regexp syntax

[03:35:36.0000] <annevk>
foolip: https://github.com/whatwg/web-apps-tracker/commit/62d433b92278c257d6305bc5f3970682967f30fa

[03:39:36.0000] <foolip>
annevk: html-mirror is now up to date and should be auto-updating

[03:40:13.0000] <annevk>
foolip: great, I also updated the commit hook from GitHub as GitHub does not deal with redirects

[03:41:06.0000] <foolip>
what redirect is that?

[03:43:51.0000] <annevk>
foolip: http->https

[03:44:09.0000] <annevk>
foolip: html5.org is also on TLS

[03:44:39.0000] <foolip>
oh, you had a commit webhook pointing at http://html5.org/something?

[03:44:47.0000] <foolip>
I never looked at that half of things :)

[03:46:31.0000] <annevk>
yes

[03:50:14.0000] <foolip>
annevk: btw, I'm going to get back to the fullscreen bugs any week now! I've been distracted by some other things for a while

[04:06:48.0000] <annevk>
foolip: Hixie filed some too

[04:08:22.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: so to address the review comment, I'll just add another commit to the same branch, right?

[04:09:40.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: yeah

[04:10:10.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me assumes it's about critic

[04:11:16.0000] <tantek>
/me waves from London

[04:11:48.0000] <foolip>
annevk: about the removal problem, I had assumed that what the spec currently says would apply for any removal, even if it was a parent that's removed

[04:12:06.0000] <annevk>
foolip: that was the idea

[04:12:12.0000] <annevk>
foolip: might have to rephrase I guess

[04:17:14.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: ok. thanks

[04:45:55.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: you can remove the `; preload` part once you’ve submitted your site to hstspreload.appspot.com

[04:46:58.0000] <mathiasbynens>
(which you’ve done)

[04:54:24.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Yeah, as zcorpan_ said

[05:40:17.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: r? https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/r/2600 The actual tests were already reviewed by bz, so they should be correct

[05:40:51.0000] <foolip>
woah, HTML joins the others under .spec.whatwg.org :)

[05:41:24.0000] <foolip>
finally I can write URLs like https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlmediaelement which are shortish and won't redirect

[05:41:51.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, Hixie fixed it!

[05:41:55.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Thanks!

[05:42:19.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: that's some confusing ID naming

[05:42:53.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Yeah, not my tests

[05:43:27.0000] <foolip>
heh, https://html.spec.whatwg.org has a SHA1 cert, I guess they're cheaper?

[05:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
Some (many?) CAs only do SHA1 certs :(

[05:44:26.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: I guess you've seen the drama around Chromiums pending changes here?

[05:44:31.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah

[05:44:53.0000] <jgraham>
I can't get a SHA2 cert from Gandi at this point

[05:45:33.0000] <jgraham>
https://twitter.com/gandibar/status/509116131173748736

[05:45:34.0000] <annevk>
foolip: the certificate is SHA-256

[05:46:01.0000] <annevk>
foolip: which is the same for all of whatwg.org except the home page at the moment as Hixie has not replaced that one, but that is also not SHA-1 afaict

[05:46:09.0000] <foolip>
annevk: oh, it says that the connection is SHA1, I guess that's separate from the cert itself

[05:46:26.0000] <annevk>
foolip: yeah, DreamHost is bad at TLS

[05:47:08.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: hasn't that test already been reviewed as part of the patch to Gecko?

[05:47:09.0000] <foolip>
clicked some more and see that the cert has a SHA-1 and a SHA-256 fingerprint

[05:47:19.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: anyway, first half is okay...

[05:47:21.0000] <foolip>
anyway, I like the new URL

[05:49:17.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: critic also does not seem to remember I logged in

[05:49:29.0000] <annevk>
foolip: jgraham managed to convince Hixie to switch it over

[05:51:10.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Thanks

[05:51:57.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: we should have a policy though that if it passes mozilla.org peer review, it can bypass critic

[05:52:20.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: though perhaps require a pointer to the public bug report where the review happened

[05:52:47.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: We do, but in this case I rewrote the tests to be in testharness.js format rather than mochitest format

[05:52:57.0000] <annevk>
I see

[05:52:59.0000] <jgraham>
So technically that change needs review

[05:56:06.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: seems Google is doing something with EV: http://www.certificate-transparency.org/ev-ct-plan

[06:17:29.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: so when is TLS coming to jakearchibald.com? ;-)

[06:18:31.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if annevk's new role in life is to ask everyone one by one when they will adopt TLS

[06:18:57.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: I'll start with this channel; have you TLS'd?

[06:21:46.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: You already asked me :p

[06:23:58.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: no repeats?

[06:24:15.0000] <boogyman>
jgraham: haha

[06:24:35.0000] <annevk>
oh hey boogyman, using TLS?

[06:24:37.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: I'm promising myself this year. We'll see if that happens.

[06:25:20.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: I've just added it to several domains, it took quite a few hours

[06:25:36.0000] <boogyman>
Good afternoon, and not right now. I use DH for hosting too.

[06:25:57.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: I like to imagine you as like the guy in Hitchhikers who is insulting every being in the universe one by one, in alphabetical order. Except in your case it's only the subset that have inadequate TLS setups.

[06:25:57.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: but at least now you know that fetch.spec.whatwg.org is really the Fetch Standard and not some MITM shit

[06:26:20.0000] <darobin>
jgraham: that's still pretty much every being in the universe

[06:26:46.0000] <annevk>
At least I have some new questions to ask at parties

[06:26:50.0000] <jgraham>
darobin: Indeed, I'm not saying it's a proper subset

[06:26:53.0000] <darobin>
/me grinds his teeth at how his plan to MITM Fetch through captive portal hacking has been foiled

[06:27:11.0000] <annevk>
Do you utf-8? "Yes" Great! Do you TLS? "Euh" Sorry

[06:27:32.0000] <darobin>
I *so* wanted to replace that dumb arrow logo with a picture of Lassie

[06:27:53.0000] <jgraham>
Oh is that the new W3C approach? Make the WiFi at TPAC MITM whatwg.org to add W3C branding?

[06:28:23.0000] <darobin>
W3C branding? what for? I just wanted to change the green to a nicer change and inject silly jokes via the secondary logo

[06:28:33.0000] <darobin>
s/change/shade/

[06:28:47.0000] <jgraham>
Oh well if you want to change the green then this is a plan that I can get behind

[06:29:38.0000] <jgraham>
TLS is clearly harmful

[06:30:33.0000] <zewt>
thread-local storage? heh

[06:36:35.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: \o/ I might bug you when I come to do it then

[06:37:32.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: yeah feel free; I decided to offer assistance to anyone who wants to try it out

[06:38:23.0000] <darobin>
annevk: mind mailing me your SSH key so I can set you up with a root account on my box?

[06:44:37.0000] <annevk>
https://twitter.com/annevk/status/511872386652962817

[06:45:17.0000] <tantek>
congrats annevk!

[06:53:44.0000] <foolip>
annevk: "On the upside, they free for non-commercial usage" + offer?

[06:55:03.0000] <annevk>
foolip: fixed

[06:55:39.0000] <foolip>
also, sounds like not fun to be dutch with all the Van going on

[06:58:02.0000] <darobin>
hsivonen: word on the street is that you have a great recommended setup for TLS on nginx

[07:16:51.0000] <tantek>
darobin: see https://indiewebcamp.com/nginx#SSL_Setup and https://indiewebcamp.com/https#nginx

[07:34:14.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: irony:

[07:34:19.0000] <zcorpan_>
-<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/"><img alt="W3C" height="48" src="https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home" width="72"></a></p>

[07:38:59.0000] <darobin>
tantek: thanks!

[07:39:27.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_: how did that happen? Outdated version of respec?

[07:39:34.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_: euh, Anolis

[07:39:39.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: yeah

[07:39:52.0000] <tantek>
darobin no problem! we just did a pretty decent https sprint at IndieWebCampUK the weekend before last which I just happened to have blogged about a couple of hours ago.

[07:40:27.0000] <annevk>
tantek: so is tantek.com getting the TLS?

[07:40:40.0000] <darobin>
tantek: all I need do now is run a sprint with myself to get it set up

[07:40:49.0000] <tantek>
darobin - also, feel free to ask any follow-ups re: setting up https re: those pages/instructions on #indiewebcamp

[07:41:05.0000] <tantek>
darobin - come on by #indiewebcamp and you'll have folks actively wanting to help get you to https

[07:41:16.0000] <tantek>
annevk - only self-signed for my admin interface for the moment

[07:41:50.0000] <tantek>
I'm behind. I'm only at what we call "Level 2" https support (out of 5) https://indiewebcamp.com/https#Level_2_security

[07:42:50.0000] <annevk>
seems I'm Level 4

[07:43:52.0000] <tantek>
you should add yourself :) https://indiewebcamp.com/https#Level_4_security

[07:45:20.0000] <darobin>
tantek: thanks, I might actually join. That said, I'll probably be fine, the only reason it's not there yet is because my ancient experience with Apache + SSL was horrible. But that was back then.

[08:04:06.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: i’m not using https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/RedirectSSL as per that twitter dude’s suggestion – works well, and much simpler

[08:32:51.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: does not look simpler, what am I missing?

[08:34:24.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: well it simplifies my setup, where i use vhosts.conf to configure each domain on my server

[08:34:38.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: if you have root that does seem better

[08:35:01.0000] <mathiasbynens>
ah, so you’re not root, gotcha

[08:36:01.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: noted this solution in the post

[08:37:02.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: so Eric Lawrence discovered that I'm now sometimes sending out the HSTS header twice

[08:37:14.0000] <mathiasbynens>
\o/

[08:37:23.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I might be invoking PHP in two different ways :-(

[08:37:38.0000] <mathiasbynens>
example URL?

[08:37:57.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: https://annevankesteren.nl/2014/09/tls-next-steps vs home page

[08:38:07.0000] <mathiasbynens>
maybe it’s .htaccess + PHP in some weird cases?

[08:39:49.0000] <mathiasbynens>
i just accidentally downloaded your `index.php` source code :/

[08:40:19.0000] <mathiasbynens>
brb

[08:40:46.0000] <annevk>
yeah that's fine, running experiments live :p

[08:45:51.0000] <annevk>
I am the first, I just discovered I was using prefixes for transitions and transforms on my site

[08:45:55.0000] <annevk>
And had not unprefixed them

[08:47:18.0000] <annevk>
I am using ::selection unprefixed however

[08:47:23.0000] <annevk>
But that seems to be gone :(

[09:15:51.0000] <Hixie>
uh

[09:15:56.0000] <Hixie>
what did i do to spec.whatwg.org

[09:17:13.0000] <Hixie>
ok that should be fixed

[09:17:19.0000] <Hixie>
no idea what i had done there

[09:17:27.0000] <Hixie>
whatever it was broke the dreamhost panel ui

[09:17:41.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll move the demos stuff back onto whatwg.org somehow

[09:17:55.0000] <annevk>
you broke the panel? lol

[09:18:07.0000] <Hixie>
i got some exception trying to edit the cert

[09:18:13.0000] <Hixie>
i just removed the domain and readded it and it worked

[09:20:18.0000] <Hixie>
so this demo is unmodified since 2011

[09:20:23.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i should just disable it

[09:20:55.0000] <Hixie>
it gets virtually no traffic

[09:22:20.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: double header is fixed – how?

[09:22:33.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: if that and some namespaces are standing in the way of HSTS, yes

[09:23:17.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: I stopped using ForceType php5-cgi for extensionless files and instead renamed those files to end in .php

[09:23:25.0000] <Hixie>
what happens if in a subdomain with includesSubdomain, an https:// site redirects to an http:// site without HSTS?

[09:23:59.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: the files ending in .php were the ones sending the duplicate header that was noticed, still not quite sure what is going on

[09:24:43.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: https://planet.html5.org/ is such a site

[09:25:00.0000] <mathiasbynens>
Hixie: same thing as any HTTPS URL that redirects to itself, i guess

[09:29:47.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: oh, to itself? Seems you created a loop

[09:30:28.0000] <Hixie>
no i mean what if https://whatwg.org has sts-includesubdomains, and https://x.whatwg.org redirects to http://x.whatwg.org without an sts header?

[09:30:54.0000] <Hixie>
or with a header, with maxage=0

[09:31:50.0000] <annevk>
I think that should cause an infinite redirect as before the redirect fetch is done, the URL would be rewritten to https://x.whatwg.org/

[09:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[09:32:15.0000] <Hixie>
let me ask again with maxage=0

[09:32:34.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear to me if that would punch a hole through the includesubdomains

[09:32:38.0000] <annevk>
https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch step 1

[09:33:00.0000] <annevk>
If a user agent lets a subdomain override includeSubdomains of a parent, that seems broken

[09:33:44.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[09:34:13.0000] <Hixie>
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-8.1

[09:34:22.0000] <Hixie>
you fetch the encrypted version of x.whatwg.org

[09:34:26.0000] <Hixie>
it unsets the hsts headers

[09:34:29.0000] <Hixie>
then you get the redirect

[09:34:36.0000] <Hixie>
so at step 1, you don't have any known hosts

[09:34:54.0000] <annevk>
what about the whatwg.org entry?

[09:35:06.0000] <Hixie>
it shouldn't be affected, right?

[09:35:19.0000] <annevk>
if that has includeSubdomains, why should that not apply to x.whatwg.org?

[09:35:45.0000] <annevk>
if you have not seen whatwg.org it would be different, but if you have it seems that ought to apply

[09:37:49.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i really can't tell from the rfc

[09:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: ping

[09:39:04.0000] <annevk>
IETF claims http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6797 provides information on how to give feedback, but it doesn't

[09:39:34.0000] <annevk>
I guess you need to click under "Source" http://tools.ietf.org/wg/websec/ and give feedback to that WG

[09:39:53.0000] <annevk>
IETF is a lot less clear than our "Participate:" boxes

[09:40:11.0000] <Hixie>
shocking

[09:40:39.0000] <Hixie>
hmmm

[09:40:51.0000] <Hixie>
includesubdomains doesn't interact very well with www.*

[09:41:56.0000] <Hixie>
k well i may have broken things more than before

[09:41:59.0000] <Hixie>
or i may have fixed them

[09:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
hard to tell until dreamhost propagates

[09:50:42.0000] <annevk>
Google friends, will there be a time when one can change their Hangouts / Google+ ID? https://gist.github.com/annevk/7f83773f82d52c721664

[09:58:08.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I attempted emailing websec with your question

[10:00:31.0000] <annevk>
Oh my, message being held for moderation

[10:00:41.0000] <Domenic_>
annevk: I have the same problem with the mandatory @gmail.com account :(

[10:00:59.0000] <annevk>
Domenic_: can you pull some strings? :-)

[10:01:07.0000] <annevk>
Domenic_: feel free to share that gist with anyone

[10:01:15.0000] <Domenic_>
I can ask around, I guess

[10:05:45.0000] <annevk>
Domenic_: in case I did not get this link through you https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/03/30/callbacks-are-imperative-promises-are-functional-nodes-biggest-missed-opportunity/

[10:25:39.0000] <caitp>
how does one argue that promises are somehow functional, they aren't really any different from callbacks except slightly more sugary and slower

[10:26:23.0000] <Domenic_>
did you read the article?

[10:26:30.0000] <caitp>
not only that, but the behaviour of promise methods depends on what? state

[10:26:41.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic_: Question from yesterday?

[10:26:51.0000] <Domenic_>
TabAtkins: about ecmarkdown wanting consistent indentation?

[10:27:00.0000] <caitp>
Domenic_ it sounds like the typical nonsense that the usual "functional vs imperative" crowd of blogs writes

[10:27:11.0000] <caitp>
haven't read it in full but I'm not confident in its contents

[10:27:15.0000] <Domenic_>
caitp: so you did, or did not read it? because i think it explains it pretty clearly.

[10:27:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic_: No, about why you want ecmarkdown to only use a single number for ol bullets.

[10:27:50.0000] <Domenic_>
TabAtkins: for consistency and simplicity, basically.

[10:27:55.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't understand.

[10:27:56.0000] <caitp>
a promise is an object which contains state (which may or may not be mutable, implementation depending), and which has methods which behave differently depending on that state

[10:28:00.0000] <caitp>
this is not really functional

[10:28:25.0000] <Domenic_>
caitp: I am really not interested in correcting your misconceptions which can be corrected by you simply reading the linked article.

[10:28:35.0000] <Domenic_>
TabAtkins: more choices = less simplicity, less consistency

[10:28:38.0000] <caitp>
those aren't misconceptions

[10:28:39.0000] <caitp>
it's a fact

[10:28:42.0000] <Domenic_>
TabAtkins: perhaps the problem is the name

[10:28:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic_: I mean, what choices are there?

[10:29:10.0000] <Domenic_>
TabAtkins: whether to start with 1 and go up, or just to stick with 1 forever

[10:29:15.0000] <TabAtkins>
caitp: Promises are monads over time-dependent state.

[10:29:30.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic_: Just... require it to be numbered correctly?

[10:30:25.0000] <caitp>
except it's not really "time dependent", it's "dependent on the order of operations, because some operations affect their state"

[10:31:18.0000] <TabAtkins>
You seem to be arguing that, for example, the IO monad isn't functional either.

[10:31:44.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: then refactoring steps messes up diffs

[10:32:12.0000] <caitp>
i don't really care to have a real argument about it, but it's like, functional is not better or worse than imperative, so the argument doesn't really mean anything; but objects containing state which is manipulated by some operations, and which affects the behaviour of other operations

[10:32:18.0000] <caitp>
that's not very functional

[10:32:24.0000] <caitp>
that's typical of any imperative programme

[10:32:27.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Sure, but the source is more readable.  (I don't like how I have to go look at the rendered html to know what the number is for a given <li> in an <ol>.)

[10:33:07.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: well I guess your answer then is we are prioritizing diffs (for which this is better) and authoring experience (for which this is neutral/slightly beter) over source readability (for which this is worse)

[10:33:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
caitp: It seems that you don't understand the functional encapsulation that monads can make over varying state; I suggest reading up a bit more on that.

[10:33:43.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Okay. Are you planning to have the "lists start with the number of the first item" behavior too?

[10:35:09.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: for all of the ES6 spec lists start with 1, so probably not?

[10:35:20.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: we'll probably change from 0. to 1.

[10:35:40.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: That's generally true for most specs, sure, but, for example, Flexbox has an algorithm split over multiple sections, where each <ol> picks up where the last one left off.

[10:36:17.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: yeah, that's fair. I mean in general we could try to do fully-general Markdown list syntax and just have a secondary linting tool that enforces our desired conventions for ES specs

[10:36:35.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: the problem there is then I have to write more code :P

[10:37:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Sorry to be a bother, it's just that now that MD actually has a spec, I consider deviations from that to need strong justifications, rather than just being a matter of flavor. ^_^

[10:37:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Bikeshed has a few deviations that it'll be maintaining, for example.)

[10:37:49.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: would it help if it were named something else? It's just Markdown-inspired (i.e. literally I found writing specs in Markdown to be pleasant, and that inspired me to create a new language). It's not meant to be a Markdown flavor.

[10:38:15.0000] <Domenic>
We'd loose the nice punning of Ecmarkup (= custom elements vocabulary) + Ecmarkdown, sadly

[10:38:27.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Do what you want, I'm just pushing my own agenda of making it easier to transport text (and authoring assumptions) across markdowns.

[10:38:50.0000] <TabAtkins>
The less parsing diff I need to maintain in my head, the better.

[10:38:50.0000] <Domenic>
Hmm hmm

[10:41:19.0000] <TabAtkins>
Obviously text won't transport too well from CMD to ECMD, due to you changing what all of the inline elements mean, but still.

[10:50:03.0000] <annevk>
Safari on iPhone has interesting UI choices. It shows [padlock] whatwg.org for https://www.whatwg.org/

[10:50:24.0000] <annevk>
It actually omits "www.", but does not do so for other subdomains

[10:53:25.0000] <Domenic>
boo to www

[10:54:49.0000] <SimonSapin>
Is "lossily" a word?

[10:55:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[10:56:34.0000] <jgraham>
True fact: a long time ago before the internet was something that people were familiar with, my Dad phoned me to ask if some server with the url w3.something.tld was the same as www.something.tld So www. has been causing confusion since the mid 90s

[10:58:40.0000] <annevk>
http://no-www.org/ (sadly no TLS)

[10:59:27.0000] <Hixie>
bummo, i broke https://n.whatwg.org

[10:59:31.0000] <Hixie>
let's see here...

[11:00:26.0000] <Domenic>
I still don't understand n.whatwg.org?

[11:00:48.0000] <Hixie>
ok, fixed it

[11:00:50.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which part? It's existence, or that it's staying on http:?

[11:00:52.0000] <annevk>
So as far as I can tell the only valid namespace is http://n.whatwg.org/work and it is not actually evident that is seeing much usage

[11:01:48.0000] <Hixie>
it's seeing basically no usage outside the html spec, as far as i'm aware

[11:02:09.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: and because it sees usage in the HTML spec we want to not do HSTS fully?

[11:02:30.0000] <Hixie>
namespaces are namespaces

[11:02:39.0000] <Hixie>
once you commit to have a namespace, you commit to having it for, like, ever.

[11:02:41.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: namespaces are also just strings

[11:02:49.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: and not actually something meant to resolve

[11:02:50.0000] <tantek>
except for the http vs https part

[11:02:53.0000] <tantek>
so I heard

[11:02:59.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: if n.whatwg.org didn't exist, the namespace would continue to exist

[11:03:22.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: it would continue to exist for sure, but some people would be confused.

[11:03:30.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: the existence. Sounds like I should do Ctrl+F on the singlepage spec?

[11:03:30.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, we have includeSubdomains

[11:03:39.0000] <Hixie>
so this is a non-issue

[11:03:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: It's nothing more than a namespace.

[11:03:48.0000] <jgraham>
I think an existance proof on those people would be interesting

[11:03:48.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: e.g. the W3C cannot configure its own server probably and has been redirecting namespaces for years

[11:03:57.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: sure, but used for what, is the question

[11:03:59.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: try http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml

[11:04:07.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: not many people have ended up being confused as a result

[11:04:13.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: though I have complained about it

[11:04:15.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: It's used to have a page that the namespaces can resolve to.

[11:04:16.0000] <Hixie>
the w3c is not exactly the pinacle of good practices

[11:04:26.0000] <jgraham>
Nor are namespaces ;)

[11:04:37.0000] <Hixie>
i'd be interesting to test that hypothesis

[11:04:42.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how many pages says xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/"

[11:04:46.0000] <Hixie>
say

[11:04:58.0000] <Hixie>
/me goes to find out

[11:05:16.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: the point is that if a widespread namespace can redirect, so can a namespace that is only used in fiction and is causing end user harm (by not being on the HSTS preload list)

[11:05:32.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: what is the namespace used for, is the question. Answering it myself, looks like, used for microdata?

[11:05:40.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Ah, ok. Yes.

[11:05:51.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: we can be on the HSTS preload list

[11:05:58.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: this is not causing any such blockage

[11:06:06.0000] <tantek>
having namespaces break just serves to demonstrate they shouldn't have been used in the first place

[11:06:13.0000] <SimonSapin>
I just wrote a proto-spec for the WTF-8 encoding: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/12056#issuecomment-55786546

[11:06:22.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: the url answers that question :-)

[11:07:05.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: haha, just goes to show, my strong assumption was that the actual namespace URL would be useless

[11:07:22.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[11:07:33.0000] <Hixie>
technically this isn't actually a namespace

[11:07:37.0000] <Hixie>
it's a vocabulary identifier

[11:07:44.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: conversion to UTF-8 needs to be better

[11:07:53.0000] <SimonSapin>
annevk: better how?

[11:08:03.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: e.g. if you concat two surrogates, they can turn into a thing

[11:08:43.0000] <SimonSapin>
annevk: do we want to support that?

[11:09:00.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: if you ever want a JavaScript impl in Rust, yes

[11:10:39.0000] <Hixie>
ok, n.whatwg.org finally does what i want it to do

[11:10:41.0000] <gavinc>
Is there an explanation somewhere as to why I can't get the status code of the request that loaded the current page in javascript? Seems so very odd not to be able to

[11:10:45.0000] <SimonSapin>
annevk: so abandon equivalence with UCS-2? (Two WTF-8 strings have the same bytes if and only if their UCS-2 representation have the same bytes)

[11:12:32.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: why would that not be true?

[11:12:33.0000] <jgraham>
Is there a special reason that concatenation of two WTF-8 buffers has to produce a valid WTF-8 string? Presumably a WTF-8 library could examine the endpoints for WTF-8ness and convert if necessary

[11:13:14.0000] <SimonSapin>
jgraham: yeah, that sounds better

[11:13:33.0000] <Hixie>
wait why does the hsts preload list require that we violate the hsts spec by adding the non-standard "preload" token

[11:13:47.0000] <SimonSapin>
so WTF-8 concat is a bit more work than byte concat, but I think that’s ok

[11:13:57.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I think that's only temporary to ensure you can't add sites that don't want to be on it

[11:14:06.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: temporarily required*

[11:14:18.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: after you submit you can remove it again

[11:16:42.0000] <jgraham>
Argh

[11:16:49.0000] <jgraham>
Config file formats all suck

[11:17:27.0000] <Hixie>
ok i give up

[11:17:30.0000] <Hixie>
https://whatwg.org it is

[11:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
for a decide i have fought this no-www nonsense on sites that are clearly _about_ the www and therefore by all reason should have "www" in their name

[11:18:09.0000] <Hixie>
but lo, hsts has beaten me

[11:18:33.0000] <Hixie>
go forth and remove the www.s!

[11:19:09.0000] <SimonSapin>
Hixie: try do buy www.org?

[11:19:23.0000] <Hixie>
from the w3c?

[11:19:27.0000] <Hixie>
good luck with _that_

[11:19:32.0000] <SimonSapin>
or convince ICANN to make a .www TLD :)

[11:19:38.0000] <Hixie>
.org is fine

[11:19:57.0000] <SimonSapin>
oh, I didn’t know W3C had this one

[11:22:09.0000] <jgraham>
You don't need to convince ICANN with more than just cash these days, do you?

[11:22:43.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: see https://javascript.spec.whatwg.org/#regexp

[11:22:51.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: not sure if mathiasbynens filed bugs on Allen for those yet

[11:23:02.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: yeah I saw that, not terribly helpful

[11:23:16.0000] <caitp>
is that a fork of es262 or something

[11:23:36.0000] <annevk>
It's a delta of sorts, I guess

[11:24:44.0000] <caitp>
neat

[11:25:03.0000] <Domenic>
It was more important when ES had none of these things

[11:25:13.0000] <Domenic>
Most of it is being absorbed into ES

[11:25:22.0000] <Domenic>
But curiously not the RegExp stuff (yet?)

[11:25:50.0000] <annevk>
Yeah, mathiasbynens should update it so it does not contradict the HTML ES6 draft

[11:26:20.0000] <annevk>
Date is also not covered by ES6 I think

[11:26:31.0000] <annevk>
Not sure about the comment syntax, I think that's still an open bug

[11:26:45.0000] <abarth>
Hixie: pong

[11:27:34.0000] <annevk>
abarth: it was a question about where HSTS defines that a policy for domain.com affects sub.domain.com

[11:27:58.0000] <abarth>
you mean where in the RFC?

[11:28:07.0000] <zcorpan>
yay no www

[11:32:31.0000] <tobie>
TabAtkins: I see from the Bikeshed doc that you're looking into importing some of the Specref data. Would anything make that easier (e.g. splitting up the existing stuff into various files)?

[11:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
tobie: Nah, I've already got it ready to go.

[11:33:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
I just need to do some profiling on it; loading up biblio and ref data is the most expensive part of running Bikeshed, and turning on SpecRef is a significant addition to that cost.

[11:34:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
Splitting things up would actually make it more difficult to handle.  I don't do any downloads at processing time; you have to periodically run `bikeshed update` yourself, so all the linking data is stored locally.

[11:34:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
So I need to have all the data anyway.

[11:34:54.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: yeah

[11:34:55.0000] <tobie>
I'll be turning-on daily auto-updates this week, btw.

[11:35:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Cool.

[11:35:17.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: say i have example.com and it has an STS policy with includesubdomains

[11:35:22.0000] <abarth>
6.1.2.  The includeSubDomains Directive

[11:35:22.0000] <abarth>
   The OPTIONAL "includeSubDomains" directive is a valueless directive

[11:35:22.0000] <abarth>
   which, if present (i.e., it is "asserted"), signals the UA that the

[11:35:22.0000] <abarth>
   HSTS Policy applies to this HSTS Host as well as any subdomains of

[11:35:22.0000] <abarth>
   the host's domain name.

[11:35:38.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: and then i have sub.example.com, and it has an STS with maxage=0

[11:35:48.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: what happens?

[11:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: the rfc doesn't seem to cover that case, because it's not clear whether sub.example.com has an entry or not

[11:36:04.0000] <abarth>
maxage=0 doesn't create "holes"

[11:36:13.0000] <tobie>
TabAtkins: Are you grabbing the raw file or the output of the app?

[11:36:41.0000] <abarth>
the intent is that sub.example.com still has HSTS

[11:36:46.0000] <TabAtkins>
tobie: I'm pulling down http://specref.jit.su/bibrefs

[11:36:57.0000] <abarth>
the storage is per-header received

[11:36:58.0000] <tobie>
ok, cool.

[11:37:10.0000] <abarth>
so you'd have to set max-age: 0 on example.com to expire the policy for the subdomains

[11:37:14.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: what about if i have example.com with an STS includesubdomains, then foo.example.com also has an STS with includesubdomains, then i go to example.com again and it has maxage=0. Does that also remove the foo.example.com STS? Per the RFC, it seems like it would, since that header isn't stored since it's redundant with the parent one.

[11:37:35.0000] <abarth>
the intent is that the foo.example.com policy is not removed

[11:37:44.0000] <abarth>
not sure if the RFC is written correctly

[11:37:48.0000] <abarth>
i'd have to check it :)

[11:37:57.0000] <tobie>
TabAtkins: any preferences on exposing EDs?

[11:38:09.0000] <abarth>
the model is that you have a database that remembers the last header received for each domain

[11:38:10.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: you didn't happen to do any research into how to have a dreamhost site accessible on multiple https: origins at once, did you?  that's probably the one thing incenting me not to move to full https: everywhere (right now I have https: for admin and http: for general-public-facing, as minor XSS mitigation)

[11:38:20.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: "domain"?

[11:38:22.0000] <TabAtkins>
tobie: I don't care all that much for biblio purposes.

[11:38:24.0000] <abarth>
host

[11:38:27.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: ah

[11:38:35.0000] <abarth>
to compute whether a given connection ought to be allowed

[11:38:37.0000] <tobie>
k

[11:38:47.0000] <abarth>
you walk the the host and its parent domains

[11:38:53.0000] <abarth>
checking for a non-expired policy

[11:38:59.0000] <TabAtkins>
tobie: We track ED/TR for linking (so that Bikeshed can prefer linking to one or the other, based on status of the spec being generated), but biblio stuff just uses whatever the ref points to.

[11:39:22.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: so what happens if you visit a host that is covered by includesubdomains, and that host has STS maxage=0 and redirects to its equivalent http:// url? is that treated as a redirect-to-self ?

[11:39:27.0000] <abarth>
(with the "includesubdomains" flag if the entry in the database isn't for the host itself)

[11:40:05.0000] <abarth>
the fact about the host having HSTS with maxage=0 isn't relevant

[11:40:14.0000] <abarth>
that would clear out any past header that host had set

[11:40:23.0000] <abarth>
but the header for the parent domain would still be in the database

[11:40:37.0000] <abarth>
so HSTS would still be in effect for that host

[11:41:19.0000] <abarth>
(I'm off to lunch---will be back later)

[11:42:11.0000] <tobie>
TabAtkins: can you point to where you're storing that data? Would like to use same schema if possible. (Need to expose this in specref.)

[11:42:43.0000] <TabAtkins>
tobie: Right now I'm just storing it literally; I do the processing into Bikeshed's data structure on each run.  I need to fix that.

[11:45:10.0000] <TabAtkins>
tobie: But here's the data structure I use to store biblio data currently: https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/blob/master/bikeshed/biblio.py

[11:45:34.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's a straight translation of the Refer file format, with some minor tweaks to handle the specref format better.

[11:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I currently just throw away some of the SpecRef data, like versions, but might add that in the future.

[11:50:19.0000] <tobie>
TabAtkins: funny you're transforming href into url, we changed that in Respec to match Anolis.

[11:51:24.0000] <tobie>
TabAtkins: iirc, versions isn't exposed by the API, but used to construct [[FOO-YYYYMMDD]] refs.

[11:52:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
Accident of history; I happened to write BiblioEntry quite a while ago, and named the attribute "url". When I started processing SpecRef stuff I just put down a translation.

[11:52:58.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: k, i added us to the hsts queue

[11:54:24.0000] <TabAtkins>
tobie: All of my biblio handling code is ancient by this project's standards, anyway. Don't pay much attention to it. It needs to be rewritten.

[11:54:40.0000] <Domenic>
annevk Hixie Mixed content in the wiki

[11:54:59.0000] <Hixie>
where?

[11:55:18.0000] <Domenic>
https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ has no stylesheet

[11:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
odd

[11:57:26.0000] <Domenic>
https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC works O_O

[11:57:49.0000] <Hixie>
home page too

[11:57:51.0000] <Hixie>
i don't get it

[11:57:55.0000] <Hixie>
who's our wiki guy

[11:57:57.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley?

[11:58:27.0000] <Domenic>
https://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/implementors-whatwg.org/ link from https://whatwg.org/mailing-list is broken

[11:59:22.0000] <Hixie>
oops

[11:59:25.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[11:59:26.0000] <Hixie>
crap

[11:59:37.0000] <Hixie>
HSTS will totally screw our list archives

[11:59:41.0000] <Hixie>
and list management

[11:59:52.0000] <Hixie>
since dreamhost don't have that on ssl

[12:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
well this will be an interesting support request...

[12:00:16.0000] <zcorpan>
Domenic: huh, firefox and chrome i get http: for scripts and styles, but in opera i get https:

[12:01:57.0000] <zcorpan>
there is http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/ but i guess not for help@ or implementors@

[12:02:10.0000] <Hixie>
and that won't let you subscribe to the list

[12:02:38.0000] <zcorpan>
ah yeah

[12:03:05.0000] <zcorpan>
and it doesn't use TLS so how knows what bad things can happen

[12:03:23.0000] <zcorpan>
(like, maybe the site will work)

[12:04:48.0000] <zcorpan>
/me has updated xref and html-differences

[12:05:13.0000] <Hixie>
support request sent

[12:05:17.0000] <Hixie>
i expect this to not go well

[12:06:32.0000] <Hixie>
wtf, spec.whatwg.org is still broken

[12:06:35.0000] <Hixie>
what have i done

[12:07:55.0000] <zcorpan>
https://simon.html5.org/html-elements is now broken. (it was very out of date anyway)

[12:08:06.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[12:08:20.0000] <Hixie>
why is it broken?

[12:08:22.0000] <Hixie>
mixed content?

[12:08:25.0000] <zcorpan>
yep

[12:08:33.0000] <zcorpan>
http: in iframe

[12:08:36.0000] <Hixie>
oh, i see

[12:08:39.0000] <Hixie>
should be easy to fix

[12:08:48.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[12:09:04.0000] <zcorpan>
the harder fix is making it not be so out of date

[12:09:10.0000] <Hixie>
well, yeah

[12:09:23.0000] <zcorpan>
preferably automate it

[12:09:43.0000] <zcorpan>
since i no longer maintain it

[12:10:21.0000] <Hixie>
spec.whatwg.org is seriously messed up in the dreamhost config

[12:10:41.0000] <zcorpan>
btw what's up with developers.whatwg.org

[12:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
i need to regen it

[12:11:08.0000] <Hixie>
i broke it all when i updated my pipeline

[12:11:43.0000] <Hixie>
ok i've killed spec.whatwg.org entirely

[12:11:54.0000] <Hixie>
i'm going to go have lunch, let dreamhost digest this change

[12:11:58.0000] <Hixie>
then i'll reinstate it

[12:12:34.0000] <zcorpan>
/me gets a redirect loop

[12:12:57.0000] <Hixie>
yeah it's just totally messed up right now

[12:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh wait

[12:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
for what?

[12:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
developers?

[12:13:30.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[12:16:09.0000] <zcorpan>
no for spec.whatwg.org

[12:16:46.0000] <zcorpan>
ok "fixed" html-elements (but developers still has mixed content)

[13:46:09.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: the spec's popup when filing a bug has links but they're not discoverable without hovering the text

[13:53:53.0000] <Hixie>
yeah... if you have non-ugly suggested styles to make them more discoverable, file a bug

[13:56:09.0000] <zcorpan>
the popup is ugly already :-P

[13:58:41.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Sorry, one final argument for numbering your list items properly, rather than giving them all the same number: it makes it easier to, at a glance, tell where sub-lists start and end; if they're all the same, you have to pay more attention to indentation, which isn't quite as obvious.

[14:00:48.0000] <Domenic>
spec. still broken? :)

[14:00:51.0000] <Domenic>
*:(

[14:07:03.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe we should update the browser icons

[14:23:31.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: if you can file a bug with styles to make it less ugly, all the better

[14:23:39.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: right now the spec is using the browser icons from html5.org

[14:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: yeah

[14:30:12.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: awesome

[14:30:30.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[14:30:46.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: I'm not sure what you mean

[14:31:16.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: what do you mean by multiple https: origins?

[14:31:26.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: I have http://whereswalden.com/ as public-facing right now; https://whereswalden.com/ purely for wp-admin pages and such

[14:31:35.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: I

[14:31:36.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: in response to HSTS and also no-www I guess

[14:31:52.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[14:31:52.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: I'd like https://whereswalden.com/ as public-facing, but I want some other origin than that for wp-admin pages

[14:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: well, we broke lists.whatwg.org, so there's that.

[14:32:04.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: move wp-admin to /wp/

[14:32:43.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: or get a more expensive certificate that allows alternate names, and setup admin.whereswalden.com

[14:33:03.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: yeah, that's the sadmaking hackaround as I understand it

[14:33:22.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: I'm not sure how it's a hack

[14:33:42.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: if you want to serve different content, you need different addresses :-)

[14:33:44.0000] <jwalden>
annevk: well, maybe not, now; last I remembered they didn't support SNI

[14:33:51.0000] <jwalden>
/me hasn't looked into this in awhile

[14:34:14.0000] <annevk>
jwalden: DreamHost supports SNI, the question is whether your certificate is valid for admin.whereswalden.com

[14:35:58.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: so lists.whatwg.org is broken because DreamHost sets it up automatically?

[14:36:38.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[14:36:43.0000] <Hixie>
i sent them a support request

[14:36:47.0000] <Hixie>
i expect this to be like pulling teeth

[14:36:51.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what we can do without their help

[14:37:22.0000] <annevk>
self-host :-(

[14:37:49.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks around for bags of cash

[14:37:54.0000] <Hixie>
nope, don't see any

[14:38:19.0000] <Hixie>
well, except that one, but that one's mine

[14:38:27.0000] <Hixie>
/me grabs one poorly-hidden bag of cash

[14:39:43.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: security through obscurity is no security at all!

[14:40:19.0000] <Domenic>
Speaking pretty much from ignorance, but I can't imagine an nginx server for static content on Amazon EC2 would be all that expensive...

[14:41:02.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: it's mostly that porting everything is a hassle

[14:41:06.0000] <Hixie>
before we talk about how expensive it is, let's first consider that the entirety of the cost of hosting *.whatwg.org for the next two years is the cost anne just spent on the certs.

[14:41:16.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: and migrating all the databases, etc.

[14:41:41.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: DreamHost is free?

[14:41:49.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: yeah that part makes sense, just not the expense claim

[14:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
and that we currently have unlimited bandwidth, users, storage, and subdomains, along with some level of tech support.

[14:42:08.0000] <annevk>
DreamHost is free for Hixie since he's on top of a pyramid

[14:42:15.0000] <Hixie>
what anne said

[14:43:06.0000] <annevk>
I guess we could claim I had to get validated anyway to make html5.org and some of my own setups work, which would make whatwg.org still running for zip

[14:43:16.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[14:43:36.0000] <Hixie>
i actually do pay for some stuff on dreamhost, but i'm hosting like 60+ domains on this account

[14:43:42.0000] <Hixie>
so the marginal cost of whatwg.org is free

[14:44:27.0000] <annevk>
html5.org: "That domain name is already preloaded!"

[14:44:59.0000] <Hixie>
wtf, spec.whatwg.org is still broken

[14:45:37.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: infinite redirects

[14:49:42.0000] <Hixie>
screw it.

[14:49:45.0000] <Hixie>
/me sends a support request

[14:51:12.0000] <Hixie>
btw n.whatwg.org is all https now

[14:51:26.0000] <Hixie>
and the one vocabulary identifier on there now just redirects to the spec so there's no confusion

[15:04:14.0000] <annevk>
nice

[16:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i've updated icons on web-apps-tracker

[16:03:28.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm possibly the svg ones need width="32" height="32" so that background-size:50% works for Hixie

[16:05:39.0000] <Domenic>
calling it now: svg is the next tls/utf8

[16:06:53.0000] <zcorpan>
Domenic: svg is old man :-)

[16:07:56.0000] <Domenic>
probably newer than tls :P

[16:09:20.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: pls review and deploy if it looks ok

[16:18:03.0000] <zcorpan>
i added a logo for chrome but it's not used yet

[16:18:05.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: What's going on? Do I need to do something?

[16:18:19.0000] <Hixie>
the faq is not getting its style sheet

[16:18:27.0000] <Hixie>
probably mixed content issue

[16:18:57.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: Can you be more specific? I'm not seeing anything wrong.

[16:19:16.0000] <Hixie>
oh, hm

[16:19:18.0000] <Hixie>
it's working now

[16:19:19.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh

[16:19:23.0000] <GPHemsley>
logged out only, maybe

[16:19:36.0000] <Hixie>
ah, yes

[16:19:38.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg.org/faq when logged out

[16:19:41.0000] <Hixie>
results in no styles

[16:19:42.0000] <GPHemsley>
ah, yeah, I think that's cached

[16:19:46.0000] <GPHemsley>
hang on

[16:19:56.0000] <Hixie>
though actually

[16:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
if we can change the styles for that page when logged out specifically...

[16:20:11.0000] <Hixie>
might be worth doing...

[16:20:25.0000] <GPHemsley>
well, I think I have it set up so that the anonymous pages are cached

[16:20:30.0000] <GPHemsley>
but the logged-in ones aren't

[16:20:31.0000] <GPHemsley>
or something

[16:20:33.0000] <GPHemsley>
it's been a while

[16:20:47.0000] <Hixie>
since that page with no styles and the headers and footers removed looks better than that page with the mediawiki styles

[16:22:33.0000] <GPHemsley>
well, it's every logged out page

[16:26:22.0000] <GPHemsley>
now if only I could remember my login details..

[16:28:34.0000] <Hixie>
btw, i've made the mailing-list page not mention lists.whatwg.org so that it doesn't much matter anymore

[16:29:36.0000] <Hixie>
wow, https://www.w3.org actually redirects (with a valid cert) to http://www.w3.org?

[16:29:50.0000] <Hixie>
that seems worse than not having anything on https://...

[16:32:31.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: How pressing is this wiki issue?

[16:32:51.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[16:33:16.0000] <Hixie>
it makes the wiki ugly

[16:33:21.0000] <Hixie>
how serious that is, that's your call :-)

[16:35:11.0000] <GPHemsley>
hey, I'm logged in all the time, so it makes no difference to me :P

[16:47:09.0000] <Hixie>
you have got to love the w3c, really

[16:47:19.0000] <Hixie>
on the one hand you have jeff saying how much the w3c respects the whatwg

[16:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
and on the other hand you have checkins consisting of only the text "minor fixes" that remove even a small suggestion of a mention of the whatwg _which included a 'stable' reference_.

[16:48:07.0000] <Hixie>
https://github.com/w3c/html/commit/5665b66d3bc7720fcaaeff5817e6eacbf782d835

[16:48:37.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, the relevant text is only 2 days old (https://github.com/w3c/html/commit/5b04c84af9bb460fa0ffddb5af7fac41a17b1938)

[16:50:58.0000] <Hixie>
man i wish the ietf had stable specs

[16:51:23.0000] <Hixie>
by which i mean a url that i could reference for a particular technology that wouldn't change over time when they update the spec

[16:51:40.0000] <Hixie>
instead of the current situation where every 5 days some spec or other gets obsoleted and i have to update all my IETF references


2014-09-17
[17:03:24.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: help.whatwg.org is currently just the place where I run scripts that scrape the meta@name and link relation wikis to generate lists of registered keywords. I could move the scripts elsewhere if needed

[17:03:47.0000] <Hixie>
ah, cool

[17:03:49.0000] <Hixie>
no that's fine

[19:47:38.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Anyone here messed with the deviceorientation event and alpha/beta/gamma stuff?

[00:20:22.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: did not review, did deploy

[00:20:29.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: seems to look okay though

[00:20:32.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: thx

[00:22:45.0000] <zcorpan>
i see Hixie already used background-size:cover so the spec's icons still have the right size

[00:23:06.0000] <annevk>
Oh is he hotlinking these now?

[00:23:53.0000] <annevk>
He is

[00:25:09.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: they might need to be even bigger to cover these new x3 screens

[00:25:50.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: also, can we do multiple images for background-image yet? I heard with icons you don't really want to downscale a high resolution icon, but provide your own low resolution

[00:26:04.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: not sure if we should care for this use case though

[00:26:24.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i'm not convinced that it's ugly on 3x

[00:27:18.0000] <annevk>
Hmm, people are actually using my WebVTT validator: https://github.com/annevk/webvtt/issues/5

[00:29:15.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: are there browser icons that are 2x or 3x that are designed for 16x16 CSS pixels size?

[00:30:06.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: no idea

[00:31:14.0000] <zcorpan>
https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos doesn't seem to have such a thing at least

[00:37:13.0000] <zcorpan>
i could have used the 16x16 icon in src and 32x32 in srcset but i don't really care about optimizing for 1x screens

[03:35:13.0000] <annevk>
Oh hey, the W3C imagined interoperability: http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PR-html5-20140916/

[03:36:28.0000] <annevk>
for jgraham: http://intertwingly.net/blog/2014/09/16/The-URL-Mess#c1410950300

[03:37:55.0000] <smaug____>
PR requires interoperability

[03:37:57.0000] <smaug____>
?

[03:38:08.0000] <annevk>
smaug____: exciting CR does

[03:38:09.0000] <smaug____>
/me has so forgotten which *R requires what

[03:38:38.0000] <annevk>
oops, exiting

[03:41:15.0000] <jgraham>
"exciting" was better

[03:41:42.0000] <jgraham>
POssibly as it "it would be exciting if a spec in CR actually had interoperability"

[03:41:54.0000] <annevk>
heh

[03:42:51.0000] <caitp>
wouldn't it though?

[03:44:22.0000] <darobin>
I completely thought that "exciting" was on purpose :)

[04:04:51.0000] <tantek>
/me reads the blog post that annevk linked to

[04:05:05.0000] <tantek>
this: " It seems pretty clear at this point that IETF/IANA has a pretty poor track record when it comes to registries."

[04:15:26.0000] <annevk>
tantek: that's from the comments :p

[04:20:16.0000] <tantek>
annevke I know :)

[05:04:39.0000] <darobin>
don't get me started on IANA :)

[05:04:53.0000] <darobin>
/me just registered five media types with them

[06:58:06.0000] <annevk>
I don't understand why https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::selection was killed and ::first-line or ::first-letter was not

[07:01:39.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: https://hsivonen.fi/extended-uncertainty/ example site went out of business

[07:03:16.0000] <zcorpan>
csswg decided to add back ::selection

[07:03:56.0000] <annevk>
can Gecko unprefix then?

[07:13:43.0000] <tantek>
darn I wanted to see a citation to re-adding ::selection

[07:14:48.0000] <tantek>
I remember some discussions about that...

[07:15:08.0000] <tantek>
annevk: current status of ::selection AFAIK is this issue: http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css3-ui#issue-30

[07:15:16.0000] <tantek>
which means it's yet another thing in my pile :/

[08:42:45.0000] <Domenic>
spec.whatwg.org still dead? :(

[08:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
you can use https://whatwg.org/specs in the meantime

[08:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's the same file

[09:04:12.0000] <Domenic>
service worker without fetch? O_O

[09:18:35.0000] <annevk>
I feel sorry for slightlyoff_ if that happens

[09:22:36.0000] <jgraham>
Uh, what?

[09:23:39.0000] <jgraham>
I thought offline was the point of service worker and everything else was tacked on

[09:23:55.0000] <jgraham>
It certainly seems like the most pressing problem to solve

[09:29:36.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: see https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/463 for context

[09:30:12.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: don't reply from your phone :p looks bad https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/445#issuecomment-55918543

[09:55:41.0000] <annevk>
That http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-encoding-20140916/indexes/index-big5.txt does not have the correct encoding amuses me

[09:58:56.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: since pretty much all specs use dfn.js, perhaps it should move? Not sure I care strongly though

[10:18:46.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i recommend copying dfn.js. i don't guarantee i won't change it arbitrarily to match what html needs.

[10:23:20.0000] <smaug____>
annevk: I was chatting with sicking yesterday, and sounds like we should have persistent and non-persistent notifications. And service worker should be supported too. Need to think about the API - it may end up being quite a bit different from what it is today. Luckily .get() is implemented in Gecko only

[10:59:45.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: okay

[11:00:09.0000] <annevk>
smaug____: okay, if you could do so within a couple of weeks that'd be great

[11:00:16.0000] <annevk>
smaug____: I'd like to update it to support service workers

[11:43:36.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: I or someone else can always edit out the cruft.

[12:35:44.0000] <Hixie>
so re our conversation yesterday about whether w3c's namespace redirect confuses people:

[12:35:45.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.hiphopcanada.com/tag/partynextdoor/

[12:35:58.0000] <Hixie>
view-source:http://www.richbone.com/kansetsu/ill/ill.htm

[12:36:11.0000] <Hixie>
http://beheretowitness.com/seating-pricing/

[12:36:17.0000] <Hixie>
there's lots of sites that have the wrong namespace

[12:36:27.0000] <Hixie>
and i wouldn't be surprised if it started from that redirect

[12:38:04.0000] <rubys>
annevk: ping?

[12:49:22.0000] <annevk>
rubys: if you leave a question I can get back to you within the next couple of hours most likely, only behind the laptop sporadically during the evening

[12:50:45.0000] <rubys>
I'll probably take it to the whatwg list.  I'm looking to sketch out a "URL differences" document comparable to the "HTML differences" document; any pointers would be appreciated.

[12:50:57.0000] <rubys>
Meanwhile, I'm scanning the spec for likely candidates.

[12:51:10.0000] <rubys>
Will post a first draft when my scan is complete.

[12:54:55.0000] <annevk>
cool cool cool

[13:42:24.0000] <Hixie>
jamesr_: yt?

[13:42:39.0000] <Hixie>
jamesr_: does http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2014JulSep/0091.html still match your desires?

[13:43:13.0000] <Hixie>
jamesr_: and if so, should i assume that if i hook into https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/RequestAnimationFrame/Overview.html#processingmodel you'll update that spec to not longer involve a task but just to expose the algorithm?

[13:44:47.0000] <terinjokes>
Domenic: we resolved that problem by creating our own format and expecting everyone else to just use it

[14:08:57.0000] <annevk>
Interesting, per http://caniuse.com/#search=apng Safari on iOS 8 supports APNG

[14:26:18.0000] <jamesr_>
Hixie: that matches my desires, but i'm not sure that i've thought through all the consequences correctly

[14:29:47.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: yeah, I wonder if people will start using it on mobile and thus force Chrome to support it

[14:29:53.0000] <Domenic>
Then we would finally have a winner

[14:30:21.0000] <Domenic>
Although browsers have some catching up to do with http://geelen.github.io/x-gif/#/http://i.imgur.com/iKXH4E2.gif

[16:46:45.0000] <roc>
has anyone had a chat with L2L?


2014-09-18
[17:00:17.0000] <jamesr_>
tab replied at length to a few of L2L's threads

[17:00:22.0000] <jamesr_>
but the replies were just more spew of the same form

[17:00:34.0000] <jamesr_>
i plan to just ignore their emails

[17:30:44.0000] <jamesr_>
roc: if you can figure out what he's asking (or is he asking something) please let me know, i am curious

[18:57:44.0000] <MikeSmith>
who's L2L?

[19:35:10.0000] <roc>
someone sending a lot of incoherent messages to standards groups

[19:37:09.0000] <caitp>
i never claimed to be a good communicator

[19:38:21.0000] <roc>
nice try

[01:08:54.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: btw, mobile Safari does exactly what we talked about the other show, show only the EV name and not the domain

[01:12:33.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: removing n.whatwg.org seems like it would solve that problem

[01:14:10.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: what problem? I think n.whatwg.org is already solved

[01:14:50.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: that people will use https in their xmlns

[01:19:28.0000] <zcorpan>
https://www.google.com/search?q=n+whatwg+work - google adds " - WhatWG" to the titles

[01:20:49.0000] <annevk>
Somewhat ironic that https://hstspreload.appspot.com/ doesn't use HSTS

[01:21:57.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: I wonder where it gets that from

[01:22:20.0000] <karlcow>
I wonder if zcorpan was searching for https://www.google.co.jp/search?as_epq=n.whatwg.org

[01:23:05.0000] <zcorpan>
karlcow: no

[01:23:50.0000] <karlcow>
oh understood

[01:25:15.0000] <karlcow>
I wonder where they get that from

[01:39:00.0000] <annevk>
Bah, wget doesn't do certificate checks correctly

[01:39:30.0000] <MikeSmith>
I always turn off the wget certificate-checking option

[01:39:46.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think it's on by default and it mostly just gets in the way

[01:40:21.0000] <annevk>
Might be that DreamHost has an ancient version of wget? https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?20421

[01:40:57.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me reads

[01:43:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah the current version of wget in debian stable is 1.13.4

[01:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but then debian also sometimes patches upstream stuff in ways that actually break things

[01:48:28.0000] <karlcow>
That would be fun to test all the command line clients: httpie, curl, etc.

[01:52:51.0000] <darobin>
my experience with cert checking in command line stuff is that it is very often wrong

[01:52:58.0000] <darobin>
(including PhantomJS)

[01:53:28.0000] <darobin>
that said, I wouldn't be shocked if it were because they were all doing it somewhat strictly by default and browsers are laxer for compat

[01:53:50.0000] <jgraham>
Writing in JS not magically leading to implementation quality shocker?

[01:59:34.0000] <MikeSmith>
since even the browsers don't behave interoperably with cert checking I guess it's not surprising that command-line tools behave the way they do here

[02:13:07.0000] <darobin>
jgraham: not sure what you meant? Phantom isn't written in JS :)

[03:08:11.0000] <annevk>
DreamHost has 1.12 per wget --version

[04:58:47.0000] <smaug____>
hayato: how should older shadow trees work in case they are not in the composed document, but the host is

[04:59:05.0000] <smaug____>
hayato: so, the newer shadow tree doesn't have <shadow>

[05:14:56.0000] <smaug____>
hayato: filed couple of bugs related to that

[05:21:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: It'd seem like 1.12 should have that bug fix from 2007. unless it's one of those cases where the Debian packager unfixed/regressed it

[05:22:26.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: hmm yeah

[05:22:58.0000] <annevk>
Mac OS X doesn't ship with wget, and I don't really care I guess

[06:20:10.0000] <mathiasbynens>
zcorpan: woah, nice work on those <picture> tests!

[06:20:29.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: thx

[06:21:04.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: wanna review? :-)

[06:21:37.0000] <mathiasbynens>
just went over them

[06:21:43.0000] <mathiasbynens>
all i could find was a small nitpick

[06:21:56.0000] <zcorpan>
ah ok. thanks!

[06:22:01.0000] <mathiasbynens>

gotta do something useful at a csswg f2f

[06:30:03.0000] <jgraham>
mathiasbynens: If you reviewed the tests you should mark them as reviewed

[06:33:48.0000] <jgraham>
mathiasbynens: (and now I changed the review so that you can ;)

[06:36:17.0000] <mathiasbynens>
jgraham: ty

[06:40:40.0000] <jgraham>
mathiasbynens: It looks like you pressed "I will review this" (which isn't necessary) but didn't mark anything as reviewed yet. Intentional?

[06:41:57.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: click "everything" in https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/showcommit?first=9a149860&last=87823b51&review=2529

[06:43:24.0000] <mathiasbynens>
jgraham: nah, just a critic n00b

[06:43:39.0000] <jgraham>
mathiasbynens: OK, np, welcome to the learning curve ;)

[06:43:48.0000] <mathiasbynens>
zcorpan: thanks

[06:45:05.0000] <jgraham>
For future reference "I will review this" basically just means "don't let anyone else mark this as reviewed". To actually mark something as reviewed you a) have to be a reviewed for that path and b) click the checkbox next to the file that you have reviewed

[06:45:14.0000] <jgraham>
(and then submit like for comments)

[06:45:20.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: zcorpan says that testharness.js has a "Not run" result. how does one use that and when is it appropriate?

[06:46:06.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: You don't use it. You get it if a test has been declared using async_test() but no .step() has been called when the overall test times out

[06:46:21.0000] <jgraham>
If a .step() has been called you get Timeout

[06:46:55.0000] <jgraham>
(I hope :)

[06:47:10.0000] <foolip>
ok, doesn't sound like the right tool for the job then :)

[06:47:13.0000] <foolip>
thanks jgraham!

[06:47:43.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: What are you trying to achieve?

[06:48:27.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: I'm trying to test for a media element GC bug and it's unavoidably racy, and it would be nice to distinguish between "passed" and "couldn't really test"

[06:49:06.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: https://codereview.chromium.org/552303006/diff2/150001:170001/LayoutTests/media/gc-while-seeking.html

[06:51:54.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: Oh interesting. I guess we could make done() take a human-readable message or introduce a new status, or something, but I'm not sure what has the right cost/effort tradeoff

[06:52:41.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: I wouldn't suggest that either

[06:53:50.0000] <foolip>
Obviously the risk with a test like this is that it ends up always taking the shortcut t.done(), but I don't see a way to change that. A unit test at a lower level seems like the best answer so far.

[06:56:39.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: Yeah, I tend to agree

[07:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
is there anybody good and active in the CSS WG who speaks Mandarin?

[07:18:05.0000] <roc>
what's the problem?

[07:18:58.0000] <roc>
I don't speak Mandarin, but my wife does, which is sometimes useful...

[07:21:50.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: possible speaking opportunity in Beijing

[07:25:57.0000] <roc>
haha ok no

[07:29:59.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: too late you already volunteered :)

[07:30:14.0000] <boogyman>
haha

[07:56:17.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Did you get the chance to update those fragment tests?

darobin: I'm hurt my your pointing and laughing at my ignorance

[08:06:49.0000] <MikeSmith>
I've tarnished my reputation as a PHP expert

[08:07:37.0000] <darobin>
MikeSmith: if it's any consolation I have now tarnished my reputation by demonstrating some degree of PHP expertise :)

[08:08:25.0000] <MikeSmith>
haha you took the bait

[08:08:45.0000] <MikeSmith>
my next trick question is about Wordpress

[08:08:47.0000] <MikeSmith>
be ready

[08:08:58.0000] <darobin>
I'm glad most of the related explanation took place on a secret team channel

[08:09:03.0000] <darobin>
who said transparency was a good thing?

[08:09:21.0000] <darobin>
luckily, I actually know pretty much fuck-all about Wordpress :)

[08:10:42.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me scrambles to change the name of the secret team-only php channel

[08:11:28.0000] <Hixie>
christ, dreamhost support is moronic these days

[08:14:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I don't understand why you guys don't switch to virtual hosting

[08:15:11.0000] <boogyman>
Hixie: try their twitter handle. phone is non-existent, and email always seems to take days.

[08:16:13.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: how do you mean? who would you recommend? we're on virtual hosting at dreamhost

[08:16:18.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: the speed is not the issue

[08:16:41.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: they just seem to only respond in platitudes

[08:16:47.0000] <Hixie>
brb

[08:19:38.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I thought you were on a shared host not a VPS? Or did that change?

[08:24:55.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yeah, I meant what jgraham said -- a separate virtual machine that you have root access to and control, not shared hosting

[08:26:09.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: but then, maintenance

[08:27:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: I think it'd be less maintenance in the long run

[08:28:35.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, my experience is that VPS is a huge win over shared hosting

[08:28:56.0000] <jgraham>
I mean unless you want to run email or something

[08:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
But for websites

[08:30:38.0000] <mounir>
annevk: I'm looking at your comments at https://github.com/w3c/screen-orientation/issues/72

[08:30:46.0000] <mounir>
annevk: I wonder what you mean by "They do not queue tasks to synchronize but rather just dispatch events"

[08:31:20.0000] <mounir>
annevk: do you want me to queue a task before resolving the promise and before fire the events?

[08:31:35.0000] <annevk>
mounir: firing events needs to happen from a task

[08:31:48.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: hmm yeah perhaps

[08:32:29.0000] <mounir>
annevk: ideally, 4.4 would run on the animation task source you want to add

[08:32:31.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I've never run my own server software, I could give it a shot I suppose... Recommendations?

[08:32:33.0000] <mounir>
annevk: but it's not defined yet

[08:34:20.0000] <annevk>
mounir: then you need to add some kind of issue marker

[08:34:30.0000] <annevk>
mounir: pretending everything is okay seems bad

[08:35:04.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: also, recommendations for a hosting provider?

[08:35:41.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I was considering to give https://www.transip.eu/vps/ a try as I have domains registered there

[08:36:10.0000] <mounir>
annevk: issue #40 is there for that

[08:36:40.0000] <annevk>
mounir: in the spec

[08:37:50.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: my experience is that even running a mail server is not a lot of work -- for the MTA just use exim and everything pretty just works. For POP/IMAP, pretty much all the options suck, just in different ways, but it's more just annoyances than it is about being a lot of maintenance work

[08:38:08.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: what about spam?

[08:38:17.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: I think http://www.bytemark.co.uk is good

[08:39:22.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: yeah spam is another "all options suck" case. You just choose one and live with it

[08:39:48.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I guess jgraham is right you're better off not trying to run a mail server if you can avoid it

[08:42:31.0000] <mounir>
annevk: I could have a look and see if respec has a way to have issue markers that disappear for publication documents

[08:42:43.0000] <mounir>
annevk: it's less of a trouble for living document obviously

[08:42:51.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: As I said I have used Linode, and I have heard people say that Digital Ocean is OK. Gandi also have something.

[08:45:06.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: oh we've been on a virtual host for years

[08:45:17.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: virtual hosts are still shared, that's why they're virtual :-)

[08:45:33.0000] <MikeSmith>
hair splitter

[08:45:46.0000] <Hixie>
it's not that fine a hair to split

[08:45:52.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: but it's not like you're running our own Apache server installation

[08:46:13.0000] <Hixie>
i've had to have them move me to a different underlying host a couple of times because of the other people on the hardware

[08:46:16.0000] <MikeSmith>
forgive me for not being precise I meant what jgraham described

[08:46:28.0000] <Hixie>
which is the main problem with shared hosting

[08:46:42.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: sure, it's managed

[08:46:50.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: you can have dedicated servers that are managed too

[08:46:55.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: managed vs virtual are entirely orthogonal

[08:47:24.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: yeah so I guess what people suggest here is to go unmanaged

[08:47:55.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I suspect VPS became somewhat synonymous with that

[08:47:55.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I'm not sure your taxonomy there actually aligns with how the terms are typically used

[08:48:14.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: In theory, perhaps. I think a one dimensional view would capture most of the available options

[08:48:45.0000] <Hixie>
i'm definitely not going unmanaged

[08:49:07.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: quite possible. i'm just using the english terms, i don't know if there's terms of art here.

[08:49:21.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: well you can always collapse the options, sure

[08:49:38.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: managed shared, managed virtual, unmanaged virtual, managed dedicated, unmanaged dedicated

[08:49:59.0000] <Asterfield>
So I'm sure that this idea has been proposed before, but I'm curious to know what your thoughts on this are. I've been learning the Drag and Drop API over the last few days, and my introductory experience has been baffling and weird.

[08:50:29.0000] <Hixie>
Asterfield: the API itself is something we inherited from IE4 which inherited it from Microsoft's COM+

[08:50:46.0000] <Hixie>
Asterfield: the attributes (dropzone and draggable) are attempts to mask the crazy a little

[08:50:51.0000] <Hixie>
Asterfield: but yeah, the end result isn't ideal

[08:51:04.0000] <Asterfield>
That doesn't mean it can't/shouldn't be improved :) Would it make sense to have the event ordering for d-n-d to behave more like the :hover state? http://imgur.com/a/tYpW3

[08:51:17.0000] <Hixie>
we can't change it, it's widely shipped and pages depend on it

[08:51:27.0000] <Hixie>
we can add features, but we can't change things that are shipped

[08:51:52.0000] <Asterfield>
:| that is unfortunate. Curses, microsoft

[08:52:18.0000] <Asterfield>
Okay, let's say a new set of events then. I know that would bring the count to 9, but the old ones could be depricated if it works, no?

[08:52:34.0000] <Asterfield>
dragin and dragout :P

[08:53:48.0000] <Hixie>
we could make new events entirely, but then we'd have to convince the browser vendors to implement a second redundant drag and drop event processing model, instead of doing whatever it is they are doing now

[08:53:49.0000] <Asterfield>
Are there any serious problems with that?

[08:53:57.0000] <Hixie>
so.... what do you think it is they are doing that's less important? :-)

[08:55:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: Hixie: anyway http://www.bigv.io is specifically what I was recommending, as far as providers. Among other reasons, they're relatively small and getting support from them amounts to talking one of maybe three people who've actually run/maintain their server hardware/software and have for years and are extremely capable and very responsive

[08:55:48.0000] <Asterfield>
Hixie: open source, anyone (*cough* me *cough*) could add these changes if they have the time

[08:56:02.0000] <Asterfield>
It doesn't necessarily have to come at the expense of a current project

[08:56:24.0000] <Asterfield>
The issue would be getting the vendors to agree to the idea in theory, no?

[08:56:54.0000] <Hixie>
Asterfield: not all the browsers are open source, and even the open source ones, you'd be taking engineers away from whatever they're doing to orient the new engineer, review their patches, fix security bugs going forward, etc

[08:57:39.0000] <Asterfield>
Hixie: That's true. Are you saying that this idea should not be attempted, and that the current IE4 model is good as-is?

[08:57:39.0000] <Hixie>
Asterfield: in practice, unless you're personally volunteering to implement it in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, it would end up taking away from another feature

[08:58:13.0000] <Hixie>
Asterfield: i'm saying that without vendor buy-in, it's pointless. If the vendors can be convinced that it's worth it, then I'd be happy to spec it or work with someone to spec it

[08:58:57.0000] <Asterfield>
Hixie: So where does vendor buy in come from? Do I google around for the emails of all the important Mozilla people? :P

[08:59:02.0000] <Asterfield>
Make a petition perhaps?

[08:59:44.0000] <Hixie>
i've been at this for about 15 years and i've still no idea how to convince people :-(

[09:00:02.0000] <Asterfield>
:P Aha, awesome. Do you know where I might be able to start?

[09:00:07.0000] <Hixie>
generally, posting in the project mailing lists is a good place to start

[09:00:09.0000] <Hixie>
but you have to be careful

[09:00:19.0000] <Hixie>
most people who do that manage to flip their bozo bit really early

[09:00:43.0000] <Asterfield>
How would you recommend avoiding this flipping of the bozo bit?

[09:03:35.0000] <Asterfield>
Or at least explain what constitutes flipping the bozo bit :P

[09:03:58.0000] <Hixie>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_bit :-)

[09:04:33.0000] <Hixie>
a lot of people come in with all these high-minded ideas and little patience for the existing engineers' opinions

[09:05:28.0000] <Asterfield>
Hixie: Hm. I shall be careful then. Thanks for your help, Hixie  :)

[09:05:30.0000] <mounir>
annevk: http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/#now-visible-algorithm < would that be find to hook at the end of that?

[09:05:37.0000] <Hixie>
Asterfield: good luck

[09:05:38.0000] <mounir>
annevk: or would that still be monkey patching to you?

[09:05:54.0000] <caitp>
people who you consider to have their bozo bit set, are people who consider you to have your bozo bit set

[09:06:07.0000] <caitp>
it's not really a one-sided thing

[09:07:19.0000] <Asterfield>
Oh, while I'm at it. Do event models fall under the DOM spec?

[09:08:35.0000] <Asterfield>
It seems they do

[09:10:06.0000] <Hixie>
caitp: that is often not the case

[09:10:25.0000] <Hixie>
caitp: there's plenty of times where someone will keep trying to convince someone of something long after that other person has stopped listening

[09:10:33.0000] <Hixie>
Asterfield: "event models"?

[09:10:50.0000] <Hixie>
Asterfield: they belong in the spec of whatever they're modeling

[09:11:14.0000] <caitp>
I think you'll find that people will tend to ignore your opinion if they believe you've thoroughly missed the point regarding something, or just fundamentally disagree with your perspective. the reason they'll keep yammering at you after you've stopped listening, is because they consider you to be in a position of authority or influence

[09:11:50.0000] <caitp>
it's just basic human dynamics, they might think they need to convince you even they think you are wrong

[09:11:59.0000] <caitp>
or especially if

[09:17:43.0000] <caitp>
it's like the intent-to-remove showModalDialog thread, even though people have very good reasons for wanting to get rid of it, you'll still see people trying to convince people with influence not to remove it, because to them, the reasons for removing it are not worthwhile --- thy aren't stupid just because they don't align their opinions with the opinions of implementors and maintainers, they just put importance on d

[09:17:44.0000] <caitp>
ifferent things which are more pertinent to their own needs

[09:27:41.0000] <Hixie>
caitp: yes, it absolutely is because they want to convince you. That's my point. Asterfield has to be careful not to have the people he wants to convince flip the bozo bit on him. I don't think in that context it's usual for the bozo bit flipping to be symmetric.

[09:28:11.0000] <annevk>
mounir: yes, because it is not apparent from the algorithm it can be extended

[09:28:32.0000] <annevk>
mounir: it's already better than what you have now, but you need to get page visibility updated

[09:28:45.0000] <annevk>
mounir: it seems it might need to be updated anyway to also make use of the animation frame task...

[09:29:32.0000] <mounir>
hmm page visibility would be updated at that point, right?

[09:30:17.0000] <caitp>
that's not what I'm saying --- on both sides, you're ignoring the other sides input. I mean yeah, they aren't "totally" ignoring the other sides input, since they allow people to use showModalDialog for another year with special flags, but they're basically still stuck behind "this is a really bad API, a really bad user experience, and it's just generally bad --- users don't seem to agree that it's a really bad API, a

[09:30:18.0000] <caitp>
nd users aren't going to care how complicated it is, so obviously they're going to ignore that opinion and believe that it's boneheaded to remove it

[09:31:01.0000] <caitp>
like, there's no real way around it, they're going to feel like their needs are being ignored, and developers are going to worry about maintainability more than meeting their needs, which they deem to be invalid

[09:31:11.0000] <caitp>
so both sides are essentially getting it wrong, despite care

[09:31:18.0000] <caitp>
it's just the way people are

[09:32:00.0000] <caitp>
but I dunno why I'm talking about it, it's just one of those fascinating things

[09:32:07.0000] <caitp>
/me moves on to other endeavours

[09:35:56.0000] <annevk>
mounir: I guess, but this is the W3C, you never know

[09:36:17.0000] <annevk>
mounir: took them almost a decade to start updating HTML again, or DOM

[09:36:48.0000] <mounir>
annevk: instead of trolling, wanna have a look at that PR? :)

[09:39:27.0000] <Hixie>
caitp: flipping the bozo bit means more than just talking at instead of talking with. It means essentially killfiling.

[09:39:28.0000] <annevk>
mounir: hey you started with "I'm not sure we can change that now we're going to LC" :p

[09:39:41.0000] <annevk>
done btw, back later

jgraham: Linode looks pretty good

[10:44:51.0000] <TabAtkins_>
roc: L2L is a crazy person and went in my killfile pretty quickly.  We should ban him from the w3 lists.

[10:49:23.0000] <TabAtkins_>
What's a polite way to say "the entire preceding paragraph is nonsense"?

[10:52:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, going with "None of what you just said is true".

[10:52:55.0000] <TabAtkins>
Can't come up with anything better.

[10:53:12.0000] <TabAtkins>
And don't really have any respect for the person I'm talking to, just trying to avoid looking overtly hostile to the rest of the list.

[11:01:03.0000] <caitp>
still sounds a bit hostile

[11:01:39.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, it definitely is, but this guy knows he's spewing nonsense, and he always does it. I don't like that sort of shit looking official and correct when it's complete fantasy.

[11:02:58.0000] <caitp>
I'm not telling you what to do :p but maybe clearly and politely showing why it's nonsense might be more effective and also time consuming

[11:03:31.0000] <TabAtkins>
The rest of my email outside that sentence was fine.

[11:10:44.0000] <annevk>
So I just found out via @antimattur that there's a thread going on in public-html about "after 5"... Seems to be mostly about modularizing, which seems weird, since they still don't really write any of the text.

[11:12:35.0000] <annevk>
Who volunteered again for console.og?

[11:12:52.0000] <annevk>
console.log even. That someone should read https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26182

paul_irish ^

[11:14:25.0000] <terinjokes>
i already messaged him

[11:14:28.0000] <terinjokes>
:)

[11:14:32.0000] <Domenic>
terinjokes we were talking about console spec

[11:14:38.0000] <terinjokes>
ah

[11:14:54.0000] <terinjokes>
i created a github repo, but haven't actually pushed anything I've done up yet

[11:17:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: Get it up! Develop in the open. ^_^

[11:18:29.0000] <terinjokes>
two seconds

[11:18:34.0000] <terinjokes>
:)

[11:21:37.0000] <terinjokes>
https://github.com/terinjokes/console-spec/blob/master/index.bs

[11:21:48.0000] <terinjokes>
just a basic outline so far :'(

[11:22:19.0000] <terinjokes>
TabAtkins: i couldn't get links in the IDL working with <dfn>s that weren't part of a <dd>, not sure what I'm missing

[11:23:18.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: The one <dfn> I see has a capitalization error - you need to say for="Console".

[11:23:46.0000] <terinjokes>
oh, i didn't know it was case sensative

[11:23:56.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Bikeshed's handling of capitalization is still kinda fucked up; I need to spend time making it sane.  The code I wrote there predates IDL definitions, where capitalization matters.)

[11:24:02.0000] <terinjokes>
yep, that did it

[11:24:29.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: Assume it's only sensitive for IDL things (after all, `var x = console;` and `var x = Console;` are two very different statements).

[11:24:45.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: Even if my capitalization handling is messed up for now, it'll be fixed later, so might as well write it correctly.

[11:24:52.0000] <terinjokes>
noted

[11:25:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Other things will remain case-insensitive, so you can, for example, capitalize a term that appears as the first word of a sentence and still have it link up.)

[11:25:26.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: That said, I think the interface really is spelled "console". ^_^

[11:25:33.0000] <terinjokes>
also should probably create a real logo… i'm sure that kitten, while cute, has a copyright

[11:25:46.0000] <TabAtkins>
hahahahaha

[11:25:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
I didn't even see that.

[11:26:59.0000] <terinjokes>
so in this case there's a one-to-one interface name to what the variable exposed is called?

[11:27:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that's how WebIDL works.

[11:27:22.0000] <Domenic>
Unsure

[11:27:27.0000] <Domenic>
Is console an instance of Console

[11:27:41.0000] <TabAtkins>
Console doesn't exist.

[11:27:42.0000] <Domenic>
or is console a single interface with lots of static methods

[11:28:04.0000] <terinjokes>
Domenic: sounds like an openable issue

[11:28:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
So etiher it's a [NoInterfaceObject], and you're doing something complicated, or it's just spelled "console".

[11:28:33.0000] <Domenic>
I think in browsers it is an instance of a Console

[11:28:41.0000] <TabAtkins>
Whoops, you're right.

[11:28:51.0000] <terinjokes>
yes, there's a Console constructor

[11:28:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
Console is the interface name.

[11:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: What browser?

[11:29:10.0000] <TabAtkins>
Chrome doesn't expose Console on the window.

[11:29:24.0000] <Domenic>
If we can convince people to use static methods then you get the benefit of them being "bound" (so you can do .forEach(console.log)

[11:29:29.0000] <terinjokes>
console.constructor exists and is labeled "Console"

[11:29:31.0000] <Domenic>
but no browser implements that sooooo

[11:29:39.0000] <terinjokes>
but not callable

[11:29:49.0000] <terinjokes>
well, callable, but throws

[11:29:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: Ah, right.

[11:30:32.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: So, what you wanna do is name the interface "Console", but put "[NoInterfaceObject]" on the line before it.

[11:30:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
That means it doesn't show up as a property on window.

[11:31:06.0000] <Domenic>
You'll also need some kind of patch onto window to expose .console. I think partial interfaces is how that is done?

[11:31:14.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup,

[11:31:16.0000] <Domenic>
Also I think workers too these days

[11:31:32.0000] <TabAtkins>
partial interface Window { attribute Console console; }

[11:32:02.0000] <Domenic>
DID YOU KNOW? window.console can be overwritten (in Firefox at least)

[11:32:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
And the same on WorkerGlobalScope.

[11:32:20.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Makes sense.

[11:32:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
Most things can?

[11:32:36.0000] <Domenic>
Really? My experience is WebIDL people love their `readonly`

[11:32:45.0000] <terinjokes>
and ditto in Chrome

[11:33:09.0000] <Domenic>
actually attribute Console console isn't quite right in that case, since I can do `window.console = "foo"` and it works with no type-checking errors

[11:33:14.0000] <terinjokes>
Domenic: i have a whole project that works by overriding lots of window and DOM things

[11:33:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Hmmmmmmmm

[11:33:43.0000] <terinjokes>
Domenic: you can do it, but should you be able to?

[11:34:18.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: Best to document what browsers currently do (when they agree), and then have issues in the spec for things you think we might want to change.

[11:34:19.0000] <Domenic>
WORSE! In Chrome it's a data property; in Firefox it's a getter/setter

[11:35:08.0000] <Domenic>
And the tiebreaker is... IE11 says data property!

[11:35:13.0000] <Domenic>
Now we're really in trouble

[11:35:16.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: We love our data properties in Chrome.

[11:35:25.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: oh right, I forgot about that

[11:35:41.0000] <smaug____>
hmm

[11:36:13.0000] <smaug____>
how would one even then explain window.console in webidl

[11:36:14.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dunno if we ever made the great "put our data properties on the prototype as getters/setters, like WebIDL requires" migration or not.

[11:36:27.0000] <TabAtkins>
smaug____: as "any", with prose defining its initial value?

[11:36:46.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: I believe another heroic attempt is being made, or at least was a week or so ago.

[11:37:00.0000] <smaug____>
TabAtkins: why would 'any' affect anything here

[11:37:09.0000] <Domenic>
smaug____: if it's a data property, you're screwed, WebIDL can't do it

[11:37:35.0000] <smaug____>
yeah, I was talking about being data property

[11:37:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
smaug____: Oh, sorry, thought you were talking about the "can override with whatever I want" part.

[11:37:50.0000] <smaug____>
/me certainly doesn't want to make a special case here

[11:38:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, no, just define it as normal in WebIDL, and let browsers fix themselves. Firefox is already fine.

[11:40:29.0000] <terinjokes>
TabAtkins: bikeshed doesn't seem to like "any" attributes

[11:40:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: Interesting! It's possible that that's not even allowed.

[11:41:31.0000] <terinjokes>
you can see from the last push

[11:45:59.0000] <terinjokes>
TabAtkins: i don't think it is allowed

[11:48:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
terinjokes: I mean that it might not be allowed in the WebIDL grammar.

[11:48:14.0000] <terinjokes>
yes

[11:48:17.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Bikeshed's webidl parser is built directly from the grammar in the spec.)

[11:48:19.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, okay.

[11:48:27.0000] <terinjokes>
can any's contain nullable sequence types?

[11:48:35.0000] <TabAtkins>
any is any.

[11:48:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
I guess mark "console" as type "Console" for now, with an issue tracking its mutability.

[11:49:17.0000] <terinjokes>
cool

[11:49:21.0000] <terinjokes>
will get to that tonight

[12:43:19.0000] <TabAtkins>
"URL modifiers" isn't already a claimed term for some part of a url, is it?

[12:47:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Ugh, I forgot everything I talked to you about a few months ago regarding computed values of URL. :(

[13:07:27.0000] <Domenic>
wat is this http://www.w3.org/Submission/2014/SUBM-first-screen-paint-20140811/

[13:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
a blog post, essentially

[14:00:24.0000] <caitp>
pdr / basically anybody who can make sense of svg 1.1, is https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=109212 a valid issue, or is firefox doing the wrong thing?

[14:00:33.0000] <caitp>
it's pretty non-obvious from reading the spec

[14:08:23.0000] <pdr>
caitp, I think it's valid from the spec's perspective. I am not sure if it will ever be implemented properly though

[14:09:36.0000] <caitp>
I see, thanks

[14:12:33.0000] <pdr>
caitp, do you have a usecase in mind? Bundling the resource in the svg document itself seems like it would be a better user experience in almost every case, but I may be missing something.

[14:14:05.0000] <caitp>
it's this weird thing where if you have a <base> tag in the document, FuncIRI stuff seems to get resolved totally wrong

[14:14:40.0000] <caitp>
so for instance, clip-path="url(#someId)" results in no clip path

[14:16:01.0000] <caitp>
or rather, they work on the initial url, but if you use history.pushState(), it no longer works

[14:19:08.0000] <caitp>
actually I'm wrong, it seems to not work even on the initial url, based on the reproduction in this bug

[14:21:14.0000] <caitp>
awit no, I wasn't wrong

[14:24:48.0000] <caitp>
i think the issue is actually someone reproducing a bug wrong, it looks like it works well enough for the use cases we want to support

[14:31:12.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins_: you keep both the input string and the parsed URL object

[14:31:27.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins_: that was the model, iirc

[14:31:42.0000] <TabAtkins_>
caitp: What pdr said, yes.

[14:31:53.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins_: URLs are parsed relative to the base URL of the style sheet

[14:31:53.0000] <TabAtkins_>
annevk: Okay. Why do you need the input string?

[14:31:56.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins_: for the object model

[14:32:03.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Ah, right, to serialize.

[14:32:03.0000] <TabAtkins_>
kk

[14:43:16.0000] <caitp>
oh no, it is still doing something weird, at least in webkit/blink, basically if you pushState() and then cause the SVG to be re-rendered in some fashion, it gets it wrong, weird

[14:44:25.0000] <pdr>
caitp, can you create a small example?

[14:45:41.0000] <caitp>
tobias bosch put together this reproduction http://plnkr.co/edit/YgBEuHuTFZXlpe7SLWrc?p=preview which goes into a bit more detail

[14:48:36.0000] <caitp>
although I don't see what difference setTimeout makes in his example

[15:00:30.0000] <pdr>
caitp, yeah, I think this is a bug. I'll file. I would recommend trying a different approach though. Might a and a:active work?

[15:05:34.0000] <caitp>
i'm not sure what you mean by that

[15:06:54.0000] <pdr>
caitp, it looks like you are trying to use this to change the appearance of svg based on the url without the svg changing. Is that correct?

[15:08:02.0000] <caitp>
so, recently we added a change to angular.js which requires a <base> element in the document, so that URLs can be resolved consistently between modern and legacy browsers --- someone complained that this broke their SVGs, because their editor adds a clipPath automatically

[15:08:15.0000] <caitp>
and it was just breaking whenever an address changed

[15:08:46.0000] <caitp>
I am not sure I understand how a / a:active could be used to resolve it

[15:09:04.0000] <caitp>
we're just trying to make our customers happy ;-;

[15:10:48.0000] <pdr>
Ok, I'll continue to file this bug. I would recommend your customer use another approach, but that's their issue.

[15:11:04.0000] <caitp>
thanks, would you mind CCing me on it?

[15:19:00.0000] <caitp>
or just paste a link even, that would be great

[15:23:00.0000] <pdr>
caitp, http://crbug.com/415772

[15:23:08.0000] <caitp>
awesome, thanks

[16:28:44.0000] <zewt>
some day, "save this password?" prompts in browsers won't be totally broken

[16:29:07.0000] <zewt>
chrome just asked me for about 1.25 seconds and disappeared it before I could click ... again

[16:29:22.0000] <terinjokes>
that's the first setting I change

[16:29:30.0000] <terinjokes>
i never want my browser to save passwords

[16:31:44.0000] <caitp>
bruce schneier wants you to know that password managers will help security, because if you don't use them, you'll just use easy-to-remember+easy-to-guess passwords or write them down in a text file or something instead

[16:44:19.0000] <zewt>
things that i'm not going to do: deal with passwords for some dumb little web forum

[16:45:36.0000] <caitp>
that's a pretty short list, you must be a very open-minded and adventurous person


2014-09-19
[17:21:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
zewt: Just use xanthir.com/password for everything, remembering passwords is for chumps, as is counting on a password db that can be corrupted/doesn't follow you around.

[17:21:47.0000] <TabAtkins>
(You can save that to a local file, or put it up on your own server; it's an independent html file with no dependencies.)

[17:23:50.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: For no reason I can ascertain, one particular call of parseHTML (to read an <a><img></a>) is taking up 2.3% of Bikeshed's processing time.

[17:24:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: It's neither the first nor the last call to parseHTML; it's comfortably in the middle.

[17:24:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I just can't figure it out.

[17:34:04.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: parseHTML?

[17:34:34.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Sorry, it's an html5lib.parse() call.

[17:35:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
When I need to parse some independent html, I parse it as an independent document, then extract the contents of <body> in the returned document.

[17:36:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is considering switching all of the include files to construct HTML elements directly, rather than being HTML text, but it's still confusing for now.

[17:37:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is there some sort of garbage collection that happens at some point?

[17:37:18.0000] <gsnedders>
nah

[17:37:19.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's possible I'm hitting that in Python itself, I suppose.

[17:38:14.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's just weird. I'm profiling Bikeshed, and I'm consistently getting 2-3% of processing time happening in addLogo(), which does nothing more than retrieve the logo.include file, parse it as HTML, then insert it.

[17:38:32.0000] <gsnedders>
what happens if you just profile that?

[17:38:46.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not doing line profiling yet.

[17:38:48.0000] <gsnedders>
where's the time spent within it?

[17:38:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I guess I can, hmm.

[17:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
nah, I was more meaning just that callstack

[17:39:21.0000] <gsnedders>
so I guess call addLogo through cProfile.callctx or something

[17:39:25.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, the only part of the callstack taking up enough time to be worth showing in the profile is the call to parseHTML().

[17:39:46.0000] <gsnedders>
Even just in that call to addLogo?

[17:39:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[17:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
and it's internal to that function?

[17:40:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's literally the only thing showing up in the profile - the other calls are too small, are get pruned from the diagram.

[17:40:32.0000] <gsnedders>
could try explicitly calling gc.collect before, I guess

[17:41:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
As far as cProfile can tell, yeah, internal to that function.

[17:44:18.0000] <gsnedders>
could try asking in #python, idk any reason why html5lib would randomly take loads of time

[17:45:20.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'll try to dig down further when I'm done dealing with profiles here; as much as possible I'm trying to avoid calling html5lib anyway.

[17:45:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's a major part of Bikeshed's runtime.

[17:46:22.0000] <gsnedders>
well yes, parsers tend not to be quick in interpreted languages

[17:46:26.0000] <gsnedders>
too many function calls

[17:46:37.0000] <gsnedders>
and typically lots of copying of strings

[17:49:29.0000] <TabAtkins>
Right. I just didn't realize it would end up accounting for ~10% of my runtime.

[17:49:47.0000] <TabAtkins>
And by switching to direct lxml element creation, most of these functions would fall off of the profile entirely.

[17:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Profiling has been very surprising and useful!

[17:50:40.0000] <gsnedders>
anolis was dominated by the cost of iterating of the tree, IIRC

[17:51:33.0000] <zewt>
tab: i'm sure there are lots of solutions--it just feels like something I shouldn't need an extra tool beyond the browser for by now

[17:53:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Iterating only takes a small fraction of Bikeshed's time, interestingly - uses of the selector function are at about 6% of time.

[17:55:33.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: just getting all definitions and checking all possible refs took a large amount of time in anolis

[17:55:48.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: just because you have to go through so many elements

[17:55:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's interesting. I wonder why it took so long?

[17:57:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
I spend about 10% of my time initializing the reference manager, but actually looking up refs is only about 1.5%

[17:57:26.0000] <TabAtkins>
And that's using the full cross-ref database, across all the specs that Shepherd parses.

[17:59:50.0000] <gsnedders>
https://bitbucket.org/ms2ger/anolis/src/061718e61cb5bc196d1e805b1b5de720132380be/anolislib/processes/xref.py?at=default makes it look pretty complex deciding whether an element is suitable

[18:01:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
Interesting.

[18:12:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Hmm, profiling another spec doesn't show the same pattern. Must just be an expensive GC that consistently triggers right there on that spec.

[18:15:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(Sorry, I'm a bit distracted by pointlessly reloading referendum results.)

[18:16:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haha, no problem.

[18:16:25.0000] <TabAtkins>
Only two counts in so far, dont' worry.

[18:16:43.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though fuck Orkney, for serious.

[18:17:27.0000] <TabAtkins>
It'll still be a few hours before results show up in several of the councils, anyway.

[18:17:31.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah, indeed

[18:17:38.0000] <gsnedders>
esp. for here

[18:17:52.0000] <gsnedders>
The islands will likely mostly vote no, none of that is surprising

[18:17:56.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[18:18:14.0000] <TabAtkins>
They hardly give a shit about Westminster anyway.

[18:18:40.0000] <gsnedders>
The Islands feel abandoned by Westminster, mostly. But feel like they'd be more abandoned by a smaller country.

[18:18:55.0000] <gsnedders>
Instead of London being the centre of attenion, it'd be the Central Belt.

[18:19:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, I'll get to see the results after dinner.

[18:19:59.0000] <TabAtkins>
Most councils will be reported in ~2 hours.

[18:20:43.0000] <gsnedders>
I should probably just sleep

[18:21:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, wake up to a brand new day, or else Westminster madly backpedalling from their DevoMax promises.

[18:21:45.0000] <gsnedders>
I dunno, it's gonna be clear that a lot of Scotland is /really/ unhappy. I'm not sure doing nothing is politically tenable anymore.

[18:22:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
I honestly can't predict what the UK government is doing anymore. Y'all are schizophrenic right now with all the UKIP/Tory/etc business.

[18:24:07.0000] <gsnedders>
The problem is it's all FPTP and there's been no major change to let a third party get anywhere (see the rise of Labour and the decline of the Liberals), so once people get pissed off at the current government after n years here come the others

[18:26:36.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, fptp is the worst voting system. It's not even "worst, except for all the others". It's just the worst. There's no excuse for it.

[18:33:19.0000] <gsnedders>
unfortunately it takes someone who cares more about constitutional reform than getting a majority in the house to actually change it

[18:36:19.0000] <gsnedders>
and also means getting the electorate over coalition governments

[18:38:39.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, change is hard. :/

[18:43:11.0000] <roc>
/me likes the NZ system, though we'll see how it works on Saturday

[18:43:28.0000] <roc>
TabAtkins: I wouldn't bother with Dr Olaf Hoffman, seriously

[18:44:20.0000] <gsnedders>
Like it's been very clear that people *do not like* coalition governments here. "But they're supporting polices that contradict their manifesto for governance!"

[18:46:18.0000] <roc>
I hope Scotland stays with the UK, because if they don't, we'll have to waste a lot of time and energy changing our flag

[18:47:44.0000] <gsnedders>
hah

[20:10:47.0000] <TabAtkins>
roc: Oh believe me, I know. Hoffman in an L2L thread, no less. But it still makes me angry to leave that sort of bullshit unchallenged.

[22:23:06.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: alt fix looks good, thanks

[00:44:58.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: in the list of params for the basic URL parser, as far the "optionally with an URL `url` and a state override `state override`" part, the optional `url` param there is a kind of spec-internal-only param that's just there as a hook for other parts of the algorithm, right?

[00:45:23.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: similar to the purpose of the `state override` param

[00:47:21.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: yeah isn't that mention in a note these days?

[00:47:40.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: dunno

[00:47:43.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks

annevk: there's a mozilla bug open for gecko not handling the host part of file: URLs per spec?

[00:59:46.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean for a case like file://localhost/test it returns just "/test"

[01:12:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I'm not sure

[01:12:22.0000] <annevk>
file URLs are generally problematic

[02:10:36.0000] <karlcow>
MikeSmith: do you mean file://localhost/test or file:///localhost/test

[02:11:18.0000] <karlcow>
aka scheme "file://" + full path "/localhost/test"

[02:19:59.0000] <MikeSmith>
karlcow: two slashes only

[02:20:45.0000] <karlcow>
How would it work? if you mean relative link.

[02:20:52.0000] <MikeSmith>
karlcow: btw what's a good ramen place in Shimokita?

[02:21:07.0000] <karlcow>
houla…

[02:21:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
We're going to be there tonight

[02:21:57.0000] <karlcow>
I would rather go to Tobu Sakana (fish izakaya) than ramen but… hmmm ramen…

[02:22:08.0000] <karlcow>
there is one I like which has fish stew

hsivonen: how much EV certificates is Mozilla paying for? Even mail.mozilla.org has one...

[04:26:47.0000] <annevk>
https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/ vs https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/ is so confusing

[05:10:04.0000] <mounir>
annevk: any comment on https://github.com/w3c/screen-orientation/pull/78 ?

[05:18:40.0000] <annevk>
mounir: it seems you'd want to change state in the same task, no?

[05:19:17.0000] <annevk>
mounir: but also, see comments from yesterday on hooks and animation frame task, for which I believe you already raised an issue with the web perf guys

[05:20:13.0000] <mounir>
annevk: the parts I'm changing are running in whatever task the page-visibility algorithm is running in

[05:20:27.0000] <annevk>
mounir: so should they be asynchronous?

[05:20:48.0000] <mounir>
annevk: there is no need to have this synchronous so async sounds good to me

[05:21:01.0000] <annevk>
mounir: aren't you dispatching events?

[05:21:08.0000] <mounir>
yes

[05:21:13.0000] <mounir>
in the screen orientation task though

[05:21:26.0000] <mounir>
that part is specified

[05:21:28.0000] <annevk>
mounir: so don't you want those to happen in the same task as the visibility events?

[05:22:28.0000] <mounir>
annevk: probably better to have all the screen orientation events fired in the screen orientation task?

[05:22:37.0000] <mounir>
annevk: maybe I could use the animation frame task when it's ready

[05:22:56.0000] <mounir>
but for the moment, using the same task for all those event firing seems the most sensible solution to me

[05:30:49.0000] <mounir>
annevk: ^ ?

[05:38:06.0000] <annevk>
hmm I guess

[05:38:14.0000] <annevk>
at this point I wonder how it's implemented

[05:38:21.0000] <annevk>
can't be this weird

[05:39:43.0000] <mounir>
annevk: in Chrome, the closest thing would be animation frame task

[06:03:10.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I have no idea of that cost info.

[06:03:23.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: sorry, I haven't had a chance to update the PR yet

[06:03:58.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: what do you think about Safari only showing the EV name?

[06:04:07.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: it's rather elegant on small screens

[06:05:12.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I don't have an iDevice, so I don't have enough data to comment

[06:13:34.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: np, you're just showing up as an overdue request in my bugzilla queue

[08:45:16.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
you know how when you're in an element with scroll bars, and when you get to the end of the scroll, the next scrollable element up the DOM chain immediately starts scrolling?

[08:45:21.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
is there any active discussion about how that UI should work? would that be at the HTML spec level, or is that an implementation detail for browsers to decide?

[08:48:31.0000] <TabAtkins>
ericandrewlewis: It's at the CSS spec level, or maybe DOM Events.

[08:48:45.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I dont' think scroll chaining has been properly defined anywher yet.

[08:49:59.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
cool, thanks TabAtkins.

[08:50:17.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I'd be interested in helping define that, for what it's worth.)

[08:53:17.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
TabAtkins: would a good first step be joining the mailing list, check for previous discussion, and starting conversation there?

[08:53:25.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup!

[08:56:28.0000] <ericandrewlewis>
rad :)

[09:05:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: fwiw I think the org-name-only display that Safari does for sites with EV certs is great

[09:05:52.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: it seems fairly intuitive that if you want to see the URL you can just touch on the org name

[09:20:59.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: what Firefox Nightly does for http://people.w3.org/mike/phish/ is not so great through

[09:21:28.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: what does it do?

[09:21:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
hang on I'll make a screenshot

I was wondering about meta  tags

[09:57:22.0000] <Andrei1000>
or meta-names rather

[09:57:24.0000] <Andrei1000>
https://help.whatwg.org/extensions/meta-name/

[09:57:30.0000] <Andrei1000>
is an empty list!

[09:57:40.0000] <Andrei1000>
there's nothing there

[10:02:48.0000] <Andrei1000>
can anyone tell me why we're getting output such as: "file:/opt/checker/tests/html/elements/meta/names-registered-isvalid.html":698:43: error: Bad value �TYPEMETAL.FORMATPREFS�name�meta�typemetal.formatprefs� for all the meta-names listed in our checker/tests/html/elements/meta/names-registered-isvalid.html

[10:02:49.0000] <Andrei1000>
?

[10:03:24.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: ^^^ That's you, right?

[10:10:48.0000] <annevk>
Andrei1000: they're maintained on https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions

[10:11:17.0000] <Andrei1000>
hi annevk ... it looks like the build.py

[10:11:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: yea me

[10:11:44.0000] <Andrei1000>
doesn;'t like our checkertests/html/elements/meta/names-registered-isvalid.html file

[10:11:45.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm yeah I need to fix that script I guess

[10:11:53.0000] <annevk>
Andrei1000: might be that things are failing due to recent move to using TLS

[10:11:58.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems like the move to TLS broke it

[10:12:17.0000] <MikeSmith>
what annevk said :)

[10:12:19.0000] <Andrei1000>
the public / w3 validator instance seems to be ok

[10:13:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
Andrei1000: yeah but it will break too next time I restart it

[10:13:33.0000] <Andrei1000>
that's exactly what happened to some of ours that were working ! :D

[10:13:39.0000] <Andrei1000>
but that explains a lot

[10:13:50.0000] <Andrei1000>
any idea when it will be fixed?

[10:14:24.0000] <annevk>
If it's written in Java that might be problematic, since hsivonen mentioned the other day that the Java module he uses doesn't support TLS SNI

[10:14:39.0000] <annevk>
If the script is not written in Java, it might be less bad

[10:14:40.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: it's a python script

[10:14:47.0000] <Andrei1000>
so you've now moved https://help.whatwg.org/extensions/meta-name/ from SSL to TLS?

[10:14:54.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: if it's Python 2.x, that again is likely problematic

[10:15:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[10:15:20.0000] <annevk>
Andrei1000: no, from not having encryption, to having encryption

[10:15:50.0000] <Andrei1000>
please restart the public/w3 validator instance, so people stop hassling us ;)

[10:15:55.0000] <MikeSmith>
it is Python 2 and running under Python 2.7 or whatever is installed by dreamhost

[10:16:19.0000] <MikeSmith>
Andrei1000: ? who's "us"?

[10:16:39.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh, and I missed the smile when I first read that

[10:16:44.0000] <Andrei1000>
we do QA stuff for BBC

[10:16:50.0000] <Andrei1000>
for their web portal

[10:16:53.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah ok

[10:17:24.0000] <Andrei1000>
they're saying it's our fault i.e. that our instances are broken, while the public instance is not

[10:17:35.0000] <Hixie_>
SSL to TLS?

[10:18:10.0000] <MikeSmith>
Andrei1000: tell them it's my fault :) and tell them to feel free to e-mail me at mike⊙wo if they want confirmation

[10:18:37.0000] <Andrei1000>
appreciated

[10:18:38.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: yeah only very latest Python 2.7 has a fix

[10:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: and dreamhost isn't running that?

[10:19:15.0000] <Andrei1000>
I'm going to hand you over to my collleague ...

[10:19:39.0000] <MikeSmith>
Andrei1000: OK, please do -- and I can send you a static file if you want

[10:19:45.0000] <jgraham>
You might be better off using requests for all your python http needs

[10:20:04.0000] <Andrei1000>
a static names-registered-isvalid.html you mean?

[10:21:05.0000] <Andrei1000>
MikeSmith: I don't get why the problem is the TLS on the remote site, when the build seems to be complaining of the local names-registered-isvalid.html ..

[10:21:26.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: DreamHost running the latest software? Hah

[10:21:55.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: "Python 2.6.6" is what DreamHost reports for me btw

[10:23:51.0000] <MikeSmith>
Andrei1000: the local validator build fetches https://help.whatwg.org/extensions/meta-name/ at build time and caches it locally

[10:24:32.0000] <MikeSmith>
every time your rebuild/restart it; e.g., if you do "python build/build.py all"

[10:25:15.0000] <Andrei1000>
MikeSmith: the one we're seeing locally looks perfectly readable ... but no the build doesn't like it

[10:25:45.0000] <Andrei1000>
still the build completes

[10:25:51.0000] <MikeSmith>
Andrei1000: hang on a minute there's to place you need to check

[10:26:00.0000] <Andrei1000>
I'll show you a sample of the o/p ... massive

[10:26:18.0000] <Andrei1000>

[10:27:00.0000] <Andrei1000>
I think that's for all the entries in the file

[10:27:32.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah that's expected if the https://help.whatwg.org/extensions/meta-name/ contents are empty :)

[10:27:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
and it's expected that the buildl will complete anyway if it's empty

[10:28:04.0000] <Andrei1000>
ok, good to know we're talking about the same thing :D

[10:30:12.0000] <NickHolmes>
MikeSmith, Hi. its me that's getting stress from our client. Do you know how we can resolve this issue by doing something to our instance of the validator to make this issue go away

[10:30:14.0000] <NickHolmes>
?

[10:30:41.0000] <MikeSmith>
NickHolmes: yeah, first check the checker/validator/src/nu/validator/localentities/files/meta-name-extensions file in your build directory

[10:31:15.0000] <MikeSmith>
and don't run "build.py all" any more for a while

[10:32:15.0000] <NickHolmes>
MikeSmith: that file is empty

[10:32:25.0000] <NickHolmes>
but it it present

[10:32:30.0000] <NickHolmes>
it is

[10:32:36.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's the emptiness that's the problem.

[10:32:40.0000] <MikeSmith>
right

[10:33:04.0000] <NickHolmes>
so do we fill it with the contents of /checker/tests/html/elements/meta/names-registered-isvalid.html or something

[10:33:18.0000] <MikeSmith>
no. I can send you a non-empty up-to-date version of that file

[10:33:23.0000] <NickHolmes>
cool

[10:33:47.0000] <NickHolmes>
can you send it to andrei.doicin⊙rc please

[10:33:49.0000] <MikeSmith>
and you can drop it into that path and you should be ok

[10:33:53.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[10:33:55.0000] <annevk>
so I guess this is technically my fault, and I could blame it on Mike West for encouraging us to deploy TLS

[10:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hah

[10:34:15.0000] <MikeSmith>
let's all blame Mike West

[10:34:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
blame chain

[10:34:34.0000] <annevk>
but this also seems good in a way, since getting TLS to work better is important

[10:34:38.0000] <NickHolmes>
MikeSmith: if we retstart, do we not overwrite it with emptiness?

[10:35:12.0000] <MikeSmith>
NickHolmes: it won't if you don't run "build.py all" but instead just do "build.py run"

[10:35:15.0000] <NickHolmes>
we will let you blame them, as long as its not our fault we dont care

[10:36:02.0000] <NickHolmes>
ok, can you send and we will try ...

[10:36:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
NickHolmes: you could avoid the need to do any building at all by running a release from https://github.com/validator/validator.github.io/releases/latest instead

[10:36:16.0000] <MikeSmith>
NickHolmes: yeah will send now

[10:36:53.0000] <NickHolmes>
cheers .... phew... I'm so looking forward to this being over... its taken 2 days to get to you, thinking it was something we did

[10:37:37.0000] <TabAtkins>
My Quest strikes again!

[10:38:45.0000] <MikeSmith>
NickHolmes: sorry this is all too arcane and not documented. Going forward I recommend running releases from https://github.com/validator/validator.github.io/releases/latest instead.

[10:41:46.0000] <MikeSmith>
NickHolmes: sent

[10:42:05.0000] <NickHolmes>
excellent - thanks

[10:42:59.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: I recommend not writing anything that anyone else would ever want to use. That's the only way to prevent this from happening again.

[10:43:16.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[10:43:23.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's one way to do it

[10:43:37.0000] <MikeSmith>
NickHolmes: also posted to https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sideshowbarker/8284404/raw/5ddff4d08b7818c30645bf116c83aa43de2c9666/meta-name-extensions

[10:46:33.0000] <AndreiD>
thanks MikeSmith ... trying it shortly ... just to make sure again, we start the build.py like so: build.py run ... but what about that preset file? we normally run like so:

[10:46:52.0000] <AndreiD>
python ./build/build.py --follow-w3c-spec --presets-file="nu-validator-site/presets.txt" all

[10:47:13.0000] <AndreiD>
should we just change the "all" to "run" at the end?

[10:47:23.0000] <MikeSmith>
AndreiD: yes

[10:47:58.0000] <MikeSmith>
you don't need to change anything else

[10:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
AndreiD: ah wait sorry

[10:49:16.0000] <MikeSmith>
you need "build" too

[10:49:35.0000] <MikeSmith>
so: python ./build/build.py --follow-w3c-spec --presets-file="nu-validator-site/presets.txt" build run

[10:49:45.0000] <AndreiD>
gotcha

[10:57:35.0000] <SimonSapin>
zcorpan: Is the order of declarations in CSSStyleDeclaration defined? (For the purpose of .item(i))

[10:59:17.0000] <TabAtkins>
SimonSapin: I think it's alphabetical?

[11:00:54.0000] <AndreiD>
MikeSmith: we tried it with build, and it blanks the meta-name-extensions file

[11:01:27.0000] <AndreiD>
we tried it without build i.e. just with run, and it gave us the same meta-name errors on the report

[11:01:56.0000] <MikeSmith>
AndreiD: gimme a minute

[11:03:49.0000] <MikeSmith>
AndreiD: try copying it to ./local-entities/meta-name-extensions as well

[11:05:16.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: it's IDL order

[11:05:25.0000] <AndreiD>
MikeSmith: should we still use build?

[11:05:30.0000] <MikeSmith>
AndreiD: yeah

[11:05:37.0000] <SimonSapin>
annevk: is that specified?

[11:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: btw about TLS browser UI/chrome I like that Google Chrome shows the URL with the "https" part in green, and like even better that desktop Safari shows the https only in a separate indicator (not as a part of the URL) with a gray background (instead of white) together with the lock icon

[11:12:20.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: I think it was at one point

[11:12:41.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I would like not showing "https" at all since it's a confusing string

[11:13:26.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: long term I guess that would be better

[11:13:53.0000] <MikeSmith>
short term you need to deal with current user expectations I would think, and not disrupt them

[11:14:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
and with current third-party guidance to users about what to look for in order to make trust decisions

[11:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: I think you wrote that URLs for TLS should be shorter not longer, and that makes sense

[11:17:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
we really should flip it around some and show a warning indicator for non-TLS URLs instead

[11:17:51.0000] <annevk>
yeah, starting with not making the TLS UI worse would be good

[11:19:43.0000] <Hixie_>
i proposed that like 10 years ago :-)

[11:20:47.0000] <MikeSmith>
the Web always learns thing the hard way

[11:21:45.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: I think Opera's approach here is pretty good

[11:21:55.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw as bad as the Web platform is, it at least doesn't have anything as fragile as BGP

[11:23:18.0000] <MikeSmith>
the http://www.renesys.com/2014/09/why-the-internet-broke-today/ thing

[11:23:19.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: yeah, as is mobile Safari

[11:23:44.0000] <MikeSmith>
"such is the nature of our trust-based Internet routing. Pretty much anyone can mess it up"

[11:24:23.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: I will verify that once they release a version for FirefoxOS :p

[11:27:37.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: oh, Opera never shows "http" or "https" in the address bar at all? just the lock for TLS and lock + org name for EV? (and just the non-scheme part of the URL for non-TLS?)

[11:29:51.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: It does if you focus the address bar (so that copy and paste works in a simple way), but otherwise a label like "Secure" or "Web" (maybe they changed the exact words now) slides over the scheme

[11:30:10.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah ok

[11:30:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, that's pretty nice

[11:32:13.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Fortunately BGP was designed so that at most 65536 different people had to be trusted not to mess it up (due to using 16-bit AS numbers)

[11:32:34.0000] <Hixie_>
yeah how's that worked out

[11:32:49.0000] <Hixie_>
it's not like india has ever blackholed the entire world's youtube traffic or anything like that

[11:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: but unfortunately someone decided it was a good idea to extend it to 32-bit AS numbers (which will surely be big enough forever)

[11:33:12.0000] <Hixie_>
(or was it pakistan, i forget)

[11:33:59.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: (Also unfortunately, 32-bit AS numbers actually broke the internet, like in http://www.renesys.com/2009/05/byte-me/ )

[11:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKcVXbLaHN0 seems to be a rather dated and inaccurate video about it

[11:36:39.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: hadn't read that one yet

[11:41:12.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: so yeah I see that current opera seems to have moved beyond that a bit and doesn't show the scheme even when you focus address bar. You can't see it even when you select it -- only after you paste it

[11:41:36.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as I can tell

[11:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway it's a pretty clean design

[11:43:23.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, that doesn't really sound better :)

[11:43:52.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: sounds more like what annevk wants at least

[11:44:17.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie_: yeah that was Pakistan it seems http://www.renesys.com/2008/02/pakistan-hijacks-youtube-1/

[11:44:27.0000] <jgraham>
copy and paste adding random things you didn't actually select to the output seems pretty awful

[11:44:41.0000] <MikeSmith>
gotta love that Renesys blog

[11:45:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: Chrome does it too I think

[11:45:41.0000] <MikeSmith>
or wait no Firefox does

[11:45:53.0000] <MikeSmith>
for http URLs

[11:46:13.0000] <MikeSmith>
it doesn't show the "http" even when you focus in the address bar

[11:46:22.0000] <MikeSmith>
and even when yuo select

[11:46:58.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah and neither does Chrome -- they both only show it for https URLs

[11:47:24.0000] <jgraham>
That doesn't mean it's good

[11:47:27.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess this is maybe part of what annevk was talking about in his blog post

[11:48:14.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: I didn't say it meant it was necessarily good :)

[11:48:25.0000] <MikeSmith>
though I personally don't think it's awful

[11:50:23.0000] <MikeSmith>
AndreiD: I need to get some sleep. So I hope you got you local validator instance working OK with that file I sent. If not, I'll be around again in a few hours and will try to figure out how else to fixe it

[11:50:45.0000] <jgraham>
I don't know about platforms that are actually supported, but Opera 25/Linux seems to be considerably worse than 12

[11:50:50.0000] <jgraham>
In this respect

[11:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: By "love", do you mean "be terrified by"?

[12:09:14.0000] <zcorpan>
SimonSapin: yes

[12:09:37.0000] <Hixie_>
MikeSmith: sounds right

[12:09:48.0000] <SimonSapin>
zcorpan: where is it defined?

[12:11:34.0000] <zcorpan>
SimonSapin: look at the things that return cssstyledeclaration

[12:12:14.0000] <zcorpan>
canonical order or so i think for .style

[12:14:21.0000] <SimonSapin>
zcorpan: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#the-elementcssinlinestyle-interface says specified (source) order

[12:15:13.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: you around?

[12:19:10.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: 'font' doesn't seem to have a matching <font> for me to parse as

[12:21:26.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: see https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26208

[12:45:28.0000] <terinjokes>
paul_irish: officially issued a ticket

[12:45:35.0000] <terinjokes>
(y)

[12:53:46.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: Which part of <font>?

[12:54:13.0000] <Hixie_>
the 'font' shorthand property's grammar

[12:54:14.0000] <Hixie_>
see the bug

[12:54:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, I see.

[13:07:26.0000] <JakeA>
marcosc: how does one correctly pronounce your surname?

[13:07:35.0000] <TabAtkins>
Caceres?

[13:07:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
Kah-sair-ehz

[13:07:59.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I'm crap at spelling pronunciation, apparently.)

[13:08:17.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's assuming standard spanish pronunciation rules.

[13:08:29.0000] <JakeA>
I might just make it up

[13:08:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
Call me, I'll pronounce it for you.

[13:10:30.0000] <JakeA>
TabAtkins: Thanks!

[13:10:36.0000] <JakeA>
I may use that service again

[13:10:39.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hahahaha

[13:10:43.0000] <TabAtkins>
Why do you need it?

[13:10:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/do/did/

[13:11:06.0000] <JakeA>
Moderating a panel at Edge tomorrow

[13:11:14.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, yeah, makes sense.

[13:12:31.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I think if you focus the address bar it makes some sense to reveal the full URL

[13:13:07.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: but when you're viewing a site and glance at the address bar it should be immediately obvious a) where you are and b) whether it's secure (or the reverse, whether it's insecure)

[13:13:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
Agree - I like the trend of only showing the domain unless you're focusing it. Makes it harder to phish.

[13:14:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
evil.cc/paypal.com

[13:16:12.0000] <JakeA>
TabAtkins: yeah, but did you see the comments on my blog post about that?

[13:16:20.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, I didn't. Link?

[13:16:28.0000] <annevk>

At one point wife-beating comes up

[13:17:17.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: poor JakeA, advocating TLS while not using it :p

[13:17:23.0000] <JakeA>
(I did get a bit agitated in the comments from all the conspiracy theory)

[13:17:25.0000] <JakeA>
hah, yeah

[13:17:50.0000] <JakeA>
I know I know

[13:17:55.0000] <terinjokes>
JakeA: :( come on, SSL is easy

[13:18:04.0000] <JakeA>
I hate you all

[13:18:35.0000] <JakeA>
It's on my TODO list

[13:19:14.0000] <JakeA>
Although it keeps getting bumped by things like "play computer games until vomit"

[13:20:37.0000] <Hixie_>
spec.whatwg.org should work now btw

[13:20:41.0000] <Hixie_>
(no thanks to dreamhost)

[13:20:51.0000] <terinjokes>
JakeA: :(

[13:21:38.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: do we know what was up?

[13:21:50.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: their panel is buggy

[13:22:06.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: you have to first set up the http: site, then set up the https: site, then you can edit the http: site

[13:22:08.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: it points to a Polish translation that is 410'd

[13:22:16.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: o_O

[13:22:29.0000] <Hixie_>
if you set up the https: site without first setting up the http: site, it just does whatever the http: site would do

[13:22:32.0000] <Hixie_>
wait, what?

[13:22:51.0000] <Hixie_>
oh the link at the top

[13:23:03.0000] <Hixie_>
removd

[13:24:20.0000] <Domenic>
Ooh and wiki stylesheet is fixed too

[13:24:32.0000] <Domenic>
I think we may have reached the point of a successful transition

[13:24:53.0000] <Domenic>
Wait! Mixed content on https://developers.whatwg.org/

[13:25:01.0000] <Domenic>
http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif:regular,italic,bold

[13:25:31.0000] <Domenic>
Hmm and stylesheet broken on https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/What_you_can_do O_O

[13:41:57.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic: developers.whatwg.org is going to be broken for some time still

[13:42:03.0000] <Hixie_>
since i need to write the code to regenerate it

[13:42:19.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie_: yeah, that is a sad

[13:42:40.0000] <Hixie_>
for hte wiki, it's a caching issue

[13:42:44.0000] <Hixie_>
logged-out users get cached pages

[13:42:49.0000] <Hixie_>
that were cached before hte transition

[13:43:03.0000] <Hixie_>
dbaron, TabAtkins: ping https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26264

[13:46:01.0000] <dbaron>
ugh, line breaking rules

[13:46:50.0000] <TabAtkins>
dbaron: What are your thoughts on doing more of those things within the confines of 'display'?

[13:47:29.0000] <dbaron>
TabAtkins, I guess I probably prefer display to ::after + content, although I wonder how important wbr is...

[13:47:41.0000] <TabAtkins>
dbaron: I use it in Bikeshed. ^_^

[13:48:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Insert it around the em-dashes it typography-fixes into the doc, since there aren't any spaces.)

[13:48:45.0000] <Hixie_>
dbaron: we ended up making <wbr> conforming due to the amount of usage it has

[13:48:50.0000] <Hixie_>
dbaron: so...

[13:49:38.0000] <dbaron>
TabAtkins, as a substitution for --- ?

[13:49:55.0000] <TabAtkins>
dbaron: If you end a line with --, yeah, it turns it into an em-dash.

[13:50:21.0000] <dbaron>
TabAtkins, hmmm, the TeX convention is -- for an en-dash, and --- for an em-dash

[13:50:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
I didn't give a lot of thought to it, but I bet I could find all the uses of -- in the CSSWG and just fix them.

[13:50:47.0000] <dbaron>
I guess I'm not as concerned about the performance of <wbr> as I am of <br>

[13:51:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
If we do <br> as display, though, we should do <wbr> too.

[13:54:15.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: Re: font, is it just the fact that the global keywords might be included in the <'font'> nonterminal?

[13:54:48.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: what is the <'font'> nonterminal?

[13:55:10.0000] <Hixie_>
i looked up 'font' in the CSS Fonts spec and it didn't have a single grammar token for me to reference

[13:55:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
The non-terminal that stands for "the value of the 'font' property"

[13:55:22.0000] <TabAtkins>
<'foo'> in general means that.

[13:55:26.0000] <Hixie_>
oh

[13:55:28.0000] <Hixie_>
where is that defined?

[13:55:34.0000] <Hixie_>
and does it include 'inherit' and so on?

[13:55:55.0000] <TabAtkins>
To your first question, http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values/#component-types

[13:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
To your second, no.

[13:56:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Also defined in that link.)

[13:56:24.0000] <Hixie_>
if it doesn't incldue the global keywords then it sounds perfect

[13:56:40.0000] <TabAtkins>
It is exactly what you need, yes.

[13:57:06.0000] <Hixie_>
coolio

[13:57:07.0000] <Hixie_>
thanks

[13:57:21.0000] <TabAtkins>
You're welcome. In return, you have to never say "coolio" again.

[14:01:52.0000] <Hixie_>
what's wrong with coolio

[14:05:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Everything.

[14:36:58.0000] <annevk>
'what's with these @w3c specs having generic, grandiose & non-descript titles? "Encoding", "URL". what's next? "Web"?'

[14:37:20.0000] <Hixie_>
i wish

[14:37:34.0000] <annevk>
can we uncache the wiki?

[14:37:39.0000] <annevk>
where's gphemsley?

[15:17:03.0000] <Domenic>
wow I did not know about <br clear>

Hixie_: i've been chating with brian

[16:52:07.0000] <terinjokes>
i don't have an account t comment on it

[16:52:18.0000] <Hixie_>
easy to get one :-)

[16:52:23.0000] <terinjokes>
oh, ok

[16:52:29.0000] <Hixie_>
anyway, i'm leaving this in your court now

[16:52:33.0000] <terinjokes>
if you insist :P

[16:52:38.0000] <Hixie_>
you don't have to

[16:52:44.0000] <Hixie_>
entirely up to you :-)

[16:55:04.0000] <terinjokes>
oh, i just made the connection between the commenter and you

[16:58:40.0000] <Domenic>

[17:13:10.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie_: ¿Qué es esto? https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26787

[17:18:05.0000] <GPHemsley>
List archive is broken? http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-February/030179.html

[17:41:44.0000] <Hixie_>
GPHemsley: load it in a browser that you haven't visited www.whatwg.org in recently and you should be fine

[17:42:55.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie_: Why's that?

[17:43:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
"Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at lists.whatwg.org."

[17:43:18.0000] <Hixie_>
because if you've visited whatwg.org recently you'll have received the STS header

[17:43:30.0000] <Hixie_>
which tells your browser to never open an http:// connection to a whatwg.org subdomain

[17:43:46.0000] <Hixie_>
yet dreamhost haven't yet made lists.* subdomains support https

[17:44:49.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh, interesting

[17:47:41.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh, so, being broken is the expected state at the moment?

[17:47:53.0000] <Hixie_>
we're pretending lists.whatwg.org never existed

[17:48:06.0000] <Hixie_>
see how all mention of it has been scrubbed from whatwg.org/mailing-list, for instance

[17:48:27.0000] <GPHemsley>
ah

[17:48:34.0000] <GPHemsley>
are all the archives at w3.org now?

[17:48:53.0000] <Hixie_>
archives for whatwg@ have been available on w3.org for some time

[17:49:00.0000] <Hixie_>
and are much nicer than the lists.whatwg.org ones

[17:49:39.0000] <GPHemsley>
yeah, sorry, I didn't phrase that clearly: I meant, this has an equivalent page on w3.org somewhere?

[17:49:57.0000] <Hixie_>
what does "this" in that sentence refer to?

[17:50:05.0000] <GPHemsley>
the particular link I gave

[17:50:08.0000] <Hixie_>
oh

[17:50:09.0000] <Hixie_>
yes

[17:50:15.0000] <Hixie_>
no idea what it is though :-)

[17:50:38.0000] <Hixie_>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2011Feb/0025.html

[17:51:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
that was a quick turnaround :P

[17:51:17.0000] <Hixie_>
open the page, copy the first sentence into google...

[17:51:46.0000] <GPHemsley>
ah, you and your other browser

[17:53:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
(this is probably a naive question, I'm realizing now...) is there really a usecase for forcing a URL to HTTPS that doesn't actually connect?

[17:53:31.0000] <Hixie_>
preventing someone from DOSing the secure site and MITMing the insecure one

[17:54:06.0000] <GPHemsley>
yeah, that was basically what I expected the answer to be

[17:55:15.0000] <GPHemsley>
but aryeh's site is dead anyway?

[17:58:49.0000] <Hixie_>
GPHemsley: http://web.archive.org/web/20121127212525/http://aryeh.name/spec/innertext/innertext.html

[17:59:06.0000] <GPHemsley>
you and your lack of laziness :P

[17:59:26.0000] <Hixie_>
yeah, copying and pasting urls into text fields, such hard work

[17:59:39.0000] <GPHemsley>
I should probably work on my existing spec before I worry about other ones...

[17:59:40.0000] <Hixie_>
:-P

[18:03:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
Incidentally, I am soliciting suggestions for a good computer desk. Feel free to send them my way (publicly or privately), as I am currently stationed on the floor.

[18:20:01.0000] <Domenic>
terinjokes: don't listen to the haters; GitHub issues are 1000x better than mailing lists.

[18:21:44.0000] <Hixie_>
github issues are terrible

[18:21:56.0000] <Hixie_>
bugzilla bugs are pretty awesome though

[18:25:27.0000] <caitp->
flexible and powerful but not well designed

[18:41:54.0000] <terinjokes>
i already have haters

[18:41:55.0000] <terinjokes>
awesome

[01:22:38.0000] <annevk>
terinjokes: haters?

[01:27:14.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: asynchronously is now something else, might want to update guides: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#in-parallel

[01:41:08.0000] <annevk>
I did not realize that if you're not using Nightly you don't get mixed content warnings in the UI for images

[01:43:38.0000] <annevk>
Can anyone tell me if https://codereview.chromium.org/265973003 is in Chrome stable?

[01:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Alternatively, run http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3191 and tell me what it says

[02:37:29.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: observation: the messaging that crypto is too hard for people to try themselves discourages people from playing around in that area; it might makes sense if you deploy sites, but not in the general sense

[06:20:42.0000] <GPHemsley>
Bugzilla > GitHub

[08:31:38.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Am I reading kangax wrong or does this suggest Chrome 35+ has String.prototype.contains? http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#String.prototype.contains

[08:43:59.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: going to binge on tickets next week, sorry for not really giving it the attention it deserves of late

[08:44:02.0000] <JakeA>
*conferences*

[08:47:57.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: getting input on the cache stuff would be good

[08:48:13.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: if you run into some networking people, point them to it :-)

[08:49:53.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: yeah, cache API consensus will be a priority. Will likely organise a call once I've gone through the issues

[08:50:07.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: will also take another serious look at the jenga thread

[08:50:30.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: sorry, this was fetch() cache setttings

[08:50:51.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: see tweet

[08:53:01.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: ahh yes, will look at that too. Also people have requested some way to set expiry on SW cache items... I think that's the point you just use the browser cache, but I want to give that more thought too

[08:53:35.0000] <annevk>
that doesn't make sense

[08:54:03.0000] <annevk>
as the whole interaction with the cache API is through script, so you can't really help not inspecting it

[08:54:39.0000] <JakeA>
That's my gut reaction too

[08:59:38.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: I could imagine setting an expiry for a URL

[14:14:32.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie_: Is everything whatwg.org now (instead of www.whatwg.org)?

[14:21:29.0000] <tantek>
yay for no-www.org :D

[14:27:21.0000] <GPHemsley>
Their wall of shame is for domains that forward no-www to www. But there are more deserving websites for which no-www flat out doesn't work.

[14:30:48.0000] <GPHemsley>
Oh, html.spec.whatwg.org is finally canonical? \o/

[14:41:36.0000] <tantek>
speaking of shaming domains, http://httpshaming.tumblr.com/

[14:46:42.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me wonders why <code> is no longer orange

[14:55:26.0000] <tantek>
anybody else watching the live video stream at edgeconf.com/2014-sf ?

[14:58:24.0000] <GPHemsley>
Look at me, closing mimesniff bugs and stuff...

[14:59:04.0000] <tantek>
GPHemsley++

[14:59:16.0000] <GPHemsley>
:)


2014-09-21
[17:15:46.0000] <Hixie_>
GPHemsley: yeah unfortunately STS requires that the top-level domain be a superdomain of other subdomains

[17:15:55.0000] <Hixie_>
GPHemsley: so www. had to go

[17:18:35.0000] <Hixie_>
GPHemsley: <code> should be orange if it's a xref

[17:49:47.0000] <tantek>
 "mailing lists are the worst form of communication invented" - @slightlylate

[17:50:00.0000] <tantek>
good to see the message spreading

[17:50:17.0000] <tantek>
"mailing lists … recipe for failure"

[17:55:56.0000] <Hixie_>
yeah, worst except for all the others :-)

[17:57:11.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, except IRC :)

[17:57:31.0000] <Hixie_>
for technical discussion, IRC is almost as bad as twitter :-P

[17:57:33.0000] <tantek>
your usage is different - it's your inbox :)

[17:57:52.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - no way - the level of conversation in here is typically 10x better than Twitter # madeupstats

[18:12:13.0000] <tantek>
lol "for analytics"

[18:25:54.0000] <tantek>
go sicking! loving all this open questioning of the extensible web manifesto.

[18:30:12.0000] <tantek>
lol @slightlyoff "just need to put a web server on the thumb drive"

[18:31:23.0000] <Phae>
He's on top form today

[18:33:07.0000] <sicking>
 tantek: i wouldn't say that i'm questioning the extensible web manifesto

[18:33:36.0000] <sicking>
tantek: just saying that it's not always possible to do.

[18:34:03.0000] <tantek>
sicking - I'd say your point about device APIs outright questioned the prioritization of the extensible web manifesto

[18:34:38.0000] <sicking>
tantek: in the context of security sensitive APIs I don't think it's always possible to do

[18:36:21.0000] <tantek>
more like nearly never possible to do.

[18:40:22.0000] <Hixie_>
tantek: dare i ask where you're seeing this conversation?

[18:43:44.0000] <Phae>
He'll be watching the edgeconf love feed

[18:43:49.0000] <Phae>
Live* even.

[18:43:54.0000] <Phae>
At Adobe right now

[18:45:10.0000] <tantek>
Hixie: edgeconf.com for most of today. just wrapped up.

[18:45:33.0000] <tantek>
Hixie: I just presumed #whatwg as the default backchannel for all things web platform ;)

[18:46:01.0000] <Hixie_>
oh this is a talk where alex and sicking are saying this stuff?

[18:46:29.0000] <tantek>
right, conference of panels, some folks on the panel, some in the audience

[18:46:37.0000] <tantek>
quite a solid gathering

[19:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if mailing lists are the worst form of communication invented, then I guess we need to mint a new word stronger than "worst" to describe telephone conferences

[22:38:19.0000] <GPHemsley>
I think telegraph conversations are worser

[22:44:13.0000] <terinjokes>
any other ham radio guys around…

[05:20:03.0000] <annevk>
https://store.apple.com redirects to http:// ...

[06:33:15.0000] <MikeSmith>
AndreiD: fyi I fixed https://help.whatwg.org/extensions/meta-name/

[06:34:28.0000] <MikeSmith>
AndreiD: so you guys can switch your validator build invocation back to "python ./build/build.py ... all" safely

[06:35:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: cool, just like the NSA does (https redirect)

[06:35:53.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: so the python issue is that libxml2 in python <2.7 doesn't handle https?

[07:14:12.0000] <GPHemsley>
Why is anyone still using Python <2.7?

[07:17:04.0000] <Ms2ger>
debian-stale?

[07:17:09.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me has no idea

[07:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
dreamhost

[07:23:55.0000] <MikeSmith>
debian stable has had 2.7 for a long time, I think

[07:25:35.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I guess the next question is why is anyone still using dreamhost

[07:26:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
dreamhost is the sourceforge of .. something

[07:27:57.0000] <MikeSmith>
somebody please give me a heads-up when tantek catches the TLS-only fever

[07:28:15.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I can switch my scraper for http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values

[07:53:04.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I tried to find exact details the other day but couldn't

[07:53:13.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: but I think it's Python 2.7.9 or some such

[07:53:24.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/ is related

[07:53:51.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I think it was planned for 2.7.7 but did not make it there

[07:55:39.0000] <annevk>
Seems 2.7.9 is not yet out

[07:58:07.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: and http://bugs.python.org/issue5639#msg204323

[07:58:16.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: mnot commented there as well

[07:59:12.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: found https://docs.python.org/2/library/ssl.html#ssl.HAS_SNI

[07:59:24.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: suggests it's 2.7.9 which as far as I can tell is not even released yet?

[08:01:59.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: ah Ok it might not actually be the cause of problem I'm seeing, I dunno

[08:03:06.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I think there's a way to use some other package to get SNI, but it has a ton of dependencies

[08:03:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: what I was using is lxml.html.parse and that apparently can't handle https URLs

[08:03:15.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: OK

[08:03:19.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: handle them at all?

[08:04:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: yeah based on glancing through some stuff on StackOverflow, I think not at all

[08:04:19.0000] <MikeSmith>
error logs don't provide much detail

[08:04:38.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: you could try perhaps with a resource that has a dedicated IP address

[08:04:42.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: maybe google.com?

[08:04:54.0000] <annevk>
(not sure if Google has restrictions in place, I'd guess they do)

[08:05:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah OK I guess I cuold try that

[08:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: anyway I worked around it for now by instead just using urllib2.urlopen to get a file object to read from, and then using lxml.html.document_fromstring to get a tree from that

[09:06:40.0000] <annevk>
https://twitter.com/janl/status/513714191665233920

[09:06:56.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I guess urllib2 might be the one with all the dependencies then if that just works?

[09:07:16.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: seems fine then, I also mostly use urllib2 iirc

[09:08:32.0000] <GPHemsley>
annevk: FYI, I've returned to active duty as the mimesniff editor, if you need to coordinate things. (It seems there have been developments in Fetch that could use corresponding support in mimesniff.)

[09:10:31.0000] <GPHemsley>
MikeSmith: And what is the github equivalent of Dreamhost?

[09:11:15.0000] <GPHemsley>
DreamHost : SourceForge :: ??? : Github

[09:16:30.0000] <Ms2ger>
GPHemsley, your next business ;)

[09:16:39.0000] <GPHemsley>
pfft

[09:16:40.0000] <GPHemsley>
no thanks

[09:22:31.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess the github equivalent of Dreamhost is hosting on your own virtual machine that you can actually control all the software on

[09:24:03.0000] <annevk>
GPHemsley: great to hear

[09:24:19.0000] <annevk>
GPHemsley: it seems working on the nosniff stuff could help Gecko

[09:25:06.0000] <annevk>
GPHemsley: I think mimesniff is prolly mostly used after Fetch has retrieved a resource, though I could envision some convenience spec hooks that couple them

[09:36:44.0000] <GPHemsley>
annevk: It's not clear to me what the issues are with nosniff as I've documented it.

[09:36:49.0000] <GPHemsley>
(If any)

[09:41:21.0000] <GPHemsley>
annevk: Unless you're referring to expanding the applicability of the image-type sniffing

[09:41:30.0000] <GPHemsley>
to additional contexts

[14:58:22.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me glares at annevk for using relative dates on all his blog posts

[14:59:40.0000] <caitp>
relative times are nice to look at

[14:59:52.0000] <tantek>
GPHemsley you may find this interesting: http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/08/23/1/you-should-not-be-displaying-relative-dates

[15:00:02.0000] <caitp>
exact times are nice as alt text

[15:01:13.0000] <caitp>
"relative dates break screenshots in a universe where exif doesn't exist"

[15:01:25.0000] <tantek>
caitp - welcome to that universe

[15:01:45.0000] <caitp>
i'm not in that universe really

[15:02:00.0000] <tantek>
screenshots on iOS and MacOS are PNGs - without any EXIF

[15:02:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
So, annevk uses <data> but not @title

[15:02:13.0000] <caitp>
sure, but that's a fixable problem

[15:02:14.0000] <GPHemsley>
and by <data> I mean <time>

[15:02:16.0000] <tantek>
so, which universe/platform are you on which puts EXIF in screentshots?

[15:02:36.0000] <caitp>
browsers can do it, WMs can do it

[15:02:47.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me consistently forgets that the element is <time> and not <date>

[15:03:30.0000] <tantek>
caitp - did't ask who "can" - asked who *does*

[15:03:51.0000] <tantek>
feel free to demonstrate EXIF in a screenshot by posting a URL to an example.

[15:03:57.0000] <caitp>
who cares :p the point is all about the fact that metadata exists

[15:04:04.0000] <tantek>
have yet to see *any* platform/device actually put EXIF in screenshots

[15:04:06.0000] <caitp>
so resolving the absolute time from relative times in a screenshot is possible

[15:04:14.0000] <tantek>
nope, it doesn't exist - you're making it up ;)

[15:04:18.0000] <tantek>
i.e. citation needed

[15:04:39.0000] <caitp>
we know that image metadata does exist, it's used in basically every cellphone and digital camera ever

[15:04:48.0000] <caitp>
whether it's used by OSes is irrelevant

[15:04:49.0000] <caitp>
it could be used

[15:04:55.0000] <caitp>
if it's not used, it's arguably a bug

[15:05:17.0000] <caitp>
people deal with relative time better than exact dates

[15:05:38.0000] <caitp>
it's harder to remember what you were doing on 9/08/2014 than it is to remember what you were doing 2 weeks ago

[15:06:42.0000] <caitp>
i mean, I don't have data to support that claim, it's anecdotal from my own experience

[15:06:52.0000] <caitp>
but if the data were collected, you'd probably find that

[15:07:18.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh, great, and he uses "fortnight"

[15:16:34.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me looks at OpenSSL and wonders where Poerto Rico is

[15:17:06.0000] <GPHemsley>
"HTTP 405 - Method Not Allowed

[15:17:07.0000] <GPHemsley>
(If you are a human being, this should have never happened)"

[15:17:10.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hmm

[15:17:15.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me reevaluates himself

[15:19:21.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh, I guess I'm back to being a human now

[15:19:27.0000] <tantek>
caitp - yes it's (arguably) a bug - OS screenshots don't save EXIFs, which last time I checked, only apply to JPEGs, whereas screenshots use PNG typically.

[15:20:30.0000] <caitp>
or bmp if you're super lucky!


2014-09-22
[19:39:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
if anybody here is familiar with the process of uploading stuff to Maven Central and can help me some time soon, I'd appreciate it

[19:40:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
in order to resolve https://github.com/validator/validator.github.io/issues/10

[19:40:33.0000] <MikeSmith>
the OP there provides a link to http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-central-repository-upload.html but that guide seems near worthless

[19:41:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least worthless to somebody like me who knows next to nothing about Maven in general

[23:33:21.0000] <ionas>
If I have a semantic set of data called “record” and I want to display 1 record by specifing data of its fields - how would you map that most semantically?

[23:39:48.0000] <ionas>
Does this look all right?

[23:39:48.0000] <ionas>
http://pastie.org/9582924

[00:08:27.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: maybe our showModalDialog article should mention that only a <dialog> polyfill might not be enough if there's a lot to refactor - http://thinkingoutsidetheanglebrackets.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/removal-of-showmodaldialog-and.html

[00:15:34.0000] <annevk>
I only use relative dates on the home page

[00:45:08.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: bug reporting from the spec seems to take longer?

[00:47:18.0000] <ionas>
seems neither <nav> nor <section> want to live without at least a h6

[00:51:38.0000] <ionas>
http://pastie.org/9583128 - trying to represent a data record most semantically

[01:19:48.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: for ServiceWorker, about the cause of the (proposed) decision from Google to not ship offline/cache is v1, is it maybe due in part to https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/468 from mnot?

[01:20:30.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I don't know

[01:20:37.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[01:21:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I'll just talk with Kenji

[01:21:24.0000] <MikeSmith>
ionas: I'd just use <div>

[01:21:57.0000] <MikeSmith>
ionas: with a class value if you want -- like, <div class=record>

[01:22:00.0000] <ionas>
MikeSmith: its not just an abstract division though, each section groups certain types

[01:22:14.0000] <ionas>
and the record has a title

[01:22:35.0000] <ionas>
and is self-sustained - eg. an article

[01:22:39.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't think any of that makes it unsuitable for marking up with <div>

[01:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the semantic elements like article are kind of a lost cause IMHO

[01:23:10.0000] <ionas>
MikeSmith: just because you CAN use div/span everywhere

[01:23:15.0000] <ionas>
does not mean you have to

[01:23:28.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah I didn't say you had to

[01:23:38.0000] <ionas>
I think they are fine, they also add options to style things without cluttering tons of classes

[01:23:43.0000] <ionas>
like <div class=“record”>

[01:24:13.0000] <ionas>
the worst thing lately happening is all that css-class-soup coming through those pseudo frontend frameworks

[01:25:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
if that's the worst thing you've seen happening lately, you're lucky

[01:26:01.0000] <ionas>
such a fall-back into dark-table-ages - ultra huge DOM trees due to just wrapping divs with classes, that’s the other reason to go “semantic” (thinking about what data you represent) - so personally I’d love to see many more semantic tags like record, product, etc - generic “nouns” that can be adapted for different use cases and have some guideline how to use

[01:26:29.0000] <ionas>
hehe ;) - yes bootstrap/div-soup/class-soup really made some projects a big pain due to bad practise/design.

[01:37:19.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: might just be W3C Bugzilla that is very slow

[01:41:48.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: yeah, that

[01:42:12.0000] <MikeSmith>
w3c systems are having some load problems right now

[01:42:25.0000] <MikeSmith>
systems team is working on getting it resolved

[01:53:08.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: https://plus.google.com/+IanBicking/posts/Cz95yhYK3aG seems apt for the further investment in DreamHost strategy

[01:53:28.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: although I suppose I might still get fed up with it after a while

[02:24:14.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Right, the correct evaluation is long term cost of moving to another host vs long term cost of staying on Dreamhost. The first option is front-loaded in that there is some switching cost (although you don't have to make a big-bang change of course), but there amy well be a break even point and it might not even be too far in the future

[02:24:46.0000] <Ms2ger>
Amy?

[02:24:47.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me ducks

[02:28:13.0000] <gsnedders>
Amy's vital to any moving plan!

[02:33:46.0000] <jgraham>
Yes, she's going to do the heavy lifting

[02:34:51.0000] <gsnedders>
Assigning elements to sections is hard, part ten: <p class=category>cats</p><h2>Pillar</h2><p>Pillar is a three-legged cat

[02:35:08.0000] <annevk>
Amy?

[02:35:55.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: as the switching cost involves learning how to manage a server, it seems pretty high

[02:42:29.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Well how hard that is depends a lot on what you're doing. Running a simple HTTP server is easy. Running a mail server is hard enough that I'm not prepared to try it. Running a HTTP server and a DB server is somewhere in the middle

[02:57:45.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: fyi, your take on the W3C HTML5 spec is being spun into "Mozilla doesn't care about a11y" propaganda on Twitter

[02:58:24.0000] <Ms2ger>
Of course it is

[02:59:21.0000] <hsivonen>
Ms2ger: I'm not suggesting that this is surprising, but failing to point to specific bogosities helps the propaganda

[02:59:39.0000] <Ms2ger>
And thank you for that

[03:16:09.0000] <zcorpan>
anyone know of a "browser" icon in svg that is cc0?

[03:16:34.0000] <zcorpan>
that looks good at 16x16px

[03:21:53.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: https://openclipart.org/

[03:22:16.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you didn't try that already

[03:27:05.0000] <zcorpan>
didn't find anything suitable

[03:31:16.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: It seems like "Mozilla a11y are implementing based on the W3C version of the spec" would be useful input to the dev.platform thread. That is something we can use as leverage to get observable differences backported to the WHATWG version, which seems like a good outcome. I also don't have kind words for people who perfer to drum up a Twitter storm rather than engage in reasoned discussion.

[03:32:51.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: no.

[03:33:11.0000] <karlcow>
the message of Ms2ger is. Not the one of jgraham.

[03:36:41.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: http://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Deer_park_globe.svg maybe

[03:37:25.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: it looks a lot like firefox nightly

[03:37:35.0000] <zcorpan>
but maybe

[03:38:30.0000] <MikeSmith>
also I see now it's cc-by -_-

[03:38:41.0000] <MikeSmith>
not cc0

[03:39:02.0000] <zcorpan>
looks like it actually is the nightly icon :-)

[03:40:30.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: Yeah but I doubt you'll find 1 normal person out of 1000 who would know it's the nightly icon

[03:41:07.0000] <zcorpan>
this is for https://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker not for normal persons :-P

[03:41:16.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ah

[03:44:20.0000] <annevk>
looks like an old version of the icon

[03:46:18.0000] <MikeSmith>
if it's a icon for recognition by people who actually work on browser code and testing, you need something that connotes pain and anxiety

[03:47:10.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., more like an exploding planet

[03:51:21.0000] <MikeSmith>

[03:51:56.0000] <annevk>
/me is still bad with regular expressions

[03:53:46.0000] <karlcow>
regex101

[03:54:47.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: do you have an example of two URIs?

[03:55:12.0000] <annevk>
https://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=8781&to=8782 -> https://html5.org/r/8782

[03:55:40.0000] <karlcow>
merci

[03:57:11.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: you don't need to escape the = sign, right? though I guess it should still wish just the same if you do

[03:57:23.0000] <karlcow>
yes no need

[03:57:36.0000] <karlcow>
and also the &

[03:57:37.0000] <MikeSmith>
nor the & sign

[03:57:55.0000] <annevk>
yeah had that before

[04:01:36.0000] <karlcow>
^/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=[0-9]+&to=([0-9]+)$ https://html5.org/r/$1

[04:01:37.0000] <karlcow>
As I'm not sure if apache knows \d

[04:02:48.0000] <annevk>
it does

[04:03:51.0000] <annevk>
doesn't work

[04:05:51.0000] <darobin>
you need to escape the ?

[04:06:09.0000] <karlcow>
ah!

[04:06:18.0000] <darobin>
and indeed Apache regexes are pretty dumb

[04:06:30.0000] <darobin>
annevk: try with the ? escaped

[04:06:33.0000] <karlcow>
? <- conditionnal

[04:06:37.0000] <darobin>
yeah

[04:06:47.0000] <annevk>
it's escaped

[04:07:12.0000] <darobin>
mmmmmmmm

[04:07:35.0000] <darobin>
oh

[04:07:47.0000] <darobin>
I'm not sure you can match against the query string

[04:07:49.0000] <annevk>
are query parameters passed in differently?

[04:07:55.0000] <annevk>
yeah, seems like it

[04:08:04.0000] <annevk>
bah

[04:08:30.0000] <darobin>
mmmm RedirectMatch — that's not mod_rewrite

[04:09:10.0000] <karlcow>
>Another case is when a CGI needs to be redirected and the CGI takes arguments by the GET method. A "Redirect" or "RedirectMatch" command will redirect the CGI but will not send the CGI's arguments along with it to the new URL.

[04:09:31.0000] <karlcow>
RewriteEngine on + RewriteRule is your friend

[04:09:38.0000] <darobin>
annevk: I think that you want to use mod_rewrite instead

[04:11:45.0000] <darobin>
annevk: RewriteRule can make backreferences to RewriteCond matches, and the latter can match on the QS

[04:12:07.0000] <darobin>
it's painful though

[04:12:57.0000] <darobin>
you could turn web-apps-tracker into a small CGI script that would do this far more easily :)

[04:13:49.0000] <annevk>
it's a CGI script, but I was hoping not to have to figure out the CGI API again

[04:14:00.0000] <darobin>
annevk: what language?

[04:14:04.0000] <annevk>
Python

[04:14:17.0000] <annevk>
need to figure out how to get the request URL

[04:14:30.0000] <darobin>
annevk: I presume it's already referencing the from/to values,

[04:14:39.0000] <darobin>
all you need to add is how to send a 301

[04:14:51.0000] <annevk>
I think then I'll get into external redirects :-)

[04:14:58.0000] <karlcow>
Ooooh https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=958887

[04:18:44.0000] <darobin>
oh, it looks like it's just print 'Status: 301...' and then the Location header

[04:18:51.0000] <darobin>
nicely close to the metal :)

[04:39:45.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: there are people on twitter who are particularly taking issue with jgraham's wording

[04:56:40.0000] <zcorpan>
what wording?

[05:18:25.0000] <mathiasbynens>
zcorpan: this seems up your alley https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/issues/32#issuecomment-55027268

[05:21:42.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/issues/32#issuecomment-55896661 seems to say they don't need a css parser anyway, can just iterate the cssom

[05:22:38.0000] <zcorpan>
but certainly making the cssom suck less is a long term goal

[05:23:43.0000] <zcorpan>
a problem with iterating the cssom is that you can't do it until the stylesheet is already applied

[05:23:59.0000] <zcorpan>
but i'm not sure how this thing works to begin with

[05:48:02.0000] <SteveF_>
hsivonen: "it doesn't do a11y any favors to hold the permathreads about longdesc as a symbol of pro-a11y activity. " who has been doing that? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-admin/2014Aug/0038.html

[06:31:06.0000] <Ms2ger>
karlcow, hmm? People complaining about me?

[06:32:46.0000] <zcorpan>
does anyone here know how css positioning works with rtl and scrollable elements? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Sep/0294.html

[06:34:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Ms2ger: it's all your fault

[06:45:19.0000] <jgraham>
SteveF_: FWIW I think that, although longdesc hasn't been mentioned here, it is the constant elephant in the room for a11y discussions. The discussion reached a point where it was clear to me, at least, that if I go blind, anything that required authors to use longdesc would simply not be accessible to me, whether or not it is in the HTML spec. At that point a valid tactic on the "WHATWG side" (if you want that kind of unhelpful characterisation) wo

[06:45:27.0000] <jgraham>
... think this attribute is entirely useless if not outright harmful, but it's not worth fighting about". Obviously that didn't happen, and perhaps it was a mistake. On the other side proponents of the attribute showed very little sign that they were engaging with the evidence that it wasn't really a helpful design. Instead they sunk a lot of political capital — more than they could really afford — on forcing it through. Several of the participa

[06:45:33.0000] <jgraham>
... had toxic personalities and people weren't prepared to cut them out of the discussion, or disown their behaviour, particularly when they happened to agree with their viewpoint on this one issue. This discussion was one of the things that led to the group becoming a lot more bureaucratic with polls and extension specs and so on. For implementors, maintaining a high cadence is extremely important, not just because it isn't anyone's job to engage i

[06:45:39.0000] <jgraham>
... debates, but also because it's necessary to keep improving specific products and the platform as a whole so as not to lose in the marketplace either against direct competitors or whole new technology stacks that don't come with all the legacy baggage. With that in mind a forum with protocols designed to neuter multi-year debates over a single attribute aren't suitable for any other kind of work, and that's why implementors lost interest.

[06:46:55.0000] <darobin>
well, that's a long thing to say on IRC

[06:47:26.0000] <jgraham>
So it seems

[06:48:46.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: like many others active in acc specification of html and related features, I have spent very little time in the past few years on longdesc, but it is usually waved around in discussions as it is an easy target

[06:52:56.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: my input on the URL spec thread may be of interest as its subject is relevant to the issues - http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/2014Sep/0015.html *warning*  lacks hyperbole and fisticuffs

[06:53:05.0000] <jgraham>
SteveF_: Right, but this is something that happened a few years ago. The fact that everyone — in some particularly unhelpful way — got what they wanted, with a WHATWG spec not containing longdesc and a W3C extension spec containing longdesc, makes it unsurprising that people moved on to new things in the meantime. But the effects of that earlier phase are still shaping the way we operate today.

[06:56:19.0000] <Ms2ger>
jgraham, your wall of text above is missing things, fwiw

[06:56:29.0000] <jgraham>
Ms2ger: Not for me!

[06:56:42.0000] <tantek>
whoa - email in IRC - amazing!

[06:56:50.0000] <Ms2ger>
characterisation) wo

[06:56:51.0000] <Ms2ger>
<jgraham> ... think this

[06:57:11.0000] <jgraham>
'would have been to say "we'

[06:57:38.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: i agree, I moved on to more interesting stuff to me, I interact with the whatwg on rare occasions I need to, rarely a pleasant experience, fact is the acc layer implementation stuff does not happen whatwg

[06:58:15.0000] <SteveF_>
at whatwg

[06:58:19.0000] <tantek>
this: "the effects of that earlier phase are still shaping the way we operate today"

[06:58:40.0000] <SteveF_>
nor does the specification of acc layer stuff

[06:59:08.0000] <Ms2ger>
SteveF_, yeah, so it seems

[06:59:41.0000] <Ms2ger>
SteveF_, I haven't followed that, though, so I'm not sure how that's relevant to the HTML 5 PR?

[06:59:53.0000] <tantek>
SteveF - where does specification of acc layer stuff happen that is *not* so political, and instead actually data-driven on helping the most people by creating acc tech that easy *and* reliable for authors to use?

[07:01:47.0000] <SteveF_>
tantek: at w3c in mailing lists, bugs etc, on browser bugs in discussion on irc , the usual

[07:01:59.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: what's the status of javascript.spec.whatwg.org?

[07:02:08.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: are you planning on pushing out an update to align with ES6?

[07:02:45.0000] <tantek>
SteveF - that hasn't been my experience with w3c mailing lists, bugs, etc.

[07:03:28.0000] <SteveF_>
rleevance to PR for me is that i went through the requirements in the aria section of the w3c HTML spec and tested them where there were issues I filed bugs either against browsers or against the spec

[07:03:36.0000] <tantek>
in that way, "longdesc" has served a purpose - it has provided an easy litmus test as to whether someone involved in working on acc layer stuff is being helpful or political.

[07:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: you should have said it on twitter instead

[07:05:09.0000] <SteveF_>
tantek: its all politics, i pick and choose who and which people/lists i interact with

[07:05:29.0000] <SteveF_>
tantek: to get stuff done

[07:05:53.0000] <tantek>
SteveF: "its all politics" <-- and that is why people simply walk away and go to WHATWG, or #indiewebcamp etc.

[07:06:05.0000] <tantek>
some of us don't believe in cultures of "its all politics"

[07:06:21.0000] <SteveF_>
tantek: a poltical statement in itself

[07:06:45.0000] <tantek>
SteveF - note, I didn't say *zero* politics, I am merely pointing out that any "all politics" cultures are basically deadends

[07:07:06.0000] <tantek>
and that implementers will shift to communities with more focus on building, and less focus on politics.

[07:08:30.0000] <SteveF_>
tantek: i work with moz acc engineers to get stuff done and to improve the acc implementation stuff defined and thats why you find people like Marco Zehe disagreeing with the dominant view

[07:08:40.0000] <Ms2ger>
tantek, seems like that might not be the case in a11y

[07:09:14.0000] <Ms2ger>
Anyway, if the people doing the a11y work want to do that at w3c, that seems fine with me

[07:09:53.0000] <Ms2ger>
We should definitely make sure that the whatwg spec matches implementations, though

[07:10:04.0000] <tantek>
Ms2ger - hence my original question of "where does specification of acc layer stuff happen that is *not* so political, and instead actually data-driven " - though I should is is not so *primarily* political.

[07:10:37.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: no bandwidth to pick this up atm, but yeah – it now uses the latest draft as a ref

[07:10:44.0000] <tantek>
Ms2ger - agreed with "if the people doing the a11y work want to do that at w3c, that seems fine with me" - as long as it is features which actually *help* people and are practical for authors.

[07:10:51.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: recently removed some things that have now progressed to the ES draft

[07:10:58.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: can you maybe add a disclaimer somewhere?

[07:11:02.0000] <mathiasbynens>
but there are more

[07:11:05.0000] <jgraham>
It is very unclear to me that "create a specification -> change the specification in incompatible ways to address a11y issues -> try to backport the changes" is going to result in better a11y outcomes than "work together to create a specification with a11y designed in from the start"

[07:11:11.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: yeah all the string stuff has moved iirc

[07:11:24.0000] <SteveF_>
"if the people doing the a11y work" i didn't say that, but i have much more in common with whatwg than others

[07:11:57.0000] <Ms2ger>
SteveF_, sorry, that's how I interpreted what you said about working with Mozilla engineers

[07:12:42.0000] <SteveF_>
Ms2ger: no what i meant is that i don't find w3c a pleasant place to work, just pleasenter than others

[07:12:57.0000] <Ms2ger>
I see

[07:13:20.0000] <Ms2ger>
Where by "others" you also mean whatwg?

[07:13:32.0000] <SteveF_>
and i don't have to spend cycles butting heads with hixie on stuff we can't reach agreement with

[07:13:46.0000] <darobin>
there are other others?

[07:13:47.0000] <darobin>
:)

[07:14:12.0000] <SteveF_>
also its where I can get feedback from acc engineers

[07:15:17.0000] <Ms2ger>
Well, the whatwg spec should eventually end up matching what browsers do, even if Hixie_ doesn't agree

[07:15:35.0000] <Ms2ger>
See: main / picture / style attribute / ...

[07:15:41.0000] <gsnedders>
SteveF_: I think my view is there's nothing wrong with people doing work in the W3C space, even though I think a lot of the policies around stuff like testsuites end up ultimately being detrimental

[07:17:15.0000] <SteveF_>
gsnedders: sure work where you find it most productive, but we could save some time if we work together instead of in a constant state of siege

[07:18:13.0000] <Ms2ger>
SteveF_, I certainly hope nobody disagrees with that sentiment here :)

[07:18:43.0000] <gsnedders>
Ms2ger: FORMAL OBJECTION. Arguments make for more interesting Twitter discussions!

[07:19:16.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me kicks gsnedders 

[07:19:28.0000] <SteveF_>
Ms2ger: the elephant in the room for HTML is that no spec scratches the surface on acc layer implementation, i have been trying to work on that for a while only now is there some traction occuring.

[07:19:30.0000] <Ms2ger>
SteveF_, nobody except gsnedders here* ;)

[07:20:18.0000] <Ms2ger>
SteveF_, that's good to hear

[07:21:11.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah improving the a11y layer implementation seems like good work

[07:21:29.0000] <gsnedders>
(I'm not actually qualified to speak about anything recently, I've scarcely read whatwg or public-html in several years.)

[07:21:45.0000] <gsnedders>
(and I think making statements from how things were years ago probably isn't helpful)

[07:22:20.0000] <SteveF_>
FYI this is the re-start of html specific doc http://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/html-aam/html-aam.html

[07:22:41.0000] <SteveF_>
there is also one being developed for svg and a core/aria spec

[07:23:25.0000] <Ms2ger>
Looks interesting

[07:23:29.0000] <jgraham>
SteveF_: shouldn't that document start "this document *defines*", not "describes"?

[07:23:40.0000] <Ms2ger>
Not that I have expertise to say anything more

[07:24:46.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: probably, feedback welcome! as of now its just a copy of the informative doc i worked on in the past have to get down to editing it more

[07:26:38.0000] <SteveF_>
we are still working out the organization of stuff between the docs

[07:28:57.0000] <SteveF_>
/me been too busy stoking the fires on twitter today to do anything productive

[07:30:06.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: btw would still like to get the acc tests into test repository, but unclear what hoops i need to jump to do so

[07:30:43.0000] <tantek>
never stoke the fires on Twitter

[07:30:43.0000] <SteveF_>
or whether they fit into the scheme

[07:30:49.0000] <gsnedders>
SteveF_: many of them need to be manual, no? afaik the manual test support is still a bit rough

[07:30:54.0000] <gsnedders>
SteveF_: they should totally be there

[07:31:33.0000] <SteveF_>
gsnedders: yes they need to be manual as they require using non automated tool to test

[07:31:43.0000] <gsnedders>
SteveF_: but they do need to be written at a level where a monkey can run them (or at least someone with no knowledge of a11y tools like say screenreaders)

[07:32:20.0000] <SteveF_>
gsnedders: the best i can do for that is to provide detailed instructions and examples

[07:33:30.0000] <SteveF_>
gsnedders: example of test http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/browser-tests/button.html

[07:35:09.0000] <SteveF_>
gsnedders: current instructions here http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/ think they need to be more detailed prescriptive http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/

[07:35:16.0000] <gsnedders>
SteveF_: if you're around in a few hours, ping me then and I'll try and put together a list of what I think needs done

[07:35:19.0000] <jgraham>
SteveF_: If they are something that browsers can run they should be in there. It would be great if we can find a scheme to make them automatable

[07:35:44.0000] <jgraham>
(automated tests have thousands of times the value of non-automated tests)

[07:36:06.0000] <SteveF_>
gsendders: thanks!

[07:36:41.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: i agree and its a laborious task manually testing

[07:36:58.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: but am not aware of any automated method

[07:38:42.0000] <jgraham>
SteveF_: It seems like it should be quite possible — at least for that test — to expose the expectation information in some machine-parsable way. Then the actions required to run the test might be amenable to webdriver and getting the result out might be possible with platform-specific querying of the a11y API

[07:39:05.0000] <jgraham>
So I think with a bit of effort we can make it possible to run these tests in an automated way

[07:40:15.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: i know that you can get a dump of acc tree in chrome, but don't believe that you can do same in FF/IE, will ask moz acc

[07:41:50.0000] <jgraham>
SteveF_: Right, but I guess the platform has APIs for getting at it? I mean these are mappings to the actual platform feature, right? So even if you had to write a native program that queried the tree, it seems like it's possible

[07:42:17.0000] <annevk>
mathiasbynens: you could also ask on Twitter perhaps if there's someone willing to help out

[07:42:40.0000] <jgraham>
It isn't as cross-browser/cross-platform as I would like, but it's not impossible to imagine doing 90% of the work and saying to vendors "if you want to run these tests you ahve to do the last 10% yourselves"

[07:42:54.0000] <SteveF_>
>I mean these are mappings to the actual platform feature, right? yes,

[07:43:17.0000] <SteveF_>
features are mapped to platform apis

[07:43:57.0000] <SteveF_>
am talking with david bolter over on irc://moznet/accessibility

[07:48:39.0000] <gsnedders>
oh, jgraham has just said half of what I was going to say

[07:48:44.0000] <gsnedders>
Typical.

[07:49:08.0000] <annevk>
Was that the other half?

[07:49:32.0000] <gsnedders>
Nah, that was mostly about being more self-documenting

[07:49:44.0000] <gsnedders>
But that's for later when I'm not working

[07:50:47.0000] <wilhelm>
SteveF_: If that can be exposed to WebDriver (or even better: JavaScript) somehow, you're all good.

[07:51:24.0000] <gsnedders>
wilhelm: it can't be to JS, as it has to see over the whole rendered viewport, cross-origin

[07:52:53.0000] <SteveF_>
"davidb:	we currently test our a11y core layer via automated tests but we don't open this up for web content (ripe security attack surface)."

[07:54:34.0000] <darobin>
that's fine

[07:55:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Then the difficult work is already done. Add a hook for WebDriver, and you've got your data.

[07:55:07.0000] <darobin>
I mean, you also don't expose everyone's browser using WebDriver to the open web :)

[07:55:34.0000] <jgraham>
Actually webdriver having access to the a11y tree seems independently good

[07:55:38.0000] <wilhelm>
Yes.

[07:55:42.0000] <darobin>
right

[07:56:05.0000] <darobin>
in fact I would be surprised if it didn't also enable things that aren't obviously a11y related

[07:56:20.0000] <jgraham>
It would allow people to write tests for their content being accessible with a much lower level of expertise than it currently requires

[07:57:45.0000] <wilhelm>
Yeah, you could do "iterate over all elements with an onclick handler, check if they have the appropriate roles set".

[07:58:24.0000] <darobin>
yeah, proper a11y linting would be a pretty damn good idea

[08:00:59.0000] <wilhelm>
The best way to do this, I think, is to work with a browser vendor on prototyping something. WebDriver is easily extended: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/default/webdriver-spec.html#extending-the-protocol

[08:01:12.0000] <wilhelm>
Then we'll have implementation experience enough to put something in the spec.

[08:01:13.0000] <jgraham>
Hahaha

[08:01:22.0000] <wilhelm>
jgraham: Sssh!

[08:01:22.0000] <jgraham>
"webdriver is easily extended"

[08:01:47.0000] <jgraham>
So far no one actually implements that spec :|

[08:02:02.0000] <wilhelm>
Details!

[08:02:15.0000] <wilhelm>
(Says the chair of the WG.)

[08:02:18.0000] <wilhelm>
:P

[08:02:51.0000] <wilhelm>
jgraham: Many, uh, still extend it, though.

[08:03:18.0000] <jgraham>
Heh, well that's true

[08:03:59.0000] <caitp>
why do people believe that email addresses require top level domains in the domain part

[08:04:25.0000] <jgraham>
Certianly on my personal priority list "make an actual spec implementation" is higher than "figure out how to hook into the a11y tree and extend the protocol to support that"

[08:04:37.0000] <annevk>
darobin: hmm, forgot FormData depends on HTMLFormElement

[08:04:38.0000] <wilhelm>
And the spec is less "designing a new thing" and more "consolidating existing implementations".

[08:04:42.0000] <annevk>
darobin: we're doomed

[08:04:48.0000] <jgraham>
But hopefully someone else does both

[08:04:54.0000] <darobin>
annevk: it was just an example :)

[08:04:56.0000] <wilhelm>
jgraham: Different humans can work on different things.

[08:05:12.0000] <darobin>
annevk: but yeah, I know it's non-trivial, and am certainly not claiming that it is

[08:05:50.0000] <gsnedders>
caitp: because practically all those in the real world do

[08:05:51.0000] <jgraham>
wilhelm: I have asked around and apparently I can subcontract my work to as many Trafalgar Square pigeons as I like, but humans are out of the question

[08:06:38.0000] <gsnedders>
well I guess that means any crumbs are cleaned up quickly

[08:08:02.0000] <caitp>
i think the most commonly used email address in the world actually doesn't contain a TLD though :c

[08:08:03.0000] <caitp>
oh well

[08:08:12.0000] <gsnedders>
caitp: really?

[08:08:36.0000] <caitp>
yeah, like root@localhost

[08:09:43.0000] <wilhelm>
jgraham: The humans working on mapping HTML elements<->ARIA roles in browsers should also make their stuff testable.

[08:10:38.0000] <wilhelm>
Other humans can work on actually adhering to the WebDriver spec.

[08:10:57.0000] <gsnedders>
caitp: mhmm, maybe. but quite probably localhost is a special case in terms of those that see much use

[08:12:57.0000] <SteveF_>
willhem: note that ARIA roles are not generally mapped to HTML elements, only in cases where no platform role exists

[08:14:27.0000] <SteveF_>
willhelm: and then usually a string representation is exposed using the APIs standard methods

[08:16:56.0000] <jgraham>
SteveF_: I think the relevant question for WebDriver is "can you go from a reference to a DOM element to a a11y API subtree?"

[08:18:17.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: right, thats what the desktop tool we developed does

[08:19:12.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/aviewer/ (windows only) ;-(

[08:23:08.0000] <jgraham>
SteveF_: Right so Webdriver would presumably have an API like getAccessibilityTree(element) which would return some representation of that tree

[08:23:25.0000] <SteveF_>
jgraham: yes

[08:23:25.0000] <wilhelm>
Yes.

[09:28:37.0000] <Hixie_>
anyone understand https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26871 ?

[09:29:30.0000] <caitp>
> needs-more-info

[11:11:20.0000] <Hixie_>
you know what would be cool

[11:11:29.0000] <Hixie_>
a [Constructor] that returned a promise

[11:15:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: No, that violates what a constructor means.

[11:15:19.0000] <Hixie_>
i don't mean literally a [Constructor]

[11:15:37.0000] <Hixie_>
i mean something so there was a specific syntax to use like  var f = async new Foo();

[11:15:53.0000] <Hixie_>
rather than the current state of the art, factory methods

[11:16:14.0000] <annevk>
asyncnew

[11:18:13.0000] <Domenic>
Unclear why that is better than var f = foo();

[11:18:36.0000] <Hixie_>
why is  var f = new Foo();  better than  var f = foo();  ?

[11:19:04.0000] <Domenic>
because you know that f will have Foo.prototype as its prototype.

[11:19:23.0000] <Hixie_>
i was going to go with "it's not", but ok

[11:19:51.0000] <Hixie_>
given your answer, an async new would be better than a factory method because "you know that the promise's value will have Foo.prototype as its prototype"

[11:20:35.0000] <Domenic>
hmm

[11:20:37.0000] <Hixie_>
but the real reason imho is because it more closely matches the programming mindset

[11:21:26.0000] <boogyman>
conventions change, what's "best practices" today, may not be so in the future.

[11:21:26.0000] <Hixie_>
there's a distinct conceptual difference between "Call a method" and "Call a constructor" which is still a real difference even if the result is delayed

[11:28:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Agree that this is a bit of impedance mismatch from async getting grafted onto JS late.

[11:28:27.0000] <Hixie_>
foolip: ping https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25897

[13:18:36.0000] <Domenic>
Using URLs as IDs, instead of as places to navigate to/download from, seems like a failure historically. (See: XML namespaces.) Do we have any good links on this topic I can point someone to?

[13:26:14.0000] <caitp>
yeah, or when a url is a resource in its own right, whose wacky idea was that

[13:27:19.0000] <TabAtkins>
caitp: I think I know what you're referring to, but can you clarify?

[13:28:48.0000] <caitp>
data-uris

[13:29:37.0000] <caitp>
but really I'm just making fun of the U(niform) in a pretty non-uniform system

[13:30:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
caitp: Oh, data-urls just point to a resource in the akashic record, which can be accessed intrinsically at all times.

[13:31:18.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or the platonic realm of knowledge, if your epistemology leans that way.

[13:31:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
There's just so much *stuff* in the Record that you can't give anything a short name, you've gotta be really specific about precisely which resource you're pointing at.

[14:03:33.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: there's https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Namespace_confusion on namespaces

[14:05:31.0000] <Domenic>
waaaugh mixed content

[14:05:53.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: if you're not logged in there's some problem with cached content

[14:06:12.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: GPHemsley can fix it I think, or maybe provide you with access to the wiki so you can fix it if he doesn't have the time

karlcow: ping GPHemsley

[14:12:04.0000] <annevk>
oh wow, MediaWiki uses getPreventDefault()

[14:12:34.0000] <annevk>
there's a whole bunch of annoying warnings from MediaWiki

[14:12:40.0000] <annevk>
sad sad sad

[14:23:51.0000] <Hixie_>
getPreventDefault?

[14:28:32.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie_, an alias for defaultPrevented

[14:28:44.0000] <Hixie_>
nice

[14:40:52.0000] <caitp>
i assume it was added in gecko before defaultPrevented ever existed, but that's kind of a weird name for it :x

[15:44:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: Weird, http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=3188 seems to transfer the overflow from inside the <iframe> to the outer page in Chrome.

[15:45:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
As does http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=3185

[15:45:22.0000] <Hixie_>
"transfer"?

[15:45:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
I assume this is a bug on Chrome's part.

[15:45:42.0000] <Hixie_>
oh wow

[15:45:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
The amount that the iframe document overflows the initial canvas, the outer document treats itself as overflowing as well.

[15:45:53.0000] <Hixie_>
i'm not seeing that

[15:45:58.0000] <Hixie_>
but i am seeing 0,0 not being at 0,0

[15:46:18.0000] <Hixie_>
oh i see it's rtl

[15:46:29.0000] <TabAtkins>
You're seeing it in the top-left corner of the portion fo the iframe that's originally rendered (before scrolling), yes?

[15:46:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[15:46:37.0000] <Hixie_>
what version are you in? i don't see what you describe

[15:46:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
Let's see...

[15:46:46.0000] <Hixie_>
i'm on 39.0.2150.5 dev

[15:46:51.0000] <Hixie_>
have a pending update

[15:46:56.0000] <Hixie_>
then again i also have a pending OS update

[15:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
37 stable

[15:47:11.0000] <Hixie_>
maybe it's fixed?

[15:47:14.0000] <Hixie_>
try dev

[15:47:14.0000] <TabAtkins>
Maybe!

[15:47:27.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can't easily do that, since I'm on my pixel. ^_^

[15:50:11.0000] <Hixie_>
set your device to dev mode :-)

[15:50:40.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nope, ChromeOS ships updates that break Crouton enough that I've had to stay on Stable permanently.

[15:50:50.0000] <TabAtkins>
(They usually fix it before it goes Stable.)

[15:51:16.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can't have my primary work laptop breaking on me every 6 weeks. :/

[15:52:22.0000] <tantek>
two primary work laptops then?

[15:52:35.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: I have three, but only one is "primary".

[15:52:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
By definition. ^_^

[15:52:46.0000] <Hixie_>
maybe use a different OS :-P

[15:52:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: Nah, I like ChromeOS.

[15:53:37.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - if they're all tethered to the same cloud identity, how is any of them primary? ;)

[15:53:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, preliminary twitter results suggest that 38 still has the issue.

[15:53:54.0000] <tantek>
Perhaps name them like borg? 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3.

[15:54:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: Only one is actually usable as a work laptop - the other two are just for things I need Corp authentication for. ^_^

[15:54:25.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: it's acting as i expect on 39, but i don't really know if i'm understanding it right. Want a screenshot?

[15:54:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure.

[15:55:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's really just "is there a big horizontal scrollbar on the outer page?"

[15:56:22.0000] <Hixie_>
ah, yes, there's a scrollbar there

[15:56:28.0000] <Hixie_>
i was thinking you meant inside the iframe

[15:56:30.0000] <Hixie_>
that's crazy

[15:56:32.0000] <Hixie_>
i wonder what's up with that

[15:57:39.0000] <TabAtkins>
We're incorrectly calculating the size of the iframe when figuring out page scrollbars, assuming that its overflow is visible.

[15:58:27.0000] <TabAtkins>
And setting 'overflow' isn't doing anything, hm.

[15:58:32.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyway, I'll reduce and report.

[16:07:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: Oh, it's your new "innerHTML View" pane that's causing it.

[16:08:02.0000] <Hixie_>
new?

[16:08:21.0000] <Hixie_>
that hasn't changed in, like, a decade

[16:08:36.0000] <Hixie_>
but yeah, looks like you're right

[16:08:50.0000] <Hixie_>
that makes me feel better :-)

[16:09:01.0000] <Hixie_>
still a bug, though

[16:09:07.0000] <Hixie_>
display:none should make the overflow go away

[16:09:23.0000] <Hixie_>
(though maybe i make it height:0 and not display:none?)

[16:09:25.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: Huh, I never even knew it existed, I guess. ^_^

[16:09:44.0000] <Hixie_>
ah, it's just height:0 visibility:hidden

[16:09:46.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, you do height:0 for some reason

[16:09:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's a weird way to hide things, dude.

[16:10:08.0000] <Hixie_>
i think it's because in old browsers hiding the iframe with display:none would kill the browsing context

[16:10:19.0000] <Hixie_>
and i use the same styles for everything

[16:10:38.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah.

[16:10:48.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, fix please. ^^_

[16:11:03.0000] <Hixie_>
i will add that to my todo list prioritised appropriately :-)

[16:12:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
All you gotta do is add a "pre.hidden { display: none; }" to the stylesheet!


2014-09-23
[18:44:54.0000] <TabAtkins>
WHY IS IT SO DAMNED ADDICTING TO DRIVE THIS PROFILE DOWN???

[18:45:15.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just spent 10 minutes shaving off .15%, because I knew it was there and it was annoying me.

[18:50:28.0000] <tantek>
sounds like well designed gamification

[18:56:20.0000] <TabAtkins>
It is. Making numbers smaller is so much fun!

[18:56:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
Especially when, after a change, the number is so small the box disappears from the profile completely.

[23:57:19.0000] <annevk>
mounir: screen.orientation seems undefined

[00:08:42.0000] <annevk>
Anyone here run Chrome stable? Would still like to know what http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=3191 does

[00:33:12.0000] <zcorpan>
SimonSapin: also test quirks mode for the font size thing

[00:35:38.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i have opera next 24 which is like chrome 37, which says Uncaught ReferenceError: TextDecoder is not defined on line 1

[00:36:06.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: oh, that's even worse

[00:37:15.0000] <zcorpan>
SimonSapin: and monospace

[00:38:29.0000] <zcorpan>
SimonSapin: and non-16px default font size

[00:39:50.0000] <zcorpan>
i recall there being something funny in that area when writing the quirks spec (although i didn't specify the quirk)

[01:14:17.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: JakeA: is creating a tee synchronously acceptable?

[01:14:33.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: JakeA: that's what we require with clone()...

[01:16:21.0000] <JakeA>
Good question

[01:17:03.0000] <JakeA>
I guess it depends on what's synchronously available on the stream. It isn't a problem with the Request/Response API as it currently stands

[01:18:49.0000] <annevk>
Yeah, I remember Domenic saying that reading from a stream could be synchronous...

[01:20:33.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: you must love that bug

[01:20:59.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: the response to utf-8 advocacy end of 2003 is fun

[01:21:13.0000] <annevk>
"lol That would be a good solution :) I personnaly use the iso-8859-15 charset which is a slight improvement of iso-8859-1 ..."

[01:29:15.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: whoa. I didn't even notice that comment.

[01:49:49.0000] <SimonSapin>
TabAtkins: what profiler do you use?

[01:56:03.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: I get "[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/tmp/spec'" these days for our Makefile; Apple apparently requires root for that now

[01:56:13.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: can we make that work in some other way?

[02:04:47.0000] <Ms2ger>
Will look later

[02:53:38.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: lazy Python help request; is there a better way to do this:

[02:53:44.0000] <annevk>
id = re.match(r"^/tools/test.py\?from=\d+&to=(\d+)$", os.environ["REQUEST_URI"])

[02:53:44.0000] <annevk>
print id.group(1)

[03:15:43.0000] <annevk>
well it works, that's enough for me

[03:40:39.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: too much success: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/loop/content/shared/libs/sdk.js#9210

[03:41:08.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should file a bug not to ship that stuff with Loop and to use built-in stuff

[03:42:47.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: copy from mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/loop/content/shared/libs/sdk.js#9210

[03:43:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: sorry, copy from jsbell's work

[03:43:12.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: so they could just use TextDecoder / TextEncoder

[03:44:51.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I think Firefox OS had a similar problem

[03:45:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: but that doesn't appear on mxr

[03:46:39.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: is there a bug on mxr not using TLS?

[03:46:53.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: hmm, make that HSTS

[03:48:41.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: dunno. There are random hostnames under mozilla.org that break with https, so at least includeSubdomains on mozilla.org is infeasible for the time being

[03:49:26.0000] <annevk>
I guess I'll just assume someone else is trying to make it work

[03:49:50.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: if you want I can file a bug on Loop, no big deal

[03:50:04.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I filed one already

[03:50:17.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I CCed you

[03:50:27.0000] <annevk>
cool

[03:50:29.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: annevk fwiw now, today I will set up a redirect of that dvcs.w3.org url to the current whatwg spec (and same for any other stale dvcs.w3.org URLs). but can't til I'm back home

[03:51:31.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: interesting turn of events. Thanks.

[03:52:40.0000] <annevk>
What URLs are we talking about? I must have missed something

[03:53:33.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: the gecko code comment in hsivonen's mxr link

[03:54:31.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: ah okay, it seems to redirect a bit already

[03:55:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ah ok

[04:09:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw a week or so back, I already set up such a redirect for the d

[04:09:19.0000] <GPHemsley>
it's more than "a bit"... but it's an HTML redirect

[04:09:45.0000] <MikeSmith>
...old dvcs.w3.org draft of the URL spec

[04:12:33.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: also btw as far as I know the Director has no blanket objection to normative references to whatwg drafts

[04:13:16.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: so what is the problem then?

[04:16:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: well sorry to be coy but I just think it's just worth knowing that the problem could be something other than that

[04:19:10.0000] <MikeSmith>
if somebody were to ask the Director directly maybe that could help to clear things up some

[04:19:33.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe Domenic could ask for some clarification about it at the TAG f2f

[04:55:52.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: your mxr find gave me an idea

[04:55:53.0000] <annevk>
https://github.com/search?q=encoding.spec.whatwg.org

[04:55:57.0000] <annevk>
there's a lot of hits

[05:59:51.0000] <darobin>
does the SVG on https://whatwg.org/ *have* to be embedded with <object>?

[05:59:58.0000] <darobin>
I mean seriously, who does that

[06:00:07.0000] <darobin>
poor little harmless SVG

[06:03:50.0000] <gsnedders>
darobin: Hixie_

[06:04:46.0000] <darobin>
gsnedders: I'm shocked

[06:04:54.0000] <darobin>
it's almost like torturing kittens or something

[06:05:14.0000] <mathiasbynens>
annevk: use quotes https://github.com/search?q="encoding.spec.whatwg.org"&type=Code

[06:05:56.0000] <zcorpan>
darobin: what's wrong with <object>?

[06:06:16.0000] <darobin>
zcorpan: it's eeeeeeevil

[06:06:31.0000] <darobin>
it bullied me when I was little

[06:06:43.0000] <zcorpan>
poor darobin

[06:07:24.0000] <darobin>
/me sniffles, nods

[06:08:38.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess the <img> is also downloaded though

[06:19:11.0000] <annevk>
if you embed SVG through <object>, I'd guess the problem is that you create a browsing context rather than an image

[06:19:22.0000] <annevk>
i.e. bloat

[06:24:39.0000] <zcorpan>
time to switch to the <img src=png srcset=svg> hack

[06:26:44.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: JakeA yes sync tee is no problem

[06:32:44.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, making https://images.whatwg.org/abstract.png in svg means having a jpg in a data: URL, right? at least if it should work in <img>

[06:33:11.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: how can Mozilla work without original iso-8859-1? HTTP requires it...

[06:33:26.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I guess we simply do byte manipulation there?

[06:34:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: yes

[06:35:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: thx

[06:44:18.0000] <JakeA>
Domenic: \o/

[06:47:18.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: did you see my cache mode update to Fetch?

[06:47:51.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: Domenic: if you could review Fetch's cache mode update that'd be great, if it's fine I'll add the corresponding API

[06:54:02.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: looking now

[07:07:54.0000] <Domenic>
Will look at

[07:19:43.0000] <zcorpan>
ok so what needs updating with the kitchensink? xbl -> web components, dom core/dom events -> dom, uri/iri -> url

[07:19:56.0000] <zcorpan>
(is web components above html?)

[07:24:49.0000] <SimonSapin>
zcorpan: how much should CSSOM serialization preserve the origin form of things? E.g. keywords instead of the equivalent numerical value (when there is one)

[07:25:58.0000] <hemanth>
/me did a talk on generators at JSChannel :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrgEZykBHVo 

[07:27:13.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Components is surely alongside it?

[07:31:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Components should be wrapping all around it, clearly

[07:31:13.0000] <Ms2ger>
And superimposing itself on everything else

[07:31:28.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: part of, eventually

[07:31:51.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: ECMAScript -> JavaScript

[07:31:58.0000] <jgraham>
Something, something, webcomponents describing itself, something, inception, something

[07:32:19.0000] <jgraham>
JavaScript™

[07:32:49.0000] <gsnedders>
®, please!

[07:35:29.0000] <zcorpan>
SimonSapin: does http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#serialize-a-css-component-value answer your question?

[07:35:29.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: Notifications / Fullscreen / Sensor APIs?

[07:35:47.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: GIF / PNG

[07:36:44.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: can you give me ascii art for what it should say where? :-)

[07:36:59.0000] <SimonSapin>
zcorpan: not really. It’s rather, should "parse a declaration" preserve the original component values, or some approximation?

[07:37:09.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: Btw, developers I've asked would expect fetch('/foo') to include cookies

[07:37:16.0000] <SimonSapin>
parse+serialize

[07:37:28.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: and still pull faces after I explain why it doesn't

[07:37:44.0000] <SimonSapin>
or can it do anything, as long as it preserves property-specific semantics?

[07:39:09.0000] <zcorpan>
SimonSapin: i haven't studied serialization in detail. i know the spec has bugs. so i'm not sure. my guess is that you don't need to preserve the original component values

[07:39:35.0000] <zcorpan>
SimonSapin: e.g. for <color> you don't roundtrip keywords

[07:40:19.0000] <gsnedders>
my memory of this stuff is web compat constraints are behind UA sniffing

[07:40:57.0000] <SimonSapin>
gsnedders: what does that mean?

[07:41:16.0000] <jgraham>
SimonSapin: "servo is screwed"

[07:41:48.0000] <zcorpan>
SimonSapin: it can't do anything that preserves semantics, you have to follow the serialization rules (insofar they aren't wrong)

[07:41:50.0000] <SimonSapin>
thanks jgraham for your usual optimism :)

[07:41:52.0000] <gsnedders>
SimonSapin: if your UA string claims you're IE, the expected answer is "rgb(255, 255, 255)"; if you're Firefox, the expected answer is "black"; if you're Chrome, the expected answer is "rgba(255,255,255,1)"

[07:42:17.0000] <jgraham>
But of course UA string isn't the only way of doing UA sniffing

[07:42:56.0000] <gsnedders>
SimonSapin: what's so wut? did you forget to leave your sense of logic at the door?

[07:43:29.0000] <SimonSapin>
my mistake :)

[07:43:45.0000] <jgraham>
It's a pity that people didn't parse the results and convert to a canonical form rather than UA sniff :(

[07:44:04.0000] <gsnedders>
speaking of which, has anyone done anything about Error.stack and UA-dependent expectations there?

[07:46:53.0000] <SimonSapin>
gsnedders: was that for computed or specified values?

[07:48:40.0000] <gsnedders>
SimonSapin: computed, I think

annevk: ok, https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/514425450194411520 suggests developers don't really know what to expect re cookies

[07:56:15.0000] <Ms2ger>
That they're delicious delicacies!

annevk: Chrome stable for 3191 is Uncaught TypeError: Failed to construct 'TextDecoder': The encoding label provided ('hz-gb-2312') is invalid.

[08:13:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
SimonSapin: Just cProfile, piped through gprof2dot.  `bikeshed profile` generates a profile for you now, if you've got the right stuff installed (documented in its help info).

[08:14:15.0000] <SimonSapin>
cool

[08:14:36.0000] <SimonSapin>
I also like xdot, for browsing gprof2dot output

[08:15:15.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: thanks, I guess I'd need to write a standalone test for hz-gb-2312 if I really wanted to know whether it was gone

[08:16:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
SimonSapin: Yeah, thought about doing that, but with --root and --leaf I have enough control so far that it's not overwhelming.

[08:16:39.0000] <SimonSapin>
TabAtkins: what are these?

[08:16:40.0000] <TabAtkins>
Kinda wanna PR gprof2dot to allow you to exclude subtrees, so I can drop everything below the html5lib entrypoint. That's about half the nodes on the graph.

[08:17:30.0000] <TabAtkins>
--root specifies which node you want to display as root; trims everything without it as ancestor, and everything above it. --leaf specifies that you only want to see call chains that bottom out in the specified node.

what's the state of the art accessibility best practice for svg (for https://images.whatwg.org/abstract.png ) ?

[12:06:33.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: seems better to provide it in alt=?

[12:09:43.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: yes, maybe so

[12:19:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3200

[12:35:42.0000] <zcorpan>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3201

[12:36:17.0000] <Hixie_>
SVG and MathML at this point should be in the top box

[12:37:06.0000] <Hixie_>
also you should add some more things

[12:37:08.0000] <Hixie_>
WebIDL

[12:37:26.0000] <Hixie_>
JPEG (on the side)

[12:37:32.0000] <Hixie_>
GIF, PNG

[12:37:41.0000] <Hixie_>
Encodings (below)

[12:37:51.0000] <Hixie_>
CSP (side)

[12:38:08.0000] <Hixie_>

Hixie_: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3202

[12:43:14.0000] <Hixie_>
nice

[12:43:16.0000] <zcorpan>
oops forgot webidl

[12:43:40.0000] <caitp>
kitchen sink is getting pretty full there

[12:43:59.0000] <Hixie_>
caitp: i think you may have misread the diagram

[12:44:08.0000] <Hixie_>
the sink hasn't changed here

[12:44:20.0000] <caitp>
it must be rendering very wrong here on netsurf

[12:46:11.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie_: ok http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3203

[12:50:04.0000] <zcorpan>
caitp: i tried installing netsurf and opened the link. it didn't run the script in live-dom-viewer it seems. then i tried pasting the svg into the textarea, and netsurf crashed

[12:50:25.0000] <caitp>
i would be very surprised if netsurf ran it

[12:50:54.0000] <caitp>
misread jokes compounded by other misread jokes

[12:50:55.0000] <caitp>

[12:51:07.0000] <caitp>
humour on IRC is hard because you really can't hear the tone of voice

[12:51:43.0000] <caitp>
it takes dedication and practice to figure out when someone is being genuine in their remarks

[12:53:38.0000] <zcorpan>
well, it was fun trying a new browser that seems to be about as useful as netscape 4

[12:54:34.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe next i should try servo

[12:59:36.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie_: should i file a bug about the image?

[13:09:20.0000] <Ms2ger>
zcorpan, do try servo, and expect cssom tests from jdm :)

[13:09:25.0000] <Domenic>
Can we moderate L2L

[13:11:22.0000] <Hixie_>
zcorpan: sure

[13:12:20.0000] <Hixie_>
Domenic: on it

[13:14:18.0000] <caitp>
what has he been doing? i've only seen him on es-discuss

[13:14:27.0000] <Hixie_>
he posted to the whatwg list and his posts are incoherent

[13:15:01.0000] <Domenic>
he's on all the lists -_-

[13:15:24.0000] <caitp>
well look at that, he cares about the state of the web and such

[13:15:30.0000] <caitp>
enough to participate in all the lists

[13:16:03.0000] <Hixie_>
so....... how do i clear the STS headers of a web site in safari or firefox?

[13:16:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie_: the new image is 2x for the bitmap part and the bitmap is base64-encoded, yet the image is almost half the size of the old png version :-)

[13:16:18.0000] <Hixie_>
zcorpan: wow

[13:18:07.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: https://domparsing.spec.whatwg.org/ can redirect to https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/innerhtml/raw-file/tip/index.html

[13:18:23.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: seems like we have nobody that is interested in maintaining it and Travis is actually doing an okay job

[13:18:34.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: bit unfortunate about the loss of CC0, but so be it I guess

[13:18:39.0000] <Ms2ger>
I'll update the git repo with something tomorrow

[13:19:03.0000] <Hixie_>
cool, ok

[13:19:05.0000] <annevk>
ta

[13:19:30.0000] <tantek>
annevk: wait what? did we lose a whatwg editor resource so the work needs to be picked up by W3C?

[13:19:59.0000] <Ms2ger>
tantek, more like the whatwg editor admitted to himself he wasn't going to have time for it

[13:20:08.0000] <tantek>
Ms2ger - perfectly reasonable.

[13:20:10.0000] <zcorpan>
shouldn't we fork travis' spec?

[13:20:16.0000] <Hixie_>

I have ban power here, don't I?

[13:20:35.0000] <zcorpan>
:-)

[13:20:38.0000] <Hixie_>
banning bad too!

[13:20:47.0000] <Hixie_>
damnit, zcorpan tricked me

[13:20:48.0000] <Ms2ger>
Pah

[13:20:56.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me withholds chocolate

[13:21:12.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: hey!

[13:21:25.0000] <Hixie_>
ffs, dreamhost

[13:21:32.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie_, see, that works better :)

[13:21:50.0000] <Hixie_>
you can set an http:// url to redirect, but setting an https:// redirect requires that you actually do full hosting then do the .htaccess thing

[13:22:03.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: can you make domparsing redirect on your end

[13:22:04.0000] <zcorpan>
withholding chocolate bad

[13:22:08.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: i've done it for http://

[13:22:11.0000] <Hixie_>
and am updating specs.

[13:23:18.0000] <tantek>
isn't there a meta tag for that? ;)

[13:24:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: Mind banning L2L from the whatwg lists?  He's a persistent and crazy troll in all the other standards lists.

[13:25:00.0000] <Hixie_>
his mod bit has already been set and i've already contacted him privately

[13:25:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk, cool

[14:13:56.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: in my experience if you make the http one a redirect, the https one redirects too

[14:14:21.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: not sure how that works

[14:17:35.0000] <annevk>
Will make it work tomorrow either way

[15:02:47.0000] <caitp>
"Specifying a character set early for your HTML documents allows the browser to begin executing scripts immediately." is this actually true? surely the browser doesn't wait for the entire document to arrive before trying to guess the encoding

[15:03:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
caitp: No, it wait for 1024 bytes to arrive.

[15:03:34.0000] <caitp>
that seems more likely

[15:04:05.0000] <caitp>
but the first 1024 bytes of the packet are probably going to arrive in the very first packet anyways, so it seems like it wouldn't make much difference latency-wise

[15:04:07.0000] <willchan>
caitp: https://code.google.com/p/page-speed/wiki/SpecifyCharsetEarly

[15:05:01.0000] <caitp>
cool thanks

Domenic: Some more improvements to Bikeshed's handling of IDL stuff and particularly those [[HiddenField]] things.

[15:14:38.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: I already told you that Bikeshed lets you escape [[foo]], Markdown style, as \[[foo]].

[15:15:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Now, if you're using the IDL shortcut link syntax, you don't even need to do that: {{[[foo]]}} looks terrible, but it's a straightforward application of the syntax to the term you want to link. ^_^

[15:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Is there a term for "the interval between two rAF checkpoints"?

[15:51:02.0000] <zewt>
cool. restarted chrome and it decided to only restore tabs from one window out of three

[15:51:09.0000] <zewt>
history diggin' time

[15:58:26.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: "page refresh period"? dunno, but one day there probably will be. it's variable, of course.

[15:58:56.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: the http ones _all_ redirect for http, and none of the https ones do...

[15:59:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: Yeah, that's fine.  We just want to be able to only fire a single animation iteration event per "frame", but "frame" isn't a meaningful term.

[15:59:50.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: oh i think the solution for that is probably to be called as part of the event loop page rendering thing we'll be adding

[16:00:05.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: i can give you a flag if the page will be getting rAF or whatever

[16:00:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie_: No need to hook into the guts of an algorithm, just want some simple way to say "UAs must not fire more than one iteration event per element per animation per "frame". "

[16:01:03.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: that's fire for a "must not" but presumably you also want a "must" that actually fires it

[16:01:10.0000] <Hixie_>
TabAtkins: and that must needs to say when it's fired, etc

[16:01:19.0000] <Hixie_>
especially relative to rAF, tasks, microtasks, etc

[16:01:40.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, the animations spec is already attempting to hook into rAF for *when* to fire things.

[16:01:52.0000] <TabAtkins>
WebAnim, that is.

[16:02:36.0000] <Hixie_>
well if it hooks into when, you don't need a when not

[16:03:49.0000] <birtles>
(that part of the WebAnim spec is pretty awkward/hand-wavy at the moment)

[16:04:19.0000] <Hixie_>
hopefully i'll have the hooks for that done in a few weeks

[16:05:13.0000] <birtles>
that'd be great

annevk: FYI about the spoofing-https-URLs-and-lock-icon thing in the address bar in Firefox mobile, it turns out there was already a bug open

[18:05:36.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=605206#c41

[18:05:59.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: though it's already been wontfixed

[18:07:50.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: Mark Finkle is defending the decision to show the title contents in the address bar, but I respectfully disagree. Please comment there if you have anything to add

[18:08:46.0000] <MikeSmith>
tantek: also take a look at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=605206#c41 please if you have a chance and have any opinion

[18:26:20.0000] <tantek>
MikeSmith crap that's a long bug thread

[18:30:27.0000] <tantek>
I'm not sure how to productively contribute. I'm for showing the URL obviously :/

[18:42:34.0000] <MikeSmith>
tantek: yeah I'm kinda surprised nobody who works more specifically on web security stuff has commented on that bug yet

[18:42:57.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems fairly clear to me that UX is an accident waiting to happen

[18:43:03.0000] <tantek>
Agreed.

[18:43:15.0000] <tantek>
What do latest mobile Chrome and mobile Safari do?

[18:43:22.0000] <tantek>
maybe document those with screenshots?

[18:44:19.0000] <MikeSmith>
they show the URL and don't show the favicon in the address bar

[18:45:28.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess it could help to add screenshots for those, but several of the commenters have already pointed it out and it seems like everybody already realizes that Firefox mobile is the only major browser that's showing the title there

[22:23:13.0000] <MikeSmith>
reading https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/463#issuecomment-56614984

[22:23:43.0000] <MikeSmith>
"The basic issue is that there are caches in Blink which we need to verify are cleared between navigations through different sites which are controlled. A SW which can respond for a font (e.g.), populate a cache, and which might be naively reused on another origin rendering in the same renderer process is Bad News (TM)."

[22:28:58.0000] <MikeSmith>
still not clear to me at least why that's a critical enough problem to block shipping onfetch

[22:29:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
also not clear if there's a plan to fix the problem

[23:03:50.0000] <slightlyoff>
it's not "blocking", it's delaying

[23:03:54.0000] <slightlyoff>
by one release

[23:03:57.0000] <slightlyoff>
(6 weeks)

[23:04:23.0000] <slightlyoff>
and yes, we know how to remediate, but we're being cautious given the incredible power of the feature.

[23:04:59.0000] <MikeSmith>
slightlyoff: ah ok

[23:05:17.0000] <MikeSmith>
didn't know it was just one release

[23:05:26.0000] <slightlyoff>
yeah, apologies for a lack of clarity

[23:05:41.0000] <slightlyoff>
catching the next train out of the station

[23:10:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
no worries

[23:27:26.0000] <terinjokes>
initial 3 issues in

[23:27:56.0000] <terinjokes>
filling in the rest of the console interface stubs now

[23:40:31.0000] <MikeSmith>
terinjokes: you're working on a spec for console I guess?

[23:41:18.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I expected to find ISO-8859-1 use in the HTTP impl, but didn't find any

[23:42:12.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: note that there's https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Guide/Internal_strings?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=XPCOM_string_guide#UTF-16_to_ASCII_converters

[23:42:36.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I saw mailnews core use that in a way that relied on the implementation details...

[23:59:26.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: I guess those are used then

[23:59:33.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: how can you rely on the details?

[00:00:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: oh wait, utf-16-to-ascii, is it effectively iso-8859-1?

[00:53:32.0000] <annevk>
I like how the new URL for HTML is much shorter

[00:54:57.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: I added a redirect through .htaccess. But e.g. https://anolis.quuz.org/ is a redirect I configured through the panel. Maybe the trick is to configure secure hosting after you configure the redirect? Might not be worth the effort at this point though.

[01:04:08.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: "lossy" means throw away the most significant byte and hope it was zero

[01:04:54.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: o_O

[01:05:59.0000] <hsivonen>
well, you are supposed to do that only when you *know* it's zero

[01:06:15.0000] <annevk>
So "ASCII to UTF-16 converters" would make perfect sense for HTTP

[01:06:19.0000] <annevk>
And ByteString

[01:06:31.0000] <annevk>
"UTF-16 to ASCII converters", not so much

[01:13:54.0000] <hsivonen>
the XPCOM string conversions from "ASCII" are actually conversions from de jure ISO-8859-1: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/string/nsUTF8Utils.h#651

[01:15:20.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, XPCOM strings allow you to convert between valid UTF-8 and UTF-16 on one hand and allow you to do zero-fillingly inflate from bytes to UTF-16 code units and allow you to discard the high byte of UTF-16 code units

[01:23:39.0000] <annevk>
http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-ByteString is already defined without iso-8859-1, so I guess it's just HTTP that needs fixing somehow

[01:32:30.0000] <Ms2ger>
Ugh, http://w3c-test.org/resource-timing/test_resource_timing.html is such a mess

[01:33:53.0000] <annevk>
Hixie_: https://validator.whatwg.org/ has mixed content; posting to validator.nu is also going to be a problem in Chrome I believe as validator.nu is not using TLS

[01:36:04.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: would you like me to make validator.nu available via opt-in TLS before I'm ready to make http redirect to https?

[01:36:31.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: it might be good if we want to get validator.whatwg.org without mixed content warnings

[01:37:13.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I guess I should get a wildcard

[01:37:43.0000] <hsivonen>
should not have gone crazy with host names before realizing that one day host names cost money, too

[01:37:52.0000] <annevk>
Hmm, the WHATWG FAQ contains stuff about polyglot...

[01:38:28.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: if you validate yourself with StartSSL you can issue certificates that last for 2 years for about a year

[01:39:07.0000] <hsivonen>
certs that last 2 years are not cool esp. with the SHA-1 on the horizon

[01:39:19.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: it's a SHA-256 cert

[01:39:20.0000] <hsivonen>
does StartSSL have SHA-2 certs yet?

[01:39:34.0000] <annevk>
they still need to update their intermediate cert

[01:39:38.0000] <annevk>
afaict

[01:40:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I need to figure out if I should get a bunch of single-host certs or a wildcard

[01:40:17.0000] <hsivonen>
and if I should use StartSSL, Gandi or sslmate

[01:41:04.0000] <hsivonen>
for wildcards, StartSSL pricing is attractive

[01:41:28.0000] <hsivonen>
for single-host certs, both Gandi and sllmate are cheaper than a revocation at StartSSL

[01:42:22.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: you could also get a single cert covering hsivonen.fi, validator.nu, about.validator.nu...

[01:43:06.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: for a reasonable price, only from StartSSL

[01:43:06.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: see e.g. Alt Name field of https://testsuite.org/

[01:43:16.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: yes

[01:43:38.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: and then if you have to revoke, it's still cheap compared to all the other options afaict

[01:43:58.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: that was my thinking in the wildcard case

[01:44:12.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: note that you can combine wildcard and Alt Name

[01:44:51.0000] <hsivonen>
I need to test terminating SSL on a different VM than the one that runs validator.nu

[01:45:19.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't want the key for hsivonen.fi on the VM that runs validator.nu. especially not on the VM that runs bugzilla.validator.nu

[01:46:10.0000] <annevk>
Anyone interested in figuring out where these two emails are on the W3C archives of the WHATWG? https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#The_.3Ctime.3E_element_should_allow_vague_times_.28.22March.22.29_and_times_from_ancient_history_to_be_marked_up

[02:14:05.0000] <jgraham>
I'm pretty sure the current dev.platform conversation about image-rendering is a case study in the problems with having multiple CSS levels rather than a single document that's always as up-to-date as possible

[04:31:57.0000] <hsivonen>
Is 。(IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) used only in Japanese or is it also used for something in Chinese or Korean?

[04:40:44.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: for Chinese as well but not Korean afaik

[04:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: thanks

[04:43:31.0000] <annevk>
It's used by IDNA...

[04:43:52.0000] <annevk>
Well, IDNA2003 and now UTR #46

[04:44:51.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how likely it is for a Japanese-language email to be Kanji-only with no Hiragana or Katakana

[04:45:22.0000] <hsivonen>
looking at Japanese texts in general, any non-trivial paragraph seems to include some kana

[04:52:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: Yeah. it's very unlikely to contain no hiragana. e.g., the verb inflections are all hiragana, and all the prepositions -- of, on, etc.

[04:56:20.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok. I intend to try to persuade the Thunderbird folks to get rid of outgoing encoding UI

[04:57:12.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't have my hopes high, but I feel that every time I bring a problem to them and the problem could be avoided by using UTF-8, I should nag them about it

[04:57:28.0000] <hsivonen>
but there's always Japanese and ISO-2022-JP

[04:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so this time, I'm going to suggest a mechanism that only ever outputs UTF-8 or ISO-2022-JP

[04:58:10.0000] <hsivonen>
and tries the latter if there's kana

[04:59:41.0000] <hsivonen>
so now it looks like I need to edit Web Platform Tests in order to land a Gecko patch to comply with a spec

[04:59:44.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh

[05:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I mean, yay, for Web Platform Tests

[05:00:06.0000] <hsivonen>
but boo HZ

[05:14:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
why ever output ISO-2022-JP?

[05:15:15.0000] <MikeSmith>
and why in particular if there's kana?

[05:15:25.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ↑

[05:29:53.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: lore says that there's doom and gloom is you use a non-ISO-2022-JP encoding for email in Japan, due to email clients on popular feature phones

[05:30:31.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I think that situation has changed considerably in the last 5 years or so

[05:30:35.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: apparently Apple change Mail.app to always send UTF-8 in Mavericks and this bothered users in Japan enough that someone developed a hack that restores the ability to send ISO-2022-JP

[05:31:25.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I think the majority of users here now have iphones and android mobiles just like everywhere else

[05:31:27.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I'm going with Google Translate, but you can check out the source: http://sourceforge.jp/projects/letter-fix/

[05:31:36.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me reads

[05:31:53.0000] <darobin>
I didn't even know they still had popular feature phones in Japan

[05:32:30.0000] <hsivonen>
darobin: as noted "lore says", but the LetterFix thing adds credibitily to the lore, unfortunately

[05:34:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I think the existence of software like that doesn't imply there's necessarily actually a compelling current need for it

[05:34:37.0000] <darobin>
hsivonen: agreed, and sadly the project seems to be getting 15-20k page views per month, which seems really high for SourceForge

[05:34:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
this reminds me of the situation of proliferation of half-width kana here when in fact there's no real need for it

[05:36:10.0000] <MikeSmith>
there's culturally this kind of fetishistic thing here to cling to quaint old technology way past the time when it's obsolete except mostly in the geek culture

[05:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: do you use UTF-8 for your outgoing Japanese-language email?

[05:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: anyway I recommend talking with Nakano-san and emk if you haven't yet

[05:37:13.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I got the URL from emk, IIRC

[05:37:19.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah ak

[05:37:55.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yeah I just UTF-8 for outgoing mail in normal clients

[05:38:05.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok

[05:38:24.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, I don't know how real the ISO-2022-JP need it, but it's perceived as a need for sure

[05:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and of course many people here are just using gmail, and there's been no big problems related to people receiving that

[05:39:05.0000] <hsivonen>
If catering to the perception allows for UTF-8 for everything else, that's a good deal from my perspective

[05:39:28.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[05:39:29.0000] <hsivonen>
since then I don't need to debate ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-9, TIS-620 and Big5

[05:40:18.0000] <hsivonen>
did gmail go UTF-8-only already for outgoing? I thought they hadn't.

[05:41:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: well as I think you know the main problem case of mail clients that can't handle UTF-8 is with software running on old keitai (non-smartphone) mobiles (which are actually quite a bit more powerful than "feature phones" elsewhere, but anyway...)

[05:42:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't know what gmail is doing. I guess I should

[05:43:12.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: anyway I know for a fact that some mobile operators are using gateways that do transcoding from UTF-8 to ISO-2020-JP for those kind of mobile clients

[05:43:35.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I know because I worked on such systems myself and deployed them

[05:43:54.0000] <MikeSmith>
although that was, like, 7 or 8 years ago

[05:44:19.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I can't imagine that that would have abandoned that approach in the mean time

[05:45:18.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway I'm sure emk has much better insight in the current situation than I do

[05:59:35.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: what's HZ?

[06:01:15.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I thought that might just be me that didn't know :)

[06:12:28.0000] <MikeSmith>
"If this plea doesn't convince you, I'll notice that although my contract prohibits the bribing of public officials, it does not say anything about fellow developers, and I'm not far off the source of Westvleteren 12. Not implying anything, just a factual observation."

hey let's change the Web security model http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2014Sep/0098.html

[07:21:36.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: ping

[07:22:04.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: gimmie 5-10mins to do a blog

[07:22:34.0000] <wanderview>
np... I leave the question and reply when you have time

[07:24:59.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: when you have time, does the spec say what to do if cache.delete() is called while the body data is still being streamed off disk for a previous cache.match()?  what do you think it should do?

[07:26:19.0000] <wanderview>
overall it seems the cache spec text should treat body data as a separate async read/write and right now its all wrapped up into a synchronous store into [[RequestToResponseMap]]

[07:36:44.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: good point. I guess delete would wait for the read to finish before removing from disk

[07:36:53.0000] <JakeA>
however, it could remove it from the index sooner

[07:36:58.0000] <JakeA>
and resolve sooner

[07:37:01.0000] <wanderview>
right

[07:37:03.0000] <wanderview>
ok

[07:37:10.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: want me to write an issue?

[07:37:14.0000] <wanderview>
for the spec

[07:37:26.0000] <JakeA>
Please!

[07:37:34.0000] <JakeA>
Actually going to look at some github issues now :D

[07:37:38.0000] <wanderview>
will do... thanks for the sanity check :-)

[07:48:09.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/470

[07:49:41.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: thanks! Appreciate you've been working the in the dark a bit over the past couple of weeks.

[07:50:22.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: np! I've mostly been mired in gecko implementation details... but looking forward to the cache spec changes

[07:52:07.0000] <wanderview>
I'll be out for 3 weeks starting sometime in the next week for paternity leave, so realistically I won't be able to look at the spec changes until I get back... just FYI

[07:52:20.0000] <wanderview>
JakeA: ^^^

[07:53:04.0000] <JakeA>
wanderview: That probably works out fine. I'm on holiday next week, then away for a couple of conferences. Oh, and congratulations!

[08:20:34.0000] <smaug____>
Domenic: https://github.com/w3c/wake-lock/issues/39#issuecomment-56248024 is surprising

[08:20:59.0000] <smaug____>
how would one implement [observable] innerHTML (in case we had such )

[08:21:10.0000] <Domenic>
smaug____: one wouldn't, for innerHTML

[08:21:23.0000] <Domenic>
smaug____: because innerHTML is lazily computed, so it wouldn't be simple for innerHTML.

[08:21:31.0000] <smaug____>
exactly

[08:21:51.0000] <smaug____>
many other properties are also lazily computed

[08:22:04.0000] <Domenic>
yep

[08:22:23.0000] <Domenic>
the general wiring is easy though, and it's easy for things like orientation that don't need to be lazily computed

[08:22:29.0000] <smaug____>
so I wouldn't add [observable], since it increases inconsistency in the platform

[08:22:57.0000] <jgraham>
Which properties are lazily computed is currently something of an implementation detail

[08:23:08.0000] <smaug____>
indeed

[08:23:16.0000] <annevk>
smaug____: are you arguing against Object.observe() in general?

[08:23:17.0000] <Domenic>
The fact that some properties are observable and some aren't is just a fact of how Object.observe works

[08:23:21.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure we want to back ouselves into a corner here by forcing some properties ot have eager semantics

[08:23:29.0000] <annevk>
smaug____: because once that's there, it's kind of a given that you will... what Domenic said

[08:23:58.0000] <smaug____>
jgraham: indeed. lazyness is good for performance

[08:24:06.0000] <Domenic>
jgraham: we are already in that corner for any properties that have corresponding propertynamechanged events

[08:24:16.0000] <Domenic>
which again are the only things we are considering making observable

[08:24:31.0000] <smaug____>
why don't we just use events then?

[08:24:43.0000] <annevk>
because we now have an observer mechanism

[08:24:51.0000] <smaug____>
/me is not at all sure Object.observe is a good thing

[08:24:54.0000] <annevk>
why don't we use callbacks? because we have promises

[08:25:10.0000] <annevk>
smaug____: well, you might want to argue that over in TC39

[08:25:14.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: That argument works both ways, so I'm not sure it proves anything

[08:25:19.0000] <smaug____>
annevk: that observer mechanism isn't too good

[08:25:38.0000] <smaug____>
so just saying we have a observer mechanism, doesn't mean we should use it

[08:29:01.0000] <smaug____>
(@mozilla in the API design guidelines we do mention consistency as a goal. use of [observable] would be a violation to that, IMHO. )

[08:30:16.0000] <annevk>
smaug____: why?

[08:30:49.0000] <smaug____>
why is one property observable but not some other?

[08:31:03.0000] <smaug____>
if we could make all properties observable, then fine

[08:31:07.0000] <smaug____>
but we can't

[08:31:28.0000] <annevk>
why is one property writeable but not some other?

[08:32:05.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if there was an alternate design where you could get a ntification that something had changed, but only get a way of computing the new value, rather than the new value itself

[08:32:42.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: The semantic of being read-only seems quite intuitive. The semantic of being unobservable seems much less so.

[08:32:51.0000] <smaug____>
exactly

[08:33:15.0000] <annevk>
*shrug*

[08:33:19.0000] <jgraham>
One is "this reflects something in the environment" and the other is "this changes, but you aren't allowed to know when"

[08:38:20.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: if we encounter some broken web platform tests in Gecko, should I copy you and ask about it?

[08:38:50.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Yeah, sure

[08:39:34.0000] <smaug____>
( It is also unclear to me how Object.observe would observe anything which is implementation detail behind some getter/setter functions. Trying to find if the draft of Object.observe says anything about such case )

[08:40:55.0000] <annevk>
Somewhat tempted to reply to Domenic's tweet with "Or just join us on IRC: link"

[08:41:08.0000] <Domenic>
hahaha

[08:52:24.0000] <jgraham>
Someone tell Google that it's 2014 and not supporting SVG images in docs isn't acceptable

[08:52:52.0000] <jgraham>
Especially since the preview will load them OK and then it will error when you actually try to insert them

[08:53:26.0000] <Domenic>
SVG support all over the web is bad :(

[08:53:43.0000] <Domenic>
e.g. should be able to use them for avatars but you can't do that anywhere

[09:43:47.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: figuring out what whatwg e-mails are in lists.w3.org is easy. Load up the whatwg archive link in a browser that hasn't seen the STS header, copy and paste the first non-quoted line of the e-mail into google, and find the w3.org link.

[09:47:35.0000] <pdr>
A big reason why there is no way SVG images would be allowed for avatars is SVG completely ignores the hard problems of security. As a result, the working group shot itself in the foot because it's not possible to use svg as avatars :/

[09:49:54.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm? What makes <svg> in <img> insecure?

[09:51:12.0000] <pdr>
jgraham, scripts can run and subresources can be loaded in images according to the spec (about half the browsers disable these though).

[09:52:03.0000] <jgraham>
I'm pretty sure everyone disables scripting in <img>

[09:52:36.0000] <jgraham>
And I'm pretty sure it would be wrong per spec to do otherwise

[09:52:41.0000] <pdr>
they do. As far as I know it's not in the spec. IE allows for loading of subresources even today.

[09:56:34.0000] <jgraham>
Well there's nothing in HTML that would allow creating a browsing context that could run scripts, at least

[09:58:12.0000] <pdr>
Can you explain a little more?

[09:58:21.0000] <Sample>
I was reading over the constraint validation API and it seems to me there is a serious gap in that, though the API provides a .checkValidity() method, there is absolutely no programmatic means with which to fire what the specs outline as "interactive validation".

[09:58:50.0000] <Sample>
Not only unable to through a new API method, but not even triggering via firing an event (like submit)

[09:59:26.0000] <Sample>
It seems to only occur in this inaccessible nebulous area triggered by direct user interaction with the page

[10:00:07.0000] <Sample>
only as an inaccessible step within the form submission algorithm

[10:05:34.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Link to the image-rendering discussion?  (Also, agreed, I'm planning on devolving level 4 to a delta spec; I've already pulled image-rendering into level 3, and we'll publish in a few weeks after review.)

[10:06:03.0000] <Domenic>
delta specs :-/

[10:06:33.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: form.reportValidity() does that, no? what am i missing?

[10:07:18.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: I'll check

[10:07:58.0000] <jgraham>
pdr: Normally you need a browsing context to run scripts, and loading an image doesn't create one. But I agree that it's not really clear what should happen in this case

[10:08:21.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Only as experimental.  As it becomes mature, it enters its chrysalis, and emerges as a full spec.

[10:08:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Right now, I have to port any changes in the common text between Images 3 and Images 4 to both, and I don't actually do that, so one or the other gets behind.

[10:08:56.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/0KYBjCdUMJw Mostly the confusion about which spec says what

[10:09:05.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: ah that makes perfect sense

[10:09:15.0000] <jgraham>
Which seems to be the problem you're describing in fact

[10:10:24.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: I don't seem to have that method in Chrome 37 however the specs for that say it returns false and "informs the user". Perhaps that implies it triggers the "interactive validation" and  fills the gap considered above

[10:11:03.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: the spec never implies anything, it's always explicit

[10:11:13.0000] <Hixie_>
Sample: where are you reading that it "returns false and informs the user"?

[10:12:31.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-constraint-validation-api:dom-cva-reportvalidity

[10:13:08.0000] <Sample>
also #the-form-element:dom-form-reportvalidity-2

[10:14:01.0000] <Sample>
Hixie_: Ah, it does say on that page that reportValidity() "must interactively validate the constraints". Thanks, that's exactly what I believe was missing

[10:14:09.0000] <Sample>
believed*

[10:14:44.0000] <Hixie_>
cool

[10:16:42.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: where do I find encoding in https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests

[10:18:46.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: If you want a directory for the encoding spec you need to create one

[10:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen's failures are in https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/blob/master/dom/nodes/Document-characterSet-normalization.html

[10:20:03.0000] <annevk>
okay

[10:22:06.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: is there an easy way to create PR locally? I'm so bad at GitHub :-(

[10:23:35.0000] <jgraham>
Well you can create a branch locally and push it. Creating the actual PR locally isn't so easy

[10:23:58.0000] <jgraham>
(maybe the GH UI allows that, or there are various things you can download, but I just use the website)

[10:24:26.0000] <annevk>
creating a branch I can do

[10:24:41.0000] <annevk>
let's see how far I get

[10:38:59.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: the changes I'm making are not showing up in the branch...

[10:47:34.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: that is, git diff shows changes, but the GitHub client doesn't

[10:53:24.0000] <Hixie_>
anyone got IE handy?

[10:53:37.0000] <Hixie_>
got some focusing tests to check

[10:55:06.0000] <annevk>
/me tries again

[10:55:08.0000] <Hixie_>
specifically, the three tests below, which are run as follows: 1. click in the "rendered view" outside the button, try using arrow keys to see what is focused. Click the button, try using arrow keys to see what is focused.

[11:10:10.0000] <Hixie_>
any mozilla people with IE? without IE, firefox is alone in the behaviour above, so i'm likely to move away from it. But if IE does the same thing, that would swing me back.

[11:34:01.0000] <wanderview>
Hixie_: I have IE up on your test... it scrolls outer area, click button, then scrolls inner area

[11:34:11.0000] <wanderview>
not sure what behavior you were asking about explicitly, though

[11:34:24.0000] <Hixie_>
cool

[11:34:25.0000] <Hixie_>
there's four tests

[11:34:28.0000] <Hixie_>
which one did you start with?

[11:34:46.0000] <wanderview>
Hixie_: going in order... tried the first 2 so far... same results

[11:35:21.0000] <Hixie_>
so you click above the button, arrow keys scroll the button up and down, then click the "Focus Child Frame" button, then arrow keys scroll the "softwar" inner-most iframe?

[11:35:37.0000] <wanderview>
Hixie_: yes... the fourth test always scrolls outer frame

[11:35:47.0000] <wanderview>
this is IE11

[11:35:57.0000] <Hixie_>
and the other three scroll the inner frame?

[11:36:09.0000] <wanderview>
yes, the first three scroll the inner frame after clicking the button

[11:42:27.0000] <Hixie_>
wanderview: cool, thanks!

[11:42:41.0000] <wanderview>
np

[11:48:14.0000] <Hixie_>
wanderview: if i can bother you for just one more second... what does IE do on these?

[11:48:17.0000] <Hixie_>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3208

[11:48:20.0000] <Hixie_>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3209

[11:48:33.0000] <Hixie_>
wanderview: (same test, though this time if it has a focus ring around a link, that's more relevant than whether the inner frame scrolls)

[11:50:10.0000] <wanderview>
Hixie_: the first one forces the scroll position on the inner frame when the button is pushed... I don't see a focus ring... the second one allows me to scroll inner frame, but does not change its scroll position automatically

[11:50:34.0000] <Hixie_>
wow, really

[11:50:38.0000] <Hixie_>
fascinating

[11:50:59.0000] <Hixie_>
what happens if you hit enter after clicking the button?

[11:51:25.0000] <wanderview>
nothing as far as I can tell

[11:51:46.0000] <Hixie_>
huh

[11:51:53.0000] <Hixie_>
not even on 3208?

[11:51:54.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: no changes were listed, but I think I did something wrong, will try again later

[11:51:55.0000] <wanderview>
Hixie_: I take it back

[11:52:06.0000] <wanderview>
Hixie_: the second one forces scroll position to top of inner frame

[11:52:19.0000] <wanderview>
Hixie_: so if I manually scroll down and push button, then it jumps back to top of inner frame

[11:52:43.0000] <Hixie_>
huh

[11:52:46.0000] <Hixie_>
cool, thanks

[11:52:51.0000] <wanderview>
np

[11:52:55.0000] <Hixie_>
not sure what to make of that exactly

[11:53:01.0000] <Hixie_>
but then again that's often my reaction to what IE does

[11:55:46.0000] <Hixie_>
i wish bugzilla had a way to select bugs that had no unresolved dependencies

[11:55:57.0000] <Hixie_>
(along with other criteria)

[12:04:12.0000] <Hixie_>
foolip: any further thoughts on https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12230 ?

[12:17:13.0000] <Hixie_>
cabanier: yt?

[12:19:13.0000] <Hixie_>
roc: yt?

[12:24:19.0000] <roc>
yes

[12:24:58.0000] <Hixie_>
so i'm looking at shadows

[12:25:14.0000] <Hixie_>
years ago we talked about changing how shadows in canvas work

[12:25:22.0000] <Hixie_>
looks like nobody did, so i'm taking the note out

[12:25:33.0000] <Hixie_>
but in looking at this i found another thing that's odd

[12:26:09.0000] <Hixie_>
per the spec, shadows and their corresponding shapes are composited separately, so if the globalCompositeOperation is 'over', you'd expect to not see any shadows

[12:26:12.0000] <Hixie_>
but you do

[12:26:36.0000] <Hixie_>
are the shapes and their shadows composited onto a scratch bitmap before being together composited onto the canvas, or something?

[12:27:00.0000] <Hixie_>
if i set the gCO to 'xor', i clearly see the shadow being xored with the shape

[12:31:58.0000] <Hixie_>
oh, i guess with xor there's no difference...

[12:32:06.0000] <Hixie_>
given the way xor works...

[12:32:35.0000] <Hixie_>
roc: so maybe it's compositing with the operator onto a scratch bitmap then compositing that all at once onto canvas with the operator again?

[12:37:27.0000] <roc>
what testcase are you looking at, on what platform?

[12:39:43.0000] <Hixie_>
i'm just doodling with my canvas console, but here: http://goo.gl/CfCQSA

[12:39:56.0000] <Hixie_>
i don't really understand why there's black in firefox

[12:41:04.0000] <Hixie_>
but in theory the presence of blue indicates that the shadow and the shape are composited together before being put on the canvas

[12:41:53.0000] <Hixie_>
although...

[12:42:07.0000] <Hixie_>
if you change the first 100 to 200 i can't explain why the teal box extends out of the blue one...

[12:42:21.0000] <Hixie_>
i don't understand what's going on here

[12:44:49.0000] <Hixie_>
roc: platform was mac

[12:59:13.0000] <roc>
we're pretty much just passing through to CoreGraphics to draw the object with shadow

[12:59:52.0000] <roc>
and I don't know what CG is supposed to do, nor what it actually does ... no Mac here

[13:01:08.0000] <Hixie_>
chrome and firefox act very different on these two tests on mac, and i can't explain either: http://goo.gl/LVUZ1r http://goo.gl/V2d3C7

[13:03:44.0000] <Hixie_>
safari on mac does what the spec says, which doesn't match the other two browsers

[13:22:19.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: I think I made it work: https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1261

[13:22:21.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: ^

[13:23:44.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: incidentally, would be nice if someone deleted old branches

[13:36:09.0000] <jamesr__>
coregraphics applies the composite op roughly speaking "per pixel"

[13:36:22.0000] <jamesr__>
so it applies to whatever pixels it decides needs to be touched for that draw

[13:36:35.0000] <jamesr__>
which for things with ill-defined shapes is pretty unpredictable

[15:30:43.0000] <Hixie_>
annevk: ping https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25099

[15:30:58.0000] <SimonSapin>
The Unicode 2.0 spec is a bunch of raster images :/ (Looking into the history of UTF-16 and surrogates.)

[15:31:31.0000] <SimonSapin>
it also claims in the very first sentence to be a fixed-width encoding

[15:35:43.0000] <Hixie_>
it was, then

[15:35:52.0000] <Hixie_>
Unicode 2.0 was a long time ago!

[15:36:31.0000] <Hixie_>
or wait, was 2.0 when they introduced surrogates?

[16:08:08.0000] <karlcow>
https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-73.html

[16:25:14.0000] <SimonSapin>
Hixie_: yes, and UTF-16

[16:25:46.0000] <SimonSapin>
but no non-BMP code point was assigned until 3.1

[16:27:46.0000] <SimonSapin>
2.0 still talks about 16 bit things being the fundamental things in Unicode. So yeah it’s a fixed width of these things. And oh by the way some abstract characters are encoded with two things

[16:28:10.0000] <SimonSapin>
"code value" is the name of things

[16:31:01.0000] <SimonSapin>
every kind of thing seemed to have many names at the time

[16:31:36.0000] <SimonSapin>
multiple in Unicode, and then some more in ISO/IEC 10646

[16:49:37.0000] <SimonSapin>
annevk: did you know that DoCoMo, KDDI, and SoftBank each have their own variant of Shift-JIS with different mappings for Emoji? What does the Encoding spec do with these?


2014-09-25
[19:14:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
SimonSapin: Maps everything to the sad-face emoticon

[20:21:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
SimonSapin: for those they're all using code points in the "user-defined" ranges of Shift-JIS

[20:22:22.0000] <MikeSmith>
SimonSapin: that is, the ranges in Shift-JIS that were intentionally set aside for private use, and not for interchange

[20:26:14.0000] <MikeSmith>
SimonSapin: so if the Encoding spec already says anything specific about how to process Shift-JIS code points in those "user defined" ranges, then I'd think the spec already has them covered

[20:27:49.0000] <MikeSmith>
SimonSapin: I wouldn't think the Encoding spec should do anything much beyond that -- certainly it shouldn't specify that they must be mapped to something else

[20:29:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
SimonSapin: because, e.g., UAs running within some system that consumes them need for them to stay just as what that system expects

[20:30:36.0000] <MikeSmith>
SimonSapin: e.g., at least for e-mail, some user sending a message within a Docomo network to another Docomo user needs for them to not be changed in between

[20:32:23.0000] <MikeSmith>
SimonSapin: it's a different thing of course for Web documents -- but authors should not be using those Shift-JIS-variant emoji in Shift-JIS Web documents anyway -- because they already can't expect any kind of interchange if they do

[20:37:25.0000] <MikeSmith>
SimonSapin: anyway, I think that at this point attempting to change any of the Web UA handling of those characters will just risk breaking existing (legacy) content

[23:22:42.0000] <MikeSmith>
the styling of https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_derivatives seems broken

[23:23:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., not login link at the top

[23:23:29.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh I guess it's the whole wiki that's borked styling

[23:35:23.0000] <tantek>
MikeSmith, FYI: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2014Sep/0061.html

[23:55:30.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: yup, it has the same PUA mapping they require

[23:55:46.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I thought the idea was to wait with that bug for a couple of months

[01:18:13.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: sorry I'm slow to react to IRC, I've commented on the two bugs you pinged about

[01:18:37.0000] <MikeSmith>
tantek: thanks

[01:19:21.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: response.clone() in Chrome, it copies each field of the response and sets body to a tee?

[01:19:53.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: I haven't really figured out what the best way to define it is, without enumerating all request/response fields, which is going to be a maintenance hassle

[01:20:36.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: I haven't dug into the implementation, but in terms of the body, doesn't the original request also need to become a tee?

[01:21:07.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: request's body, yes

[01:21:54.0000] <JakeA>
annevk: gotcha. Not sure what we're doing with the other properties, I assume they're copies

[01:23:52.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: is there a plan to un-bork the mixed-content situation with the wiki styling?

[01:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
whatwg wiki

[01:27:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: GPHemsley should know

[01:27:07.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: I didn't notice a problem for the TLS page

[01:27:11.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: is it only cached pages?

[01:27:19.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems to be everything

[01:27:37.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah wait

[01:27:50.0000] <annevk>
I don't get a mixed content warning for that page

[01:28:23.0000] <MikeSmith>
https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_derivatives

[01:28:35.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: what about that one

[01:28:56.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: when I'm logged out I do

[01:29:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah

[01:29:16.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm logged out

[01:29:48.0000] <MikeSmith>
weird that it matters whether you're logged in or not

[01:30:10.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: old pages are cached with the wrong link for the style sheet and such

[01:30:21.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith: but only cached for users that are logged out

[01:30:25.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[01:30:51.0000] <annevk>
E.g. FAQ had this problem, but now https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ renders fine, even when logged out, because we updated it recently

[01:31:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[01:31:37.0000] <annevk>
I don't know why GPHemsley can't clear the cache

[02:54:04.0000] <smaug____>
++foolip

[02:54:35.0000] <smaug____>
"sync XHR one could artificially make it slower to the point where people will notice."

[02:54:57.0000] <smaug____>
mean, but might work

[03:03:50.0000] <zcorpan>
increase the delay with half a millisecond per day

[03:03:58.0000] <annevk>
JakeA: beverloo: ETA on notifications in service workers email?

[03:04:11.0000] <GPHemsley>
annevk: Because I'm having trouble logging in. Once I can do that, I'll clear the cache and upgrade and whatnot.

[03:04:27.0000] <JakeA>
/me reads

[03:05:34.0000] <annevk>
GPHemsley: logging in to the server?

[03:05:41.0000] <GPHemsley>
yes

[03:05:50.0000] <annevk>
GPHemsley: you can ask Hixie to reset your credentials

[03:05:56.0000] <GPHemsley>
I have

[03:06:14.0000] <annevk>
GPHemsley: and you're using the correct username? (always trips me up with SSH)

[03:06:28.0000] <GPHemsley>
As far as we've been able to determine.

[03:07:10.0000] <annevk>
odd

[03:13:26.0000] <MikeSmith>
anybody know if there is yet a web-based feed reader that's actually usable in mobile browsers

[03:14:23.0000] <MikeSmith>
unlike, say, the web version of feedly, which is pretty much unusable on mobile

[03:19:13.0000] <annevk>
I'm using newsblur.com at the moment, but I haven't checked out the mobile version since I read enough stuff on mobile as it is

[03:20:11.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: "feed reader"? Is that like some way to check your Facebook, or something?

[03:27:01.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: it's how you Twitter on G+

[03:27:09.0000] <annevk>
jgraham: you wouldn't understand

[03:28:41.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: thanks for reviewing my patch to web-platform-tests!

[03:28:59.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: welcome

[05:37:16.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: pls review https://github.com/whatwg/web-apps-tracker/commit/66f7dfa4e32623157aa7c47618e09d621a5be008

[05:37:44.0000] <annevk>
please don't review newlines at end of files

[05:38:35.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: not sure I'm competent enough to review that regular expression

[05:38:49.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: roc isn't on twitter so I otherwise dunno how to fine out when he posts to his blog

[05:38:58.0000] <zcorpan>
oh my editor does that for me. can remove the newline though

[05:39:14.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i tested the regexp

[05:39:31.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: oh you added a newline?

[05:39:39.0000] <MikeSmith>
I vote for please leave the newline in

[05:39:40.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: that's fine, my editor works the same, thought it was removed

[05:40:13.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: yeah i added it

[05:41:30.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: ended up making a new browser icon

[05:41:37.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh boy

[05:42:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
does it have a skull?

[05:42:24.0000] <zcorpan>
no, but it has a back button

[05:43:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh that's actually pretty clever

[05:43:23.0000] <zcorpan>
that is 1x1 CSS px. that has a radial gradient. :-)

[05:44:37.0000] <MikeSmith>
man that just looks like a box

[05:44:43.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's too tiny

[05:44:55.0000] <MikeSmith>
it looks like a placeholder thing, img missing

[05:45:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
but with a white bar

[05:46:39.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: turns out browsers.svg needed to be without extension

[05:46:49.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: just committed  that

[05:46:52.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: oops

[05:47:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: some SVG files specify width/height, others don't

[05:47:23.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: hmm, maybe i can make the toolbar bigger

[05:47:46.0000] <MikeSmith>
christ we need an actual designer in this club

[05:49:36.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: so is this to reduce the amount of icons?

[05:50:29.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: Hixie always lumps the browsers together in commit messages so it seemed like it makes sense to use one icon

[05:50:58.0000] <annevk>
maybe we should ask Unicode if they can mint some emojis for us

[05:51:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: maybe could just use the reload icon?

[05:56:55.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: i don't associate that with a browser really

[05:57:12.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: pushed an update

[06:02:52.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: you can use "b" instead of "giow" in commit messages now

[06:17:18.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/ might provide some further inspiration

MikeSmith: i've made the toolbar bigger now

[06:19:43.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah ok

[06:19:46.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks

[06:20:16.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: can you deploy again? :-)

[06:20:16.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah that's better yeah

[06:20:23.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: great

[06:22:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm but when I look at https://html5.org/tools/icons/browsers it doesn't look different

[06:22:20.0000] <MikeSmith>
not that it really matters what it looks like big

[06:23:34.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: that's the old version

[06:23:49.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh ok

[06:27:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway for future reference as far as other symbol ideas for representing a browser, http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/icons/application_view_tile.png kind of looks like speed dial (or whatever other browsers call the similar thign they have)

[07:56:38.0000] <Domenic>
JakeA: annevk: +1 for keeping close for the use case JakeA outlined.

[08:50:48.0000] <hsivonen>
I like the way https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/subresourceintegrity/ defines "MIME type".

[08:51:16.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how many opposing comments the editors end up getting over an unorthodox definition like that.

[08:53:32.0000] <darobin>
hsivonen: lol, that's brilliant

[09:32:52.0000] <Domenic>
We need to come up with a living dead standard to publish on halloween

[09:32:56.0000] <Domenic>
something about zombie service workers

[09:33:19.0000] <Domenic>
maybe resurrecting finalized objects or something

[09:58:32.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: wait with which bug?

[10:19:29.0000] <tantek>
for any future dated WHATWG snapshots, I propose two things in combination: 1) a shorter title, without reference to any specific constituents. AND 2) for the first sentence to make it clear Implementers should reference the living specification.

[10:21:27.0000] <Ms2ger>
For any such snapshots, I propose a small script that makes all necessary alterations

[10:21:58.0000] <tantek>
Ms2ger - as long as it's server-side. As people do View Source without scripts running on the client.

[10:22:14.0000] <tantek>
And yeah, automating that on the server via a script is a good suggestion

[10:22:36.0000] <Ms2ger>
I was thinking generate in python and upload the result

[10:22:48.0000] <Ms2ger>
But any way that doesn't involve me doing anything :)

[10:22:57.0000] <tantek>
SGTM

[10:23:04.0000] <tantek>
e.g. right now the dated URL spec snapshot has the first sentence "For the current version of the URL Living Standard, including significant errata to the contents of this specification, please see: http://url.spec.whatwg.org/"

[10:23:27.0000] <tantek>
whereas I'd suggest something more like this for the first sentence:  "Implementors should reference the URL Living Standard, including significant errata to the contents of this specification: http://url.spec.whatwg.org/"

[10:23:37.0000] <tantek>
so there's a concrete example of a transform

[10:29:32.0000] <Domenic>
I like the existing sentence

[10:29:45.0000] <Domenic>
As ideally *everyone* should reference the living standard

[10:31:26.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: you saw http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2014Sep/0002.html ?

[10:31:56.0000] <MikeSmith>
about file:

[10:32:24.0000] <Domenic>
I have been bugging annevk about file:, and specifically file:///, for probably a year now :)

[10:35:57.0000] <Hixie>
yeah the only people who should reference the snapshots are lawyers, for patent purposes, since the snapshot is what the patent license covers, and government officials who for reasons beyond my understanding are required to reference unchanging documents in their references, and where it would be illegal to do otherwise.

[10:36:07.0000] <Hixie>
everyone else should just use the living standard

[10:36:28.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: the events bug

[10:36:31.0000] <Hixie>
using the snapshot for a reference e.g. from a w3c spec, is a fantastically bad idea.

[10:36:51.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: will deploy now

[10:37:11.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: what did I do instead of waiting?

[10:37:24.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: you pinged me

[10:38:15.0000] <Hixie>
wait, which events bug. https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12230 ?

[10:38:41.0000] <MikeSmith>
Domenic: looks like that guy is actually working On that i-d https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kerwin-file-scheme-11

[10:38:52.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: deployed: https://html5.org/tools/icons/browsers

[10:39:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: I don't get why you would put height/width in the icon

[10:39:12.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: that seems to defeat the purpose of it being scalable

[10:39:58.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: no, the IDL one

[10:40:35.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: MikeSmith: browser vendors have not been interested in revamping their URL parsers thus far, much less in revamping the file URL part of it I suspect

[10:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: oh... why are we waiting again? sorry, i'm apparently confused about some of these bugs.

[10:42:38.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: mostly because it was not high priority for you and I have other things to shift through

[10:43:10.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: there's also a thing with event objects that we don't really define the internal slots that well, so we could fix them but it would be a larger effort

[10:44:40.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: k. i'll punt it to 2015 on my side. feel free to bring it closer if you have time for it.

[10:45:51.0000] <Hixie>
can't find the bug

[10:45:57.0000] <Hixie>
do you remember what it's called?

[10:46:53.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25099

[10:47:16.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[10:57:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: i put it there so they would have the same intrinsic dimensions as the pngs in case someone uses them without giving width height. but i guess it doesn't really matter

[11:05:48.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: the only change to https://whatwg.org/specs/url/2014-07-30/ that would be good would be to change http to https for both <img> references

[11:05:59.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: that would also ensure the images keep loading into the future

[11:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not changing it. it's not important enough to violate the principle of the snapshot.

[11:13:27.0000] <tantek>
in order to keep with the principle of the snapshot, may I then suggest a new snapshot with the fixes I proposed above, and changing http to https for the <img> references

[11:14:54.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: lol @ bikeshed + git bisect :D

[11:15:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
Why lol?

[11:16:07.0000] <Domenic>
your enthusiasm was funny :)

[11:16:09.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: given that we only got 5 patent commitments to the last one, it seems a bit premature to already be making another patent snapshot. Also, see above regarding why I disagree with the change you're proposing.

[11:16:37.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Ah, kk. ^_^  I've been meaning to use it anyway, and it looks cool.

[11:31:17.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay, bisect is great!

[11:31:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
Confirmed that the problem was in the commit I thought it was, so I can look more closely at what's going wrong here.

[11:33:41.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, I'd like to iterate on snapshots to get *more* patent commitments. Including making changes like a shorter title that omits references to specific audiences.

[11:35:22.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: why do you think changing the title would get more companies on board the FSA?

[11:35:54.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, because in-person several representatives (AC even) of companies reacted poorly *just to the title*

[11:36:18.0000] <tantek>
whereas they seemed to otherwise like or be ok with the whole CG way of getting patent commitments etc.

[11:36:55.0000] <Hixie>
who?

[11:37:37.0000] <tantek>
unfortunately it was in the context of a private w3c meeting :( so I don't think I can say who.

[11:37:49.0000] <tantek>
you may accept that as weak data if you wish

[11:37:53.0000] <Hixie>
and did they react poorly because they thought "stale drafts should be referenced by more than lawyers!" or "we would never sign a license to commit patents to a draft made for that purpose!" or what?

[11:38:16.0000] <tantek>
in short it was a purely emotional reaction AFAIK, without any additional actual rational thought

[11:38:37.0000] <tantek>
I realize that may be a human bug but there you have it.

[11:38:47.0000] <Hixie>
that's the entire point of the title

[11:38:55.0000] <Hixie>
to make people not want to read that version of the spec

[11:38:58.0000] <Hixie>
so, working as intended

[11:39:49.0000] <Hixie>
one would assume that a company's lawyers don't, however, base what they will sign or not sign on emotional reactions

[11:40:54.0000] <tantek>
not want to read and not want to patent commit are not the same thing.

[11:41:10.0000] <Hixie>
[24~exactly

[11:41:12.0000] <tantek>
but to get to a company's laywers, typically there are intermediate humans that make decisions

[11:41:26.0000] <tantek>
fortunately not all decisions are made by lawyers :P

[11:41:51.0000] <tantek>
or rather, if that's what you're looking for, you may find exactly that in the "government officials" you refer to ;)

[11:42:16.0000] <Hixie>
if you can find me a company who would commit to signing the license based on nothing more than a title change, let me know.

[11:42:47.0000] <Hixie>
until then, this is just a distraction from more important issues, like actual bug fixing.

[11:50:24.0000] <tantek>
Apologies for the distraction. I'm hoping others can help with silly things like static snapshots for external referencers so you can keep focusing on actual more important issues like bug fixing (agreed about importance).

[12:20:44.0000] <annevk>
tantek: it would help if we had on black and white that it is what is blocking progress I think

[12:21:37.0000] <annevk>
tantek: I'm willing to help out create another snapshot, but to be fair we already published one, it seems kind of weird to put rules on titles after the fact

[12:22:00.0000] <jsbell>
annevk: how close are you to yanking the Errors stuff out of dom? i.e. is IDL covering it all yet? Someone was bugging me that DOM's DOMException IDL fragment doesn't have `name`

[12:22:29.0000] <annevk>
jsbell: that's because it's an exception and not an interface...

[12:22:39.0000] <annevk>
jsbell: I can do it today, but it would help if IDL actually covered it

[12:22:45.0000] <jsbell>
Not urgent at all.

[12:23:02.0000] <annevk>
jsbell: so far nobody updated IDL... there's open bugs and all, but we don't have a person writing IDL full time

[12:23:10.0000] <annevk>
jsbell: if you happen to have a spare six months or so

[12:23:43.0000] <annevk>
(or anyone else in this channel for that matter)

[12:24:33.0000] <jsbell>
I know how much fun others have working on the IDL spec. So tempting. ;-)  It looked like there was at least some blather in IDL about DOMException and general exception attributes.

[12:24:45.0000] <jsbell>
Anyway... thanks (as always)

[12:51:14.0000] <tantek>
annevk - no rules, just suggestions for increasing the chance of getting more support, and fewer emotionally negative reactions which aren't helpful to anybody.

[12:51:34.0000] <tantek>
never going to get black and white about this kind of thing - it's a process of iteration. we try something, see what breaks, fix it, iterate.

[12:51:36.0000] <tantek>
the usual

[12:52:47.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: When I said "should be fixed", I of course meant "When I push, which won't happen yet because I just found a bug".

[12:53:42.0000] <annevk>
tantek: understood, but I've the feeling that if we did iterate the same people would find something else

[12:54:26.0000] <tantek>
annevk, that's not my impression. rather, there are *some* who would see iterations as good faith listening / response and be supportive. and unfortunately there are likely others who would not be satisfied by any changes.

[12:54:49.0000] <tantek>
important to distinguish those two sets of people. I have specific examples in mind for each set but have no desire to call out specific names in public (yet)

[12:55:30.0000] <annevk>
no need

[12:55:42.0000] <tantek>
in addition, by addressing the concerns of set 1, they often see the stubbornness of set 2 as *bad faith* and will turn right around and call them out for it

[12:58:44.0000] <annevk>
tantek: if these are in-person meetings btw, did you try telling them they could ask us directly?

[12:58:57.0000] <annevk>
tantek: I don't think either Hixie or I heard about this until it broke on public-html

[12:59:13.0000] <annevk>
(well a bit before, but from other people than proxies I mean)

[13:01:34.0000] <annevk>
tantek: comment-by-proxy is a huge pain in the ass

[13:01:37.0000] <tantek>
annevk - am I not part of "us" in the "ask us directly"? ;)

[13:02:04.0000] <annevk>
tantek: well you didn't publish this doc

[13:02:13.0000] <tantek>
ah, ask the editors/publishers directly

[13:02:18.0000] <tantek>
that's a very reasonable request

[13:02:32.0000] <tantek>
I'll keep asking for such direct communication over comment-by-proxy

[13:02:38.0000] <annevk>
ta

[13:02:58.0000] <tantek>
but I'll continue facilitiating until the communication improves

[13:03:45.0000] <tantek>
more than that I'll probably start a wiki page collecting every little minor complaint anyone has about any such external normative references

[13:03:56.0000] <tantek>
for future guidance for such static snapshots

[13:04:12.0000] <tantek>
I'm giving public-html another 48-72 hours to collect reactions

[13:04:38.0000] <tantek>
treating it kind of like snail-mail, seems to be a reasonable model.

[13:06:37.0000] <annevk>
tantek: I'm happy to make another snapshot, not a big deal to me

[13:06:42.0000] <annevk>
not sure how Hixie feels about it though

[13:10:38.0000] <tantek>
annevk - sounds like Hixie has more important things to focus on, which I'm cool with.

[13:11:23.0000] <annevk>
http://www.economist.com/news/international/21620221-translating-technological-terms-throws-up-some-peculiar-challenges-cookies-caches-and-cows is rather beautiful

[13:11:35.0000] <annevk>
'Ibrahima Sarr, a Senegalese coder, led the translation of Firefox into Fulah, which is spoken by 20m people from Senegal to Nigeria. “Crash” became hookii (a cow falling over but not dying);'

[13:11:59.0000] <Ms2ger>
Nice comparison

[13:13:51.0000] <tantek>
thus causing a crash is cow-tipping?

[13:17:32.0000] <tantek>
annevk - cool - re: happy to make another snapshot, not a big deal to me

[13:18:09.0000] <tantek>
let's give folks some time to dump their current set(s) of objections publicly, I'll collate and document on a wiki and we can try to fix a bunch in a new snapshot.

[13:18:28.0000] <tantek>
I don't want to spend a lot of your or Hixie's time on this. So, fewer iterations with more things fixed in each.

[13:19:51.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if HSTS can be abused for tracking

[13:20:20.0000] <annevk>
E.g. if we offered the network error on redirect feature, you could see whether someone visited a HSTS site before

[13:20:31.0000] <annevk>
Not a huge deal now perhaps, but might soon be

[13:29:53.0000] <Ms2ger>
"CVE-2014-6271 looks like a variant of a problem we fixed ~30 years ago in Research UNIX sh(1)."

[13:29:59.0000] <Ms2ger>
Now if only they'd written tests

[13:40:43.0000] <tantek>
famous last words

[13:43:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Okay, *now* fixed and pushed.

[13:53:44.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I just cleared cache in a browser and still can't open e.g. https://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018888.html

[13:53:59.0000] <annevk>
that I copied that prolly means the cache is not cleared completely

[13:54:09.0000] <Hixie>
try http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018888.html

[13:55:23.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: if you have a concrete commitment from someone that their patent-rich company will sign the FSA for a snapshot with reasonable changes, then i'm interested.

[13:56:17.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, noted.

[13:56:40.0000] <Hixie>
("reasonable" being the main vague word in that sentence, of course)

[13:56:48.0000] <tantek>
I don't expect to see "concrete" commitments about anything usually. There's more room to make progress than that I think.

[13:57:09.0000] <Hixie>
we had a concrete commitment from three companies before we published the last one, fwiw.

[13:57:19.0000] <Hixie>
(and they followed through)

[13:57:36.0000] <tantek>
good! hopefully no changes to put any of that into jeopardy then.

[13:57:51.0000] <Hixie>
well those commitments are done, so it's moot :-)

[14:34:21.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan++ for https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#abstract

[14:34:38.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: yeah made it work

[14:35:59.0000] <Ms2ger>
zcorpan++

[14:36:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
in general

[14:46:23.0000] <Hixie>
made what work? what?

[14:46:32.0000] <Hixie>
and yeah, zcorpan++ in general

[14:47:11.0000] <Hixie>
oh, the link

[14:48:04.0000] <tantek>
that picture is amazing.

[15:30:38.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: ping https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26804

[15:48:12.0000] <jwalden>
Hixie: I see the URL in source, but does https://html5.org/r/8821 probably want some sort of inline attribution link, and perhaps an addition to acknowledgments or so?

[15:48:36.0000] <Hixie>
it's already in the acknowledgements, no?

[15:48:49.0000] <jwalden>
oh, I probably missed that

[15:49:09.0000] <Hixie>
nothing changed except that it became a jpeg+svg instead of a png

[15:49:20.0000] <Hixie>
(and a few words changed)

[15:49:33.0000] <jwalden>
ah, right

[15:49:35.0000] <jwalden>
carry on!

[15:49:43.0000] <jwalden>
/me figured there was some stupid explanation like that :-)

[15:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
:-)


2014-09-26
[00:18:52.0000] <zcorpan>
huh, where does the url snapshot hide part of the title? it's not hidden for me

[00:20:46.0000] <zcorpan>
hahahaha whatwg isn't open enough

[00:22:36.0000] <zcorpan>
oh the hiding was reverted, ok

[00:54:28.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: we could also make innerHTML only be available on html/svg/mathml elements

[00:54:52.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: although mathml just uses Element, doesn't it?

[00:56:36.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I don't recall what MathML uses

[00:57:16.0000] <zcorpan>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3211 - Element

[00:57:57.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. fun times. createContextualFragment supports only HTML contexts

[00:58:21.0000] <zcorpan>
could make setting innerHTML throw when context isn't html/svg/mathml. but i think #2 is better

[02:57:53.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: did you read http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=2673311

[02:58:06.0000] <annevk>
"The E.U. Parliament seems to have been successfully captured by CA lobbying efforts."

[03:25:07.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I haven't read that

[03:25:12.0000] <hsivonen>
thanks

[03:28:52.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: does that article describe something that's about to make things worse? or just a failure of the EU to make things better?

[03:31:10.0000] <MikeSmith>
hard to imagine what could get worse there

[03:34:12.0000] <MikeSmith>
I suspect It's more a thing of Just the CAs managing to get the eu to avoid Doing any useful regulation of the CAs, or hold them accountable for anything

[03:35:15.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe it will be illegal not to use SHA-1

[03:47:43.0000] <annevk>

hsivonen: do you know if they are in Chrome final yet?

[05:21:08.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I don't

[05:21:33.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: but isn't 4 months shorter than the time it takes to get to release for Chrome?

[05:22:03.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: yeah I guess it is, the weeks vs months thing threw me off

[05:28:33.0000] <annevk>
:-( Found an attack where you can use CSP and HSTS to discover whether someone has visited a domain

[05:41:18.0000] <darobin>

[06:12:57.0000] <annevk>
the number of problematic things with redirects...

[06:42:04.0000] <beverloo>
annevk, reading the thread now

[06:42:22.0000] <annevk>
beverloo: notifications? yay

[06:42:36.0000] <beverloo>
yup

[06:42:38.0000] <annevk>
beverloo: also https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Sharing

[06:42:49.0000] <beverloo>
that's unrelated to notifications, right?

[06:43:08.0000] <beverloo>
I'll read it again, stumbled across the link a few weeks ago

[06:43:22.0000] <beverloo>
mounir will definitely have opinions about it, too

[06:45:16.0000] <annevk>
beverloo: yeah is

[07:07:47.0000] <wanderview>

wanderview: I'm now curious about your employment history :p

[07:08:59.0000] <wanderview>
annevk: a lot of xml based systems running around out there is all I'm saying

[07:09:02.0000] <wanderview>
whether we like xml or not

[07:09:25.0000] <annevk>
I'm not opposed, I even designed a successor

[07:09:55.0000] <annevk>
And advocated the hell out of XML MIME types, XHTML, DOCTYPEs, and a bunch of other crap that turned out to be mostly irrelevant for the web

[07:14:29.0000] <wanderview>
annevk: the last enterprise-type system I worked on used a mixture of json, xml, and a fixed-width text file format from the 80s :-\

[07:14:52.0000] <annevk>
wanderview: what was the encoding?

[07:15:00.0000] <annevk>
wanderview: and what kind of newlines did it use?

[07:15:15.0000] <wanderview>
ascii I believe?  I don't recall the specifics

[07:20:28.0000] <wanderview>
annevk: the text file format was EDI... took me a while to dredge that up... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange

[09:23:00.0000] <sicking>
Domenic: ping

[09:23:16.0000] <sicking>
Domenic: is it possible to .freeze() a Map?

[09:25:44.0000] <SimonSapin>
annevk: http://www.openwebfoundation.org/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements/owfa-1-0 now redirects to a landing page rather than 1.0 specifically

[09:26:11.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: yeah, I've been meaning to ask tantek how to fix that

[09:26:23.0000] <annevk>
sicking: no

[09:26:33.0000] <annevk>
sicking: freeze() only freezes properties

[09:26:45.0000] <annevk>
sicking: it's not a general mechanism

[09:26:47.0000] <sicking>
annevk: can't functions check the frozen-state and honor it?

[09:27:10.0000] <annevk>
sicking: they could, but no built-in object observes it

[09:27:11.0000] <sicking>
annevk: seems like at least getters/setters need that ability

[09:27:17.0000] <sicking>
annevk: bummer

[09:27:36.0000] <sicking>
that seems pretty broken to me :(

[09:27:52.0000] <annevk>
sicking: it's a feature that came out of the Mark Miller ES5 compromise

[09:28:10.0000] <annevk>
sicking: and is disliked by at least half of TC39 which thinks it should never have existed in the first place afaict

[09:28:17.0000] <annevk>
sicking: and therefore nobody pays attention to it

[09:28:20.0000] <sicking>
annevk: freezing in general?

[09:28:30.0000] <annevk>
sicking: Object.freeze()

[09:28:45.0000] <sicking>
sigh

[09:28:49.0000] <annevk>
sicking: it was added for fairly specific Caja use cases

[09:28:54.0000] <sicking>
i guess what we really need is value object

[09:28:55.0000] <annevk>
sicking: but given a rather prominent name

[09:29:33.0000] <annevk>
I haven't seen much progress on those recently, but they do seem neat

[09:29:34.0000] <sicking>
annevk: seems like the ability to use readonly data structures, like arrays and maps, is not Caja specific

[09:30:14.0000] <sicking>
bummer

[09:30:50.0000] <sicking>
oh well, we can always add more DOM APIs to overcome ES shortcomings, that's not new :(

[09:30:51.0000] <annevk>
sicking: the people that don't care about freeze(), including e.g. dherman, think immutable data structures require something else

[09:31:11.0000] <annevk>
sicking: we can also propose new ES features relatively easily these days

[09:31:37.0000] <annevk>
sicking: by making a thought out proposal and then getting someone to bring it up during a TC39 meeting

[09:31:57.0000] <annevk>
sicking: it's still pretty bad compared to other bodies

[09:32:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk: yeah. Though designing readonly data structures is a pretty big undertaking

[09:32:15.0000] <annevk>
sicking: yeah if you want a generic solution

[09:32:40.0000] <annevk>
sicking: dherman and some people have been working on immutable ArrayBuffers I'm told, but I'm not sure how far along that is

[09:32:51.0000] <sicking>
annevk: i don't need it to be more generic than "readonly lists and maps". But that's still pretty generic

[09:32:53.0000] <annevk>
sicking: very little public stuff to follow, not sure why they're so bad at that

[09:33:51.0000] <sicking>
ok

[10:03:00.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie et al: is it completely safe to use < as long as I always follow it with a space?

[10:03:47.0000] <Hixie>
sounds plausible

[10:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
might not be conforming though

[10:04:27.0000] <Domenic>
heh

[10:04:36.0000] <annevk_>
I always escape <, but never >

[10:04:44.0000] <Hixie>
what anne said

[10:08:19.0000] <Domenic>
I'm looking at algorithm steps basically. While k < length is much nicer than while k &lt; length

[10:09:32.0000] <annevk>
Even less English?

[10:09:57.0000] <annevk>
You have prose somewhere that describes it means less than?

[10:10:25.0000] <annevk>
biab

[10:14:39.0000] <Domenic>
um, if http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less-than_sign counts, then yes

[10:26:39.0000] <Sample>
Does the idea or terminology "constrained by implementation" mean that browser vendors have committed features ahead of adherance to spec? I've browsed webkit chromium and mozilla ticket systems and I've seen at times suggestions "we won't implement that because it's not in spec" but other times acceptance and review of patches that seem to cause this "constrained by implementation"

[10:27:04.0000] <Sample>
or is it more commonly that they've implemented adherance to spec in such a specific way that the specification has no leverage to re-define better intentions?

[10:27:49.0000] <Sample>
in this particular case, I was reading a thread about input.files where webkit implemented an approach through patch right away (ability to assign FileList references I believe)

[10:32:02.0000] <Sample_>
Doh.. what was the last thing I wrote in here and did I get any answers?

[10:32:09.0000] <Sample_>
irssi was letting me type without connection (not being delivered to the channel0

[10:34:54.0000] <Sample_>
I guess I'll repeat myself in case nothing came through (apologies!)

[10:35:55.0000] <Sample_>
Does the idea/terminology "constained by implementation" mean/suggest that browser vendors have committed features ahead of adherance to spec?  I've browsed webkit chromium and mozilla ticket systems and I've seen at times suggestions "we won't implement this feature because it's not in spec" and a plea is made to the w3c list

[10:36:05.0000] <caitp>
those messages came through

[10:36:41.0000] <Sample_>
however regarding a w3c ticket on input.files being writeable it was said to be "constrained by implementation" linking a bugs.webkit ticket where patches were made in 2012. I'm curious if this was ahead of specification

[10:36:43.0000] <caitp>
[13:27]  <Sample> in this particular case, I was reading a thread about input.files where webkit implemented an approach through patch right away (ability to assign FileList references I believe) --- was the last one before you rejoined

oh thanks caitp

[11:00:17.0000] <Hixie>

[11:00:22.0000] <Hixie>

[11:03:41.0000] <Hixie>

[11:10:21.0000] <annevk>
grr, I keep getting disconnected

[11:10:36.0000] <annevk>
I need a better wirless setup I guess

[11:19:11.0000] <Sample_>
annevk: I know the feeling, clearly =)

[11:26:44.0000] <annevk>
https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#error-names-table is sad

[11:26:51.0000] <annevk>
everyone just mints a bunch of names

[11:27:20.0000] <annevk>
nobody asks for names, they just take up generic names like ReadOnlyError and claim it's about transactions

[11:31:18.0000] <Domenic>
Last time someone asked for names you weren't very receptive IIRC

[11:48:47.0000] <Domenic>
Do HTML import documents require a <!DOCTYPE>? I remember us trying to make them never-quirks but don't remember where that landed.

[11:51:47.0000] <Domenic>
Also do HTML import documents need <title>?

[12:52:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sample: Both things happen.  Sometimes specs lead browsers, sometimes the reverse, sometimes they develop at the same time with close communication between the implementor and the spec writier.

[12:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: I have no idea why we'd ever want to make them quirks.  If they're not already never-quirks, we better have a damned good reason.

[12:59:40.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: that's fair I guess

[12:59:47.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: I've been trying to make this IDL's problem

[12:59:56.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: or get people to just use TypeError

[13:00:11.0000] <Domenic>
Yeah :/

[13:00:17.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: still need to see code that differentiates on errors though

[13:01:00.0000] <annevk>
There was some flipflopping on the quirks stuff and HTML imports

[13:01:22.0000] <annevk>
There was even some flipflopping on the encoding stuff for HTML imports, but I killed that quickly

[13:05:47.0000] <Domenic>
Oh thank goodness, I hadn't even contemplated having to include a <meta charset> everywhere

[13:11:35.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: they definitely don't need <title>, i think HTML already has the clause you need to avoid those

[13:13:46.0000] <Sample>
TabAtkins: thanks for the response regarding that terminology

[13:54:26.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Have you been using markdown headings yet?

[14:26:53.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: yes, but Bikeshed yells at me to give them IDs, so it feels only temporary

[14:27:15.0000] <TabAtkins>
Domenic: Hahaha, I was going to ask you about if you were tagging them with IDs.

[14:27:30.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've finally documented them a bit better - you've been able to give them IDs for forever.

[14:27:35.0000] <Domenic>
Also it is weird that ### gives a h4

[14:27:41.0000] <Domenic>
I am used to the number of #s giving the heading level

[14:28:26.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, the choice was between shifting the levels, or just making === headings useless.

[14:28:43.0000] <TabAtkins>
I went with the former - relative levels are still maintained, they just map to a different level of heading.

[14:28:48.0000] <Domenic>
Hmm

[14:29:17.0000] <Domenic>
Well for those reasons I think I'll probably just switch to <hn> tags when I get around to thinking about what my IDs should be

[14:29:39.0000] <TabAtkins>
"Those reasons" include the ID yelling?

[14:29:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because, like I said, you can totally provide IDs for your markdown headings.

[14:31:56.0000] <Domenic>
Well, if I have to give them IDs anyway, and I am already uncomfortable with the mismatch between number of #s and heading level, I might as well use <hn id="x">...</hn>, since at that point I am not saving many characters

[14:32:26.0000] <TabAtkins>
Interesting that ### = <h4> makes you uncomfortable.

[14:32:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's the third-level heading in your source, after all.

[14:33:09.0000] <Domenic>
Yeah, I think my brain is well-trained to read ### as "h3" in the mental-verbalization sense

[14:33:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
And your brain is simultaneously well-trained to read "h3" as "second-level heading in my source document"?

[14:35:22.0000] <Domenic>
More like ... there is only one h1, there are many h2s, and below h2 comes h3, ...

[14:35:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
Interesting.

[14:36:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
Related: Do you like using # headings in preference to = and - headings?

[14:36:56.0000] <Domenic>
Yes, definitely

[14:37:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, our preferences definitely don't match there.

[14:37:40.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wonder if I should rejigger things to have # headings map directly to heading levels, but keep = and - mapping to <h2> and <h3>.

[14:39:30.0000] <Domenic>
I mean, that would make me happy, but not a big deal, and I can understand the consistency argument

[14:41:20.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was just wondering, because I just converted Images 3 to use all the Markdown I support so far.

[14:42:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
And I had to fix the underlined-heading ID handling to actually match Markdown Extra, so I wanted to warn you in advance. ^_^

[14:42:07.0000] <Domenic>
Link to source? Sounds like worth a read.

[14:42:48.0000] <TabAtkins>

[14:44:00.0000] <Domenic>
Very interesting

[14:46:44.0000] <TabAtkins>
Now I'm curious what you find interesting. ^_^

[14:47:47.0000] <Domenic>
Heavy use of indentation, the large minimap blocks... the way ' and '' are useful for CSS specs...

[14:48:00.0000] <Domenic>
your list formatting and line-wrapping choices

[14:48:10.0000] <TabAtkins>
Semantic line-wrapping, yo.

[14:48:23.0000] <TabAtkins>
The large text blocks are supported by Bikeshed. ^_^

[14:48:34.0000] <TabAtkins>
<!-- Big Text: foo --> in your doc, then run `bikeshed source`

[14:49:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
I do it because it makes it much easier to navigate the document via Sublime's minimap.

[14:49:36.0000] <Domenic>
Yeah, definitely, never actually used that technique, but was quite aware of it.

[15:41:45.0000] <Hixie>
so what's the relationship between css animations and web animations?

[15:41:50.0000] <Hixie>
and css transitions, for that matter

[15:43:42.0000] <Domenic>
I think they are meant to be related, and implementations try to back them by the same code, but that aspect of the spec is very hand-wavey

Hixie: Web Anim explains the low-level of all CSS and SVG animations.

[19:35:29.0000] <TabAtkins>
CSS Transitions and Animations decompose into Web Animations.

https://blog.cloudflare.com/celebrating-cloudflares-4th-birthday/ they're going to announce free TLS?

[04:47:35.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: did the TAG review getUserMedia() yet? Can it recommend authenticated origins? I'm trying to get both geolocation and getUserMedia() to be TLS-only features. Might require some deprecation period for the former.

[05:09:31.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: might also be good to point out in the API guide somewhere; filed an issue

[09:34:47.0000] <terinjokes>
annevk: who knows?

[09:39:25.0000] <terinjokes>
would it even be possible for UAs to change geolocation at this point? its been implemented for years

[11:09:16.0000] <annevk>
terinjokes: might be tricky

[11:13:22.0000] <annevk>

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169521

[02:22:48.0000] <ondras>
all other browsers are doing the same

[02:22:55.0000] <ondras>
so probably a PEBKAC?

[02:23:09.0000] <ondras>
can please someone more skilled with xml confirm and/or explain?

[02:25:54.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: it's a bug in the serializer

[02:28:06.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: the xml parser normalizes a few literal characters in attribute values to U+0020

[02:28:25.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: so the xml serializer needs to escape them for proper round-tripping

[02:29:36.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: HTML has the same deal for U+000D

[02:31:00.0000] <ondras>
zcorpan: yes, I would say I am pretty familiarized with how it works and how it *should* work

[02:31:20.0000] <ondras>
zcorpan: but the serializer does the same in all browsers; a behavior that often signifies a user error

[02:31:36.0000] <ondras>
zcorpan: also, this bug is 12 years old, so I would guess nobody really considers it a bug then?

[02:32:19.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: ah. well in this case it's not a user error :-)

[02:32:29.0000] <Ms2ger>
ondras, just not one that's more important than the million other things that need fixing :)

[02:33:01.0000] <ondras>
Ms2ger: would be nice to at least acknowledge it is an issue :-) that would, for instance, motivate me to submit it to other browsers as well...

[02:34:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
zcorpan, can you please say "this is a bug" in the bug? ;)

[02:34:29.0000] <ondras>
:-)

[02:35:13.0000] <zcorpan>
didn't bz confirm it in 2002?

[02:36:04.0000] <zcorpan>
(maybe we don't want to escape U+000D though)

[02:57:03.0000] <ondras>
zcorpan: thanks!

[02:57:59.0000] <annevk>
ondras: NEW means confirmed

[02:58:16.0000] <annevk>

[02:59:56.0000] <ondras>
("new" opera, webkit/blink)

[03:00:07.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't expect people to test presto these days :-)

[03:00:13.0000] <ondras>
yeah.

let's try trident then .)

[03:01:01.0000] <zcorpan>
although createDocument threw an exception, adding another argument fixed it

[03:04:17.0000] <ondras>
yes

[03:04:24.0000] <ondras>
and the results are, hmm, different.

[03:04:25.0000] <ondras>
:)

[03:05:13.0000] <ondras>
but serializes properly it seems

[03:12:37.0000] <annevk>
ondras: does https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/innerhtml/raw-file/tip/index.html define the behavior properly?

[03:18:06.0000] <ondras>
annevk: first of all, when using DOMParser with "text/html", the literal newline in attribute value seems to be preserved

[03:18:46.0000] <ondras>
annevk: which leads me to conclusion that text/html is treated in a different way than application/xml, with respect to parsing

[03:19:13.0000] <ondras>
annevk: and thus I would expect the option to choose beween these (two?) modes during the serialization

[03:23:17.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: if geolocation were to be deprecated for insecure origins, are mixed-content https pages insecure or secure?

[03:31:19.0000] <ondras>
annevk: I would say that the behavior matches https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/innerhtml/raw-file/tip/index.html#dfn-concept-serialize-attr-value , but this spec is not sufficient for serialization of generic XML documents

[03:34:27.0000] <ondras>
An XML parser, for the purposes of this specification, is a construct that follows the rules given in the XML specification to map a string of bytes or characters into a Document object.

[03:34:32.0000] <ondras>
At the time of writing, no such rules actually exist.

[03:34:33.0000] <ondras>
heh

[03:41:04.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: you'll have to define mixed content

[03:41:25.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: would the definition change the answer?

[03:42:09.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: if the mixed content is blocked, it's still secure

[03:42:22.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: if it's actually loaded, not so much

[03:42:41.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: hmm so if there is a loaded http:// <img>, the origin is no longer considered secure?

[03:52:51.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: apparently that's not considered mixed content just yet

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: though it probably should

[03:53:09.0000] <annevk>
and is in Firefox Nightly

[03:53:37.0000] <annevk>
though only UI-wise, we don't actually block the loading

[03:53:51.0000] <annevk>
so I doubt that'd impact authenticated origin

Their map is super-surprising. It's really not obvious to me why Madagascar and Somalia would have as many modern browsers as Finland, but Ethiopia, say, would have far fewer.

[04:20:57.0000] <jgraham>
Latvia als looks like a hige outlier in Eastern Europe and Indonesia in the Far East

[04:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
*huge

[04:29:26.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: yeah mixed content is sad

[04:29:38.0000] <annevk>
but announcement is huge and awesome

[04:42:33.0000] <terinjokes>
Domenic: i don't have a tile server that isn't https (nor did I create the map on an https server… ah development)

[04:58:47.0000] <terinjokes>
Domenic: fixed, thanks

[04:59:45.0000] <terinjokes>
annevk: such sadness… i'll have to get all those tile servers to sign up :P

[05:06:18.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: yep the html parser doesn't normalize LF or tab in attributes

[05:08:08.0000] <ondras>
zcorpan: sounds consistent with the serialization behavior. I would suggest adding xml serialization mode then.

[05:08:27.0000] <ondras>
(as parsing application/xml already works as expected)

[05:08:38.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: there is an xml serialization mode already :-)

[05:09:52.0000] <ondras>
zcorpan: is there a secret "on" switch hidden somewhere? :)

[05:11:17.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: XMLSerializer should always give you the xml serialization

[05:12:06.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: innerHTML should give the xml serialization if the "node document" is an "XML document"

[05:12:34.0000] <Ms2ger>
[probably]

[05:16:17.0000] <zcorpan>
i'll file a bug on https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/innerhtml/raw-file/tip/index.html#dfn-concept-serialize-attr-value

[05:20:34.0000] <ondras>
zcorpan: okay, *should*, right :)

[05:20:45.0000] <ondras>
zcorpan: I will file a chrome issue then

[05:20:59.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: well "must" per spec

[05:21:08.0000] <zcorpan>
ondras: i'm not using RFC2119 in irc :-)

[05:21:11.0000] <ondras>
:)

[05:21:26.0000] <ondras>
no offense, I was pointing to the fact that most browsers are not compliant with respect to this

[05:21:47.0000] <zcorpan>
any opinion on hex escape vs decimal escape?

[05:22:02.0000] <ondras>
I treat them equally

[05:22:18.0000] <zcorpan>
we need to decide what to spec

[05:22:36.0000] <ondras>
well the XML parsing spec uses #xA

[05:22:39.0000] <ondras>
so hex

[05:23:35.0000] <zcorpan>
ok https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26928

[05:24:44.0000] <ondras>
zcorpan: cool, thanks!

[06:20:49.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: the innerHTML view in live dom viewer also explains the unnecessary vertical scrolling which is even more annoying than horizontal scrolling

[06:35:20.0000] <SimonSapin>
In practice, JS strings are neither UTF-16 (which disallows unpaired surrogates) nor UCS-2 (which is BMP only) but kind of a mix where surrogate pairs represent a supplementary code point but unpaired surrogates are also allowed. Is there a name for this? If not, what could we call it?

[06:36:47.0000] <Ms2ger>
Wait, it isn't ucs-2?

[06:36:49.0000] <Ms2ger>
Lovely

[06:37:47.0000] <SimonSapin>
in a way, it’s UCS-2 which we give a different meaning to when rendering text

[06:38:34.0000] <SimonSapin>
The definitions of UCS-2 I can find say it can only encode BMP code points

[06:47:18.0000] <jgraham>
SimonSapin: WTF-JS? :p

[06:48:56.0000] <SimonSapin>
it’s not just JS, though

[06:49:08.0000] <SimonSapin>
(I wish it was!)

[06:50:55.0000] <jgraham>
I guess if you are coining WTF-8, this is somewhat logically WTF-16?

[06:51:27.0000] <jgraham>
Also, it seems my serious suggestion and my not serious suggestion are distressingly close together

[06:52:14.0000] <darobin>
hehe

[07:44:47.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: JS is simply 16-bit integers

[07:45:02.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: it's the text layer that's special

[07:45:09.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: if anything

[07:45:26.0000] <SimonSapin>
annevk: yes, but we give meaning to these integers when rendering as text, and when decoding bytes from the network

[07:45:47.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: but those are different subsystems

[07:48:38.0000] <SimonSapin>
annevk: they’re the subsystems I’m interested in right now

[07:48:50.0000] <annevk>
SimonSapin: but you're conflating them with JS

[07:49:38.0000] <SimonSapin>
I’m talking about the arrangement of 16-bit code units when these subsystems interact with JS

[07:50:06.0000] <annevk>
But that's saying something about those subsystems, not JS

[07:50:12.0000] <SimonSapin>
sure

[07:50:45.0000] <annevk>
So in practice, JS strings are consist of 16-bit integers

[07:50:48.0000] <annevk>
Good

[07:50:50.0000] <SimonSapin>
I’d still like to have a name for that arrangement of code units

[07:50:53.0000] <annevk>
s/are/still/

[07:51:03.0000] <SimonSapin>
yeah, I’m not disputing that

[07:51:44.0000] <annevk>
It's utf-16, unless the lone surrogates are rendered, which I think they are

[07:51:51.0000] <annevk>
In which case it would be WTF-16 indeed

[07:52:02.0000] <SimonSapin>
that’s what I mean

[07:52:05.0000] <annevk>
But that depends on the user agent

[07:52:14.0000] <annevk>
However, network is always utf-8

[07:56:22.0000] <gsnedders>
SimonSapin: it's UTF-16, it's just sometimes not valid UTF-16

[07:57:43.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders: if you don't replace the lone surrogates, it's not utf-16

[07:57:45.0000] <SimonSapin>
gsnedders: but when it’s invalid we give it a different meaning

[08:08:34.0000] <gsnedders>
The example given in D89 of Unicode 6.3 makes it pretty clear that the intention is that it's a UTF-16 string

[08:09:44.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, no, I'm misreading. It's the point it's still a Unicode string even if it's not a UTF-16 one.

[08:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
it refers to them as "Unicode 16-bit strings"

[08:10:36.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: r? https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/r/2725

[08:12:48.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: if you can find more differences between HTML's and JS's parsing of ints and floats, would be good to add

[08:18:37.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders: sounds worthy of WTF-16 to me

[08:18:59.0000] <annevk>
but that name kind of implies you could serialize it, which is probably what's wrong with such names

[08:36:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: You can serialize it, though.  Or do you mean "it implies that tools would have a serialization for it"?

[09:04:54.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: to be more clear, it looks like a transport encoding with such a name

[09:05:16.0000] <annevk>
transfer is prolly more appropriate

[09:06:26.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Yeah, makes sense.

[09:07:07.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: do we really want to keep having that difference between JS and HTML?

[09:14:08.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk, well, Aryeh argued against the difference, nobody wanted to change their implementation

[09:14:35.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk, and I believe Hixie wasn't happy about JS depending on unicode for space characters

[09:15:14.0000] <Hixie>
depending on unicode for the meaning of a language is crazy

[09:15:25.0000] <Hixie>
it means that each time they add new characters, existing scripts might stop working or work differently

[09:16:02.0000] <caitp>
i'm sure the same argument has been made about depending on ascii codepoints meaning specific things too

[09:16:33.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger: didn't the implementations use the ECMAScript semantics?

[09:16:39.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk, no

[09:22:45.0000] <Hixie>
caitp: ascii doesn't change every year

[09:22:53.0000] <Hixie>
and also, nobody is suggesting depending on ascii

[09:23:13.0000] <caitp>
it changes whenever someone invents a new variant on it

[09:23:16.0000] <gsnedders>
tbf, Unicode categories change exceptionally rarely

[09:23:31.0000] <Hixie>
caitp: that... isn't how that works

[09:24:11.0000] <caitp>
i think it's just over your head

[09:24:32.0000] <TabAtkins>
caitp: You might also be thinking of all the ASCII-compatible encodings, which all share the same first 128 codepoints with ASCII.

[09:24:38.0000] <TabAtkins>
caitp: Why you trolling?

[09:24:43.0000] <caitp>
which is fine, but the concept isn't that complicated. region A decides that this combination of bits means a new thing, suddenly it isn't read consistently world wide

[09:24:47.0000] <caitp>
every time a new variant is invented

[09:25:02.0000] <caitp>
which isn't as often anymore, but used to happen a fair bit

[09:25:16.0000] <TabAtkins>
Again, those were all ascii-compatible.

[09:25:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
ASCII is a 7-bit encoding, and lots and lots of encodings agreed on those 7 bits.

[09:25:31.0000] <caitp>
no, they were partially compatible

[09:25:41.0000] <caitp>
even bits under 0x80 changed meaning

[09:25:52.0000] <caitp>
not in an especially harmful way, but it did change

[09:26:19.0000] <TabAtkins>
Further, "someone, somewhere, inventing a new way to interpret some bits" is not equivalent to "the definition of those bits has changed".

[09:26:36.0000] <caitp>
the point is that it's not really a new problem, it's existed forever and it doesn't matter what encoding you use, you still run into it

[09:27:09.0000] <Hixie>
man, i just got out of that troll hole and tab fell right in instead :-P

[09:27:22.0000] <TabAtkins>
caitp: No, you are seriously missing, like, all of the points.

[09:27:32.0000] <caitp>
no, you are missing the points =)

[09:27:35.0000] <caitp>
and that's okay

[09:27:45.0000] <TabAtkins>
lol ok

[09:28:39.0000] <caitp>
you assign meaning to a combination of bits, over time, the honouring of that particular meaning that is convenient to you changes, regionally or worldwide

[09:29:32.0000] <TabAtkins>
The widely accepted definition of ASCII has not changed in a long time.  Even if some regions invent an encoding that is not fully ASCII-compatible, that does not change the definition of ASCII that everyone else depends on.

[09:29:51.0000] <Hixie>
and that wouldn't even matter if it had

[09:29:55.0000] <Hixie>
because we don't reference ASCII

[09:29:59.0000] <TabAtkins>
Even if there was a period wherein ASCII was updated or changed regularly (without looking things up, I dunno), that period is long past.

[09:30:21.0000] <TabAtkins>
Whereas Unicode is updated every few years right now, and they do extend categories, potentially including the whitespace category.

[09:30:21.0000] <caitp>
sure it's long past, until someone does it again

[09:30:57.0000] <TabAtkins>
Literally no one is going to update ASCII, and pretending that it's even a remote possibility that we should worry about (in comparison to the worry about Unicode changing) is ridiculous.

[09:31:13.0000] <caitp>
I wouldn't discount it

[09:31:22.0000] <caitp>
crazier things happen every day

[09:31:53.0000] <TabAtkins>
Good for you.  Apparently you like paying excessive attention to things with vanishing probability.  Don't pretend that anyone else cares about that possibility, though, and is "missing the point" for not caring about it.

[09:32:05.0000] <caitp>
but that's not really the point, the point is that it's an example of the fact that it really doesn't matter whether you depend on unicode or not, at some point, meanings will change

[09:32:24.0000] <jgraham>
This is not how the world works, people

[09:32:33.0000] <TabAtkins>
*Additionally*, as Hixie said, *HTML doesn't depend on ASCII for the definition of whitespace*.

[09:32:39.0000] <caitp>
the number of people in this room who know how the world works is precisely zero

[09:32:53.0000] <caitp>
self included

[09:33:13.0000] <jgraham>
If you have a critical mass of people depending on a certian behaviour in software, that behaviour will not change

[09:33:25.0000] <caitp>
you're bringing html into it, but it doesn't matter, html is kind of irrelevant to it

[09:33:28.0000] <jgraham>
That applies to both unicode and ascii

[09:34:06.0000] <jgraham>
Unicode has the additional problem that there are a large number of cases where there could be a specified behaviour that doesn't get a critical mass of dependent users

[09:34:12.0000] <caitp>
the fact is that it will change when it's convenient

[09:34:28.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Right, which is why claiming to depend on Unicode for a potentially important category definition, when Unicode's interests aren't really aligned with "make sure JS keeps working", is silly.  In reality, JS impls depend on a static set, and won't follow Unicode if anything ever changes in a breaking fashion.

[09:34:38.0000] <jgraham>
caitp: I think you aren't making a point of any substance.

[09:34:50.0000] <caitp>
that's fine, but you can just watch it and see

[09:35:08.0000] <Ms2ger>
TabAtkins, and in that case, we end up with some weird situation like "whitespace in Unicode from 2017"

[09:35:23.0000] <caitp>
it's just the way things are, nothing is ever set in stone

[09:35:26.0000] <jgraham>
"when it's convenient" is exactly the crux of the argument, but you are sweeping it under the carpet

[09:35:46.0000] <jgraham>
It is almost never convenient to break something that large numbers of people actually depend on

[09:36:01.0000] <caitp>
it's not convenient for some people

[09:36:40.0000] <Domenic>
wait so ... we want to reference a dated unicode snapshot? O_O

[09:38:07.0000] <Ms2ger>
Domenic, no, we want to reference ASCII whitespace from encoding.s.w.o

[09:38:18.0000] <Ms2ger>
Domenic, except that parseInt doesn't want to do that

[09:46:57.0000] <Hixie>
what will eventually happen is the JS spec will just list a long series of numbers that are to be treated as whitespace

[09:48:19.0000] <Hixie>
oh my god i just noticed something

[09:48:31.0000] <Hixie>
the w3c main page no longer says that their mission is to lead the web to its full potential!

[09:49:07.0000] <Hixie>
it's still in the <title>s for the News and Blog pages

[09:49:10.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if that's an oversight

[09:55:26.0000] <hober>
potentialgate?

[09:55:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: What's the name of the actual file that constitutes the single-page spec?

[09:57:29.0000] <Hixie>
um, /, i guess?

[09:57:32.0000] <Hixie>
what do you mean?

[09:57:38.0000] <Hixie>
like, in svn?

[09:57:53.0000] <Hixie>
complete.html is the file in svn. Also index. Same file. For legacy reasons I check it in under both names.

[09:59:21.0000] <Hixie>
hober: well i mostly just think it's humourous. Something to point at as showing a culture shift if I ever write a blog post about the sad fall of the w3c. :-)

[10:00:10.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: I think I need to ask plinss why Shepherd asks for the actual file, in addition to the normal url.

[10:00:20.0000] <TabAtkins>
Like, it wants to know about "Overview.html" for CSS specs.

[10:01:53.0000] <Hixie>
huh

[10:02:13.0000] <Hixie>
yeah it's just "" in that case

[10:04:47.0000] <annevk>
"(PS - Going forward, also we plan to support the ability to add HSTS headers.)"

[10:04:57.0000] <annevk>
maybe we should have just put Cloudflare in front of whatwg.org

[10:06:48.0000] <jgraham>
You still want SSL from cloudflare to your servers

[10:07:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which I think you can do with self-generated certs?

[10:07:22.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe, I'm not sure

[10:07:42.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean, you just tell CloudFlare what your certs are, there's no risk of impersonation.

[10:08:35.0000] <Domenic>
yep

[10:08:47.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: yup, they do that

[10:08:56.0000] <Domenic>
i was going to suggest cloudflare but it was like $15/month at the time

[10:09:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
You know that we can just expense that, right?

[10:09:33.0000] <Domenic>
i think we want to keep google money out of the whatwg as a general rule?

[10:09:34.0000] <annevk>
note that Cloudflare doesn't support the *.spec.whatwg.org thing for unpaid customers

[10:09:40.0000] <annevk>
just *.whatwg.org

[10:09:42.0000] <Domenic>
ahh

[10:10:12.0000] <annevk>
also, I'm somewhat glad went through the trouble, would have learned far less if we did something like this

[10:10:18.0000] <annevk>
I went*

[10:11:05.0000] <annevk>
Oh, through DreamHost Cloudflare would've been USD 10

[10:11:51.0000] <Domenic>
per month though i assume

[10:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: But going through resellers delays your free ssl until they work out some technical kinks

[10:12:08.0000] <annevk>
yes

[10:12:18.0000] <annevk>
(to you both, it seems)

[11:53:21.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: maybe not

[12:07:56.0000] <zcorpan>
does anyone see a problem with this example? https://html-differences.whatwg.org/#mathml-svg

[12:10:55.0000] <caitp>
does any browser ship with support for mathml yet? :o

[12:10:55.0000] <caitp>
i can't remember if gecko does or not

[12:13:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan: No, what problem do you think might exist?

[12:13:45.0000] <zcorpan>
TabAtkins: i got a private email asking for the svg to be moved out of the <p> so that it would be rendered on a separate line

[12:13:58.0000] <TabAtkins>
...why?

[12:14:39.0000] <zcorpan>
"The text "A green circle" now gets rendered above the circle, which is what most people might expect, expecially since the text has a colon "A green circle:""

[12:15:42.0000] <zcorpan>
i can see that it's a bit ugly because the <svg> is 300x150, but i'm unsure about it being on a separate line is what most people expect (or whether the colon has anything to do with it)

[12:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I don't get that at all.  A colon doesn't ever mean "the following content is on the next line".

[12:16:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's just an inline circle.

[12:16:38.0000] <TabAtkins>
Plus, who cares, it's a markup example that isn't even rendered in the document.

[12:16:51.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[12:26:58.0000] <smaug____>
caitp: Gecko has supported mathml like forever

[12:27:47.0000] <caitp>
it doesn't render the mathML dom in any special way though, as far as I can tell

[12:28:56.0000] <caitp>
so you still end up using one of the fancy "apply CSS or draw it with SVG" libraries to it

[12:29:06.0000] <caitp>
and then you wonder what the point of it ever was

[12:29:31.0000] <smaug____>
"	it doesn't render the mathML dom in any special way though" ?

[12:30:05.0000] <zcorpan>
caitp: are you testing presentational mathml or content mathml?

[12:30:06.0000] <caitp>
"dom" was the wrong word

[12:31:50.0000] <caitp>
I'm talking about presentation here

[12:31:51.0000] <caitp>
since I'm not aware of any other use for mathML

[12:32:33.0000] <smaug____>
and I don't understand what Gecko doesn't render

[12:33:19.0000] <caitp>
ah don't worry about it

[12:33:23.0000] <smaug____>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/MathML_Project/MathML_Torture_Test

[12:35:49.0000] <caitp>
people come up with wacky things which don't seem to solve any real problem on their own

[12:36:18.0000] <caitp>
maybe someone wants to programme matlab with it, who knows

[12:36:47.0000] <zcorpan>
https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=22731 ... i don't understand ap

[12:37:36.0000] <ap>
zcorpan: ?

[12:38:09.0000] <zcorpan>
ap: the spec change wasn't unmotivated

[12:39:15.0000] <ap>
zcorpan: well, it was definitely against what all browsers did at the time, and I assumed that no one would intentionally break compatibility like that

[12:40:29.0000] <zcorpan>
ap: it happens sometimes if it doesn't break the *web* and there's a reason to change

[12:41:50.0000] <ap>
zcorpan: I very clearly explained in the bug why this was a change for the worse, and it got WONTFIXed simply because it was only a little step to the worse

[12:43:13.0000] <ap>
like, maybe someone sometimes sould want a different behavior, so why not take an existing API and change it

[12:43:19.0000] <zcorpan>
ap: that's not my understanding. my understanding is that Hixie considers the change to be a little step to the *better*. and two browsers were interested enough to implemented on a relatively short time and abarth didn't see the security problem

[12:44:07.0000] <ap>
zcorpan: going against an explicit recommendation of base64 spec is super arbitrary

[12:44:39.0000] <Hixie>
personally i don't really care either way, but some people thought it was a step to the better, yeah

[12:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
i'm happy to change the spec if the momentum goes the other way

[12:45:21.0000] <Hixie>
my understanding is that the decision wasn't arbitrary, though

[12:45:28.0000] <zcorpan>
agree

[12:45:35.0000] <Hixie>
it was intentional because a bunch of people would first strip whitespace then call this

[12:45:43.0000] <Hixie>
and it seemed simpler to not have them do this, or something

[12:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
also i don't really understand the security risk in this specific case (i agree that in some cases there's a problem)

[12:46:08.0000] <ap>
Hixie: as I said in the bug, "The bar was quite high, and I do not think that this change came anywhere close to meeting it."

[12:46:23.0000] <Hixie>
the bar i use is almost always "two browsers implement the change"

[12:46:27.0000] <Hixie>
that bar was met

[12:46:33.0000] <Hixie>
no?

[12:46:52.0000] <ap>
Hixie: also, not sure why it is difficult for anyone to see the security concern

[12:47:08.0000] <ap>
Hixie: obviously, this introduces a covert channel where it used to be none

[12:47:28.0000] <ap>
Hixie: yes, it is not an attack against the _browser_

[12:47:39.0000] <ap>
Hixie: which may be why abarth doesn't see it

[12:47:57.0000] <ap>
Hixie: but there are many actors, each of whom have their security to worry about

[12:48:31.0000] <Hixie>
can you give a sample scenario where there's a concrete security problem?

[12:48:40.0000] <ap>
Hixie: just take a look at webcrypto security discussions... these are way different from what one is accustomed to seeing elsewhere

[12:48:52.0000] <ap>
Hixie: let me think about a specific example...

[12:52:18.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I don't have anything specific like "this breaks this particular software", but the change would break parenting and corporate filters that used to assume that base64 in a browser follows RFC 4648 recommendations (and whose authors tested browsers to see that they did). They would simply fail to decode the content, which would be then displayed

[12:52:39.0000] <ap>
Hixie: it's hard to come up with anything specific for covert channel. These are always special snowflakes

[12:53:28.0000] <ap>
Hixie: like, watermarking where you don't expect any. or piggy-backing on an existing channel to exfiltrate data (like sending out stolen data over DNS)

[12:55:23.0000] <Hixie>
i understand the attack in principle, i just don't understand how this specific API would be subject to it

[12:55:36.0000] <Hixie>
like i said, my understanding is that Aryeh when making this call found that most people strip spaces first anyway

[12:57:10.0000] <ap>
Hixie: yes, clearly, people who strip the spaces would not be affected

[12:57:40.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, i'm not the one to convince, really

[12:58:20.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just following the usual principle. two implementations changed. i'm just following the momentum.

[12:59:22.0000] <ap>
Hixie: the real outcome is that there is increased potential for websites to work in Chrome and Firefox, but not in Safari - as release cycles are different. Certainly that's a financially desirable outcome for a certain percentage of standards community

[13:00:20.0000] <ap>
trivial performance improvements pale in comparison to the diversity introduced into the platform

[13:00:30.0000] <caitp>
in the real world, authors are a lot more likely to make sure their website works on an ipad than they are to make sure it works on b2g

[13:01:11.0000] <caitp>
regardless of what direction standards are moving

[13:01:22.0000] <ap>
caitp: unfortunately, it too often happens that this is achieved with wrong techniques - e.g. by special casing a specific user-agent, and having a separate implementation for that

[13:01:47.0000] <caitp>
maybe, but that's just the nature of the game

[13:01:48.0000] <ap>
caitp: then everything breaks again with a new browser release

[13:01:50.0000] <caitp>
they follow the money

[13:03:04.0000] <ap>
caitp: that is certainly reasonable. What I request - here and also in general - is that the standards community is less cavalier with changing well established and fully interoperable APIs

[13:04:37.0000] <Hixie>
ap: i don't disagree with what you're saying, but changing the spec won't magically make firefox and chrome change back, if they think the change is a good idea. Just like changing the spec didn't magically change Safari since you think it's a bad idea. :-)

[13:05:14.0000] <ap>
Hixie: it does seem too late now. It probably wasn't too late when the spec bug was filed

[13:06:59.0000] <Hixie>
ap: i don't think anything really changed between then and now, but ok

[13:07:06.0000] <Hixie>
ap: i'm not sure what i should have done differently here.

[13:07:19.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I think that no one has yet shipped at that point

[13:07:27.0000] <Hixie>
ap: i feel you're saying i dropped the ball, but what would have been a better way to deal with it?

[13:10:52.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I think that the spec change should not have been made without a measured performance improvement on some pre-existing use case or test. I don't have a recommendation about how the change could be dealt with when questioned - as you know, I'm not very active in the standards community, and don't know any of the poilitics or even the procedures

[13:11:13.0000] <ap>
Hixie: ideally, a change that should not have been made would be undone somehow

[13:12:46.0000] <Hixie>
ah, well, the spec change wasn't in HTML

[13:12:54.0000] <Hixie>
that predates my involvement

[13:13:30.0000] <Hixie>
define "should not have been made", though? Here I had two browser vendors on board and agreeing it was a good idea, as well as the spec author for that feature.

[13:13:45.0000] <Hixie>
and only one vendor against it

[13:14:13.0000] <Hixie>
objectively, i don't really see why i would have concluded that it was a mistake

[13:14:46.0000] <Hixie>
(not sure why it would be a performance thing. It was just a convenience change, as I understand it, not one for perf.)

[13:16:06.0000] <Hixie>
ap: i'm not trying to gloss over this. I'm just genuinely not sure what I should have done differently here. It seems like every step was objectively reasonable.

[13:17:17.0000] <ap>
Hixie: Well, we have two vendors with very quick release cycles, who naturally favor "embrace, extend and extinguish" approach

[13:17:34.0000] <ap>
Hixie: the "two vendor" rule indeed encourages that

[13:18:26.0000] <ap>
Hixie: and there is no reason why vendors should not use the standards process to their competitive advantage, and to the disadvantage of others

[13:18:26.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: context?

[13:19:10.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: "do we really want to keep having that difference between JS and HTML?"

[13:19:26.0000] <ap>
Hixie: obviously, there are many changes that disadvantage old browsers - adding anything does!

[13:19:54.0000] <Hixie>
ap: well, certainly i would encourage you to follow the other three browsers and move to a more frequent deployment model

[13:20:31.0000] <zcorpan>
ap: we can compensate by removing things :-)

[13:20:52.0000] <ap>
Hixie: but authors would be more likely to conditionalize WebGL something and fall back, than a call to atob. This tiny convenience just creates quite a bit annoyance

[13:20:58.0000] <ap>
zcorpan: indeed :-)))

[13:22:07.0000] <Hixie>
ap: but i don't really see how i could change my approach to make it more balanced... i mean, giving IE and Safari a higher weight in considerations seems like something that would be considered even less fair

[13:24:17.0000] <ap>
Hixie: My assumption is that there was no problem to begin with, and the idea to add some convenience was arbitrary. That

[13:24:28.0000] <ap>
s's something one wouldn't do even in a private platform

[13:25:25.0000] <ap>
Hixie: like, we don't change Cocoa API behaviors any time there is an opportunity to improve

[13:25:26.0000] <boogyman>
Hixie: isn't the "2 vendor" rule weighting more towards the vendors that have "very quick release cycles" ?

[13:25:45.0000] <Hixie>
ap: as i said, i wasn't involved in that decision

[13:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
ap: that was done in the editing spec, i only got involved later when the APIs were moved to the HTML spec already in that state

[13:26:21.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: that is ap's argument, though i don't really understand how to quantify that

[13:26:22.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I understand this

[13:26:52.0000] <Ms2ger>
boogyman, depends on whether you require shipping

[13:27:03.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: http://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/44

[13:27:16.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: maybe pattern="" can have u always on?

[13:27:18.0000] <boogyman>
As an author, I like earlier adoption of new features/functionality, but I do think there should be a happy medium for vendors to weigh in.

[13:28:14.0000] <Hixie>
ap: (i'm not sure I agree that we should never make APIs more convenient, but I agree that in this case it's not obvious that the win was worth it.)

[13:30:09.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=11011 earlier discussion about i

[13:32:17.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I think that one test would be - would I make a similar change in a private API? If "no", or "maybe", then it's worth stopping and demonstrating tangible benefit bigger than convenience before making it on the Web. I think that allowing spaces in an existing atob function would be frowned upon in a native API, even though that's a backwards compatible change

[13:32:33.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Ms2ger hsivonen Would you know why empty iframes invisible in Firefox? Firefox is the only major browser in any OS to not show the red box: http://jsfiddle.net/nft8puq5/

[13:33:15.0000] <annevk>
ap: I'm not sure that's going to help many people

[13:33:30.0000] <annevk>
ap: there's not an agreed upon policy for private APIs either

[13:33:36.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Is there a security concern with empty iframes? Is there a spec that isn't clear on what should happen?

[13:34:20.0000] <Ms2ger>
JonathanNeal, it flashes up

[13:36:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
JonathanNeal, not sure what's up. Create a standalone case and file a bug, please

[13:36:32.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: a lot of specifications now have checks on global environments

[13:36:50.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: whether something is a document or worker or shared worker environment, etc.

[13:37:15.0000] <zcorpan>
Ms2ger: hsivonen: about:blank ghost?

[13:37:16.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: since you don't want global environments to leak to APIs to much, consider abstracting that too somehow

[13:37:36.0000] <Ms2ger>
zcorpan, I don't see why there'd be two

[13:38:11.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: on another note, is it worth pointing out on es-discuss that what you and Allen agreed to is a hack and is going to break as soon as ES wants something more complicated from their loop?

[13:39:43.0000] <annevk>
ap: on another note, it would help if WebKit were responsive to queries for input on new or existing standards; it seems copying people on bugs is not sufficient to get their attention; better ideas?

[13:43:29.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I'll comment on the bug about the global environment thing

[13:50:25.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Ms2ger: have a recommendation on how i can make my case even more standalone than the js fiddle, or is that simple enough?

[13:50:39.0000] <Ms2ger>
JonathanNeal, one html file?

[13:51:19.0000] <mathiasbynens>
zcorpan: I was hoping for always-`u` `pattern` but assumed it would break the Web

[13:51:28.0000] <mathiasbynens>
e.g. `\W` is different

[13:52:10.0000] <zcorpan>
mathiasbynens: might be worth analyzing

[13:52:54.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: environment settings objects contain a link to the global, but yeah, we can separately also include a "kind" or something if that would help

[13:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: please feel free to comment on es-discuss

[13:53:23.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i'm not sure when allen is making the changes i mentioned, if at all

[13:54:31.0000] <ap>
annevk: can't talk for others; personally, I think that I do respond when CC'ed or asked, as long as I have anything to say

[13:55:29.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: kind sounds alright; just looking out for you here since you cared about making things not depend on ES ;-)

[13:55:57.0000] <Hixie>
well the global is an interface, that's not depending on JS

[13:55:59.0000] <Hixie>
per se

[13:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[13:56:18.0000] <annevk>
ap: I often end up copying Maciej and Ted for high-level feedback, don't really want to bother you

[13:56:46.0000] <ap>
annevk: makes sense, I would rarely want to provide high level feedback

[13:56:47.0000] <Hixie>
as in, if you go settings object -> specified global -> instanceof, as opposed to global object -> instanceof

[13:57:10.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: ah yes, the global could work

[13:57:45.0000] <Hixie>
but we can have an explicit "kind" too

[13:57:49.0000] <Hixie>
just to make it more explicit

[13:57:54.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: note that JavaScript instanceof is not safe across realms

[13:58:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: sgtm

[13:58:22.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't mean a real instanceof, but yeah :-)

[14:09:41.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26195 also affects <img sizes> fwiw

[14:10:25.0000] <Hixie>
do you agree with the decision?

[14:11:11.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't care strongly either way. TabAtkins thinks comments should be allowed iirc

[14:11:22.0000] <Hixie>
k

[14:11:24.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: shouldn't email use https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-domain-to-ascii too?

[14:11:33.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: rather than punycode directly

[14:11:56.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't really matter

[14:11:58.0000] <Hixie>
it's a UI thing

[14:14:23.0000] <annevk>
yeah, I've got news for you, UI matters

[14:15:49.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: zcorpan: Yeah, comments should be allowed, because otherwise it's a switch in the parser for no gain.

[14:16:30.0000] <TabAtkins>
Plus remote possibility of code not moving cleanly between contexts that use the same value set.

[14:17:36.0000] <Hixie>
i believe mike's proposals was just an authoring conformance requirement, no change to the parser

[14:17:47.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: UI matters but there's no interop issue, is my point

[14:17:51.0000] <TabAtkins>
Probably insignificant, but still, comments don't cause any actual problem for browsers.

[14:17:52.0000] <Ms2ger>
I thought we all worked through that?

[14:17:55.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: it's a quality of implementation thing

[14:19:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Yeah, but I've used comments in weird spots before. Dropping a bit for why a length is s particular weird value, etc. I can see potential (small) value in allowing them.

[14:20:37.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: yeah no disagreement from me, i wontfixed the bug :-)

[14:20:51.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: i was just making sure mike's argument was accurately represented

[14:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: you could file a bug on ES for the event loop approach to be inverted

[14:41:18.0000] <zcorpan>
mmmm broccoli

[14:41:27.0000] <zcorpan>
/me grows his own broccoli

[14:41:37.0000] <zcorpan>
/me also reads w3cmemes

[16:13:15.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Might anyone here be able to guide me through filing an issue with Firefox?

[16:15:28.0000] <caitp>
you basically go through the annoying process of signing up for bugzilla (which if you've done for any of the w3/whatwg/webkit/llvm/whatever projects, you're familiar with), then you basically just file

[16:15:46.0000] <caitp>
and smaug or someone will shortly tell you you're wrong and your bug is wrong (kidding kidding)

[16:21:00.0000] <smaug____>
/me kicks caitp :)

[16:22:29.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: assuming it is an API related bug, better to not fire Firefox bug, but a Core Gecko bug, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core

[16:22:38.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I’m having a lot of trouble figuring out which category in Firefox this belongs.

[16:22:43.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It has to do with how elements are rendered on a page.

[16:23:08.0000] <smaug____>
layout or graphics then, probably

[16:23:29.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Don’t see that @ https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Firefox

[16:23:43.0000] <smaug____>
what did I just say ;)

[16:23:49.0000] <smaug____>
file a core gecko bug

[16:24:03.0000] <smaug____>
it is more effective if the issue is about API or layout or such

[16:24:11.0000] <smaug____>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core

[16:25:30.0000] <caitp>
if you get it wrong, chances are good if someone notices, it will get moved to the right place

[16:25:37.0000] <smaug____>
yup

[16:27:55.0000] <JonathanNeal>
thanks

[16:33:19.0000] <JonathanNeal>
smote me, smaug____ https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1074549

[16:35:00.0000] <smaug____>
hmm, sounds like about:blank loading issue

[16:35:36.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: what happens if you append the iframe, add load event listener, and in that listener set the color?

[16:36:09.0000] <smaug____>
/me doesn't know if any browser does about:blank loading right, or what even is the right about:blank behavior

[16:36:12.0000] <smaug____>
hsivonen would know

[16:38:16.0000] <JonathanNeal>
smaug____: it doesn’t make a difference, it visually hides the content of the iframe.

[16:38:35.0000] <JonathanNeal>
You can inspect the content, and it’s all there, and you can add event listeners and they will fire.

[16:40:32.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: no, the content doesn't have "hello world"

[16:40:40.0000] <smaug____>
are you looking at the first document content?

[16:40:52.0000] <smaug____>
access the content document after load event has fired for the iframe

[16:41:42.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Check out iframe.contentWindow.document.body.childNodes[0]

[16:41:45.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It’s a text node.

[16:44:21.0000] <JonathanNeal>
smaug____: it doesn’t make a difference for me whether i add or access the content before or after its windows’ content event has fired.

[16:44:28.0000] <JonathanNeal>
content event, er, load event

[16:44:47.0000] <smaug____>
I don't see the text node in iframe.contentDocument.body

[16:48:46.0000] <JonathanNeal>
smaug____: we can force the inspector into seeing it, watch, it’s fun.

[16:49:09.0000] <smaug____>
?

[16:49:17.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Try this:

[16:49:17.0000] <JonathanNeal>
iframe.contentWindow.document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('p')).appendChild(document.createTextNode('Hello, World!'));

[16:49:34.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The inspector won’t see it.

[16:49:35.0000] <smaug____>
yes, after that it is there

[16:49:37.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Then try: console.log(iframe.contentWindow.document.body.firstChild);

[16:49:46.0000] <smaug____>
I'm talking about your testcase

[16:49:48.0000] <JonathanNeal>
then click it, and the inspector will see it.

[16:50:09.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Even in the testcase, if you look at iframe.contentWindow.document.body.firstChild it’s a textnode.

[16:50:49.0000] <JonathanNeal>
You should see something like #text “Hello World"

[16:51:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
well, plus the comma and exclamation point.

[16:52:05.0000] <smaug____>
don't see

[16:53:53.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/6664082 gives the text + red color


2014-09-30
[17:06:09.0000] <smaug____>
Hmm, "Fetching the image must delay the load event of the element's node document"

[17:06:11.0000] <smaug____>
is that right

[17:07:05.0000] <smaug____>
should it delay load event only in case img element is in the document

[17:07:07.0000] <smaug____>
Hixie: ^

[17:07:33.0000] <smaug____>
at least the code in Gecko hints that, but haven't tested yet

[17:11:41.0000] <smaug____>
or no

[17:11:48.0000] <smaug____>
apparently img is loaded first

[17:15:19.0000] <JonathanNeal>
smaug____: that’s a weird onload event, you didn’t put it on the actual iframe content, you put it on the node.

[17:15:55.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: nothing weird with that load event

[17:16:09.0000] <smaug____>
that is where is should be when you want to know if something has been loaded to the iframe element

[17:16:23.0000] <JonathanNeal>
so, if the element has content ready, why would it not display?

[17:16:37.0000] <smaug____>
what content ready?

[17:16:51.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hello world

[17:17:21.0000] <smaug____>
the issue is that accessing contentWindow.document  creates an about:blank document

[17:17:26.0000] <JonathanNeal>
in other words, the iframe has content, and depending upon when you add it depends on whether or not you can see it?

[17:17:40.0000] <JonathanNeal>
that doesn’t make any sense, and is not consistent with any other browsing experience on any platform.

[17:17:48.0000] <smaug____>
but simultaneously appending the iframe to document has started a task to load a new about:blank

[17:17:54.0000] <smaug____>
since no src means about:blank

[17:18:20.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: the issue is very similar to window.open() behavior

[17:18:34.0000] <smaug____>
as I said earlier, I don't recall what the spec says about this

[17:19:40.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: See https://twitter.com/hsivonen 's summary ;)

[17:20:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Is iframe.src supposed to report “” as the src when it does what you say?

[17:20:42.0000] <smaug____>
don't recall what it is supposed to "report"

[17:20:59.0000] <smaug____>
but no src is supposed to load an about:blank document

[17:21:22.0000] <smaug____>
but I don't know what the spec says in case there is already that initial about:blank

[17:21:46.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, do you think my expectations are misaligned with how things should work, or are you telling me what the bug is or both?

[17:22:13.0000] <smaug____>
"When an iframe element is inserted into a document that has a browsing context, the user agent must create a nested browsing context, and then process the iframe attributes for the "first time"."

[17:22:43.0000] <smaug____>
I'm not saying this isn't a Gecko bug

[17:22:48.0000] <smaug____>
I'm just explaining what happens

[17:23:24.0000] <smaug____>
per spec the second about:blank shouldn't be there

[17:24:17.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: hsivonen will probably mark your bug to be a dup of some old Gecko bug

[17:24:22.0000] <JonathanNeal>
smaug____: interestingly enough, i don’t think the example you provided works in any browser except Firefox.

[17:25:30.0000] <smaug____>
hmm, it doesn't in chromium

[17:25:34.0000] <smaug____>
that is a chromium bug then

[17:25:51.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Considering what you said, it’s even more wild! http://jsfiddle.net/nft8puq5/2/

[17:26:01.0000] <smaug____>
( different bug than what we have been discussing )

[17:26:08.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Look, addEventListener firing on the iframe that is not there.

[17:26:53.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I guess it’s just weird that the iframe’s document refreshes, is all. that does not make sense, that it would load one document and then another.

[17:27:38.0000] <smaug____>
the spec explicitly says "A load event is also fired at the iframe element when it is created if no other data is loaded in it."

[17:28:06.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: yeah, that is a Gecko bug, and load event firing incorrectly is a blink bug

[17:28:50.0000] <JonathanNeal>
smaug____: "if no other data is loaded” not sure what that means, but if i give the iframe data, it definitely ignores it, and also fires the load event.

[17:28:59.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Thanks so much for finding it in the spec though.

[17:54:11.0000] <smaug____>
JonathanNeal: how did you manage to paste a link to a 2012 version of html5 spec ;)

[17:54:23.0000] <smaug____>
we're certainly not trying to implement that one

[17:54:50.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Google.

[23:05:35.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: I didn't check in a debugger, but it seems to me that you do the stuff you do on Gecko's docshell-created about:blank. Then the event loop spins and the old HTML parser, which we keep around only in order to remain compatible with our old about:blank behavior, overwrites the docshell-created about:blank with a parser-generated about:blank

[23:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: so you end up seeing the latter, which blows away everything you did with the first one

[23:06:05.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: yes, this is sad

[23:06:26.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: fixing this requires some serious work

[23:06:42.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: fortunately, some of that work is being done in order to support CSP better

[23:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: when the CSP stuff is done, maybe I should take another attempt at fixing about:blank

[01:01:41.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: you need to reopen bugs if you want Hixie to see your comment

[01:14:31.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: what's your time table for fixing developers.whatwg.org?

[01:14:43.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: it's the new TR at this point :-P

[01:42:52.0000] <Domenic>
oh burrrrrn

[01:46:22.0000] <odinho>
zcorpan: Makes sense. Web developers obviously can't program to a moving target.   :]

[01:50:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I'm meeting with Makoto Murata this week to discuss him contributing a mechanism for making the error strings in the HTML5 datatype library localizable. I think he wants it for use in the epub checker.

[01:50:49.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: whatever we might happen come up with, I'll make sure to get it to you for discussion before he does any work on implementing it

[01:52:13.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: to be clear, right now, right now he's only planning/wanting to contribute something for the error messages emitted from the datatype code

[01:54:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: though if we're going to OK it, I guess we should try to make sure it's generally applicable to as much of the rest of the error-emitting code elsewhere as possible

[02:05:42.0000] <jgraham>
odinho: Can they program to a stationary target?

[02:12:36.0000] <odinho>
jgraham: Or indeed any target?

[02:32:18.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: OK. makes sense

[04:33:52.0000] <annevk>
Anyone here happen to be good with wireless routers? We have a "Technicolor TC7200" from the cable provider. Would buying something new extend the range?

[04:35:13.0000] <annevk>
I was thinking of maybe getting an AirPort Time Capsule so we can do backups and such too

[04:38:03.0000] <wilhelm>
annevk: Not really, but I got a few for the new offices. The two tips I got were: 5GHz is your friend. Skip the consumer grade stuff.

[04:38:33.0000] <wilhelm>
Ended up with Cisco Aironet 2602i.

[04:40:31.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i wouldn't consider myself good but i researched it a bit last time i needed to buy one and ended up with ASUS RT-N66U (i think), which has coverage all over my garden

[04:42:28.0000] <zcorpan>
(but apparently its NTFS impl is broken so don't plug in an external drive formatted as NFTS to it)

[04:47:47.0000] <annevk>
wilhelm: I wonder if my Xbox 360 can do 5GHz

[04:48:12.0000] <annevk>
wilhelm: we also have an iPhone 4 and a Macbook Pro from 2010 or so in the mix

[04:48:38.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: garden sounds nice :-)

[04:54:06.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: yep

[04:54:44.0000] <annevk>
we can see a park, but no way I can make wifi work there

[04:55:26.0000] <annevk>
wilhelm: that shit's expensive

[04:55:59.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: you sure? there are 1km range routers

[04:56:07.0000] <annevk>
ooh

[04:57:09.0000] <annevk>
"The RT-N66U dual-band wireless router from ASUS brings to the fore super-fast connectivity with up to 450 Mbps per band simultaneously. It works in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, and supports up to a massive 300,000 concurrent data sessions - approximately 20 times the capacity of mainstream routers."

[04:57:21.0000] <annevk>
that one is a bit cheaper as well

[04:58:50.0000] <zcorpan>
you can have two 2.4 GHz networks, so i have one guest network that only has internet access

[04:59:03.0000] <wilhelm>
annevk: Yes. The ones I have are for the office. (c:

[04:59:20.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: brilliant

[04:59:36.0000] <wilhelm>
Still not enough to pass through a few layers of 1928-style reinforced concrete, though. :D

[05:06:42.0000] <annevk>
wilhelm: we're not all based in the bunkers of Oslo

[05:11:16.0000] <jgraham>
Well metal in the walls seems like it would be the most effective thing in blocking the signal

[05:11:27.0000] <jgraham>
Which doesn't just mean thick concrete

[05:25:41.0000] <annevk>
Hmm, I just found out I could set bandwidth to 40MHz

[05:32:30.0000] <wilhelm>
jgraham: It's either metal, or something else that bends space-time. This is a functionalist building from the 1920s. Nice place, big windows, just downtown. Zero radio communication between rooms.

[05:38:01.0000] <annevk>
That seems to have helped boost things up a bit, maybe I don't need new stuff for now

[05:41:15.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen: nice work on getting those encoding changes landed, hoping they'll stick :-)

[05:58:08.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: empty string already has a meaning for languages

[05:58:50.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: is the meaning wrong for what we want here?

[05:59:30.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: unknown language != user's language

[05:59:47.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: although apparently there's no such thing as a tag for the user's language

[06:00:11.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: user's language is not known by the author :-)

[06:00:50.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: lang="" is equivalent to not specifying lang anywhere, isn't it?

[06:01:41.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: from that perspective...

[06:02:26.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: seems reasonable, chatting with Richard on Skype, but he's a bit busy

[06:27:14.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: so i am learning that multipart formdata parsing is not well-specified, but larry is trying to make it so, without much traction? how does this impact fetch and FormData?

[06:28:39.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: there's https://github.com/masinter/multipart-form-data/ but per https://github.com/masinter/multipart-form-data/issues/17#issuecomment-48077041 it's not clear whether he's interested in defining what we need in the end

[06:29:25.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: the impact is that multipart/form-data parsing is somewhat muddy and might differ until we clearly define the rules

[06:29:45.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: not so different from user agents not agreeing on how to implement URLs... that seems a bit more significant if you ask me

[06:30:09.0000] <Domenic>
right

[06:31:36.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: I hope someone will pick it up, if nobody does, I guess I will at some point

[06:33:47.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: does it make sense for you to write the algorithms for converting things into larry's format?

[06:34:36.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: that sounds like the theoretical let's write a URL spec on top of RFC 3986 approach, which is not very attractive from an engineering standpoint

[06:34:54.0000] <Domenic>
yeah, i dunno

[06:35:19.0000] <annevk>
The format is not very complicated. Either Larry makes it work or someone else will. No big deal I think

[06:59:16.0000] <annevk>
https://twitter.com/llaamm1991/status/516947782478102528 hmm

[07:02:43.0000] <ondras>
poor child.

[07:36:04.0000] <Domenic>
wowww http://unicode-inc.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/updated-unicode-security-specifications.html

[07:38:35.0000] <annevk>
interesting attacks

[07:40:14.0000] <annevk>
Firefox is not vulnerable, but Chrome will be if they still have the same strategy (which to be fair, I considered to be a good one at the time)

[07:46:50.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: care to fix http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/buttons/88x31/svg/cc-zero.svg

[07:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: for my specs you mean?

[07:56:56.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: is there a https url?

[07:58:47.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: I meant turn it into better SVG

[07:59:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: and then perhaps host it on resources

[07:59:43.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: ah ok. sure

[08:00:08.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: is the icon itself cc0? :-)

[08:00:59.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: hmm, actually, per https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads it might not be

[08:01:10.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: I might just stop using the icon

[08:03:13.0000] <zcorpan>
no icon wfm

[08:57:37.0000] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: how do i tell bikeshed to prefer EDs

[08:58:03.0000] <Domenic>
tobie: is there a reason WebIDL doesn't point to the ED for the href, if specref prefers "latest and greatest"?

[08:59:41.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: README predates any of the automation we've added since then.

[08:59:52.0000] <Domenic>
:-/

[09:00:18.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: Yeah, but it wasn't using EDs either back then.

[09:01:06.0000] <tobie>
I actually started a thread on the topic of what it was folks really wanted on specprod@ a while back.

[09:01:30.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: it wasn't really conclusive. :)

[09:01:58.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: given that I actually need to solve that problem for me pretty much as we speak, I'm happy to reopen the conversation.

[09:02:32.0000] <tobie>
Else, I'll just add an EDDraft prop to the returned object and let folks deal with it as they please.

[09:04:15.0000] <Domenic>
I mean, this is mainly a Bikeshed level concern for me right now

[09:06:22.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: I understand. The data's currently not exposed on Specref though.

[09:06:33.0000] <tobie>
So I'm not sure what Bikeshed can do about that.

[09:07:35.0000] <tobie>
Unless Bikeshed grabs the JSON directly from the repo rather than from the API.

[09:09:33.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I want to put the "This version" URL of my specs inside the <hgroup> after the <h1> before the <h2>

[09:09:43.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: could you adjust the style sheet to make that look a bit better?

[09:10:15.0000] <Hixie>
what's the value of the "This version" line?

[09:10:37.0000] <SimonSapin>
When writing a spec: if I have a term with a definition that can be linked to, should every single occurrence of the term be linked? Only the first of the paragraph? Some other criteria?

[09:10:41.0000] <Hixie>
also, <hgroup> only takes <hx> children, i'm not sure what you mean

[09:10:55.0000] <Hixie>
do you have a sample of what you want to do?

[09:10:59.0000] <Hixie>
like in live dom viewer or something

[09:11:16.0000] <Hixie>
SimonSapin: i've started just linking every case cos it's easier to reason about when making edits

[09:14:58.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/ has an example

[09:15:13.0000] <Hixie>
well that's non-conforming

[09:15:26.0000] <Hixie>
i think maybe you want <header> intead of <hgroup>?

[09:15:39.0000] <annevk>
but then the <h2> is no longer grouped

[09:15:47.0000] <annevk>
perhaps I should upgrade the link to be a heading?

[09:15:49.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/2014AprJun/0027.html

[09:15:49.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i wouldn't use <h2> if you went that route

[09:15:56.0000] <Hixie>
you could make the link a heading

[09:15:58.0000] <Hixie>
but the real question

[09:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
is why bother with the url at all

[09:16:29.0000] <annevk>
it's a bit of a leftover from the old days, but okay

[09:16:37.0000] <annevk>
let's nuke it and see how people react

[09:16:37.0000] <Hixie>
i mean look at the html spec

[09:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
nobody outside of #whatwg while i was editing it has said anything at all about the header of the html spec

[09:20:14.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: interesting, no editor

[09:20:26.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: put it in ack

[09:20:30.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: same with license

[09:20:44.0000] <annevk>
not sure about license in ack but didn't feel like a whole new chapter either

[09:21:18.0000] <Domenic>
I did always find "this version" confusing

[09:21:56.0000] <Domenic>
Getting rid of OWF patent agreement seems bad?

[09:22:16.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: it redirects to a Google thing

[09:22:20.0000] <Domenic>
tobie: I like how "latest" is completely false

[09:22:27.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: I've asked tantek to clarify

[09:22:33.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: yeah their redirects seem to go the wrong way heh

[09:22:37.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: sorry?

[09:22:46.0000] <Domenic>
"latest" != "ed" in specref

[09:23:09.0000] <tobie>
there is no latest.

[09:23:11.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: editors are crazy man

[09:23:28.0000] <annevk>
Domenic: needs vetting by WG on a teleconference before you can call it stable

[09:23:43.0000] <Domenic>
tobie: ah was referring to the thread you linked above

[09:23:55.0000] <Hixie>
you typoed "stale"

[09:23:59.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: gone

[09:24:03.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: that's a proposal, not implemented yet.

[09:24:05.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: heh

[09:24:15.0000] <Domenic>
tobie: ah ok

[09:24:43.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: see, isn't that cleaner? :-)

[09:24:54.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: the "this version" link implies that there might be other versions

[09:24:58.0000] <annevk>
maybe the next thing to do is make the table of contents some thing that comes from the side as you often see on mobile

[09:25:08.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: imho it's a symptom of the w3c's snapshot issues

[09:25:34.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: there was some disagreement in the thread about what should be exposed and how.

[09:25:41.0000] <tantek>
what's the broken URL

[09:26:01.0000] <annevk>
tantek: http://www.openwebfoundation.org/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements/owfa-1-0 is the link various specs have and the Mozilla wiki recommends

[09:26:24.0000] <tantek>
yeah that seems like a redirect broke

[09:26:38.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: I didn't really need it myself until this week, so didn't look into it more.

[09:26:39.0000] <tantek>
sigh.

[09:27:00.0000] <tantek>
it should just serve up https://sites.google.com/site/openwebfoundation/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements/owfa-1-0

[09:27:06.0000] <tantek>
but at the same URL as before

[09:27:30.0000] <annevk>
okay so that URL should remain working

[09:27:38.0000] <tantek>
yes it should

[09:27:52.0000] <tantek>
I don't know why it's showing up as a sites.goole.com URL

[09:28:00.0000] <tantek>
it should just work as is

[09:28:03.0000] <annevk>
note that all openwebfoundation.org links redirect

[09:28:15.0000] <tantek>
noted. and that looks like a bug.

[09:28:33.0000] <annevk>
okay, so I'll restore the OWF link for now hoping it'll get fixed

[09:28:41.0000] <annevk>
it will be moved to ack

[09:28:48.0000] <annevk>
no need to have this on top

[09:31:28.0000] <annevk>
tantek: see https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#acknowledgments

[09:31:39.0000] <annevk>
tantek: "Per CC0, to the extent possible under law, the editor has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this work. In addition, as of 30 September 2014, the editor has made this specification available under the Open Web Foundation Agreement Version 1.0." is the text I plan on using from now on

[09:32:20.0000] <annevk>
tantek: the previous iteration had a plain text version of the link as well, but that seems like bullshit

[09:32:28.0000] <Domenic>
+1 that

[09:33:35.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't OWFa 1.0 require a new version of the license with each edit?

[09:33:58.0000] <Hixie>
and a signature, etc?

[09:34:12.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand what it means to say "the editor has made this specification available under the Open Web Foundation Agreement Version 1.0."

[09:34:45.0000] <Hixie>
also, is it you who is granting your patents, or is it mozilla?

[09:35:05.0000] <annevk>
ask tantek

[09:35:13.0000] <annevk>
tantek: ^

[09:35:30.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: that said, PR welcomed granted it doesn't make all Urls suddenly EDs (as the last thing I want is another of those sterile discussions directly in my inbox).

[09:35:37.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: you're the one saying it, i'd hope that you would be able to answer those questions too :-)

[09:35:51.0000] <Domenic>
tobie: I mean, can I PR WebIDL's href to be the ED?

[09:36:45.0000] <tobie>
Domenic: you could, but it would be overwritten by the nightly automation script. :(

[09:36:53.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I think it's just me

[09:37:00.0000] <Domenic>
tobie: but for one glorious moment, i would be free ;)

[09:37:39.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: so do you print the agreement with each commit and store the signed contracts each time?

[09:37:48.0000] <annevk>
I don't

[09:38:02.0000] <annevk>
if that's required, I might opt to remove it again I guess; Domenic / tantek?

[09:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
so what do you mean by "the editor has made this specification available under the..."?

[09:38:09.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, read the license

[09:38:11.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[09:38:25.0000] <Domenic>
annevk: I know very little besides "more open good" :)

[09:38:26.0000] <annevk>
so much work :/

[09:38:38.0000] <Hixie>
see in particular section 8.8

[09:38:58.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really understand what OWFa 1.0 adds, if you're already using CC0

[09:39:26.0000] <Domenic>
doesn't CC0 not cover patents at all

[09:39:37.0000] <Hixie>
in fact, I don't understand how you can both use CC0 and OWFa, doesn't OWFa section 2.1 mean nothing at all if CC0 is used?

[09:39:56.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: neither does OWFa 1.0, unless Anne owns patents he hasn't told us about

[09:40:21.0000] <Domenic>
Hixie: I think the idea is to provide assurance that you don't claim any patents without the reader having to know the editor's patent portfolio

[09:41:23.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, not AFAIK

[09:41:44.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: then I think the CG CLA is probably a better mechanism

[09:41:49.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: not AFAIK what?

[09:42:42.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: since, in particular, it doesn't require that you sign a piece of paper with each contribution

[09:43:05.0000] <tantek>
CLA fails in practice

[09:43:12.0000] <tantek>
splitting CLA and FSA was a mistake

[09:43:27.0000] <Hixie>
the OWF licenses have the exact same split

[09:43:32.0000] <tantek>
so instead, we switched the model where with each version/commit/date you re-agree to the FSA

[09:43:36.0000] <tantek>
which is what the boilerplate has

[09:43:46.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, I know, and that's why we ignore the CLA half

[09:43:47.0000] <tantek>
it's useless

[09:44:12.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, the language about "editor has made this specification available under the Open Web Foundation Agreement Version 1.0. " is good enough per our legal review.

[09:44:23.0000] <tantek>
no need to print stuff out and fax things etc.

[09:44:35.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand how your lawyers interpret 8.8 or 2.1

[09:44:48.0000] <tantek>
IANAL so I'm not worried about it

[09:44:58.0000] <tantek>
got it reviewed, good enough, moving forward.

[09:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not in the slightest bit worried, i just think it's bogus :-)

[09:45:11.0000] <tantek>
if you have specific legal issues from your lawyers we can have them talk to ours

[09:45:29.0000] <tantek>
otherwise, I don't care to spend time on micromanaging license contents

[09:45:49.0000] <Hixie>
i'm pretty sure my lawyers don't care either :-)

[09:45:56.0000] <tantek>
well then, let's keep moving forward

[09:46:05.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't stop it from being bogus :-)

[09:46:05.0000] <tantek>
as you've pointed out, we've got real bugs to fix :)

[09:46:15.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - IIRC you think all patents are bogus :P

[09:46:27.0000] <Hixie>
different meaning of the term

[09:47:27.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. the OWFa stuff imho is pointless. if we want to resign the FSA each time then we should just do that with the CG FSA, which is much more sound.

[09:48:47.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: any news on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=974341 ?

[09:50:20.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, the OWFa stuff gives us a patent commitment *independent of W3C*

[09:50:23.0000] <tantek>
that's why it's useful

[09:50:35.0000] <tantek>
the CG FSA is purely for "playing nice with W3C"

[09:50:36.0000] <tantek>
IMO

[09:50:45.0000] <Hixie>
?

[09:50:55.0000] <Hixie>
what's it got to do with the w3c other than that they host it

[09:51:04.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: no

[09:51:20.0000] <annevk>
tantek: hmm, no, FSA gives us much more

[09:51:21.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: should i wontfix the relevant spec bugs, or is this something that's still in the cards?

[09:51:36.0000] <annevk>
tantek: e.g. for URL we have commitments from Mozilla and Google

[09:51:47.0000] <Hixie>
and opera

[09:51:53.0000] <Hixie>
and darobin, now!

[09:51:58.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I guess it might still be in the cards

[09:52:23.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I pinged the bug

[09:52:50.0000] <Hixie>
k

[09:53:05.0000] <annevk>
tantek: so I guess I'm with Hixie that if OWF only says something about me and a potential co-editor, it's worth zilch

[09:53:41.0000] <tantek>
annevk - the *CG* gives us much more

[09:53:56.0000] <Hixie>
(it would be mildly clearer if you used the patent-only one, but i don't see how it's worth any more than just "I don't have any patents, by the way.")

[09:54:09.0000] <tantek>
we could independently try to get other companies to sign OWFa FSA for WHATWG specs

[09:54:10.0000] <tantek>
*independently* of W3C

[09:54:25.0000] <Hixie>
who cares if it's independent of the w3c

[09:55:40.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not against the w3c, i'm against the w3c's actions that harm interoperability.

[09:55:50.0000] <Hixie>
the CGs and the FSAs don't harm interoperability. They're great.

[09:58:27.0000] <annevk>
I think Hixie's right

[09:59:20.0000] <Hixie>
does firefox really still not support type=date inputs?

[10:02:14.0000] <Hixie>
anyone got iOS handy? does iOS8's Safari do anything useful with the inputs on http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3218 ?

[10:02:47.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: no :/

[10:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
well that explains not supporting that other one!

[10:03:25.0000] <Hixie>
(make that http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/3219 )

[10:03:41.0000] <annevk>
looking

[10:04:13.0000] <Hixie>
or IE, for that matter

[10:04:15.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: color not, date and time yes

[10:04:31.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: datetime not, datetime-local yes

[10:04:40.0000] <Hixie>
is there any room for placeholders on the ones where they do something useful?

[10:05:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: week renders super weird and doesn't seem to work

[10:05:04.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: month works

[10:05:31.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: yeah, but none of them renders anything for "hello"

[10:05:41.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: I have IE10 I think

[10:05:43.0000] <Hixie>
oh there is? can you send a screen shot?

[10:05:50.0000] <Hixie>
where would the placeholder go?

[10:06:46.0000] <annevk>
I was thinking it could be drawn on the select

[10:07:37.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[10:08:11.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: IE10 does none of this

[10:08:27.0000] <Hixie>
like firefox?

[10:08:29.0000] <Hixie>
except not even color?

[10:08:44.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: correct

[10:08:49.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: no color

[10:09:06.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if I can get IE11

[10:09:19.0000] <annevk>
Is IE11 out?

[10:09:26.0000] <annevk>
I have install updates automatically on...

[10:09:35.0000] <Hixie>
only on win8, iirc?

[10:10:22.0000] <annevk>
oh

[10:10:50.0000] <annevk>
seems I have Windows 7, I guess I should get a license from IT or some such

[10:11:42.0000] <Hixie>
man, i like how i just have to type "h" in the location bar and the html spec url comes right up

[10:12:07.0000] <kbrosnan>
i belive date is supported on FxAndroid and/or FxOS

[10:12:23.0000] <Hixie>
not on android

[10:12:29.0000] <Hixie>
at least, not with the build i have

[10:12:42.0000] <Hixie>
(android firefox is my default browser on my phone)

[10:13:13.0000] <kbrosnan>
have it on nightly, let me look

[10:13:19.0000] <Hixie>
pretty sure i do too

[10:13:33.0000] <kbrosnan>
er mean input date

[10:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure how to force an update

[10:14:13.0000] <Hixie>
i silenced the update notifications at some point since it was driving me crazy

[10:14:35.0000] <kbrosnan>
data:text/html,<input type="date">

[10:14:47.0000] <Hixie>
aha, found the update button

[10:14:55.0000] <kbrosnan>
functions for me on all branches, 32-35

[10:16:05.0000] <Hixie>
not for me...

[10:16:09.0000] <Hixie>
35.0a1

[10:16:42.0000] <Hixie>
i just get a text field

[10:16:50.0000] <Hixie>
is there some flag i should flip?

[10:21:25.0000] <kbrosnan>
http://i5.minus.com/ib0qSl1EYrWS5w.png

[10:23:07.0000] <kbrosnan>
it is live on release

[10:23:44.0000] <Hixie>
wait, you can tap that text field and a UI comes up?!

[10:24:16.0000] <Hixie>
wow, that's terrible!

[10:24:26.0000] <Hixie>
i would never have guessed that

[10:25:19.0000] <kbrosnan>
unless you autofocus the field

[10:25:26.0000] <kbrosnan>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769352

[10:26:31.0000] <Hixie>
i mean they should at least look like the dropdowns iOS Safari uses...

[10:26:51.0000] <annevk>
All specs have been updated

[10:26:56.0000] <annevk>
This version is gone

[10:27:09.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[10:27:33.0000] <annevk>
(Also OWF, until there's a better argument)

[10:27:54.0000] <kbrosnan>
hm autofocus does not trigger it

[10:40:16.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: if i have a promise A

[10:40:32.0000] <Hixie>
and a promise C

[10:40:53.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: and I say  var B = A.then(function () { return C; })

[10:40:58.0000] <Hixie>
Domenic: what is B?

[10:41:51.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: a new promise

[10:42:50.0000] <Hixie>
which is resolved when? when C is resolved? and its value is C's value?

[10:43:16.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: yes

[10:43:37.0000] <Hixie>
k, thanks

[10:48:06.0000] <annevk>
maybe tomorrow I'll run some experiments with a table of contents from this century

[10:48:31.0000] <annevk>
seems annoying you still have to scroll to see actual content

[10:48:48.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: my changes might have made it harder to migrate to Bikeshed I guess

[10:48:55.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins: still interested in that though

[12:48:31.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notices quirks has mixed content

[12:57:22.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: don't you think some people may want to email the editor and expect to find that at the top, not in acks?

[13:06:27.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't found that removing that from the html spec has reduced the amount of feedback i get, fwiw

[13:06:30.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Kk, I'll mess with it soon. Either tomorrow or Friday.

[13:06:31.0000] <Hixie>
and it's been removed for a while there

[13:13:05.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-ttml-imsc1-20140930/#h3_namespaces ....

[13:13:10.0000] <zcorpan>
/me cries

[13:16:42.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: is it intentional that toc.js doesn't run on multipage?

[13:42:44.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: not per se

[13:42:58.0000] <Hixie>
wait, toc.js?

[13:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
isn't that dead?

[13:43:30.0000] <Hixie>
bigger question is why is the shorter toc not being generated at all

[13:44:19.0000] <zcorpan>
oh the short toc is (supposedly) generated in the toolchain now?

[13:44:40.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i never actually implemented that...

[13:44:48.0000] <Hixie>
la la la

[13:45:18.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: toc.js still exists and the source has this:

[13:45:21.0000] <zcorpan>
     if (document.documentElement.className == "big" || document.documentElement.className == "big split index")

[13:45:21.0000] <zcorpan>
       load('toc.js');

[13:45:43.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think i set the class right these days either

[13:49:33.0000] <Hixie>
haha yeah i never implemented SmallTOC

[13:49:34.0000] <Hixie>
d'oh

[14:59:35.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: I hope it will encourage people to file bugs instead

[15:00:24.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: we'll see what happens, I don't get that many personal emails about these standards anyway, and mostly they would be better aimed at a public list

[15:00:54.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[15:01:53.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: not as bad as https://annevankesteren.nl/2006/03/smil

[15:01:58.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan: re TTML

[15:03:22.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah but i would have hoped they didn't repeat the same mistake. /ns/ suggests it's relatively new

[15:04:17.0000] <annevk>
cue "You must be new here"

[15:48:56.0000] <SimonSapin>
Domenic, wycats: so, what dherman was talking about is that Servo converts absolute CSS length units like cm and in to px early, in the parser. But we may have to change that, it’s unclear how much CSSOM is expected to preserve the original formatting of stuff

[15:56:17.0000] <odinho>
Feels a bit weird not saving that metadata at least.

[15:56:50.0000] <odinho>
Some serializing-deserializing stuff will go bad.  Or devtools.

[16:26:53.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah at this point it's pretty unclear that any statement of the form "Servo has shown that X is possible" is actually true for values of X that might have compat impact
