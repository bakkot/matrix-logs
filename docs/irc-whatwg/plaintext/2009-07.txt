gah, it's too warm to sleep

[01:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
depending on how the page is built, I'm quite sure the performance of google could actually be improved by adopting a more standards based approach

[01:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I feel guilty for posting on the codec thread

[01:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I should have known better

[01:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I can't see what part of your message somebody could reasonably take issue with.

[01:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think the hardware concern is a major concern

[01:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I was just hoping that I wouldn't extend the flamewar

[01:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: if you didn't post on the thread at all, your silence would be interpreted as a clear indication that you are indeed part of the conspiracy

[01:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
obviously

[01:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think it's high time I added some H.264 and Theora stuff to my wisdom generator

[01:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh. looking at it now, I see that I already had the "the MP/LA Expert Group" in there

[01:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
under the category "seemingly-benign-pawns"

[01:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok, now with even more wisdom: http://logopoeia.com/wisdom/

[01:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, slightly more

[01:58:00.0000] <annevk2>
first hit: "the divine principle of time inequality is encoded in Anne van Kesteren's weblog."

[01:58:01.0000] <annevk2>
though reading further it also says "the divine principle of time inequality is encoded in the Nag Hammadi Library"

[01:59:00.0000] <annevk2>
"Eminent thinkers throughout history (Roy Fielding, etc.) agree that the divine principle of time inequality is the transcendental principle behind all creation" :p

[02:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is any spec responsible for XMLSerializer?

[02:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
nope

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
:-( there should be

[02:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It turns out that MySpace uses it on HTML DOMs and makes expectations 

[02:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe XMLSerializer and DOMParser can be snuck into Web DOM Core

[02:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
what expectations do they have?

[02:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: they expect no generated namespace declarations

[02:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
where do they depend on that?

[02:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Safari would generate namespace declarations and so violate their expectation

[02:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
they except h=h.replace(/<html>|<\/html>|<html\/>/gi,"")  to zap the root element tags

[02:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
when updating status/mood

[02:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you're making it sound like their way to do status updates is a Rube Goldberg device

[02:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: it is

[03:10:00.0000] <roc>
if we want an good baseline video codec

[03:10:01.0000] <roc>
and the barrier is the choices made by device manufacturers and their hardware suppliers

[03:10:02.0000] <roc>
and their decisions are purely economic

[03:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how varied are the DSPs used in contemporary handhelds?

[03:11:01.0000] <roc>
then the only practical way forward is to encourage the proliferation of content in an unencumbered codec, to tip that economic balance

[03:12:00.0000] <roc>
so it seems to me that everyone who's interested in having a good baseline video codec should be encouraging that

[03:13:00.0000] <roc>
including by supporting Theora wherever the device constraints do not apply

[03:15:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: a lot are using these OMAP chips, but a lot aren't

[03:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
just wondering if writing for a Nokia shipped TI chip results in any portability to whatever Apple uses in iPhone

[03:16:01.0000] <roc>
I believe the answer is no

[03:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok :-(

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh hey, gsnedders just invaded my inbox via our bug tracking software

[03:42:01.0000] <annevk2>
welcome!

[03:45:00.0000] <roc>
annevk2: I already made your point about vendor consensus!

[03:46:00.0000] <roc>
therefore it's a good one :-)

[03:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
is Web DOM Core a W3C deliverable already?

[03:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: mwhaha?

[03:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
roc, teaches me to read the whole thread first (over and over again...) :)

[03:49:01.0000] <roc>
this is why gmail is superior

[03:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hasn't read the whole thread but points out that Nokia ships Flash on Maemo

[03:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what *that* does to battery life when watching YouTube

[03:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should measure

[04:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
roc, congrats btw on Firefox 3.5, haven't tried the official release yet, but it sure seems like a great product

[04:31:00.0000] <roc>
thanks

[04:34:00.0000] <roc>
but 3.6prealpha1 is what the cool kids are using these days :-)

[04:35:00.0000] <annevk2>
so I hear, with a certain pref turned on rather than off :)

[04:36:00.0000] <takkaria>
roc: what exciting stuff is planned for firefox.next?

[04:38:00.0000] <roc>
Henri's HTML5 parser is on trunk, I assume that's what Anne was referring to

[04:38:01.0000] <roc>
hopefully we'll turn it on for FF.next

[04:39:00.0000] <roc>
well, I'm sure we'll turn it on, the question is whether we'll turn it off after we see what it does to the Web :-)

[04:39:01.0000] <takkaria>
hehe

[04:39:02.0000] <roc>
multiple backgrounds is already on trunk

[04:39:03.0000] <takkaria>
is there anyone looking at webforms stuff?

[04:40:00.0000] <roc>
someone is looking at file upload

[04:40:01.0000] <roc>
I'm not sure what that plan is

[04:41:00.0000] <roc>
Jonas is working on XBL2, I suspect we may try to build new web forms stuff on top of that

[04:41:01.0000] <roc>
<video poster> is on trunk

[04:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
fun. text-indent makes WebKit indent the video controller

[04:41:03.0000] <hsivonen>
in both Chrome and Safari

[04:42:00.0000] <roc>
lots of other stuff is going on

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. looks like Cortado doesn't work right in IE with two instances on the same page :-(

[04:44:01.0000] <takkaria>
roc: sounds cool, I should start reading the mozilla planet again sometime

[04:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. maybe I should try to get my blog feed on planet so that I could advertise the HTML5 parser once the Windows crasher patch and comment end bang state are in

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how are Xiph Cortado and Wikimedia Cortado related? I suspect the Wikimedia Cortado worked better than the Xiph one in IE.

[04:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think it's important to promote Ogg-only video also for IE, so that people don't need to use royalty-encumbered fallback formats, but it seems Cortado isn't quite ready for prime time

[05:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
has anyone researched the h.264 patents to find out when they're all due to expire, which would make h.264 royalty free?

[05:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
I checked the MPEG-LA patent list earlier, but they only mention the expiration dates for the few that already expired. The others just list patent numbers

[05:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Seeming the first draft was 1999, I would guess no earlier than 17 years after that

[05:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The final draft was 2003, so potentially 2020

[05:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hey, that's before 2022 :-)

[05:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[05:29:00.0000] <roc>
the problem is that there will be an H.265 or whatever

[05:29:01.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: yes, you should definitely be on planet.mozilla.org

[05:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
roc, are you just speculating about h.265, or is there already work in progress?

[05:30:01.0000] <roc>
I'm speculating

[05:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: "under study for potential development" according to wikipedia

[05:30:03.0000] <hsivonen>
has On2 said anything about why they made the VP3 stuff free but not VP6?

[05:30:04.0000] <roc>
why wouldn't there be?

[05:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if On2 will provide nicely packaged Theora encoding solutions

[05:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.265

[05:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I thought the patent term was 20 years, not 17

[05:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: It depends on country. Don't expect me to remember the max :)

[05:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
"Patents must be granted in all "fields of technology," although exceptions for certain public interests are allowed (Art. 27.2 and 27.3 [1]) and must be enforceable for at least 20 years (Art 33)." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIPS#The_requirements_of_TRIPS

[05:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
so that applies to all countries that have agreed with TRIPS

[05:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
quick black-box poking suggests the XMLSerializer in WebKit is already an HTML serializer when applied to HTML

[05:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the right mailing list for XMLSerializer? www-dom?

[05:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see how www-dom would be relevant

[05:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what ARIA cases is chaals referring to here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2009AprJun/0009.html ?

[06:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
no idea. Unfortunately, he's not around for me to ask him

[06:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: about XMLSerializer, lacking any better place, I'd say public-webapps, 

[06:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok.

[06:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: btw, I ran the V.nu deployment script yesterday

[06:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: cool

[06:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll see if I can get the W3C instance synced up too

[06:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, is QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR used in webstorage defined as a constant anywhere for DOMException?

[06:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
does anyone here working on WebKit know if you enforce any disk quota limits for localStorage and sessionStorage?

[06:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just tried testing it with an infinite loop that keeps storing data until it throws an exception, but it just kept going

[07:00:00.0000] <Rik|work>
Lachy: I've seen bugs to fix that

[07:00:01.0000] <Rik|work>
don't know if they're closed or not

[07:02:00.0000] <Rik|work>
Lachy: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22765

[07:02:01.0000] <Rik|work>
and https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26155

[07:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
Rik|work, ok. I'd recommend also setting a quota for sessionStorage

[07:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: yt?

[07:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: What's "ouch" about http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#baseURIs-Considerations?

[07:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. looks like Daily Motion has some borked browser sniffing

[07:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Telling me to install Firefox in order to see video without proprietary plug-ins

[07:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
when I'm using Firefox

[07:52:02.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, liveness

[07:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oops. I've overridden my User-Agent string

[07:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: Ah, OK. So nothing more.

[07:53:02.0000] <annevk2>
maybe

[07:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Heh. Opera's the only browser that ever treats it as live, though we have bugs.

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, willing to write the spec for XMLSerializer and DOMParser?

[07:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: can't volunteer right now :-(

[08:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
href in the DOM on HTMLAnchorElement doesn't give the absolute URL, right? The only way to get that is to recompose the decomposition attributes?

[08:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: It gives the absolute URL

[08:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The spec says that it reflects the content attribute though…

[08:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie?

[08:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, yes, but it reflects a URL value

[08:20:01.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, see the definition of reflect

[08:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: Ah, right. I need to actually read beyond the note

[08:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk2: The definition of reflect could be improved to note that there are special cases wwhere the behaviour is more complex

[08:25:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, that's just an introductory note, it doesn't define anything

[08:26:00.0000] <annevk2>
but euh, I'm not the editor :)

[08:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
attribute [ReflectURL] DOMString src;

[08:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
[[

[08:29:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
This indicates that the src DOM attribute reflects a content attribute  

[08:29:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
named src, but that the result is a completed URL, not the raw  

[08:29:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
attribute value:

[08:29:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
]]

[08:29:06.0000] <annevk2>
I'd think you want [Reflect=URL]

[08:30:00.0000] <annevk2>
'cause all "reflect" thingies have something in common, but some have specific types

[08:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
(e.g. they all create a new content attribute if none exists)

[08:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: I guess they didn't do it that way maybe because of  [Reflect=URL] would imply there's a content attribute named "URL"

[08:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because they're also doing, attribute [Reflect=class] DOMString className;

[08:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
I see

[08:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: Is there any spec which says http://t/imported/annevk/xml/xml-base/004.xht should pass?

[10:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is Perl installed on OS X by default?

[10:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, sounds like it is

[10:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why somebody gets a "perl: No match." error

[10:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, it's because they're using csh and writing "[...]" on the command line

[10:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: web dom core iirc

[11:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: yt?

[11:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: I'm here now

[11:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for a while at least

[12:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith and gsnedders are like star crossed lovers

[12:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[12:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders where he can buy a birthday card, and what he should get as a present.

[12:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: A birthday card shop

[12:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Located where in Linköping, at what address?

[12:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: A tea towel

[12:56:03.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: make your own

[12:56:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I don't know - walk around and look for one that has thousands of birthday cards in the front window

[12:56:05.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Me!?

[12:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Do I look creative?

[12:57:01.0000] <takkaria>
if you write code, you're at least somewhat creative

[12:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Do I look as if I have artist capabilities?

[12:59:00.0000] <takkaria>
/me shrugs

[13:01:00.0000] <takkaria>
looks can be and often are deceiving

[13:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnBokia sells some cards if you don't fancy DIYing it

[13:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh he left. That's why tab did nothing

[14:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
WebSocket ports and schemes; text/html and application/xhtml+xml; text/cache-manifest; text/event-stream; application/microdata+json and application/microdata+bibtex

[14:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
anything else need registering with IANA?

[14:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
text/javascript update?

[14:50:00.0000] <annevk2>
someone needs to finish http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoehrmann-javascript-scheme

[14:51:00.0000] <annevk2>
ideally the character encoding stuff would be fixed at the IETF/IANA/Unicode-level

[14:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
rel values needs some more coordination prolly

[14:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
is text/uri-list defined?

[14:57:00.0000] <annevk2>
only as experimental in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2483 afaict

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i'll leave those for now

[14:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
but yeah

[14:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[16:34:00.0000] <sayrer>
lol, hixie sent "suitable" to whatwg and "consensus" to w3c

[16:34:01.0000] <sayrer>
hahaha

[18:36:00.0000] <roc>
what did we do to deserve Tom Lord

[18:53:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
roc: it seems he's managed to equally annoy all sides of the font discussion

[18:53:01.0000] <roc>
he's veering towards troll status

[19:05:00.0000] <sayrer>
he's the peter kasting of fonts

[19:07:00.0000] <sayrer>
I have to say, the whatwg has reached epic bullshit status this week

[19:08:00.0000] <sayrer>
private feedback has determined there is no suitable codec

[19:08:01.0000] <sayrer>
I wonder if people realize that is indistinguishable from collusion

[19:09:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I personally would opt for the "screw Apple + Nokia and make Theora the de jure standard, as it's fast becoming de facto"

[19:09:01.0000] <jcranmer>
but I'm not going to push the issue

[19:09:02.0000] <sayrer>
jcranmer: h.264 is an open standard! didn't you read othermaciej_'s mail?

[19:10:00.0000] <sayrer>
all of the relevant stakeholders were involved

[19:10:01.0000] <jcranmer>
sayrer: that's why I referred to `de facto' as reasoning

[19:10:02.0000] <jcranmer>
sayrer: which one?

[19:10:03.0000] <sayrer>
groan

[19:10:04.0000] <sayrer>
nevermind

[19:11:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I kind of skimmed over them

[19:11:01.0000] <sayrer>
fair enough

[19:11:02.0000] <sayrer>
here is my edit: http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2009/07/01/offered-without-comment-4/

[19:12:00.0000] <jcranmer>
ah, I found it

[19:12:01.0000] <sayrer>
I like how people that have gone through media training think they can say anything

[19:12:02.0000] <sayrer>
it's kind of funny

[19:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
sayrer: it's not clear to me what problem you have with that statement

[19:12:04.0000] <othermaciej>
it's true that H.264 is an open standard

[19:12:05.0000] <jcranmer>
just like patents are open standards

[19:13:00.0000] <sayrer>
othermaciej: say it enough and it becomes true

[19:13:01.0000] <sayrer>
:)

[19:13:02.0000] <jcranmer>
it doesn't mean that you can actually use them

[19:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
sayrer: the normal definition of "open stanard" doesn't automatically imply royalty-free licensing

[19:13:04.0000] <jcranmer>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard disagrees

[19:13:05.0000] <jcranmer>
"The term "open" is usually restricted to royalty-free  technologies"

[19:14:00.0000] <jcranmer>
(2nd para)

[19:14:01.0000] <sayrer>
but that was written by hippies, obviously

[19:14:02.0000] <jcranmer>
"The definitions of the term "open standard" used by academics, the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark, France, and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use, as do the New Zealand and the Venezuelan governments."

[19:14:03.0000] <sayrer>
othermaciej: how about this: proprietary is where you pay

[19:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wikipedia seems to disagree with actual standards orgs (as stated in later paragraphs)

[19:15:01.0000] <sayrer>
funny

[19:15:02.0000] <sayrer>
wonder why

[19:16:00.0000] <jcranmer>
nearly everyone concurs that "open" == "free" (as in beer)

[19:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Ogg Theora on the other hand is not a de jure standard at all, even though it has an open source implementation and is not known to be covered by non-RF patents

[19:16:02.0000] <sayrer>
but anyway, private feedback settling on MPEG-LA codecs is indistinguishable from collusion

[19:17:00.0000] <sayrer>
no matter what the intentions are

[19:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
to me these are all orthogonal factors, and I didn't know that was controversial

[19:17:02.0000] <jcranmer>
it's becoming de facto

[19:17:03.0000] <jcranmer>
as I said before, if Hulu and Youtube both go for Theora in <video>

[19:17:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I mentioned the standards process used for H.264 because getting all the vendors involved is part of why it has an ecosystem around it

[19:18:00.0000] <sayrer>
clearly not all vendors

[19:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
H.264 actually had hardware implementations before it saw any significant Web use

[19:18:02.0000] <sayrer>
just enough to charge others

[19:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
all right, strike "all" and replace with "many"

[19:19:00.0000] <jcranmer>
"many

[19:19:01.0000] <jcranmer>
er

[19:19:02.0000] <sayrer>
not that all vendors comrpise "relevant stakeholders"

[19:19:03.0000] <jcranmer>
"many", presumably does not include about 90% of browser market share

[19:19:04.0000] <jcranmer>
s/,//

[19:19:05.0000] <sayrer>
yeah, that's true

[19:19:06.0000] <othermaciej>
the Ogg spec, on the other hand, is unilateral, which may be part of why it doesn't have the same level of tools support

[19:19:07.0000] <sayrer>
please

[19:19:08.0000] <jcranmer>
this is getting pointless

[19:20:00.0000] <sayrer>
no doubt

[19:20:01.0000] <sayrer>
later

[19:20:02.0000] <jcranmer>
it's basically a religion war

[19:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
/me shrugs

[19:20:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I just wanted to inject some factual information to the discussion

[19:20:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't want to get into the religious war part of it

[19:20:06.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not just a religious war, it's a format war

[19:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
format wars are unpleasant and suck for everyone

[19:21:01.0000] <jcranmer>
well, a standard that 90% of the world doesn't support isn't exactly a useful standard

[19:21:02.0000] <jcranmer>
which is probably why SVG sees so little web usage

[19:21:03.0000] <jcranmer>
2/3 of the web can't use it

[19:21:04.0000] <jcranmer>
er, users

[19:21:05.0000] <othermaciej>
not sure what you're referring to there

[19:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
standard status is a separate thing from deployment

[19:22:01.0000] <jcranmer>
HTML is SGML, right?

[19:22:02.0000] <jcranmer>
I'll go use <br/ and see how web browsers like it!

[19:22:03.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML 4.01 was SGML in theory but not in practice

[19:22:04.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML 5 is not SGML even in theory

[19:23:00.0000] <jcranmer>
NNTP is UTF-8 in theory, in practice it's whatever-the-server-decides

[19:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
/me is not sure how this is relevant to video

[19:23:02.0000] <jcranmer>
it's not what the standard says that matters

[19:23:03.0000] <jcranmer>
it's what the web browsers do

[19:23:04.0000] <othermaciej>
isn't the whole dispute here over what the standard should say?

[19:23:05.0000] <jcranmer>
and if a significant share decides it's untenable to support the standard, the standard will be ignored

[19:24:00.0000] <jcranmer>
the crux of the matter is that the two sides are so extreme in their viewpoint that no consensus can be reached since a significant share would ignore it

[19:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's probably true

[19:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
we also don't have any input from Microsoft on whether they are willing to implement <video> at all, though they are pretty clearly on record as not being willing to support Ogg

[19:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(H.264 will ship as a built-in codec on Windows 7, so I guess they don't have a problem with it as a codec in general)

[19:25:01.0000] <jcranmer>
besides, HTML 5 is essentially, in large part, a codification of de facto web stuff 

[19:35:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
safari's <video> support is defined as "whatever quicktime supports," no?

[19:35:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
if i install XiphQT (Ogg QuickTime components) on my wife's Mac, Safari 4 plays  Ogg video demos

[19:36:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
is there any legal reason that every single non-apple stakeholder couldn't bundle XiphQT with their mac installer?

[19:42:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i.e. install mac firefox, get ogg video in safari for free

[19:43:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
install mac chrome, get ogg video in safari for free

[19:43:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
(yes i work for google, no i haven't discussed this internally. i'm just brainstorming here.)

[19:44:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
wouldn't solve the iphone problem, but all modern macs are fast enough to decode ogg video in software anyway

[19:44:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
on the desktop, it's just a codec installation problem

[20:06:00.0000] <roc_>
mpilgrim: the possibility of installing Firefox leading to other apps breaking is scary

[20:06:01.0000] <roc>
mpilgrim: also, what if someone uninstalls Firefox? do you uninstall the codec? If not, who does the security updates?

[20:07:00.0000] <roc>
mpilgrim: then there's the issue that people who install other browsers probably don't use Safari much

[20:07:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
doesn't have to be just browsers

[20:07:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
lots of things bundle other things

[20:08:00.0000] <jcgregorio>
openoffice and java

[20:09:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
xiphqt 0.1.9 was released a few weeks ago

[20:09:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
the release before that was in 2007

[20:09:02.0000] <roc>
the other issues are still pretty big issues

[20:10:00.0000] <sayrer>
but they are not legal ones, to speak to mpilgrim's point

[20:10:01.0000] <sayrer>
not having access to the system update stream is a problem, for sure

[20:11:00.0000] <sayrer>
and the end game is probably signed executables on Mac OS X

[20:11:01.0000] <sayrer>
first they came for your iphone, then your tablet, then your laptop, then your tower

[20:12:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
that's not news; even gruber figured that out after the iphone sdk was released

[20:12:01.0000] <sayrer>
I am agreeing with you, then

[20:12:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
yes

[20:12:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
usually when that happens, it means it's time for me to reexamine my position

[20:12:04.0000] <sayrer>
haha

[20:13:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
but i think we are in violent agreement on theora and vorbis

[20:13:01.0000] <sayrer>
well, probably just tactical disagreement

[20:14:00.0000] <sayrer>
at any rate, I don't think Mozilla would choose to ship/maintain an ogg vorbis implementation if it didn't have to

[20:14:01.0000] <sayrer>
roc knows better, though

[20:14:02.0000] <roc>
depends what you mean by "have to"

[20:15:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i am... disappointed (but not surprised) that my employer is shipping h.264

[20:15:01.0000] <roc>
If Quicktime and DirectShow supported Ogg Vorbis and Theora, would we just plug into them?

[20:15:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
and elated (and surprised) that we are shipping theora

[20:15:03.0000] <roc>
Probably not

[20:15:04.0000] <sayrer>
it makes total sense if you have a h264 license, kinda

[20:16:00.0000] <sayrer>
roc, why not?

[20:16:01.0000] <roc>
it makes total sense if you have an H.264 license and don't care whether the Web is royalty-free

[20:16:02.0000] <sayrer>
well, or you care more about everything working in your minority browser

[20:17:00.0000] <sayrer>
we have been there, in not so patent-encumbered areas

[20:17:01.0000] <roc>
 /don't care/don't care very much/

[20:17:02.0000] <sayrer>
fair enough

[20:18:00.0000] <roc>
sayrer: http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2009/06/directshow_and.html

[20:18:01.0000] <sayrer>
but that

[20:18:02.0000] <sayrer>
is for any directshow thing

[20:19:00.0000] <sayrer>
if we sniff for ogg, we could only send ogg

[20:19:01.0000] <roc>
oh, you're suggesting we could use DirectShow but only for Ogg?

[20:19:02.0000] <sayrer>
well, system ogg from anyone

[20:19:03.0000] <sayrer>
anyone but us

[20:19:04.0000] <roc>
I don't really see the point

[20:19:05.0000] <roc>
it would just make our lives harder

[20:19:06.0000] <sayrer>
oh?

[20:19:07.0000] <roc>
we'd be driving the codec from arm's length

[20:20:00.0000] <sayrer>
that

[20:20:01.0000] <sayrer>
is true. less control.

[20:20:02.0000] <roc>
we'd have to interact with different versions of the codec

[20:20:03.0000] <sayrer>
but ogg in firefox would work with ogg in browser foo.

[20:20:04.0000] <roc>
we'd be exposed if the vendor didn't do security updates

[20:20:05.0000] <sayrer>
that last part is our problem

[20:20:06.0000] <mpilgrim>
/me is unclear how all of these problems don't bother apple

[20:21:00.0000] <roc>
mpilgrim: they control the framework

[20:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
of third-party codecs?

[20:21:02.0000] <roc>
mpilgrim: and they control almost all the codecs that actual users have installed

[20:21:03.0000] <sayrer>
they control the things that work on iphones and ipods

[20:21:04.0000] <sayrer>
and probably apple tvs and god knows what else

[20:21:05.0000] <roc>
mpilgrim: I have been told that there have already been Quicktime changes to make it work better/safer with Web video

[20:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there are, I believe, a number of popular QuickTime codec add-ons besides Ogg (I'm not sure Ogg is even the most popular)

[20:22:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
i'd guess divx is the most popular

[20:22:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
due to existing bundling and massive marketing

[20:22:03.0000] <sayrer>
they don't work on the ipod though

[20:22:04.0000] <sayrer>
interoperability problems

[20:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the fact that Apple can ship good quality versions of the codecs we care about to all our target platforms is sufficient

[20:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
we don't consider allowing other codecs to plug in a problem

[20:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I wouldn't even rule out a future Safari being able to use DirectShow on Windows

[20:23:03.0000] <sayrer>
yes, Apple has explicitly stated that control is the issue

[20:24:00.0000] <sayrer>
so if other people plug in, and don't disrupt that control, it is a non issue

[20:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Mozilla seems to have even greater control issues in that you don't even want to let other people plug in (short of forking)

[20:24:02.0000] <sayrer>
that seems weird to say...

[20:25:00.0000] <sayrer>
we allow people to plug in and do basically anything

[20:26:00.0000] <sayrer>
including undermine the business model of our biggest partners

[20:26:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
could a firefox extension provide support for other video formats in the <video> element?

[20:26:02.0000] <sayrer>
I don't know off hand, but I think we should allow that

[20:26:03.0000] <roc>
Quicktime had 10 security fixes in June, for a variety of pretty much unused formats

[20:26:04.0000] <roc>
that's a whole lot of attack surface that I don't really want to be exposed to

[20:27:00.0000] <sayrer>
in theory, the extension setup should allow it

[20:27:01.0000] <sayrer>
but there might be details to thwart

[20:27:02.0000] <roc>
mpilgrim: that's not possible right now

[20:27:03.0000] <othermaciej>
fwiw we restrict the set of codecs we support, mainly to remove things that aren't audio/video codecs at all (since QuickTime is overly general) and some obsolete codecs

[20:27:04.0000] <sayrer>
roc, bummer. how come?

[20:27:05.0000] <othermaciej>
but it's a blacklist, not a whitelist

[20:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so third-party codecs are not excluded

[20:28:01.0000] <roc>
sayrer: because the decoder interface is reasonably nice and frequently changing, not an XPCOM pain barrier

[20:29:00.0000] <sayrer>
oh, and there is no higher level thing to plug into?

[20:29:01.0000] <sayrer>
short of rewriting the video element, obviously

[20:29:02.0000] <roc>
no

[20:29:03.0000] <roc>
there's the video element

[20:29:04.0000] <roc>
there are decoders, nsOggDecoder and nsWaveDecoder

[20:29:05.0000] <roc>
and there are services that decoders can use, like the media cache

[20:30:00.0000] <sayrer>
but there is no way to register as a decoder?

[20:30:01.0000] <roc>
no

[20:30:02.0000] <sayrer>
ok

[20:30:03.0000] <roc>
the decoder list is compiled in

[20:30:04.0000] <roc>
fixing that would be pretty easy

[20:30:05.0000] <roc>
but the interface is very much C++ and not all pure virtual functions

[20:30:06.0000] <roc>
and it changes a lot

[20:30:07.0000] <sayrer>
we could promise only source compatibility

[20:31:00.0000] <roc>
perhaps the biggest problem is that the symbols you need to use aren't exported from libxul

[20:31:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
seems like i've started a constructive conversation

[20:31:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
so this is what it feels like...

[20:31:03.0000] <roc>
mpilgrim: no, sayrer's exploring a road that I don't think is that interesting to go down

[20:32:00.0000] <sayrer>
see, fool's gold

[20:32:01.0000] <sayrer>
roc, I can see exploding maintainability

[20:33:00.0000] <sayrer>
roc, but why do you think it is not interesting?

[20:33:01.0000] <roc>
realistically the value of supporting pluggable codecs on the Web is very low

[20:33:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
so othermaciej was right; firefox's audio/video support is tightly controlled

[20:33:03.0000] <roc>
since most people won't have them, Web authors can't use them

[20:33:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
by virtue of being hardcoded and not extensible

[20:34:00.0000] <sayrer>
mpilgrim, on one axis, you are right.

[20:34:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
i'm not saying it was intentional

[20:34:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
it seems more like a side effect

[20:34:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
but as you would say, "the end result is the same"

[20:35:00.0000] <doublec>
the point of video originally was not to be a plugin based system wasn't it?

[20:35:01.0000] <sayrer>
fair, but the end result is not quite the same

[20:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
although roc implied in his blog post that it was an active goal not to support other codecs (no idea if other Mozillians share his views)

[20:35:03.0000] <doublec>
once codec, that could be assured to work across all systems

[20:35:04.0000] <doublec>
so content providers didn't have to wonde

[20:35:05.0000] <doublec>
r if their format would work

[20:35:06.0000] <roc>
I don't think it's oppressive to fail to have extension points

[20:35:07.0000] <sayrer>
yes, when the full browser is open source

[20:36:00.0000] <sayrer>
(yes, except for the effing logos, mpilgrim)

[20:36:01.0000] <roc>
if someone's got a great open source codec, and they're willing to do some work, we can integrate it

[20:36:02.0000] <sayrer>
it may prove to be irrelevant

[20:36:03.0000] <sayrer>
firefox seems to take share from safari 

[20:37:00.0000] <sayrer>
and Chrome will probably take share from both

[20:37:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
there are few codecs that are modern, interesting, used, open, and royalty-free

[20:38:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
(for the record, i don't think chrome has any support either for adding video codecs in its upcoming extension system)

[20:38:01.0000] <sayrer>
one thing that puzzles me is the ambivalence towards mpeg-la's intention to charge

[20:38:02.0000] <sayrer>
that seems incredibly bad

[20:39:00.0000] <sayrer>
and it

[20:40:00.0000] <sayrer>
it's not clear to me that joint client/publishers like apple and google have to face that

[20:40:01.0000] <roc>
what puzzles me is the reluctance of some people I respect to do anything to help avoid a royalty-required format becoming part of the Web platform

[20:40:02.0000] <sayrer>
I think that they care about other things more

[20:42:00.0000] <sayrer>
and there is certainly a willingness to believe that the latest winner of a benchmark contest has sealed the deal

[20:42:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
i'm pleased to see wikimedia accelerating their plans to integrate theora video into wikipedia

[20:43:00.0000] <sayrer>
but I wouldn't be surprised to see MS, Opera, or someone else enter at a large advantage. present competition strong though it is.

[20:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for what little it's worth, my personal position is that on the whole, royalty-bearing standards and software patents in general are a bad thing for the industry, but I don't have the means to do anything about it in this case

[20:45:00.0000] <sayrer>
I do think roc's point about the defaults is a good one

[20:45:01.0000] <sayrer>
the default choice pretty much makes the game

[20:50:00.0000] <sayrer>
so, you can after extension points, and make them super duper extensible, but it might not matter a whole lot

[20:50:01.0000] <sayrer>
go after

[20:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
What works in a default install is probably more important

[20:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's one reason using the system media framework would be different from just having a hypothetical extension point

[20:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
otoh QuickTime's extensibility could make it easier for Ogg to drive demand

[20:53:02.0000] <sayrer>
there are two considerations

[20:53:03.0000] <sayrer>
works in Firefox, works in all browsers on OS Foo

[20:53:04.0000] <sayrer>
at least, from our perspective :)

[20:55:00.0000] <sayrer>
some Mozilla derivatives ship many more codecs by default

[23:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
did google just change the style of the results page a tiny bit?

[23:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
every time i've done a search in the past like 5 hours i've felt like something was subtly different

[23:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe Google recently increased the left margin

[23:44:00.0000] <gavin_>
yeah that's really throwing me off

[23:45:00.0000] <gavin_>
I'll get used to it eventually :)

[23:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
holy crap, looks like google search now uses the html5 doctype

[23:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess this html5 thing really is going to take off

[23:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
google is now in standards mode!

[23:48:02.0000] <ezyang>
oh ho ho :-)

yeah, maybe

[23:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
though i'm sure it was intentional

[23:49:03.0000] <Hixie>

I dunno... I thought the margins were weird 

[23:50:01.0000] <ezyang>
Standards mode makes it suddenly make sense. 

[23:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
they probably ran an experiment where they tested every possible margin from 0px to 20px and used the one that made people the most efficient in searching

the XMLSerializer thing

[00:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes XMLSerializer, innerHTML  and XHR didn't have "XML" or "HTML" in their names

[00:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well those Dreamweaver screenshots make it pretty clear that Dreamweaver users are highly likely to write bad table summaries

[01:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, I suppose what you suggest makes sense for XMLSerializer

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: good :-)

[01:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me wonders how hard XMLSerializer and DOMParser are to spec now that HTML5 defines all the primitives

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
was there some kind of solution for running the tokenizer tests in a browser that doesn't expose the interface between the tokenizer and the treebuilder, so you can only observe the tree?

[01:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
like a JavaScript impl of the tokenizer?

[01:54:01.0000] <annevk5>
I think Philip` had one

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: no, I mean having a JS harness that feeds html5lib tokenizer test to the browser-native parser and makes conclusions from the tree output rather than raw token output

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
cool. a word on codecs form Opera.

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh I see, hmm

[02:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so in that case run in Gecko it would show if the Java to C++ translator introduced bugs into the tokenizer

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
huh? Mozilla supports MJPEG in <img>? demo?

[02:43:00.0000] <roc>

"word on codecs from Opera"?

[02:45:00.0000] <jgraham>

[02:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: ok. no real MJPEG then.

[02:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>

(which collapses parts that are repetitions of previous parts of the thread)

[04:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
woohoo! Opera has added OpenType support since the first 10 Alpha. more interop!

[04:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
People who want interop in practice will have to provide EOT to IE users, and IE only supports fonts with TrueType outlines :-(

[04:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: only people who care about feature parity in IE

[04:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
i.e. most people in the real world

[05:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whew. finally caught up with my other-than-public-html W3C email

[05:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mostly by not reading all the Origin and font threads

[05:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I think we need some scare quotes and different points of view around "real world" :-)

[05:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: But I have data, so I necessarily win the argument conclusively - out of three people who've contacted me about my font optimizer tool, one wanted it for PDFs and the other two wanted to generate EOTs :-)

[05:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: bah. data. I claim expertise!

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
seriously, though, I think we need to get authors create sites that use the new Web platform features even when IE doesn't support them

[05:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and fonts seems to be particularly additive rather than a feature that makes content unbrowsable if not supported

[05:16:00.0000] <beowulf>
hsivonen: hard to sell something to a client that looks 'right' in everything but IE

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
beowulf: this has to start with sites that aren't made for clients

[05:17:01.0000] <beowulf>

also how it's not per origin but per registered domain

[05:24:02.0000] <annevk4>
it's insane

[05:25:00.0000] <annevk4>
they must be on some pretty bad enterprise crack

[05:27:00.0000] <takkaria>
what could be better than making spurious HEAD requests on every web site you visit?

[05:28:00.0000] <annevk4>
also funny that they called the header x-ua-compatible and this file is clearly vendor specific

[05:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
was this behavior always there or does this come in an autoupdate or something?

[05:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think the file is actually IEStandards.xml, not iestandards.xml

[05:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is kind of an important distinction for anyone not using IIS

[05:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>

[07:05:00.0000] <annevk2>
mkay, assuming you mean the one Hixie edits, I wonder how you're going to do it :)

[07:06:00.0000] <sayrer>
oh, I'll make a copy and change it from there

[07:06:01.0000] <sayrer>
no edit wars

[07:06:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But edit wars add drama to life!

[07:06:03.0000] <annevk2>
sayrer, ah ok, makes sense

[07:06:04.0000] <sayrer>
gsnedders: I have accepted your feedback. I will reply with 4 months

[07:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
sayrer: Only four? Dude, you need to learn how to edit specs! :)

[07:07:03.0000] <sayrer>
gsnedders: it says so right on there on my blog

[07:07:04.0000] <sayrer>
oh wait, that's elementary web design

[07:07:05.0000] <sayrer>
I get confused easily

[07:07:06.0000] <Midler>
/me think gsnedders life just exstended with 4month?

[07:08:00.0000] <annevk2>
(edit wars works for me, but I believe only Hixie has write access to the source file so any changes would be overwritten each time the spec is generated)

[07:08:01.0000] <sayrer>
Actually, I was looking at the source

[07:09:00.0000] <sayrer>
and there are these comments saying "YOU MUST TALK TO IAN BEFORE CHANGING THIS TEXT"

[07:09:01.0000] <sayrer>
I wonder who those are directed to

[07:09:02.0000] <sayrer>
I decided they don't apply to me

[07:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
That was because of changes made before publication to /TR/, I believe

[07:09:04.0000] <annevk2>
W3C pubteam

[07:10:00.0000] <sayrer>
ah I see

[07:10:01.0000] <sayrer>
I won't be taking feedback via the whatwg lists, so I have to change some parts

[07:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
i wouldn't expect it to apply to forks anyway

[07:11:01.0000] <annevk2>
that wouldn't make sense

[07:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
but are you sure you're looking at the source?

[07:12:01.0000] <sayrer>
it might be a header file that had that

[07:12:02.0000] <sayrer>
I don't think it would make sense, either

[07:12:03.0000] <sayrer>
but... Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks!

[07:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
yadayada

[07:15:01.0000] <sayrer>
also, I need to update the spec to disallow private feedback on certain issues

[07:15:02.0000] <sayrer>
basically anything controversial

[07:16:00.0000] <sayrer>
I thought about trying to disallow it completely, but it seems like I would have to recuse myself from hallway conversations

[07:16:01.0000] <sayrer>
not a credible way of going about things :)

[07:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
"No, sorry, I can't accept your comment. Good bye."

[07:17:00.0000] <sayrer>
on video codecs, that's exactly what I'll say

[07:17:01.0000] <sayrer>
well, maybe "send your comment to the list" would be better, and a touch more polite

[07:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
so you're saying you will no longer have hallway or lunch conversations on <video>?

[07:19:01.0000] <annevk2>
sounds pretty tough

[07:19:02.0000] <sayrer>
on codecs

[07:20:00.0000] <sayrer>
there are plenty of other parts

[07:21:00.0000] <sayrer>
In fact, I won't even discuss codecs here

[07:21:01.0000] <sayrer>
only on the list

[07:25:00.0000] <annevk2>
that is starting now or so?

[07:26:00.0000] <annevk2>
doesn't really matter I suppose; anyway, I'm curious what your draft will look like

[07:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should give me CVS access so I can make a version of the spec where all the letters are upside down

[07:47:00.0000] <sayrer>
Philip`: that would be awesome!

[07:48:00.0000] <takkaria>
or you could make all 'i's that Turkish cahracter that looks like 'i' but without the dot

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: Maybe I should replace them all with http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0D%0A%26%23x131%3B%3Cblink%3E%26%23x307%3B%3C%2Fblink%3E

[07:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
except sadly that appears to be buggy in pretty much all browsers :-(

[07:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
Firefox and IE on Windows ignore the styling of the dot entirely

[07:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Firefox on Linux doesn't even draw the dot

[07:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
sayrer, re http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2009/07/02/secrets/ - why are you surprised that Hixie accepts feedback that gets sent to him privately? That's certainly not the first time he's mentioned that and it would be silly for him to reject it

[08:00:00.0000] <sayrer>
I am not surprised

[08:00:01.0000] <sayrer>
no comment on the silliness

[08:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, then I'm not sure I get the point of what you're trying to say about it

[08:04:00.0000] <sayrer>
Lachy: I can live with that

[08:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if it worth pointing out that we may be unable to get consensus on not specifying codecs, decides it is not

[08:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, so we're damned if we do and damned if we don't? Cool!

[08:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: damn you.

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why do people like Flash and <video> more than they like <embed>/<object> methods of embedding videos?

[08:17:00.0000] <ezyang>
I think it's because they promise to "just work" 

[08:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, ignoring the fact that Flash uses object/embed, using object/embed for regular video files historically depends on 3rd party codecs that may not be present for all users

[08:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What should .min and .max return on an HTMLInputElement which doesn't allow min/max?

[08:18:02.0000] <Lachy>
whereas Flash already has sufficient market penetration for that problem to be ignorable

[08:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, what does the spec say?

[08:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I can't find the spec saying anything.

[08:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(wrt to this)

[08:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: undefined, no?

[08:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
Because you are doing a property lookup of a non-existent property

[08:21:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: But the spec says min/max return a DOMString, so surely that's wrong?

[08:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
the spec says they should reflect the content attributes

[08:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh you mean in the case where min/max are supported but not relevant to that particular type of input

[08:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes

[08:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
so my guess is that even though they don't apply to certain controls, should still return whatever values were specified (if any) or the default value if not

[08:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Empty string then

[08:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
(or the values that were supplied)

[08:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
From my reading of the spec they should return an empty string or what was given.

[08:23:04.0000] <gsnedders>
There is no default value.

[08:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
The empty string is the deafult value

[08:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
so we all agree

[08:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
No need for anyone to get CVS access and modify the draft or anything

[08:25:00.0000] <sayrer>
aw, you sound a little snarky :(

[08:25:01.0000] <sayrer>
hope everything is ok :)

[08:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
This is IRC, you're not allowed to be snarky in here!

[08:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me won't dare get in the way of any Boojumic snarkiness, however

[08:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"The value DOM attribute is in mode filename." — does that mean it only ever returns one?

[08:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What does "in mode" mean?

[08:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(quick, while jgraham's away from his computer!)

Oh, wait.

Some days ago I started reading about html5 and the features it consists. The offline capabilities are very interesting, especially the client side SQLite database. I want to start learning html5, and for this I need to develope my own applications.

[09:53:00.0000] <mr_daniel>
But for this I need a html5 capable browser. I am working on a ubuntu 9.04 machine. Which browser should/can I use to start developing web apps which use some html5 features?

[09:53:01.0000] <mr_daniel>

[12:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: 12SEK or so I think

[12:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
mr_daniel: I think webkit based browsers are the most likley to have SQL support at the moment

[12:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although chrome doesn't afaik and I'm not sure about other webkit-based linux browsers

[12:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
Otherwise Opera, Firefox, Webkit based browsers, and, to a lesser extent, IE8, all implement some HTML5 features

[12:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
hober: I wonder how the "more resources" will be depolyed to help us reach LC/CR

Actually, re there any good use cases for <col>? 

[12:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
Why do we still have it?

[12:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
For styling columns?

[12:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Does that actually work?

[12:46:01.0000] <takkaria>
no

[12:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
You could use tr > td:nth-of-type or something

[12:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
(although that wouldn't allow for hte possibility of mixed td/th in rows)

[12:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: It also fails with colspan

[12:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
True

[12:49:02.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: It works in some browsers, with some styles

[12:49:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Styling <col>, that is

[12:49:04.0000] <jgraham>
CSS could grow a column selector I guess

[12:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but colspan seems hard in general. What happens if I style the third column but have a cell that spans from the first to the fifth column?)

[12:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I guess it shouldn't be styled)

[12:52:00.0000] <takkaria>

I wonder how they came up with the questions in http://www.w3.org/2009/06/xhtml-faq.html

[13:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
some of them seem quite silly

[13:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: You aren't, under the W3C process, allowed to just stop working ona doc. You need to either publish a REC or a NOTE

[13:45:03.0000] <Lachy>
like "Does W3C plan for the XML serialization of HTML to remain compatible with XML?"

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: "n[o]t[...] allowed" - what could they do if you stop anyway?

[13:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Move it to another WG.

[13:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
the faq does rather gloss over the fact that html5 is a w3c-whatwg joint venture

[13:54:01.0000] <krijnh>
Is it then?

[13:55:00.0000] <krijnh>
I thought the W3C only did the marketing part :)

"I plan to use XHTML 5 served as text/html, just to tork off the purists, just like I do now with XHTML 1.0."

[14:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's actually impossible to do that

[14:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
xhtml5 served as text/html5 is just html5

[14:15:01.0000] <Hixie>

I thought it didn't

[16:56:00.0000] <roc>

[16:56:01.0000] <roc>
maybe it still doesn't

there's work being done on it, but no concrete impl

[17:08:01.0000] <dglazkov>
it's a pretty tricky business for a multi-process arch, and jorlow will tell you all about it.

*snicker

[18:21:02.0000] <roc>
no

[18:22:00.0000] <roc>
maybe we would if there was no spec for it, but fortunately there is one

[18:23:00.0000] <sayrer>
also, this feedback about removing the WAVE requirement, that was removed, didn't really have anything to do with removing the WAVE requirement

[18:23:01.0000] <sayrer>
just making sure we're all on the same page

[18:23:02.0000] <roc>
if H.264 was the baseline codec then we might very well have a lot of work to do to figure out which H.264 profile should be the baseline (including undocumented muxing requirements that Apple requires)

[18:23:03.0000] <sayrer>
also, the baseline codec must meet the requirements for an optimal codec

[18:24:00.0000] <sayrer>
such as high volume serving and client vendor unanimity

[18:24:01.0000] <roc>
I wonder who the Wave-hating browser vendor is

[18:24:02.0000] <roc>
It's not us

[18:24:03.0000] <roc>
it's not Apple, for once

[18:24:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think it's Apple

[18:24:05.0000] <roc>
Chrome doesn't support Wave currently, so I suspect Chrome

[18:24:06.0000] <sayrer>
the fact that we are guessing is a fucking joke

[18:24:07.0000] <roc>
yes, I agree

[18:24:08.0000] <Hixie>
can't argue there

[18:24:09.0000] <othermaciej>
so far we seem to support the broadest range of codecs

[18:25:00.0000] <sayrer>
good job!

[18:27:00.0000] <sayrer>
well, I wish the w3c guys would hurry up with the cvs access

[18:27:01.0000] <sayrer>
I have a @summary attribute that needs unbanning

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i guess with xhtml2 being end-of-lifed, there is a niche to be filled for specs that are based on idealism rather than pragmatism. :-)

[18:29:00.0000] <sayrer>
oh, I'll be sure to note that it doesn't work very well

[18:30:00.0000] <sayrer>
banning it... that would be idealistic

[18:30:01.0000] <sayrer>
one might even say naive

[18:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
wait, aren't you planning on removing all authoring conformance criteria?

[18:31:00.0000] <sayrer>
there are many kinds of authoring conformance criteria in the spec

[18:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
sayrer: I have put in a request for your cvs access and will let you know as soon as I get word from the systems team that it's been set up

[18:31:02.0000] <sayrer>
I plan on removing most of them

[18:31:03.0000] <sayrer>
MikeSmith: thanks

[18:31:04.0000] <sayrer>
didn't really mean to pester, just fed up with the list

[18:33:00.0000] <sayrer>
Hixie, to pick a less loaded example, I plan to unban @profile if you haven't already

[18:33:01.0000] <sayrer>
and insert text that says "this attribute doesn't do anything in practice"

[18:33:02.0000] <sayrer>
aiming to be accurate, but not prescriptive

[18:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
i would asssume that once you remove the authoring conformance critiera, profile="", summary="", axis="", and gjshewqt3="" would all get unbanned automatically

[18:34:00.0000] <sayrer>
for authors, that is

[18:34:01.0000] <sayrer>
Hixie: some things become defined, others are undefined

[18:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
sayrer: all I ask is that you add an additional subdir under /html5 . name it whatever you want (it's cvs, anyway, so we can change names later if we care too, and still preserve the revision history)

[18:34:03.0000] <sayrer>
yeah, no problem. don't want any confusion

[18:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
sayrer, are you going to check in and work on your own modified version of HTML5?

[18:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
in dev.w3.org ?

[18:37:02.0000] <sayrer>
I am going to check it in and work on it, I do not want to be the owner

[18:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sayrer: who else do you expect the owner to be?

[18:40:00.0000] <sayrer>
it will be my proposal initially, obviously. but if I need to exercise control over it, it's probably a failure.

[18:45:00.0000] <sinuhe>
Would <code></code>, or <kbd></kbd>, or perhaps something else (samp?) be the most appropriate when marking up something like: To view a file type "cat /etc/passwd", ie <p>To view...type <code>cat /etc/passwd</code></p>?

[18:46:00.0000] <sinuhe>
s/ie/eg/

[18:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
sayrer: so your plan is to check in the proposal, then leave it up to the chairs and the working group to decide what (if anything) to do with it?

[18:47:00.0000] <sayrer>
iterate on it a bit

[18:47:01.0000] <sayrer>
and the end state should be what you ended with

[18:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[18:47:03.0000] <sayrer>
cutting is hard to do that way, and I want to cut some stuff

[18:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
sinuhe: <kbd>

[18:47:05.0000] <sayrer>
not forever, just for now

[18:47:06.0000] <sinuhe>
Hixie: Thank you.

[18:48:00.0000] <T-->
<kbd class="shell"><kbd class="command">cat</kbd> <kbd class="parameter tabbed">/etc/password</kbd></kbd> ;-)

[18:48:01.0000] <sinuhe>
Nice

[18:48:02.0000] <sinuhe>
Though would not /etc/passwd be better suited to <code>?

[18:49:00.0000] <T-->
a user would type or tab-type it?

[18:51:00.0000] <T-->
Oh. To realise something like the insane tab-idea, HTML 5 has some weird kbd-samp-combination rules.

[18:52:00.0000] <sinuhe>
Type, but, I was thinking in terms of the phrase "a filename" in the first sentence of the code element description.

[18:52:01.0000] <Wolfman2000>
...did I hear things right?  There is no more <video> or <audio>?

[18:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Wolfman2000: you didn't hear right

[18:52:03.0000] <T-->
Sounds like a var?

[18:52:04.0000] <othermaciej>
<video> and <audio> are still in the spec

[18:52:05.0000] <othermaciej>
the section saying that a baseline codec was desired, but not stating what it is, has been removed

[18:53:00.0000] <sinuhe>
s/but,/but/

[18:56:00.0000] <sinuhe>
T--: Looking at that again, I think you're right.  The code element seems more appropriate in terms of code snippets.  Thank you.

[18:58:00.0000] <Wolfman2000>
othermaciej: thanks

[19:05:00.0000] <sinuhe>
Perhaps <kbd class="command argument">/etc/passwd</kbd>?

[19:07:00.0000] <T-->
/etc/passwd is not really command-y.

[19:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, wouldn't a more appropriate place to document the formats, codecs, and standards supported by all browsers be in a wiki that can be easily kept up to date as browsers progress?

[19:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
judging from the replies, it seems that people are assuming that such a document would itself be a spec of some kind

[19:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
but that doesn't really seem like a sensible alternaive to me.

[19:10:01.0000] <sayrer>
hmm, I thought CSS required PNG support

[19:10:02.0000] <Lachy>
Even if it were just a NOTE, the W3C process would mean it could at best publish infrequent snapshots

[19:11:00.0000] <heycam>
svg requires png and jpeg

[19:13:00.0000] <sinuhe>
T--: A shell positional parameter recognized as an argument of a command, though it indeed is also a file, I'm not using command completion (what I assume you mean by tabbing), but giving a description in computer documentation for what a user should type to accomplish a generic task, (specifically, a description of CSH ! history modifiers in Bash and how to use them).  I find it confusing knowing when to use samp, code, kbd, and var

[19:13:01.0000] <sinuhe>
(though the latter seems simplest), and when to avoid them altogether (such as with a password example).

[19:19:00.0000] <T-->
sinuhe, I'm not authorative in this regard, just reporting my gut instinct. kbd for communicating with the computer, samp for content, the computer reports back and var is orthogonal to both of them, meaning usable whenever one needs something variable or an example.

[19:19:01.0000] <sinuhe>
T--: OK.  Thanks for your input.

[19:42:00.0000] <roc>

othermaciej: except saying that, you are playing like if you were a noble knight, when in fact, all people *really* involved in html 5 work have business/community interests and all of them are pushing their things. Apple included ;)

[22:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I didn't mean to imply that this is somehow sinister

[22:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, Apple has an agenda too

[22:19:03.0000] <sayrer>
you wrote what you wrote

[22:19:04.0000] <roc>
has Apple actually gone on the record with "We will not support Theora because of A, B, and C"?

[22:19:05.0000] <sayrer>
own your words

[22:19:06.0000] <roc>
All I've heard is "people might not support Theora because of A, B and C"

[22:19:07.0000] <othermaciej>
it's natural for Mozilla to care more about Mozilla's concerns than about Apple's concerns

[22:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and vice versa

[22:20:01.0000] <roc>
and Ian saying that unspecified vendors have declined to support it

[22:20:02.0000] <sayrer>
a fair point, roc

[22:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Apple doesn't support it in any of the products where we have shipped HTML5 <video>

[22:20:04.0000] <sayrer>
that's not the same thing that ian said, is it?

[22:20:05.0000] <othermaciej>
we don't have immediate plans to, but I wouldn't say never because things can change

[22:20:06.0000] <roc>
that's not what I mean

[22:20:07.0000] <roc>
Ian says vendors have vetoed it

[22:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
putting it in the spec would not change our current unwillingness to implement it

[22:21:01.0000] <roc>
if those vendors don't come forward and say why, it's hard to give their concerns much weight

[22:21:02.0000] <sayrer>
yeah, I don't really think we need to reverse engineer the Ian Proxy

[22:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think when I've expanded on Apple's concerns, they haven't been given much weight in any case

[22:22:01.0000] <sayrer>
is this sort of a rush limbaugh play the victim stance?

[22:23:00.0000] <sayrer>
sometimes, you state your case, and you lose

[22:23:01.0000] <sayrer>
that's how it goes

[22:23:02.0000] <karlcow>
/me will not support ogg theora. I'm still trying to implement D-1 with Fortran on a Z-80

[22:23:03.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: it's honestly hard to tell which of the concerns you raise are the ones that are actually stopping Apple from supporting Theora

[22:23:04.0000] <sayrer>
it doesn't mean your position wasn't considered

[22:23:05.0000] <othermaciej>
sayrer: that is a mature point of view that I wish you would adopt

[22:24:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: since officially, we don't even know that Apple has told Ian they won't support Theora

[22:24:01.0000] <sayrer>
I know when I lose

[22:24:02.0000] <roc>
you're blaming Mozilla for failing to read between the lines correctly

[22:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I think Apple has made it's position pretty clear, both now and in the past

[22:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure what additional clarifications you are looking for

[22:25:01.0000] <sayrer>
when reading between the lines completely correctly, and rejecting the conclusion

[22:25:02.0000] <doublec>
karlcow: is that for an ATJ2085 based MP3 player device?

[22:25:03.0000] <sayrer>
and, seriously, sending patent FUD to the public-html list? 

[22:25:04.0000] <sayrer>
like... how dare you?

[22:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I know! how shocking!

[22:26:01.0000] <sayrer>
is apple going to assert a patent?

[22:26:02.0000] <karlcow>
doublec: hehe ;) was kidding

[22:26:03.0000] <sayrer>
like in the widgets wg?

[22:26:04.0000] <sayrer>
it would be good to know now

[22:27:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: have you got a link to an email where Apple acknowledges telling Ian they won't support Theora?

[22:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know of any Apple patents that would read on Ogg Theora

[22:27:02.0000] <doublec>
karlcow: man I was looking forward to my cheap device playing h.264 and other codecs

[22:27:03.0000] <karlcow>
;)

[22:27:04.0000] <sayrer>
othermaciej: that's an answer to a question I didn't ask

[22:27:05.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: we've stated on the public list that we're against declaring Ogg Theora the baseline as things currently stand, and we haven't retracted that position; I'm not sure what more you want

[22:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sayrer: I don't see how we could assert a patent we don't have

[22:28:01.0000] <sayrer>
I think roc's question was pretty plainspoken

[22:29:00.0000] <sayrer>
othermaciej: that's true, but you didn't say you don't have one

[22:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
as far as I know, no one at Apple is aware of patents we hold that might apply to Theora, nor do I think anyone is looking for any

[22:29:02.0000] <sayrer>
but you have also said you don't know much about it

[22:29:03.0000] <sayrer>
I think you wrote it today

[22:30:00.0000] <sayrer>
so I am not sure why this is an interesting argument for you to be having, unless you just want to bloviate.

[22:31:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: You've said why you think it's not a good idea, is that what you mean?

[22:32:00.0000] <roc>
I don't think I've seen a flat-out "We refuse to support Theora" statement

[22:32:01.0000] <roc>
I may have missed it in the volume

[22:34:00.0000] <sayrer>
that would be some good data

[22:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe that when the Theora requirement was first introduced we publicly asked for it to be removed, although I would have to study the email archives to be sure of what exactly was and wasn't said

[22:35:00.0000] <sayrer>
do you refuse to support theora?

[22:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
If there are additional statements that you think would have a chance of changing anyone's position instead of just acting as flamebait, let me know

[22:35:02.0000] <sayrer>
it is a simple question

[22:35:03.0000] <sayrer>
you don't even have to answer ehre

[22:35:04.0000] <sayrer>
here

[22:36:00.0000] <sayrer>
just mail your position to the list

[22:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I already answered: we don't support it, we have no plans to support it, we won't become willing to support it solely because of a spec change, but I don't really have the ability to make a promise for all time no matter what that we won't implement it

[22:37:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: I think it would be honest to state your position clearly

[22:37:01.0000] <sayrer>
the question can be answered with "yes" or "no"

[22:37:02.0000] <sayrer>
but, again, I am not asking you to answer here

[22:37:03.0000] <sayrer>
only to send the answer to the list

[22:37:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think our position is actually unclear to anyone

[22:38:00.0000] <sayrer>
I don't know the answer to the question

[22:38:01.0000] <sayrer>
it seems like it could be "don't want to, but maybe"

[22:38:02.0000] <sayrer>
or it could be "no"

[22:38:03.0000] <sayrer>
or it could be "yes"

[22:38:04.0000] <sayrer>
It is clear that you don't want to actually say anything

[22:39:00.0000] <sayrer>
so, your position is clear in that respect

[22:39:01.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: most people have guessed that Apple's feedback caused Ian to drop the codec requirements

[22:39:02.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: in that sense, your position is clear to everyone

[22:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the codec requirements for video were dropped long ago

[22:40:01.0000] <roc>
ok, keep them out

[22:40:02.0000] <sayrer>
I don't get it, are you arguing with roc?

[22:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Apple has always said Theora shouldn't be required

[22:40:04.0000] <roc>
he is

[22:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe our position is pretty much on the record

[22:41:01.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: let me rephrase the question. Is Apple one of the vendors Ian refers to as vendors who refuse to support Theora?

[22:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: what I said above is Apple's position, I don't know whether anyone would describe that as "refuse" or not, but I personally prefer to state it accurately instead of in one-word form

[22:42:01.0000] <sayrer>
it's a right squirmy worm, this

[22:43:00.0000] <sayrer>
I did notice that Ian said "browser vendors" today regarding WAVE

[22:43:01.0000] <sayrer>
but then changed to "browser vendor in question" in a subsequent response

[22:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm pretty sure Apple has no problem with WAVE, or at least if anyone at Apple does, they haven't told me

[22:43:03.0000] <sayrer>
roc asked " Is Apple one of the vendors Ian refers to as vendors who refuse to support Theora?"

[22:44:00.0000] <roc>
that's a simple question of fact

[22:44:01.0000] <roc>
not a question about the meaning of "refuse"

[22:44:02.0000] <sayrer>
my point is that Ian has characterized one browser vendor as plural "browser vendors"

[22:45:00.0000] <roc>
that might just be a mistake

[22:45:01.0000] <sayrer>
could be

[22:45:02.0000] <sayrer>
hard to be optimisitc

[22:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
If the word "refuse" is very important to you, then I would say by definition 3 of the definition here: <http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/refuse> you could characterize what I said as "refuse"

[22:46:01.0000] <roc>
let's forget about what I mean by refuse

[22:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I would still add that I wouldn't rule out changing conditions would change our mind

[22:47:00.0000] <roc>
 Is Apple one of the vendors *Ian* refers to as vendors who refuse to support Theora?

[22:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
just that a codec requirement HTML5 spec is not one of them

[22:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: if you want an interpretation of Hixie's statement shouldn't you ask him?

[22:47:03.0000] <roc>
he won't tell me because it's private feedback

[22:47:04.0000] <sayrer>
private feedback in the open process

[22:47:05.0000] <sayrer>
boy howdy

[22:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think I personally used the exact word "refuse" in any private conversation with Ian, I can't be certain that no one else has

[22:48:01.0000] <sayrer>
I said "garbage" just today!

[22:48:02.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: if you think Apple's position is clear, can you give Ian permission to answer my question?

[22:48:03.0000] <sayrer>
almost the same

[22:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think I said anything to him besides the position stated above, and the fact that we think it's technologically infeasible to ship Theora on our mobile devices at a quality level we are happy with due to lack of hardware support

[22:49:01.0000] <roc>
I assume you read my reply about that

[22:49:02.0000] <sayrer>
funny story

[22:49:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm fine with Ian answering whether Apple is a vendor he characterized as refusing to support Theora

[22:50:00.0000] <sayrer>
in the Atom days, a lot of people were worried about J2ME not supporting PUT and DELETE

[22:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would assume we are but I can't speak for him any more than you can

[22:50:02.0000] <sayrer>
that turned out to be a pretty foolish thing to value

[22:50:03.0000] <sayrer>
you don't write tomorrow's standard for today's devices

[22:52:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: I would actually like clarification about what exactly would change Apple's mind

[22:52:01.0000] <roc>
if "hardware support" means "actual Theora ASICs in the iPhone" then I concede that's going to be difficult

[22:53:00.0000] <sayrer>
but also, there is some level where a client is non-conforming

[22:53:01.0000] <sayrer>
HTML5 requires all sorts of things to get the job done

[22:54:00.0000] <roc>
but I honestly don't see how supporting Theora in software makes any Apple product worse

[22:54:01.0000] <sayrer>
it seems bogus to draw the line at a video codec and say "that... that is cruel and unusual!"

[22:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that's what Adobe thinks about Flash

[22:56:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: I'd also like clarification on why Vorbis is unacceptable to Apple

[22:57:00.0000] <sayrer>
it occurs to me that a real answer probably wouldn't come as an IRC reply

[22:57:01.0000] <sayrer>
just sayin

[22:57:02.0000] <roc>
it doesn't have to be an IRC reply

[22:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know if Apple has stated a position on Vorbis, and I haven't asked around what Apple thinks about it in official terms

[22:58:00.0000] <roc>
hmm

[22:58:01.0000] <sayrer>
roc, but a reply comes, huh

[22:58:02.0000] <roc>
Ian said on public-html "If anyone can get Apple to implement it, I'd be more than happy to update

[22:58:03.0000] <roc>
the spec to mention that as the common audio codec."

[22:58:04.0000] <roc>
I guess it's not clear whether that means he had private feedback vetoing it, or not

[22:58:05.0000] <roc>
(booo! hisss!)

[22:58:06.0000] <othermaciej>
as far as I can tell informally Apple doesn't like it

[22:59:00.0000] <sayrer>
well, private feedback is bad

[22:59:01.0000] <sayrer>
but a veto is not part of the w3c process

[23:01:00.0000] <sayrer>
and, if one wanted to get especially pedantic, one could say that Ian conveying private feedback breaks the requirement that a participant must not represent more than one member

[23:04:00.0000] <sayrer>
this reminds me of those old videos with ari fleischer

[23:05:00.0000] <sayrer>
(former whitehouse press secretary, for the rest of the world)

[23:05:01.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: sorry this was so heated. It's not personal.

[23:05:02.0000] <sayrer>
not in roc's case

[23:05:03.0000] <roc>
sayrer: we know who Ari Fleischer is

[23:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I know it's not personal in your case; but thanks for saying so, as well

[23:06:01.0000] <sayrer>
othermaciej: in my case, it is personal. you're an ass.

[23:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sayrer: are you trying to challenge me to a bar brawl or something?

[23:12:00.0000] <sayrer>
no :)

[23:13:00.0000] <sayrer>
have you ever been in a bar brawl? I can't say I recommend it.

[23:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
actually, yes

[23:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I won, but I also discovered that in a bar fight, everyone is the loser

[23:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
even if you win

[23:14:03.0000] <sayrer>
that's not true

[23:14:04.0000] <sayrer>
depends what the other guy did

[23:15:00.0000] <sayrer>
there are just wars, and sometimes it's just a war

[23:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
do you believe in the theory of just war?

[23:18:00.0000] <sayrer>
yes, but I think it is very rare

[23:18:01.0000] <sayrer>
iow, I find it hard to rule out

[23:19:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me thinks this conversation has gone nowhere, arguably even less than nowhere, over the last two days of IRC argument

[23:20:00.0000] <sayrer>
/me is not so worried about that

[23:20:01.0000] <sayrer>
lots of information has been gathered

[23:20:02.0000] <sayrer>
for a data driven effort, that is progress

[23:20:03.0000] <jwalden>
/me wonders who else would agree

[23:21:00.0000] <sayrer>
well, I could certainly see the argument about lack of progress

[23:21:01.0000] <sayrer>
do you also think nothing new was learned?

[23:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think a fair amount of conversation happened between sayrer's swearing and gratuitous personal attacks

[23:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure anyone learned anything new

[23:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
can't say I did

[23:23:00.0000] <roc>
I have

[23:23:01.0000] <sayrer>
othermaciej: it's not clear to me that you have steered clear of personal attacks

[23:23:02.0000] <sayrer>
let's take "nerdrage" for instance

[23:23:03.0000] <sayrer>
a funny word, I'll grant you

[23:24:00.0000] <sayrer>
so I guess you have the high ground on swearing

[23:24:01.0000] <sayrer>
I will order you a medal from amazon

[23:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sayrer: yt?

[23:55:01.0000] <sayrer>
yep

[23:58:00.0000] <sayrer>
there is a gold medal available for $0.98

[23:58:01.0000] <sayrer>

[23:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sayrer: your cvs access is set up

[23:59:01.0000] <sayrer>
thanks so much

[23:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll pm you with the details

[23:59:03.0000] <sayrer>
kk

[00:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
sayrer: i never said anyone unspecified refused to implement Theora

[00:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
I said someone or someones unspecified had requested that the requirement for Wave PCM be removed, but that I had changed their mind so that they would implement it anyway

[00:04:01.0000] <sayrer>
Hixie: I think roc was asking

[00:08:00.0000] <sayrer>
Hixie: ah, roc has sent you and the list a very specific question via electronic mail

[00:08:01.0000] <sayrer>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0098.html

[00:08:02.0000] <Hixie>

[00:24:00.0000] <sayrer>
Hixie, your latest mail seems wrong wrt to SQL

[01:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
cool. Prince 7 beta is out

[01:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notices the time, curses, and wonders whether he'll beat jgraham to work

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
are attributes that apply to "all elements" like hidden and draggable supposed to apply only to elements in the HTML namespace or other elements too?

[01:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dom.html#global-attributes

[01:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
"HTML elements"

[01:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
all righty

[02:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
has Apple always been part of the licensor pool for H.264 or has Apple joined the pool lately?

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me can't remember noticing Apple in there earlier

[02:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't remember them there either. I can only remember them being in the container pool.

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I see Nokia in the AAC pool but not in the H.264 pool despite what shepazu said on list

[02:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't remember us being in the H.264 pool before either

[02:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(not that I have any specific knowledge about this besides what the site says)

[02:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Apple hasn't always been there: http://web.archive.org/web/20071126123130/http://www.mpegla.com/avc/avc-licensors.cfm

[02:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm also not clear on why the MPEG-4 Systems portfolio is no longer offered (I assume that is what would cover containers)

[02:54:00.0000] <shepazu>
hsivonen: sorry, my mistake, I thought Nokia was an H.264 license holder

[02:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
<pendatic>they are indeed a license holder, just not a patent holder

[02:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
</pedantic> (he said optimistically)

[03:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
"I don't think anyone is concerned about risk of additional patent exposure from other HTML5 technologies, to the point that this is a showstopper for implementing"

[03:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
Didn't Microsoft claim exactly that about <canvas>?

[03:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Where is that from?

[03:29:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: yes

[03:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hasn't really been touching public-html, waiting for MikeSmith to get back to me about whether there was any need to do anything being an intern

[03:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't recall Microsoft claiming that, though I remember they had some complaints about <canvas>

[03:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
an organizer for an an upcoming event in Hungary has contacted me about possibility of having an HTML5 presentation there. Anybody know of somebody who's been involved in discussions on whatwg or public-html lists who's based in Hungary or nearby? 

[03:31:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Apple has a known patent on <canvas> which we've never enforced and which we disclosed and didn't exclude as part of the HTML5 FPWD patent disclosure requirement

[03:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Microsoft complained about the difficulty and expense of doing patent research on <canvas> for patent disclosure purposes, presumably a non-issue now

[03:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: for now, you are OK to continue to participate in public-html discussions as an individual

[03:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: k

[03:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
we would need chaals to add you as Opera rep, and I think he may have just left for a vacation until the 13th

[03:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I think Chris Wilson mentioned the issue of canvas patents, before Apple disclosed it in the patent non-exclusion period

[03:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
but I think I only remember it being mentioned somewhat tangentially, not as a reason why they weren't implementing canvas

[03:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
I had got the impression that it was not the apple patent in particular that they were concerned about

[03:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me hadn't got that impression

[03:35:03.0000] <jgraham>
But I don't really remember the details; it was discussed a bit at the 2007 TPAC iirc

[03:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[03:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me just knows what was said on lists

[03:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe Apple disclosed the fact that we had a patent even before the non-exclusion period

[03:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-March/010129.html

[03:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
personally I'm surprised that Apple's patent has held up, but fortunately it's now not a problem for anyone

[03:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
The patent seems to be basically a dump of Apple's canvas documentation

[03:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
and then repeated in lawyerish

[03:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Well of course, what do you expect a patent to be?

[03:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why this codec issue is so popular

[03:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
i've received more private feedback abotu this than almost anything else

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
put together

[03:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Because it is the free web v. the evil mega-corps!

[03:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems to generate a lot of public feedback too

[03:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Because the list of involved parties is large enough that everyone can find someone they hate

[03:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Because people wwant usable video on the web and are concerned that the current spec will impede that?

[03:43:00.0000] <jwalden>
"almost" anything else?

[03:43:01.0000] <jwalden>
I'm guessing only rdfa could possibly surpass

[03:43:02.0000] <jwalden>
but I don't see why such feedback would have been private

[03:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm kinda curious who is sending Hixie private codec feedback

[03:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I gave him some when asked but I believe I have also made all the same points in public

[03:44:02.0000] <roc>
people don't want to have to pay money to produce or consume Web content

[03:45:00.0000] <jwalden>
or maybe the more reasonable interpretation is s/any/every/

[03:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
roc: I don't think anybody contends that

[03:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: random people from all over the web

[03:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
there are a surprising number of H.264 advocates / Ogg haters in threads about this topic on, e.g., reddit

[03:45:04.0000] <roc>
gsnedders: then no-one should be surprised

[03:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(I don't think any of them are Apple shills)

[03:46:01.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: a lot of them are x264 developers and their fans

[03:46:02.0000] <jwalden>
I want the bikeshed to not be splotchy

[03:46:03.0000] <jwalden>
(oversimplification, to be sure, but a vague attempt at humor)

[03:46:04.0000] <jwalden>
even if only self-humor :-)

[03:46:05.0000] <jwalden>
and I suppose s/splotch/block/ to use the technical term

[03:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
The discussion is great because you can complain about Apple, Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, W3C, Adobe, and Nokia - everyone can find someone to argue against

[03:48:00.0000] <roc>
there seems to be a large community of codec geeks who hang out in doom9 and other places who tend to focus on the technology, don't care about licensing issues, and hence tend to be pro-H.264 anti-Theora

[03:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
As long as no one can complain about Opera :)

[03:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Seemingly nobody thinks Opera has enough influence to be worth caring about)

[03:48:03.0000] <jgraham>
:(

[03:48:04.0000] <roc>
jgraham: the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about

[03:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe I should try to convince someone here to make our policy really controversial

[03:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
We could send out teams of ninjas to hunt down pepople who author videos in non-RF formats

[03:49:02.0000] <jwalden>
/me is tangentially sad that the person named singer does not work for the company named opera

[03:50:00.0000] <roc>
jgraham: announce support for Dirac

[03:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Use the Opera Mini/Turbo proxies to dynamically transcode content from H.264 into Theora

[03:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: that would be more confusing than controversial

[03:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: for delivering content to phones, the other way around might make more sense...

[03:51:00.0000] <takkaria>
Opera need a Therora to Dirac transcoder

[03:51:01.0000] <takkaria>
it's the only way to preserve free content on the Web

[03:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh that's just what we need, a lossy codec to lossy codec convertor

[03:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: Just use ffmpeg or mencoder, they should support that already

[03:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm starting to think motion jpeg might be a good idea

[03:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
(if compiled with suitable flags and libraries)

[03:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's so stupid that everyone can hate it

[03:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: these long flamewars really cause people to lose good judgement :-P

[03:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
MJPEG might be a good way to distract from the issue of finding a solution that anyone can seriously use

[03:53:03.0000] <roc>
and remarkably, it has actual proponents

[03:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, a baseline should be a least common denominator

[03:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hard to think of anything lesser than MJPEG

[03:54:02.0000] <takkaria>
HD video in MJPEG would be amusing

[03:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anything prior to MPEG-1, of those related codecs, has fixed resolutions, right?

[03:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me has a camera that outputs HD MJPEG (720p@24fps)

[03:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: one of the e-mails i received suggested i make animated GIFs the baseline

[03:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I stand corrected

[03:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: And it manages to have high enough IO to cope? That's actually somewhat impressive.

[03:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[03:56:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: btw, another area where Theora is more righteous than H.264 is the profile stuff

[03:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Theora doesn't do profiles. H.264 has profiles times levels

[03:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and we don't like profiles

[03:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
i personally don't care which of 264 or theora is better

[03:57:03.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: I think I have a "Class 6" SDHD card

[03:57:04.0000] <roc>
on my blog, an H.264 advocate posted a link to an H.264 vs Theora comparison

[03:57:05.0000] <hsivonen>
(or whatever the abbreviation is today)

[03:57:06.0000] <Hixie>
it's academic unless they could both be implemented, which they can't

[03:57:07.0000] <roc>
his H.264 file didn't play in Quicktime

[03:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't understand "could both be implemented"

[03:58:01.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I have disputed that, but I need to take a break from all this for a few days

[03:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
They could be implemented :P

[03:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: you could implement 264?

[03:59:01.0000] <roc>
hopefully in the meantime someone will reply to all my emails on the subject

[03:59:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Esp. with H.264 the legally is questionable, but it could be implemented.

[03:59:03.0000] <roc>
sorry, I see what you mean

[03:59:04.0000] <Philip`>
What would happen if you took MJPEG but 'rotated' the input so you were compressing x-time planes instead of x-y planes? That would make it benefit from temporal coherency, which is better than standard MJPEG

[04:00:00.0000] <roc>
then you don't benefit from Y-locailty

[04:00:01.0000] <roc>
fail

[04:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh :-(

[04:00:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Wikipedia should push XiphQT to Safari users. are they doing that already?

[04:01:00.0000] <roc>
that's kind of impractical

[04:01:01.0000] <roc>
it would be more practical to create a virus that installs XiphQT on Mac worldwide

[04:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: who is working on the Ogg ActiveX control you mentioned had been mentioned in the open video conference?

[04:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Okay, so if you consider the video to be a 3D x-y-time cube, you could quantise it into a series of nested cubes of decreasing size, and then flatten the surface of each cube into a plane, and compress that series of planes as MJPEG

[04:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
Then you'll benefit from locality in all three dimensions

[04:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
I can't imagine why nobody has done this already

[04:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I doubt binary plugins will be effective at resolving a format war, the last time the industry tried that, Flash won

[04:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, yeah, an implementation in ActionScript would be better

[04:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: it's desirable for codecs to be able to decode frames sequentially, for smooth playback

[04:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: your scheme would require decoding N frames at a time for possibly large N

[04:05:03.0000] <othermaciej>
there's a Java implementation of Theora

[04:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Wikipedia uses it

[04:06:01.0000] <roc>
they do

[04:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I use it, too, on my site. It sucks when you put two videos on one page

[04:06:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: like here http://hsivonen.iki.fi/makasiinit/

[04:06:04.0000] <roc>
it's not too bad, for a Java implementation of a video codec

[04:06:05.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: using Actionscript would improve that to one

[04:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: To decode frame 1, you would only need the outermost cube; to decode frame 2, you would need the next smaller cube plus the edges of the previous one; etc; so you could actually do it sequentially

[04:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you know, the more I read the thread title "Nothing is really hidden", the more I want to take it as a sublime philosophical point

[04:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't mean playing them at the same time. Just weird breakage.

[04:07:03.0000] <hsivonen>
at least Flash works with multiple ads on one page.

[04:07:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: oh, nested cubes, well that seems like it would be pretty terrible

[04:07:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I was assuming cube slices

[04:07:06.0000] <hsivonen>
(the videos on that page were encoded 3 years ago)

[04:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I should re-encode them with Thusnelda)

[04:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: Hmph, maybe I should leave codec design to "experts" then :-(

[04:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well if you're going to do something more complicated than vanilla motion jpeg, it may as well be good

[04:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
What if I consider overcomplication to be inherently good?

[04:10:01.0000] <takkaria>
othermaciej: you should take it as a philosophical point, since it's pretty philosophical in nature, and it ends up like most philosophy, with people redefining other people's words in order to be right

[04:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that his contributions to this discussion are probably not especially productive

[04:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: so far your contributions have been more useful than those of some people who think they are contributing seriously

[04:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
takkaria: I've given up on actually reading the mails in that thread, so I wouldn't know

[04:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so Mozilla, Apple and Opera are now saying PCM WAVE isn't a problem...

[04:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
by process of elimination, it was probably Google (the Chromium bit of it) that complained, but I buy Hixie's argument that their complaint was irrelevant if they agreed to implement it anyway

[04:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
Anonymous feedback isn't so anonymous when you know it comes from one of a finite group and you can ask all the others in the group if it was them

[04:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I feel bad for duplicating Hixie and doublec's replies

[04:19:00.0000] <doublec>
repitition is important :)

[04:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has a revelation

[04:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
This MJPEG-over-surfaces-of-cubes-in-x-y-t thing clearly ties into the notion of the Time Cube

[04:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me gets more private feedback from people trying in good faith to be helpful but only suggesting things that were attempted years ago

[04:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've been trying to go to bed for the past 3 hours, but there's always more mail!

[04:23:00.0000] <jwalden>
othermaciej: if you're going to take a high ground, don't snark at someone behind his back

[04:23:01.0000] <jwalden>
notwithstanding that I basically agree

[04:23:02.0000] <takkaria>
doublec: if repetition is important, why doesnt't HTML5 support repetition in forms?  hmm?

[04:23:03.0000] <takkaria>
see, your logic is inconsistent

[04:24:00.0000] <doublec>
hehe

i should post controversial things about theora every 6 months

[04:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
this is all just a way for Hixie to attract more slashdotters to subscribe

[04:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
public-html hasn't changed, still 341

[04:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's unsurprising given the relative effort needed to join each list, and the relative benefits

[04:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jwalden: what did I say that you thought was snarking about someone behind his back? the thing about the "nothing is really hidden" thread?

[04:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Joining the HTML WG doesn't even give you the benefit of being able to post to the list, since everyone has that anyway)

[04:26:03.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: lunch now?

[04:26:04.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: aye

[04:27:00.0000] <jwalden>
othermaciej: "Philip`: so far your contributions have been more useful than those of some people who think they are contributing seriously"

[04:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(though I guess if that was snarking, it would be about Shelley)

[04:27:02.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: the work has not really been started yet on the ActiveX control, but the guy who is maintaining oggcodecs is interested

[04:27:03.0000] <takkaria>
/me snarks (scare quotes implies)

[04:27:04.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: ok. any plan on whether it's going to be VLC minus everything else or a new thing?

[04:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jwalden: if you took that to be about a specific person rather than about the many people who posted useless things, then that person probably earned some snark

[04:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: and whether it will expose an HTML5-like API for easy JS shims?

[04:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
jwalden: but I didn't mean it that way

[04:28:03.0000] <jwalden>
othermaciej: undoubtedly (to the first), guess I misinterpreted then (to the second)

[04:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: would i be right to assume that apple wouldn't ship dirac by default either at this point?

[04:29:01.0000] <jwalden>
it probably doesn't help that I read all of the last two days of scrollback at once, so I got the full force of all the argument in one sitting :-)

[04:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
(it seems the same reasons you've stated for not doing theora apply to dirac, but it's always worth asking...)

[04:29:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I don't think Dirac is currently in a state to be a viable choice for Web video

[04:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but I think all the concerns about Theora would apply

[04:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jwalden: that must have been a hair-raising experience

[04:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BBC had a partner that did Dirac in hardware (albeit not in the mobile form factor), right?

[04:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe that was without interframe compression?

[04:32:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: it will be built on oggcodecs but be native otherwise

[04:32:01.0000] <jwalden>
othermaciej: heh

[04:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
IRC clients should have a rewind / fast-forward mechanism, that plays back the conversation at 2x normal speed, so you still get the real-time aspects rather than a sudden onrush of dozens of pages of chat log

[04:32:03.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: oggcodecs is a directshow filter for anything ogg

[04:32:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: Dirac uses novel techniques, so it might be less likely to infringe the nest of existing patents, but on the other hand, there's less US-based big company exposure to it so far

[04:32:05.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: ok.

[04:32:06.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: and yes, it should play nicely with HTML5 - that's the whole idea

[04:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: excellent

[04:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: but I'm not sure it's worth worrying about because it doesn't even have a stable spec yet and really isn't ready for prime time by anyone's estimation

[04:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
lazyweb side note: does anyone know of grants or disclaimers of On2's patents on Theora that aren't limited to code derivatives of the reference implementation?

[04:33:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(I've been trying to research what patent grants or non-enforcement promises there are)

[04:33:04.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: but Dirac has gone through a standardisation process at SMPTE and even Apple did not object to it being standardised there 

[04:34:00.0000] <nessy>
I agree thought that it's not quite the choice for Web video (yet)

[04:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: wasn't the SMPTE thing without interframe compression?

[04:34:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Maybe the people who black out MP's expenses reports could be employed to remove all the bits that are likely to raise ire in the IRC logs too

[04:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: but then MLW would be out of a job

[04:34:04.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: it was some subset of Dirac, which is now called VC-2, yes, but I don't know the details

[04:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok no e-mail for 5 seconds, time to go to bed

jgraham: That's easy - just add <style>body { background: black }</style> on the logs page

[04:36:01.0000] <nessy>
excellent - I am sick of the email avalanche, too :)

[04:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
Nah, you have to let something through to give a sense of being transparent

[04:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the only licenses/disclaimers I found are these: <https://trac.xiph.org/browser/branches/vp32/vp32/VP32_license.txt> <https://svn.xiph.org/trunk/theora/LICENSE>

[04:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
from googling it seems I am not the first to wonder if independent implementations wouldn't be covered

[04:42:00.0000] <jwalden>
yay, untrusted connection :-\

[04:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me likes how Chrome handles those

[04:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me just clicks "Accept" in Opera automatically

[04:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
amazingly I didn't even notice they had a bogus cert

[04:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which goes to show you how useful the warning is

[04:46:00.0000] <jwalden>
it's not bogus, just issued by an untrusted authority

[04:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's more of a problem because in many cases (e.g. this one, viewing a public file) you really don't care about security at all

[04:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I shouldn't have used the word "bogus" so loosely

[04:47:01.0000] <jwalden>
I make the effort to add temporary exceptions when I encounter things like this

[04:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
in a sense you could argue all certs are bogus, given the extremely weak verification done by CAs

[04:47:03.0000] <jwalden>
and complain when I can, e.g. http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20250

[04:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Opera also complains "An encryption level that is not secure was requested by the server"

[04:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I found a thread in the theora mailing list archives about this from 2004

[04:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there didn't seem to be a clear conclusion on whether the patent disclaimer applies to independent implementations

[04:52:01.0000] <doublec>
yeah I'm reading that too

[04:52:02.0000] <doublec>
maikmerten is on irc a lot and can probably comment more

[04:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
from the thread it doesn't seem like there are any relevant patent licenses or disclaimers

[04:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
does maikemerten work for or represent On2?

[04:56:00.0000] <doublec>
No, he was involved in the thread which is quite old so thought he'd be able to comment on how relevant it is.

[04:56:01.0000] <doublec>
eg. if another thread came up clearing things up later

[04:56:02.0000] <doublec>
an On2 person has frequently posted in the reddit threads about theora I notice

[04:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
where on IRC can he be found?

[04:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am a bit hesitant to dredge this up with him because of the risk of accidentally instigating an additional flamewar

[04:58:01.0000] <doublec>
he hangs out here, as well as in #annodex, #theora

[04:58:02.0000] <doublec>
he's a reasonable guy - very easy to discuss things with

[04:58:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll stick to here then

[04:59:00.0000] <doublec>
not a raving zealot anyway :)

[04:59:01.0000] <doublec>
not that there are any of those in codec discussions...

[05:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if independent implementations of Theora were disallowed or non-RF I assume that would be a problem

[05:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ffmpeg has an independent impl, right?

[05:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be nice if On2 made a clearer statement

[05:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
dunno

[05:02:01.0000] <doublec>
so apple has licensed vp3, which is similar to theora

[05:03:00.0000] <doublec>
since theora was based on it

[05:03:01.0000] <doublec>
does that mean apple are covered anyway by the patents that on2 have on theora?

[05:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
has Apple shipped VP3, too?

[05:04:01.0000] <doublec>
oh, my mistake, it's the 'third party components' quicktime page I'm ready

[05:04:02.0000] <doublec>
reading

[05:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
ah

[05:04:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the people who said Apple has licensed VP3 were arguing based on faulty evidence (the codec download page)

[05:05:00.0000] <doublec>
yes, correct

[05:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know if Apple has in fact licensed it, but I would guess no, b/c Apple started phasing out proprietary codecs with the advent of MPEG-4

[05:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and VP3 appeared around the same time (in fact I believe it was a rejected candidate for MPEG-4 Part 2 video, the pre-H.264 MPEG-4 video codec)

[05:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if independent implementations are not allowed or must pay, then I would find that more of a problem from the spec POV than for Apple specifically (since the reference implementation is BSD-licensed)

[05:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
wikipedia says that On2 released the codec under an open source licence and disclaimed all rights to their patent, citing this licence http://trac.xiph.org/browser/branches/vp32/vp32/VP32_license.txt

[05:11:01.0000] <doublec>
"VP3 allows for the highest quality video, at the lowest possible data rates while still retaining the video's full frame-rate. The result is a clear 320x240 video that can be expanded to a full-screen 640x480 resolution. The power of this codec has been validated by the fact that it has been licensed by both RealNetworks and Apple for their internet video players."

[05:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that patent doesn't actually disclaim all rights (it is one of the two I linked)

[05:11:03.0000] <doublec>
from random internet news source of course ;)

[05:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
then I assume what wikipedia says is poorly written

[05:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
s/that patent/that license/

[05:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the original VP3.2 license actually has a field-of-use restriction on the patent in addition to limiting it to derivative works

[05:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the later patent disclaimer (not license) seems limited to derivative works, but doesn't have the field-of-use restriction

[05:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not even exactly a disclaimer, just a promise not to assert the patent

[05:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
legalese is fun

[05:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, where's the patent disclaimer you're referring to?

[05:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: https://svn.xiph.org/trunk/theora/LICENSE

[05:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(despite the name of that file, it appears to contain a promise not to assert the patent, not a patent license)

[05:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(I have no idea if that makes any legal difference)

[05:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
that legalese is certainly confusing to me too

[05:21:00.0000] <doublec>
according to On2's CTO at the time: "On2's VP3 codec was licensed by Apple Computer for inclusion in their 3rd party auto-update component server, starting with QuickTime 5."

[05:21:01.0000] <doublec>
Not sure what 'licensed by..." actually means in regards to the 3rd party auto update component server

[05:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
me neither

[05:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
like I said, I think this is more of a concern from a standards process perspective than an Apple-specific perspective

[05:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if independent implementations were not allowed and RF, that would subvert the RF requirement and make it problematic to satisfy the usual CR exit conditions

[05:24:00.0000] <doublec>
yes, clarification from Xiph on that is really needed

[05:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder when On2's patent expires?

[05:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure Xiph can clarify, unless they have some additional documents from On2

[05:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: if we knew what the patents are it would be easy to look it up

[05:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
however I can't find any record of specific patent numbers

[05:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I was just looking for a patent number

[05:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, any idea when h.264 patents will all expire? The patent list on MPEG-LA only listed the expiration dates for the few that already expired.

[05:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
https://twitter.com/sjespers/status/2452546402

[05:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[05:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: the spec was finalized in 2003, so the upper bound would be 2024 I think; but I haven't looked up all the patents

[05:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, that's a long time.

[05:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there are a number of old patents that read on it, so the expiration will be very staggered

[05:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
my understanding is that at least some members of the MPEG-LA pool would be willing to give a royalty-free license for some kind of baseline profile but there are some holdouts

[05:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know who the holdouts are, when their particular patents expire, or if they continue to be stubborn

[05:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I might be able to learn those things though

[05:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if it's possible to create a baseline codec that would exclude anything covered by the patentds owned by those holding out

[05:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
no idea

[05:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
though, it might be a challenge even if it were possible, since we would need to get video editing software that can output content that complies with the more limited baseline

[05:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: even if MPEG-LA made H.264 Baseline RF, it would be a challenge to make video encoder software really clamp to it and to make decoders not implement anything beyond

[05:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, that's basically what I just said.

[05:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: not quite :-)

[05:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen was talking about the existing H.264 Baseline profile

[05:39:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: H.264 Baseline profile is already defined

[05:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not a hypothetical new profile that tries to dodge patents of stubborn patent holders

[05:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: and it's still a challenge

[05:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, where I said "baseline", I was referring to a hypothetical RF baseline

[05:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I would guess x264 can properly handle target profiles

[05:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: if it does, it requires a lot of effort on the part of its user to set the right knobs to the right positions

[05:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe we should just start fighting to have all the h.264 patents invalidated, at least for those who won't agree to RF licencing

[05:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
it would take a lot of effort though

[05:45:00.0000] <jwalden>
speak of the devil :-)

[05:45:01.0000] <jwalden>
perhaps not coincidentally, I bet

[05:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
jwalden, what are you referring to?

[05:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I think he's referring to maikmerten joining the channel

[05:47:02.0000] <jwalden>
^

[05:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[05:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: it looks like someone would have to undergo the painful experience of making an x264 profile definition in XML and after that it would be easy (whether for an official H.264 profile or some arbitrary other set of features)

[06:44:00.0000] <maikmerten>
othermaciej_, oh, hello :)

[06:44:01.0000] <maikmerten>
so... what devil was talked about?

[06:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
maikmerten, they were discussing On2's VP3 patent licensing issues in relation to implementing Theora

[06:47:00.0000] <maikmerten>
ah

[06:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
and whether it covers independent reimplementations

[06:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's not clear whether it only covers derivatives of the Xiph implementation, or any implementation

[06:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
maikmerten, discussion started around here http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090703#l-728

[06:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
or maybe slightly before that

[06:50:00.0000] <maikmerten>
from what I know it should cover independent reimplementaton as the deal with On2 was done in that spirit. One can see current Theora as a non-VP3 related implementation, given it has been rewritten from scratch

[06:50:01.0000] <maikmerten>
Lachy, thanks

[06:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
maikmerten, it would be nice to get some official clarification on the issue, preferably from On2 themselves

[06:51:01.0000] <maikmerten>
I'll forward this

[06:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
thanks

[06:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
maikmerten: is it a known problem that Cortado acts weird if there are two instances on one page in IE?

[06:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
maikmerten: also, what's the difference between the Wikipedia and Xiph Cortado code bases?

[06:53:00.0000] <maikmerten>
hsivonen, no, didn't hear about that issue before

[06:53:01.0000] <maikmerten>
hsivonen, development moved to Xiph.org Git

[06:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
maikmerten: ok.

[06:53:03.0000] <maikmerten>
hsivonen, we're trying to set up a proper project page

[06:54:00.0000] <maikmerten>
hsivonen, currently the Xiph.org version features some decoder fixes over the Wikimedia one

[06:54:01.0000] <doublec>
if it's a problem caused by two applets onthe page it sounds more like a jvm issue

[06:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
doublec: could be

[06:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'll try to test it some more

[06:57:00.0000] <doublec>
I've used cortado a bit and it's worked well for me - but only one per page. I'll try two as well.

[07:00:00.0000] <maikmerten>
mkay, it seems like any spec-compliant Theora product is derived from the original VP3 codebase simply because the spec was written from scratch with the VP3 source-code as input

[07:01:00.0000] <maikmerten>
there were zero pages of specification when the VP3/Theora deal was done

[07:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. an implementation of the spec isn't a derivate work of the spec necessarily, is it?

[07:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought the write-implementation-from-spec-written-from-implementation approach was often used as a way to *avoid* being considered a derivative

[07:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
like in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design

[07:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: yes

[07:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: though that's cleaning copyright derivation

[07:04:00.0000] <maikmerten>
I think nobody here is lawyer enough to settle that question. The only reliable source would be the actual agreement.

[07:04:01.0000] <maikmerten>
I'll forward this request

[07:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Is there any other form of derivation that would be relevant?

[07:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the kind of derivation that the On2 promise means

[07:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Could that kind be anything other than copyright derivation?

[07:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose I don't actually care about the answer, and probably nobody knows enough to answer it anyway

[07:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/nobody/nobody here/

[07:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Huh, #location has irrelevant tests linked

[07:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I think it's better if I don't try to guess what someone else's legalese means

[07:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm... I have a set of Unicode codepoints. Someone can construct a string of those codepoints, and then convert the string to NFC. How I can tell what set of codepoints the output string can contain?

[07:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
font subsetting is hard

[08:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be easier if OS X wasn't silly enough to convert strings to NFC before trying to render them

[08:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
I thought OSX converted to NFD

[08:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
Not when rendering text, as far as I'm aware

[08:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you write HTML with "i{combining grave}" then it'll try to find the glyph corresponding to "{i grave}"

[08:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I already have code that finds a superset of the necessary codepoints, but want something stricter)

[08:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
OS X uses NFD for HFS+, but otherwise uses NFC.

[08:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: well, almost NFD for HFS+, IIRC, it's a special normalization that isn't quite exactly any real normalization form

[08:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I think the differences are in the Korean block

[08:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
How can you find out if something is in an array?

[08:07:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(in JS)

[08:07:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hangul isn't decomposed or something of that nature

[08:07:05.0000] <hsivonen>
I forget

[08:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Argh

[08:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
NFC(U+1e60 U+0323) = NFC(U+1e62 U+0307) = U+1e69

[08:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/1e62/1e63/

[08:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/1e60/1e61/

[08:09:04.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, something like that

[08:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
What I currently do is convert everything to NFD, and then find all codepoints that decompose into a subset of those NFDs, but that is both inefficient and incorrect

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Incorrect because UnicodeData.txt doesn't always give maximal decompositions, and inefficient because e.g. {i grave} will get decomposed into a combining grave even though there's no need to include that character)

http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1291113&cid=28572213 - "The [HTML5] spec is quite readable" - really?

[12:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: actually i get feedback regularly along those lines

[12:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: though frankly with a spec the size of html5, there are bits that are easy and bits that are hard

[12:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: maybe they're only reading the easy parts :-)

[12:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1291113&cid=28573027 - "Suddenly, I don't resent HTML5 anymore." - wow, somebody actually changed their mind in a discussion

[13:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
on /. no less

[13:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[13:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
I've had people tell me that the spec is unreadable.

[13:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
I was either told that or read a comment to that effect a few days ago, but not sure where exactly

[13:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
IMHO, the only problem I have with the spec is that being so long, it takes forever to read

[13:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've certainly had people complain it's unreadable also

[13:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what's the point of section 1.4 History? I never noticed that before. Why was it added?

[13:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
someone asked for it

[13:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, it just seems that a description of how the work started and who held the copyright for it at particular points in time isn't particularly relevant content for the spec itself

[13:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[13:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
it was easier to add it than not add it, iirc

[13:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
well, I don't have any serious objection to it being there. I just thought it was odd

[13:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, now that XHTML2 is dead, the relationship to XHTML 2.0 should be considered for removal

[13:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
leaving just the relationship to XForms parts of that section

[13:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
good point

[13:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
I will send mail, if you don't want to do it now

[13:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'll do it now

[13:43:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

/me discovers that Apple's web site lets you reserve a slot for technical support at one of their stores, with nothing more than a name and an (unverified) email address

[13:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's absurdly vulnerable to DOS attacks

[13:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
but it's user-friendly, and I guess people must not abuse it too much

[13:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but I think it only lets you book one appointment per day with the same name and email address

[13:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
That's sure to stop a determined attacker who can't think up more than one fake name or fake email address in a day

[13:51:03.0000] <Lachy>
exactly!

[13:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
actually, I was thinking that it would be nice to be able to reserve numerous consecutive slots so that the staff were free enough to spend extra time with you

[13:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: the twitter form on www.whatwg.org is also vulnerable to DOS attacks, but in practice DOS attacks aren't interesting to a lot of people

[13:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
so such features survive with occasionaly abuse

[13:54:02.0000] <Lachy>
I'm only aware of one organised attempt at DOSing Apple's Genius bar

[13:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I'm not sure how effective it was

[13:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.defectivebydesign.org/apple-challenge

[13:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: That's not a DOS attack, because there's no limit to Twitterings

[13:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
whereas there's a very limited number of 20-minute time slots in a day, and if they're all reserved then people can't get support for their stupid buggy defective expensive equipment

[13:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, would it be possible for you to remove some of those scripts running on the whatwg copy of the spec and replace them with equivalent server side processing that inserts the necessary status markers

[13:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
reloading the spec has become a really time consuming operation now

[14:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me stabs himself trying to open a DVD

[14:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
at least toc.js and status.js seem like they might work with a significant portion of their function moved server side

[14:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, their "Thanks for making a reservation" email provides a handy "Get directions to the store" link which is a 404

[14:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
i've seen HOUSES with less elaborate security systems than DVD boxes do these days

[14:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's ridiculous

[14:01:05.0000] <Philip`>
(because it doesn't include the country code in the URL, and so it'll only work in the US)

[14:01:06.0000] <Hixie>
can we please go to download-only media already?

[14:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, is that a new form of DRM the MPAA are adding to DVDs now to prevent people even opening the case? :-)

[14:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: More like ARM

[14:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: if you use safari it's pretty quick actually

[14:02:03.0000] <Lachy>
ARM?

[14:02:04.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: (Analogue)

[14:02:05.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: but yes, i've been waiting for your colleague gsnedders to implement a variety of server-side versions of these features for a while now

[14:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
heh.

[14:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
How much of status.js do we want server side?

[14:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should set up a fund for implementing these features

[14:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Start at $1, increase by $1 every day, and eventually somebody will crack and implement the feature for you

[14:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
if only gsnedders were here. I would start beating him till he stopped being lazy. I guess I will have to let jgraham and zcorpan have the honours of that while gsnedders is in sweden.

[14:04:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Sadly, for your sake, zcorpan is on holiday.

[14:04:03.0000] <Lachy>
ah, that explains why he isn't responding to his bugmail!

[14:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
at least jgraham is there

[14:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
His computer's turned on :P

[14:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
He's away for the weekend.

[14:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
status.js should be mostly client-side

[14:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
toc.js should be server-side

[14:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
and the css sheet should change to be server-side too

[14:05:06.0000] <Hixie>
the one that inserts Note: and stuff

[14:05:07.0000] <gsnedders>
toc.js certainly should be server-side

[14:05:08.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that too

[14:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
status.js could probably be sped up by moving part of it to the server side, such as inserting the actual boxes, and leave just parts of it as JS that can be done a little quicker

[14:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
how could you do it server-side?

[14:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
you'd have to generate it each time the page was served

[14:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
and that would be even slower than what we do now, given the relative speeds of html5 parsers

[14:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
HTML5 parser speed isn't important - just parse once per revision, then cache it as XML

[14:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
you check in so frequently anyway, and the statuses change so infrequently, that a relatively small delay between changes to the statuses and when they appear probably won't matter too much

[14:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
that way, they could just be updated once at checkin time when the spec in generated

[14:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I tried reproducing the crashing bug, BTW, and failed.

[14:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be nice if definition cross-reeferences were computed on the server, so that they could still work in the multipage version

[14:08:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/ee/e/

[14:08:04.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, there's a bug in BTS about the spec crashing Opera

[14:08:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I saw.

[14:08:06.0000] <Lachy>
I filed it, but had difficulty reproducing it too

[14:08:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I saw.

[14:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i think that it would be very confusing if, say, we had a wg meeting where we were going through and adding annotations, and then we had to reload, and the annotations were gone.

[14:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, fair enough

[14:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh yeah if we could do dfn.js server-side, that would rock too

[14:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: That's why I'm telling you :P

[14:09:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Yeah, you asked for that.

[14:09:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I took a brief look at that when I got bored once.

[14:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if there's a way it could be optimised in some way

[14:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Problem is getting section titles.

[14:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Doing this without massively changing Anolis and without large perf. regressions is hard.

[14:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
also i'd like to create a static version of the author (no .impl) version

[14:10:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Just no .impl? I guess that's quite easy.

[14:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why is the current stylesheet approach ineffective?

[14:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: what i'd really like is a script that takes html on stdin, removes all nodes that match certain filters (like .impl), and outputs the result on stdout

[14:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: CSS selectors as filters?

[14:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: that would be ideal but is far beyond what would be necessary

[14:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, how many anolis feature requests from me do you still have in your queue?

[14:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it's not optimal to be shipping 2MB down for 1MB's worth of rendering, or whatever it is

[14:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Dunno. I may have lost metadata as to who things are from.

[14:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: and it means you have to have JS

[14:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
well anyway, i'm happy to do change all these things (except making status things disappear as noted above)

[14:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: biblio, and inclusion (which I was basically going to reply to and say no)

[14:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
it should be noted that in safari, this is still pretty fast and snappy

[14:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
so if you're seeing perf issues, file browser bugs

[14:13:03.0000] <Lachy>
damn, that inclusion thing is somthing I really want

[14:13:04.0000] <Lachy>
didn't we already get biblio implemented?

[14:13:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Yes, I just need to merge this.

[14:13:06.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[14:13:07.0000] <Hixie>
(stick &profile=1 into the url to see timings btw, which might help track down what is slow)

[14:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm now going afk to see that movie whose dvd i was bitching about earlier.

[14:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[14:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders what DVD it is

[14:14:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I can do xpath or limited CSS

[14:14:04.0000] <Lachy>
/me guess it's a Pixar film

[14:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, load: 14065ms; toc.js: 56ms; styler.js: 2ms; updater.js: 19ms; dfn.js: 15068ms to do 22280 links; status.js: 27187ms

[14:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
OK, so vague plan:

[14:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, without that inclusion feature, how should I manage combining the auto-generated sections with the manually written sections?

[14:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
This weekend, try and move WordPress's WXR/RSS importer over to using an XML parser instead of regex.

[14:19:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Weekend after, merge in biblio to Anolis.

[14:19:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Weekend after, take an attempt at dfn.

[14:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: The problem with that is execution order is undefined in Anolis.

[14:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: So I could do includes after TOC, which would make your doc fail.

[14:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, so I would have to write a separate pre-processor from which I then pipe the output into anolis to get the final version

[14:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: yeah

[14:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You could just define the execution order

[14:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[14:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that if there's lots of tools and piping, it really would be a good idea to support XML import/export in all of them, for huge efficiency gains

[14:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Indeed.

[14:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, what is special about XML import/export?

[14:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It's a zillion times faster than HTML5 import/export

[14:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: it's just XML parsing/serializer is cheaper in Python, by a long way.

[14:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
is that because html5lib is just really slow?

[14:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Yes

[14:23:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me should make the spec splitter accept XML, and have Anolis output XML, and then it'd save tens of CPU seconds on each spec change

[14:23:05.0000] <Lachy>
and because Python's built in XML parser is actually written in C or C++ or something?

[14:23:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: C

[14:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, that's fair enough. So html5lib doesn't just suck, it just can't compete with C for speed

[14:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, actually, I think the spec splitter already uses lxml's HTML mode for input, which is close enough to XML speed

[14:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
has anyone ported html5lib to C yet?

[14:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Hixie uses lxml's HTML parser for Anolis (and html5lib serializeR)

[14:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
python $SPLITTERDIR/spec-splitter.py --html5lib-serialiser index multipage

[14:25:02.0000] <ezyang>
Lachy: No ;-) 

[14:25:03.0000] <Lachy>
I didn't realise it was possible to force anolis to use lxml's parser. Doesn't it default to html5lib though?

[14:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Looks like I do the same

[14:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Yes

[14:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me defaults to lxml

[14:26:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I'm not too concerned about speed though. I don't generate nearly as often as Hixie, and my spec is smaller

[14:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
The HTML5 serialiser is still a bit slow, though

[14:26:05.0000] <Philip`>
(but I think the lxml serialiser had correctness problems)

[14:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yes

[14:34:00.0000] <takkaria>
evening

[14:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: hi, how are you?

[14:35:01.0000] <takkaria>
I'm good

[14:35:02.0000] <takkaria>
I went for a ride to IKEA in the end

[14:35:03.0000] <takkaria>
quite a nice view from just near there

[14:35:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah

[14:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Long ago in days of yore / It all began with a god named Thor / There were Vikings and boats / And some plans for a furniture store"

[14:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
The Vikings used to purchase their Viking ships in kit form from IKEA.

[14:40:00.0000] <takkaria>
it makes sense

[14:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Where's http://www.flickr.com/photos/takkaria/3669356238/?

[14:45:00.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: at the side of the canal just near Hemk&ouml;p

[14:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: ah

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: Primer

[16:35:00.0000] <roc>
it's easy to make something a derived work of something else

[16:41:00.0000] <Viper550>
Wait, What working group

[16:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Viper550: I don't know what working group

[16:56:00.0000] <ndim>
From "10.2 Parsing XHTML documents":

[16:56:01.0000] <ndim>
Certain algorithms in this specification spoon-feed the parser characters one string at a time. In such cases, the XML parser must act as it would have if faced with a single string consisting of the concatenation of all those characters.

[16:56:02.0000] <ndim>
Does "spoon-feeding characters one string at a time" make any sense?

[16:57:00.0000] <Viper550>
so for say a site like this http://mnsi.net/~playdium (I designed it though), would HTML5 provide any advantages?

[16:57:01.0000] <ndim>
Spoon-feeding strings one character at a time, I find an obvious remark on XML parsers.

[16:57:02.0000] <ndim>
But not the other way round


2009-07-04
[17:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
ndim: Maybe "spoon-feed the parser characters one at a time"? Anyway it does seem like an error in the spec - it's probably best to email the WHATWG list about it, so Hixie doesn't lose the feedback

[17:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i probably meant "spoon-feed the input stream one string at a time"

[17:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
but yes, please send feedback

[17:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
Do you mean "one character"?

[17:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
because otherwise you don't know how long a string is

[17:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
the point is that document.write() can send input to the parser one string at a time

[17:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, right

[17:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
the phrasing might need work

[17:05:03.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe the original phrasing does actually make sense, then

[17:06:00.0000] <ndim>
It is confusing, to say the least.

[17:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me agrees

[17:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
send mail and i'll fix it

[17:06:04.0000] <ndim>
ok

[17:16:00.0000] <jwalden>
Hixie: finally got around to the structure-data threads, nicely done on the solution, looks about as simple as possible but no simpler

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
jwalden: yay


2009-07-05
[04:31:00.0000] <krijnh>
Oh hai

[06:53:00.0000] <krijn>
Start logging you!

[06:53:01.0000] <krijnh>
:(

[06:53:02.0000] <krijn>
Let's see how long it lasts

[06:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
hey, it's working now

[06:54:01.0000] <krijn>
Yeah, the magic part

[06:54:02.0000] <krijn>
:)

[06:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
have you always been running krijn and krijnh as separate users? I thought the logging used to be done on the same machine you used

[06:56:00.0000] <krijn>
No, usually I'm not here

[06:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://icanhascheezburger.com/2009/07/03/funny-pictures-sky-hmm/

[06:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
:-D

[07:12:00.0000] <karlcow>
[03:26]  <MikeSmith> about the future-of-XHTML confusion, maybe it would help for someone in the group to edit a "XHTML5 and HTML5" Note to make things clear

[07:12:01.0000] <karlcow>
I'm 30% through. I hope to have finish tonight (Montreal time).

[07:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
karlcow: excellent

[07:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe someone could volunteer to provide gap logs for whenever krinj falls out of the channel

[07:43:00.0000] <krijn>
Yeah, if anybody has the log for the last day(s), just e-mail them to me

[09:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: you planning to announce/blog about html5.enable support in nightlies?

[09:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
(since I notice it's already been mentioned on the whatwg list)

[09:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: Was your "for now" answer meaning until chaals in back?

[09:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: yeah

[10:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yes, when comment end bang is on mozilla-central

[10:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK, I saw that you had checked that into v.nu repository

[10:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: can't do the same with m-c without r&sr

[10:35:00.0000] <sayrer_>
MikeSmith: so I have anolis spitting out a document that looks like a w3c working draft. It's not clear to me which software changes the dates and/or formats it to look like an editor's draft

[10:35:01.0000] <sayrer_>
do you know?

[10:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sayrer_: about anolis, gsnedders would be the one to ask

[10:36:01.0000] <sayrer_>
oh, right, sorry

[10:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but basically, it just needs to point at the ED CSS stylesheet

[10:37:00.0000] <sayrer_>
oh ok

[10:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, when did the html5.enable pref get added to Firefox nightles?

[10:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-ED

[10:38:00.0000] <sayrer_>
MikeSmith: also, you asked me to create a new directory in the repo. you want it next to /html-design-principles etc?

[10:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: on Monday

[10:39:00.0000] <sayrer_>
don't want to create a directory in the wrong place, since cvs is pretty defective with misplaced directories

[10:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sayrer_: yep, next to html-design-principles/ etc.

[10:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
sayrer_: Yeah, as MikeSmith says, it needs to point to the style sheet. There is one option that exists for compatibility with the CSS WG's postprocessor which tries to work out what style sheet to use, but it's a really fucked up whacky algorithm.

[10:53:01.0000] <sayrer_>
gsnedders: is that -w3c-crazy?

[10:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Basically, you don't want to use it.)

[10:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
sayyeah

[10:53:04.0000] <gsnedders>
sayrer_: yeah, even

[10:54:00.0000] <sayrer_>
ok, what about the date substittutions?

[10:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
sayrer_: They should work from [DATE]

[10:54:02.0000] <sayrer_>
oh, maybe my header file is a little jacked up

[10:54:03.0000] <sayrer_>
ok

[10:54:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(or [CDATE], or [YEAR])

[10:54:05.0000] <gsnedders>
sayrer_: Got a copy of it online anywhere?

[10:54:06.0000] <sayrer_>
not yet

[10:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
[DATE: foo] should also work

[10:55:01.0000] <sayrer_>
installing lxml on OS X

[10:55:02.0000] <sayrer_>
not so fun

[10:55:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I think, again for compat, it allows [DATE, followed by anything, until ]

[10:55:04.0000] <gsnedders>
sayrer_: http://pimpmyspec.net exists too

[10:55:05.0000] <sayrer_>
I tried it, but it timed out

[10:55:06.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blames jgraham 

[10:55:07.0000] <sayrer_>
so I went for local anolis

[10:55:08.0000] <sayrer_>
it's working now

[10:56:00.0000] <sayrer_>
the recipe to build with macports libxml actually works

[10:56:01.0000] <sayrer_>
unlike every other page I found on the internet

[10:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
heh

[10:56:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I remember having fun at TPAC getting it to work on Marcos's laptop

[10:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Whereas I have always had macports installed on the computers I use)

[10:57:01.0000] <sayrer_>
I have macports, just not libxml

[10:57:02.0000] <sayrer_>
er, had

[10:57:03.0000] <sayrer_>
so it wasn't too bad

[10:57:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I have other things that have libxml as a dep :)

[10:58:00.0000] <sayrer_>
I've heard there are projects using it :)

[10:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Just a couple :)

[10:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me goes back to less productive stuff like writing in his diary

[11:00:00.0000] <hober>
Hixie: which major mode do you use for editing the spec?

[11:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like the decision to pull the plug on the XHTML2 WG boosted HTML5 questions on stackoverflow

[11:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if that means there were people previously stiill unsure about whether XHTML2 was relevant or not?

[12:23:00.0000] <syp_>
Hixie: about DOMTokenList, maybe the spec should mention how to deal with empty string tokens, like raising INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR.

[14:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
hober: text-mode

[14:43:01.0000] <Hixie>

[20:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
i need a complicated but small table for summary="" stuff

[03:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: "if an old draft" -> "of an old draft"

[03:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
well

[03:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
shockingly, it seems no two browsers interoperate on the meaning of history.back().

[03:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
i would never have guessed that

[03:53:00.0000] <takkaria>
excellent

[03:53:01.0000] <takkaria>
given that it's used all over the place, that's quite surprising

[04:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/level0/history/

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm gonna spec IE's behaviour

[04:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
(since the spec doesn't match anyone currently)

[04:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me stretches and heads for lunch, if anyone wants to join him

[04:09:01.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, why do the tests need to be cached and run again? I just tried them in Opera and Firefox and got the same result both times each test was run in each browser

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you're on a slow connection you'll get unreliable results if you don't let them get cached first.

[04:21:00.0000] <Lachy_>
ok. I'm on a fast conncetion, so didn't affect me

[05:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: typo fixed. thanks

[05:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, for the question "What’s the doctype for XHTML5 documents?" you might want to mention that <!DOCTYPE html> is also a well-formed DOCTYPE that can be used for the purpose of producing a polyglot document

[05:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I don't want to encourage people to write polyglot documents

[05:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[06:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Nice FAQ. Any progress on being syndicated on planet.mozilla? Your blog deserves more exposure...

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: planet is bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=502224

[06:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.general/629043 and following are quite interesting

[06:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
(and we got a patch out of it too, which I haven't really looked at hard yet but shows that at least some of the people are awesome some of the time)

[06:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2009-July/718802.html saner archives

[06:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(like, with next message links)

[06:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Ah. Useful. I wonder hy gmane sucks so much

[06:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
*why

[06:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
From that original post, I guess I probably ought to read the thread sometime (but I guess not now :))

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: if you want more perf, I suggest splitting up the data state the way it's split in the V.nu tokenizer

[06:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Link to hsivonen's FAQ?

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/xhtml2-html5-q-and-a/

[06:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Thanks

[06:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: How is that?

[06:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me actually wants a non-broken trunk more than perf right now

[06:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: you don't need to check the content model flag per character if you bake the content model flag into the tokenizer state

[06:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh so you have dataStateCdata and dataStateRcdata and so on?

[06:37:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: yeah

[06:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I know that in the PHP impl. that the PHP DOM extension (which is written in C) is the bottleneck for medium to large HTML documents!

[06:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: what kind of storage does it use for the children of an element?

[06:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: One with non-constant perf. characteristics. More exactly, I don't know.

[06:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: ok

[06:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Well, actually, accessing it I think is constant, but appendChild is non-constant

[06:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: it seems to me that you want linked lists of siblings and child arrays are bad

[06:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Yeah, myself and ezyang were intending on trying to write something quicker, though for distributability purposes we need something that runs in interpreted code, so it'll be fun if we get that running quicker than the DOM extension in C

[06:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
IIRC it's based upon a very old gdome

[07:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: you there? got a problem with v.nu update

[07:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I'm here

[07:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I'm rebuilding now to see if I can reproduce it

[07:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe same problem that David Eisenberg reported

[07:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the classcast exception can usually be remedied by rerunning python build/build.py all

[07:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: this may be a different error

[07:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, I'm re-running now

[07:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, this seems different

[07:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hang on, I'll post the log

[07:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: http://people.w3.org/mike/v.nu/build-log.txt

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: hmm. I may have broken the tree by failing to commit all local changes

[07:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: that's what I suspected might be the case

[07:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
easy thing to do

[07:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: try updating now

[07:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: sorry

[07:26:04.0000] <MikeSmith>

[07:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"I use XHTML because it simply feels good."

[07:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
words have failed, I guess we need to start drawing pictures

[07:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe somebody could do a comic strip

[07:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The earlier post repeats the "mobile devices are too weak to parse HTML, and XHTML is much easier to parse" story

[07:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh I forgot to have a Q and A about that

[08:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, are there any issues you're aware of with the html5.enable pref not showing up in the Linux build of the Firefox nightlies?

[08:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: wfm (but you can create the pref if it doesn't exist already)

[08:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't have Linux myself, but someone here at work wanted to try it and apparently, the pref isn't available for him

[08:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, yeah, that's what I said to do on the internal discussion list

[08:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://simonwillison.net/2009/Jul/6/xhtml/#c47115 appears to be an "interestingly" phrased Firefox bug report

[08:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: I think dude must be using the "Convert glyphs into boxes with little numbers inside them" extension for Firefox

[08:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think it's one of the developer features

[08:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as I can see, he complaint is that the little-number-boxes with lines underneath them should be a slightly different shade of blue than the one they show up in

[08:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and he has a point there -- the blue not quite right

[08:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so, good eye, John Handelaar

[08:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
a lot of people don't catch those kind of subtleties

[08:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it takes a real pro, like him

[09:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: you were saying before about coming around this evening to pick up your stuff. still got any intention of doing so?

[09:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me assumes gsnedders just wants help finding the washing machine

[09:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me would like to deny that, but it is in part true

[09:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
One way or another, this _will_ end tonight.

[09:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(I expect that's a misquote, though…)

[09:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a bit funny seeing people go "This is silly, surely we'll be working on HTML8 before 2022" seeing as how HTML4 was over a decade ago. Why the sudden change in expectancies :)

[09:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Is "Unnofficial" typoed on purpose?

[10:44:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: is it ok if I do it tomorrow?

[10:44:01.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: I'm a bit tired :)

[10:44:02.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: and I can help you find the washing machine tomorrow :)

[10:45:00.0000] <eighty4>
I'm free all day!

[10:45:01.0000] <eighty4>
absolutly free! I have nothing at all to do

[10:45:02.0000] <eighty4>
/me hides in the corner...

[10:45:03.0000] <eighty4>
having nothing to do is scary

[11:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
No matter how much data against @summary is discredited, I think jarring that there's absolutely no data (regardless of credibility) in favor of it

[11:15:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
eighty4: yeah, I guess

[11:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm, oh well, if me at work does want to persist, then so be it.

[11:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: Also, see Habari #580 for something to do :P

[11:19:00.0000] <eighty4>
oh, ETags :)

[11:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's take a fair amount of work to impl. well :)

[11:19:02.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: you're working tomorrow?

[11:19:03.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: yeah

[11:20:00.0000] <eighty4>
then just let me know in here when you'll be home

[11:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: I could even let you know when I leave the office, or when I arrive at the office :P

[11:21:00.0000] <eighty4>
I'll be in here and/or in #habari most of the day.

[11:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
As you've probably noticed, I'm not in #habari at work

[11:22:01.0000] <eighty4>
I might walk out to IKEA or something but that'll be in the morning

[11:23:00.0000] <eighty4>
no, haven't noticed that :) I'm not actually active in any channels durin working hours

[11:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm just not in them :)

[11:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(I am here, but this is vaguely work related)

[11:24:01.0000] <eighty4>
it's very work related

[11:24:02.0000] <eighty4>
:)

[11:25:00.0000] <eighty4>
I have cheez doodles

[12:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: http://www.w3.org/mid/Pine.LNX.4.62.0907060805240.1053⊙hdc — with what locale? :P

[13:05:00.0000] <tantek>
gsnedders, Hixie - I still think a "vote" on a specific feature sets a bad precedent. science isn't democracy.

[13:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
tantek: I was more attempting to make a joke

[13:45:00.0000] <smedero>
hrm. can someone remind me why I would get an "unexpected-doctype" exception in html5lib.

[13:46:00.0000] <smedero>
(for some reason I thought it didn't give a crap about the doctype...)

[13:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: Because it's not at the start of the document. But as an exception?

[13:48:00.0000] <sayrer_>
I actually don't want a vote either

[13:49:00.0000] <smedero>
I should say it was a html5lib.html5parser.ParseError

[13:49:01.0000] <smedero>
@gsnedders but yes, that makes sense.

[13:49:02.0000] <sayrer_>
I doesn't seem like anything has changed from a technical perspective

[13:49:03.0000] <sayrer_>
It doesn't

[13:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
My computer doesn't think 1 + 1 = 2 anymore?

[13:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me goes back to less useful stuff :P

[13:50:02.0000] <sayrer_>
how does it do on 5 > 2

[13:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
False. Maybe it has a virus or something.

[13:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: i agree, but sam hasn't put forward any other suggestions for how to resolve this, and he refuses to make an actual determination himself

[13:56:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, from briefly reading the recent email thread that gsnedders linked to, it appeared that there was *some* progress being made in the level of dialog (more scientific) with regards to the methodology of analysis of summary.

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
tantek: I think what progress there is is minimal.

[13:57:01.0000] <sayrer_>
gsnedders: yes, nothing seems to warrant a line item vote on the matter

[13:57:02.0000] <sayrer_>
that is supposed to be a last resort at the w3c

[13:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Basically I don't think we're going to get much more compromise from either side, and I think we're more or less stuck, with the arguments going round in circles.

[13:59:00.0000] <sayrer_>
I don't think we're stuck

[13:59:01.0000] <sayrer_>
just stop answering emails about it

[13:59:02.0000] <sayrer_>
then we're not stuck

[14:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I haven't answered any emails about it almost a year ago :P

[14:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/haven't/stopped/

[14:00:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders how that makes us less suck

[14:00:03.0000] <jgraham>
*stuck

[14:00:04.0000] <tantek>
gnsedders - I disagree - specifically, Shelley's recent message: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0152.html has a good tone and a reasonable listing of concerns with the methodology of analysis of summary. At a minimum, those concerns could (should) be documented on a wiki page, and then addressed.

[14:01:00.0000] <sayrer_>
jgraham: well, we are stuck if you are wed to making the attributes lack of success result in a conformance error

[14:02:00.0000] <tantek>
gsnedders - in addition, framing the debate as "from either side" unnecessarily harms the ability for all sides to make scientific progress on various possibilities by polarizing the issue.

[14:03:00.0000] <tantek>
gsnedders, you're right about being stuck in circles due to it being discussed in email. if you capture the issues and follow-ups in a wiki page, it becomes much easier to represent loops and duplicates (via hyperlinks) than in email.

[14:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
tantek: I think we went through stuff like what Shelley's message is about at TPAC last year with PF, though, and within a few weeks the arguments were back to what they were before that meeting

[14:04:01.0000] <tantek>
gsnedders - so why weren't those points recorded on a wiki then so they could be properly assessed? (rather than being repeated in email)

[14:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
sayrer_: So your proposition is "accept my point of view and the arguments will go away"?

[14:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
tantek: I think because nobody has bothered to put them on the wiki.

[14:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
tantek: We have a wiki page. Is is hardly fair and balanced and attempts to make it so would unlikely go down well

[14:06:01.0000] <sayrer_>
jgraham: so you do think it is really important to have it result in a conformance error?

[14:06:02.0000] <sayrer_>
like, life or death, technical showstopper?

[14:06:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It would be a lot easier if we just made no comment about what was conforming :P

[14:07:00.0000] <tantek>
jgraham - Wikipedia has had to deal with far worse conflicts than this, by recording multiple points of view (and arguments for/against), and has done so. So I disagree with your assessment that it is "unlikely [to] go down well" - offering Wikipedia conflict documentation as evidence.

[14:07:01.0000] <sayrer_>
well, that is a proposal I intend to make, but we needn't go whole hog there to resolve this specific issue

[14:07:02.0000] <sayrer_>
the author conformance requirements have a variety of motivations

[14:07:03.0000] <sayrer_>
and they are inconsistently applied

[14:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
tantek: http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/SummaryForTABLE (note also http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/SummaryForTABLE?action=info)

[14:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I think from a syntax point of view, conformance should be what produces an obvious DOM tree and the subset of the spec's algorithm and what works in legacy UAs

[14:09:02.0000] <sayrer_>
legacy UAs aren't html5-conformant

[14:09:03.0000] <sayrer_>
not remotely

[14:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Indeed, but there is a subset of input that is parsed the same.

[14:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I think there are significant reasons not to bloat the markup language with all the old, failed, ideas

[14:10:02.0000] <sayrer_>
jgraham: what are those reasons?

[14:11:00.0000] <sayrer_>
I am honestly curious

[14:11:01.0000] <sayrer_>
I don't see these attributes being reclaimed for other purposes soon

[14:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
sayrer_: It increases the language surface that authors will encounter. There is value in "there whould be one and only one obvious way to do it"

[14:13:00.0000] <sayrer_>
that is a very subjective area to venture into, but I agree it is a legitimate concern

[14:13:01.0000] <tantek>
jgraham - that wiki page certainly has a lot of good documentation, but does little to address follow-ups of the points made.

[14:15:00.0000] <tantek>
jgraham - I agree with you about minimizing the "language surface that authors will encounter" - I've been referring to that as the principle of minimal vocabulary and have documented it as a microformats design principle: http://microformats.org/wiki/minimal-vocabulary

[14:16:00.0000] <tantek>
in short, lower cognitive load which greatly helps ease of use (for authors and developers)

[14:17:00.0000] <sayrer_>
a counter example might be presentational elements

[14:18:00.0000] <sayrer_>
since those let authors do simple formatting without learning CSS

[14:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
I've tried editing various wiki pages on the w3c

[14:21:01.0000] <takkaria>
I seem to recall a couple of edits being reverted staright away

[14:21:02.0000] <takkaria>
at that point I gave up

[14:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Well, you obviously aren't doing it right :P

[14:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
I think it was around the time I bothered actively debating with Rob Burns

[14:30:01.0000] <takkaria>
I think I was editing a page he had some investment in

[14:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
tantek: I think that wiki page is very unbalanced e.g. it frames the issue as "why summary should not be provided vs why summary should be provided whilst the actual issue is about the most effective way to increase the accessibility of HTML tables

[14:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
tantek: and my perception is that any edits I make that change existing content would be reverted

[14:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
So there is no point in investing my limited time in making those changes

[14:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
(it is possible that I m wrong. However I think that other people have the same impression; the esw wiki is viewed as poisoned from the pov of HTML)

[14:43:00.0000] <smedero>
I think there was one instance of an edit war on the ESW wiki between Lachlan and Laura... if memory serves. I believe Laura suggested it was a mistake... that she accidently clobbered Lachlan's updates.

[14:44:00.0000] <smedero>
*shrug* I find most of the wiki pages on there to be insanely difficult to parse.

[14:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
smedero: Agreed. Maybe that is one of the reasons I am so loathe to edit them; it is impossible to work out where to insert things and heavy refactoring would likely remove information that people were attached to

[14:46:01.0000] <smedero>
yep.

[14:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
We should make unit tests for the wiki page :)

[14:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Are you going to get a intern to do that? :P

[14:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
(a series of statements that should be invariant under refactorings. Then we could replace the wiki page with the unit tests)

[14:48:01.0000] <smedero>
There was a suggested template structure... and people sorta stuck to it but then they misinterpreted the spirit of the headers... or perhaps... the average person doesn't share the same definition of "use case" that a software engineer has.

[14:53:00.0000] <tantek>
jgraham, then let me make the modest proposal of forking from the esw wiki, and copying any content relevant to HTML to the whatwg wiki, where the policies of the whatwg can be used to help encourage better community participation on the wiki.

[14:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
tantek: That seems like a reasonable idea

[14:55:00.0000] <tantek>
if Lachy has had trouble with his edits being reverted on the esw wiki, perhaps he might be able to help with such a migration to the whatwg wiki.

[14:56:00.0000] <tantek>
perhaps takkaria would similarly be interested in migrating to the whatwg wiki

[14:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
I gave up on the esw wiki based on edit wars with Rob Burns and, if smedero is right, Laura.

[14:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think the edit war with Laura was something about documenting use cases for video accessibility

[14:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
which is why I did document most of that on the whatwg wiki already

[15:07:00.0000] <takkaria>
heh

[15:07:01.0000] <takkaria>
the idea of migrating to the whatwg wiki is all well and good

[15:07:02.0000] <takkaria>
but people who aren't involved with whatwg have in the past refused to deal with it

[15:38:00.0000] <tantek>
takkaria - start citing the whatwg wiki in the Issues tracker. the more you make use of it, the more others will as well.

[15:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
btw in case any edit wars turn up on the whatwg wiki - feel free to create whatever pages you want; if two people disagree about how a page should exist on the whatwg wiki, then fork it and both maintain an independent copy

[15:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's just a scratch space

[15:48:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - that's a good start for documenting multiple points of view.

[15:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
Is there a page on the whatwg wiki documenting the summary issue?

[15:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
not to my knowledge

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
christ, www-font makes public-html look positively friendly

[15:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me goes to create a "Table Summary" page

[15:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, do you recall what evidence the proponents for summary="" claim supports their position?

[15:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
The only thing I can think of is that the attribute is read out by default in some screen readers

[15:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
the PFWG has consensus on the idea that summary="" is successful

[15:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but what's that consensus based on?

[15:51:03.0000] <Lachy>
maybe there's something in the esw wiki about it.

[15:52:00.0000] <hober>
That's like having consensus that the Roman Empire never fell.

[15:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It didn't.

[15:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
the consensus is based on the expert opinions of their constituents, i believe

[15:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
so it's an appeal to authority, who's consensus is itself based on an appeal to authority?

[15:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
wow

[15:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
digg is weird

[15:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Looking at the HTML 5 codec thing?

[15:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
article "Decoding the HTML 5 video codec debate - Ars Technica" has the following link suggested as "related by keyword": "5 Bizarre Sexual Conditions That Can Ruin Your Life"

[15:55:00.0000] <ojan>
5. Discussing video codecs in bed

[15:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can't scroll the digg comments page in safari

[15:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
it keeps scrolling back to the top

[15:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
wtf

[15:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
i hate digg

[15:56:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Any interesting replies to my comments?

[15:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I don't see any

[15:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Do you have all threads expanded?

[15:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was just looking to see who was trashtalking me, but it turned out to me someone who's comments are all paranoid rants, so i didn't feel the need to investigate further :-)

[15:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I do now. There's some responses to you

[16:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
"Ian Hickson is personally responsible for the failure of the video tag, because he has made too many enemies in all three camps..." :-D

[16:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
check out the guy's other comments though

[16:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
this one? "Well apparently Ian Hickson has somehow acheived the post where he is personally responsible for HTML 5, and he routeinly trash talks all the other members of the committee. I don't understand how that happened, but this is mostly a result of push back on this Ian Hickson character..."

[16:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean other comments in other threads

[16:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, here? http://digg.com/users/B1665r

[16:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
it strikes me that saying that he only writes paranoid rants is not going to help me any in convincing him that i don't trashtalk people regularly

[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
though he wouldn't have known i was talking abotu him if you hadn't pasted what he wrote and his username into the channel :-P

[16:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
just get krijnh to clean up the logs and he'll never know

[16:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't hide my words :-)

[16:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I just talk incoherently, and claim not to use words.

[16:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Though I guess UAX #29 would disagree

[16:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, no-one ever knows what you're talking about anyway :-)

[16:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: esp. on Twitter

[16:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL, some of these rationale for including summary="" from the esw wiki are funny.

[16:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
"19. Including @summary solves a real problem."

[16:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
"20. Including @summary removes an obstacle to accessibility advocates promoting the use of HTML5."

[16:15:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy - perhaps the [citation-required] template/convention of Wikipedia would be useful for claims that are made without supporting evidence.

[16:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
tantek, unfortunately, the esw wiki seems to lack any useful templates like that

[16:16:01.0000] <tantek>
Lachy, but you could introduce such templates into the whatwg wiki

[16:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that would be possible

[16:16:03.0000] <tantek>
and thus continue your fork of the Table Summary page there with more diligence

[16:17:00.0000] <hober>
pedantic correction: it's {{Citation needed}}

[16:17:01.0000] <tantek>
regarding "PFWG has consensus on the idea that summary="" is successful" - it is better (more scientific) to document data/opinions, even bad data / opinions, and debunk it, than not to document it at all.

[16:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
hober, it's it {{cite}} ?

[16:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
s/it's/Isn't/

[16:18:01.0000] <tantek>
debunk *them* (them being the opinions as it were, not the people)

[16:18:02.0000] <tantek>
if necesary, label opinions as "appeal to authority", or "based on personal anecdote" etc., whatever you think is the appropriate critique.

[16:19:00.0000] <tantek>
because even data based on personal anecdote is better than no data.

[16:19:01.0000] <tantek>
it just has be considered with the appropriate weight relative to other kinds of data (data on studies of a hundred websites for example)

[16:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not going to copy and paste most of the existing content. I think a better approach is to sift through the existing page and e-mail archives and simply document any supported claims, preferably with citations for each

[16:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
But not tonight. I'm getting quite tired.

[16:25:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy yes that seems reasonable

[16:26:00.0000] <tantek>
There may also be value in documenting which claims are *unsupported* in a separate section, just to highlight the fact that the claims are unsupported - so that if such claims are reiterated in email - you can follow-up with the response that the claim is unsupported per URL.

[16:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
I started the page. http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Table_Summary

[16:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
feel free to continue with it and I'll try and get back to it tomorrow evening

[16:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's it for?


2009-07-07
[17:02:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy - regarding the page, I've added questions to the one Pro item of the sort that I think should be asked about Pro and Con items of any particular proposed solution.

[17:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
tantek, yeah, I intend to provide that info. There's some notes about it in the esw wiki and others I've seen in the mail archives that I will have to find

[18:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: do you think we should require SQL support?

[18:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: philip.html5.org is more recent, and less of a random meaningless domain

[18:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[19:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: The cost of the ifs seems pretty irrelevant in overall html5lib performance, so it doesn't really seem like an interesting thing to optimise, if I remember correctly

[19:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Changing e.g. the way it looks at content model flag doesn't seem to affect much either

[19:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I think I tried making an extremely stripped down tokeniser that basically parses < and tag names and > and data, or something like that, and it was quite similarly slow to html5lib)

[19:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that Alton Towers has nice rollercoasters

[20:07:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: are you comparing requiring SQL with requiring Theora?

[20:39:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me would be fine with sql if there were general agreement upon some rigorous specification of exact syntax and behavior

[20:40:00.0000] <jwalden>
which doesn't seem likely to happen given the enormity of the prerequisite tasks, but is not entirely unlikely

[21:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: well, a lot of the arguments sicking makes seem to apply equally to ignoring mozilla's preference and requiring support for the sql database api

[21:04:00.0000] <roc>
The arguments seem completely different to me

[21:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in each case, the argument for inclusion would be to promote interoperability by exerting market pressure on holdouts

[21:05:01.0000] <roc>
but the reasons for people holding out are completely different

[21:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so your Mozilla's reasons for holding out are valid but Apple's are not?

[21:06:01.0000] <roc>
Modulo my limited understanding of Apple's reasons --- yes.

[21:08:00.0000] <roc>
if Web SQL was the only plausible solution for structured client-side storage, I'm sure we'd just bite the bullet and do it.

[21:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so existence of plausible (though not yet materialized) alternatives justifies holding out, in a way that specs should accomodate?

[21:13:00.0000] <roc>
depends on what you mean by "materialized"

[21:13:01.0000] <roc>
http://hg.toolness.com/browser-couch/raw-file/blog-post/index.html

[21:14:00.0000] <roc>
there are many other differences between the two situations

[21:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
fundamentally, i don't think i should be in the business of saying that apple's reasons are less good than mozilla's reasons

[21:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
in particular, not when it won't make any difference anyway

[21:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
as in this case

[21:15:00.0000] <roc>
e.g., only one browser implements Web SQL currently, so there's no interop to speak of, whereas we have three browsers with demoed or shipping Theora implementations, one of which is actually different code

[21:15:01.0000] <roc>
there's the issue of Web SQL not having a real spec

[21:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Right now we have 1 browser shipping it and 2 that have publicly committed to doing so

[21:15:03.0000] <roc>
Has Opera committed to it?

[21:15:04.0000] <othermaciej>
vs for Theora, 2 browsers shipping and 1 publicly committed

[21:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Opera has said they will do it

[21:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
(websql will have a real spec after html5 is in last call, assuming no better alternatives surface -- i'll write it myself if i have to :-) )

[21:16:02.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: OK, that strengthens the case for Web SQL a bit.

[21:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Mozilla is entitled to wait and see what happens, even if I would prefer you did implement Web SQL

[21:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's why I proposed splitting it from the rest of the Web Storage spec

[21:17:02.0000] <roc>
I doubt we'll see an independent implementation of SQLite's SQL dialect, though, which remains a worry

[21:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
i think mozilla's concerns with websql are perfectly valid

[21:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
i think apple's concerns with theora are valid too

[21:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
insofar as mozilla thinks their concerns are valid, and apple thinks their concerns are valid

[21:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
fwiw Apple is doing a new round of research on the matter

[21:18:02.0000] <roc>
I don't think we should shy away from making value judgements about peoples' concerns

[21:18:03.0000] <roc>
people have unreasonable concerns sometimes

[21:18:04.0000] <roc>
I know it can sound arrogant

[21:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
that's a very dangerous path to go down, imho

[21:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
and not one that leads to productive cooperation

[21:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
what would you do if i said that mozilla's concerns re websql weren't valid?

[21:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt you would really appreciate it

[21:19:03.0000] <roc>
We'd argue about it

[21:19:04.0000] <roc>
in the past I've had a lot of concerns that you have assuaged in one way or another

[21:20:00.0000] <roc>
I don't think I personally, or Mozilla in general, am immune to unrealistic or overblown concerns

[21:21:00.0000] <roc>
putting them on an untouchable pedestal is itself dangerous

[21:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm talking specifically about "we won't implement X" feedback

[21:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
for more nuanced feedback, things are more complex

[21:21:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the only thing anyone has done to assuage Apple's concerns (or Google's) about Theora is to say they shouldn't count or imply that they are not on the level

[21:21:04.0000] <roc>
Mozilla has not said "we won't implement SQL"

[21:22:00.0000] <roc>
at least, I don't think we have

[21:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
not quite as explicitly as apple has said it about theora, i'll grant you

[21:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, my point was just that sicking's comments seemed to be dangerously close to saying "ignore apple", which i don't think it would be appropriate for me to do, as i think it would set a precedent for ignoring any vendor whose feedback isn't convenient.

[21:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
which could be mozilla, e.g. as with websql

[21:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just trying to treat everyone fairly :-)

[21:24:01.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: there's an interesting thing. Google's got concerns about Theora not being a great codec. Fine. But they're implementing it anyway. I don't understand why Apple can't do the same.

[21:24:02.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: or at least, patents are the only reason I can understand.

[21:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
our concerns are that we could get sued, and that it might not be viable on the phone

[21:24:04.0000] <othermaciej>
we're going to investigate both these issues much more in depth

[21:25:00.0000] <sayrer_>
roc, btw, here's the message from MS on SQL dialects:

[21:25:01.0000] <sayrer_>
http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.community.web-standards/msg/d6a92db27bd52bcb

[21:25:02.0000] <roc>
"viable" as in "consumes more power than your H.264 hardware decoder" or as in "Will Not Work At All"?

[21:25:03.0000] <roc>
the former is a red herring, I think.

[21:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wouldn't phrase it in as absolute a way as you just did

[21:26:01.0000] <roc>
the latter would be a shock

[21:27:00.0000] <doublec>
vlc plays theora videos on jailbroken iphones so it's certainly possible

[21:27:01.0000] <roc>
One question in the mega-thread that I asked that never got answered is "how would supporting Theora make the iPhone *worse*"?

[21:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
"viable" as in "consumes more power than seems reasonable" and "renders at adequate performance relative to the quality of experience we expect on iPhone OS"

[21:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
er

[21:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I phrased one of those backwards

[21:28:02.0000] <roc>
does Apple reject applications from the iPhone store because they run the CPU at 100%?

[21:28:03.0000] <othermaciej>
"doesn't consume more power than seems reasonable"

[21:28:04.0000] <roc>
does Safari refuse to render Web pages that run too much JS?

[21:28:05.0000] <othermaciej>
we do limit background apps in part to avoid killing the battery

[21:28:06.0000] <othermaciej>
and yes, MobileSafari has a JS execution limit

[21:28:07.0000] <roc>
what sort of limit?

[21:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
run JS for too long within a given time period and it gets shut off for that page

[21:29:01.0000] <roc>
ok

[21:30:00.0000] <roc>
I wonder what Opera thinks about this mobile power issue

[21:30:01.0000] <roc>
since that's most of their business

[21:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, to clarify the parameters, if it took 10x as much battery that would probably be unacceptable, if it took 1.5x, that probably wouldn't be

[21:30:03.0000] <doublec>
the camera app on the iphone consumes an enormous amount of power - so does skype. Ban them imho.

[21:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway I think it needs to be put to the test whether a software-only implementation could be acceptable

[21:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I suspect Opera cares less, because it's the device vendor, not the app vendor, who faces the users' ire over poor battery life

[21:33:00.0000] <roc>
I suspect device vendors are able to forward that feedback

[21:34:00.0000] <sayrer_>
roc, anyway, I think the SQL comparison is not such a good. I don't think the storage draft has a dangling dependency.

[21:34:01.0000] <roc>
sayrer_: it's worse, it has a dependency on something that doesn't exist, a spec for SQLite

[21:34:02.0000] <sayrer_>
well, if the storage draft contains SQL

[21:35:00.0000] <sayrer_>
if it's moved into a new Web SQL API draft, that document still has it

[21:35:01.0000] <roc>
right, that could be fixed. I believe Ian when he says he'll fix it if necessary. But we can't be blamed for pushing back against the draft that exists today

[21:36:00.0000] <roc>
no-one really knows how hard it will be to spec out the SQL bit. I have faith in Ian's supreme speccing skills, that's all

[21:36:01.0000] <sayrer_>
roc, I read the response as saying the splitting of the storage spec was due to our lack of implementation

[21:36:02.0000] <sayrer_>
but it seems to me that splitting the spec is not really the same as leaving something unspecified

[21:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: :-)

anybody know of GUI alternative to ssh-keygen?

[23:14:00.0000] <kinetik>
MikeSmith: PuTTYGen, on Windows.

[23:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
kinetik: thanks

[23:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
kinetik: know if there's any equivalent for OSX?

[23:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I got an request by e-mail for info about generating a keypair, and don't know if he's on Windows or Mac

[23:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and no clue personally because I've never used anything but ssh-keygen myself

[23:18:01.0000] <jwalden>
SSHKeychain, I *think*

[23:18:02.0000] <gavin_>
send him http://github.com/guides/providing-your-ssh-key ?

[23:18:03.0000] <gavin_>
it has instructions for win/mac/linux

[23:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jwalden: I find something called "SSH Agent" (not so great a name, since there's the ssh-agent CLI tool)

[23:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
gavin_: great, thanks

[23:21:00.0000] <jwalden>
http://www.sshkeychain.org/ was what I referred to

[23:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jwalden: OK

[23:24:01.0000] <jwalden>
comment enough in <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=472529>, Hixie?  :-P

[00:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what happens if Microsoft announce that they will never support <canvas> or that they will never replace their non-tree-like DOM

[00:39:00.0000] <hober>
I think we're OK in the latter case

[00:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
hober: afaict Hixie's arguments about requiring vendor consensus means that we would have to either a) get everyone else to agree to the IE model or b) leave a big chunk of the parsing mechanism unspecified

[00:44:00.0000] <hober>
My understanding is that the cases in which IE's DOM is a non-tree aren't important for web compat

[00:45:00.0000] <hober>
which is how the other browsers have gotten away with not reverse-engineering it

[00:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
hober: Indeed. But that seems to me to be a more nuanced position than Hixie has taken.

[00:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
(possibly because the examples that have actually come up have not required it)

[00:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jwalden: I'm awake now

[00:54:00.0000] <jwalden>
hsivonen: aha!

[00:54:01.0000] <jwalden>
hsivonen: so most people on planet have full-text feeds there

[00:55:00.0000] <jwalden>
dunno if that was intentional or not, but it's a rather marked difference from most of the other posts

[00:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jwalden: My full text feed has the full text for the latest entry and the most recent entries from 24 hours

[00:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jwalden: unless there's a bug, of course

[00:56:02.0000] <jwalden>
hm

[00:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jwalden: the older entries only get summaries and typically don't show up on planets anyway after initial setup

[00:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jwalden: though the other planets I'm on are actually Venus

[00:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
in case that makes a difference

[00:57:03.0000] <jwalden>
well, at least validation 2.0 and large-amount-of-finnish-I-can't read are showing up in google reader without a body

[00:57:04.0000] <jwalden>
;-)

[00:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jwalden: but the latest entry in the Atom feed has full text, right?

[00:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I should rewrite my feed generator anyway. the current one uses severely legacy software and I can't touch it without breaking it)

[01:00:00.0000] <jwalden>
hm, I think so; I have auto-send-me-elsewhere in all the browsers I can test directly now, view-source: suggests yes but there's no formatting, so it's hard to say (wonder if mime type is wrong maybe)

[01:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
works on Planet Intertwingly

[01:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe the Planet Mozilla view becomes normal once I update when planet is already subscribing

[01:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
unless the version of planet at Planet Mozilla is so old that it can't deal with XHTML-in-Atom

[01:03:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I see the full text of "

[01:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
An Unofficial Q&A about the Discontinuation of the XHTML2 WG" on planet.mozilla.org

[01:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. right. now I see it too. 

[01:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I have no idea why the old posts appear after it

[01:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
after in time

[01:04:04.0000] <hsivonen>
before in page order

[01:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh, and planet.mozilla.org says it's running Venus

[01:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so things should go normal with the next update

[01:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hopefully

[01:06:00.0000] <jwalden>
heh

[01:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Write a short article about using the hml5 parser in nightlies so we can find out :)

[01:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I will once comment end bang is on m-c

[01:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: since not having it known to be a compat issue, so there's no point in inviting reports about not having it breaking pages

[01:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
me things that "comment end bang" is a nice name for something

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: like "spurious triples"

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i don't know what we would do if we couldn't get consensus on something as core as parsing

[02:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.sandisk.com/Products/Catalog%281433%29-Players_bundles.aspx is interesting with the HTML5 parsing algorithm

[02:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the squares at the bottom of your pages always confuse me

[02:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
i always think they're an image that failed to load

[02:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
and spent 10 seconds each time interacting with them

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do you mean the dingbat that I use for <hr>?

[02:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[02:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's a PUA glyph. you need @font-face supporting UA :-)

[02:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
i have one

[02:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
two even

[02:38:05.0000] <Hixie>
still looks like a square :-)

[02:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: interesting. which UA and which platform?

[02:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
mac os x, safari and firefox nightlies

[02:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
actually i haven't tried firefox

[02:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
works in firefox

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
that sandisk page is sad

[02:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
any idea what's wrong yet?

[02:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think it's <ul></li>

[02:40:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but further than that, I don't know yet

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[02:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Safari WFM with the font installed locally. Apple makes it too hard to test Safari with @font-face if you have the font file anywhere on disk

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and Parallels is too scared of Apple to let me run a clean VM

[02:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish safari would show your content before the ttf file downloaded

[02:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
firefox's flickering experience is actually nicer, imho

[02:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I suppose I could uninstall the font *and* go zipping all instances of the font files around all mounted volumes so that Safari couldn't detect the presence of the font on disk

[02:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I wish hyatt agreed with you

[02:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe I'll just take a look the next time I visit another Mac user who doesn't have the font locally

[02:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: WFM in firefox / opera on Linux

[02:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: which page? http://www.sandisk.com/Products/Catalog%281433%29-Players_bundles.aspx ?

[02:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
what would I see in the browser if that page not being rendered as expected?

[02:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
replacement characters or artifacts on the page somewhere?

[02:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: No hsivonen's funky pua thing

[02:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[02:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: The sandisk page breaks for me in firefox with html5.enable

[02:56:03.0000] <jgraham>
(look at the top menu)

[02:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: oh. re-reading the scrollback now, I see that's what hsivonen mentioned

[02:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me got confused

[02:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
The sandisk issue minimizes to <!DOCTYPE html><ul><li>A<ul></li>B

[03:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, re http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-July/020783.html - you mentioned you're going to be taking out the SQL stuff from webstorage. Will it be replaced by something else, or just progress in its own spec?

[03:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: separate spec for now

[03:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: maybe other specs will be introduced to compete with it

[03:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
we'll see

[03:01:02.0000] <Creap>
Is it ok to ask short html5 questions here, or is this channel about the spec process?

[03:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
Creap: both

[03:02:00.0000] <Creap>
ok

[03:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
though this is often a bitch channel so you might not get useful replies :-)

[03:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, it's just a social channel damnit :P

[03:02:03.0000] <Creap>
isn't that just IRC overall :)

[03:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: weird. The PUA wfm on Arora on Linux (built against Webkit trunk) but not in latest Chrome (191)

[03:04:00.0000] <Creap>
well, I'm considering having a fieldset with a meter measuring how secure a password a user has entered is, and some text on how to improve it. technically it's not a form element..

[03:04:01.0000] <Creap>
maybe if I combine it with an output?

[03:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: maybe beause Arora is QtWebkit, Chrome is GTK+

[03:04:03.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, have you explained what will happen with the SQL stuff in more detail, elsewhere?

[03:04:04.0000] <Lachy>
like in any mail I may have skipped in public-webapps?

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
no

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
bu tthere's no much to explain

[03:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just plan to split web storage into two, web storage and web database

[03:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: for now, I'm treating the PUA thing as a bug that should be fixed in WebKit rather than fixing it in my CSS

[03:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: wow, weird. i thought IE ignored </li> altogether. send mail, we should be able to fix that.

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: this is interesting: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533020%28VS.85%29.aspx#Close_Your_Tags

[03:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
what's the reason for splitting it? Is it because it's not clear whether the SQL stuff has an uncertain future?

[03:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: btw if you could comment on mjs' idea of introducing a third level of conformance (summary being conforming but showing a warning) that would be useful

[03:08:03.0000] <Lachy>
let me rephrase...

[03:08:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: hmm, even http://sandisk.com page looks equally porked with html5.enable

[03:08:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: (on the list, about to go to bed)

[03:08:06.0000] <Lachy>
... Is it because the SQL stuff has an uncertain future?

[03:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: assuming that the MSDN article has been written by someone who actually knows IE internals

[03:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: main reason is because they are independent features, and might have different lifecycles

[03:09:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:09:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I haven't read list email today. I'll get to it.

[03:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: but the uncertain future and the weirdness from the oracle guy were further motivating factors

[03:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'll get to it some time, not now that is.

[03:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: no rush, but i'm holding off on replying to mjs pending your input

[03:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
looking at msdn page...

[03:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
Creap: <meter> would be appropriate for that in html5

[03:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
Creap: not supported anywhere yet of course

[03:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
Creap: <output> would be fine too

[03:13:00.0000] <Creap>
nope, but since javascript will be required anyway, I might as well use meter with attributes for visual hints, for instance, if value is lower than 'low' then make the text red

[03:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: if that's written by someone who knows their parser, that's a frightening insight into what their code does

[03:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: There seems to be a typo in your bug report

[03:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I guess http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7084 should say <ul>, not <iul>

[03:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me shakes his fist at jgraham

Oh, and there's a </l>

[03:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess some accidental drag&drop moved the i around

krijnh: More logs?

[04:12:01.0000] <krijnh>
For #webapps, dont' know

[04:13:00.0000] <krijnh>
Still gotta put yours online, but they're on a different machine atm :)

[04:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And reformat them, I bet :)

[04:14:00.0000] <krijnh>
Nah, why? :)

[04:14:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You don't seem to be on w3c-irc right now, so I can hold off sending them until you're back stable

[04:14:02.0000] <krijnh>
I'm not?

[04:14:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, the logs I sent you include the control characters for colors and stuff

[04:14:04.0000] <krijnh>
Ah, I'm not :p

[04:15:00.0000] <krijnh>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/webapps/20090707#l-25

[04:16:00.0000] <krijnh>
I don't think those characters are a problem

[04:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, if you want user modes you have to translate the nick colors :)

[04:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Since I use color coding instead of mode prefixes

[05:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do Microsoft and Nokia count as browser vendors who have veto on spec sections?

[05:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. spammers have developed networks of hundreds of inter-following spam twitter accounts

[05:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, link?

[05:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder how that's useful for spammers

[05:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
pm'ed link to avoid driving traffic to spammers

[05:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
from krijn's logs, that is

[05:07:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Doesn't this channel have the comment feature?

[05:07:03.0000] <hsivonen>
ah. right. what was it?

[05:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't know

[05:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, what feature are you referring to?

[05:08:02.0000] <Dashiva>
We could check the logs - oh wait :)

[05:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the one developed for webapps WG

[05:08:04.0000] <krijnh>
#off, but it doesn't work here

[05:08:05.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I don't think it does

[05:08:06.0000] <Lachy>
it's [off] but it doesn't work here

[05:08:07.0000] <hsivonen>
krijnh: ah. ok

[05:08:08.0000] <krijnh>
Of [off]

[05:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: is it really surprising?

[05:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: well, not really

[05:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: I'm not surprised that there are spam accounts

[05:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: I'm mildly surprised about them taking the time to arrange follower numbers

[05:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I'd call it "two degrees of Google"

[05:12:00.0000] <virtuelv>
while twitter uses nofollow, I think the ultimate purpose is to get people to create the links elsewhere

[05:12:01.0000] <virtuelv>
and twitter drives significant traffic to a site on its own

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/43972 is a great example of why hasFeature() kind of APIs don't work on the Web

[05:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't hasFeature pretty much relegated to Java use?

[05:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe the return values should be "maybe" and "maybeNot"

[05:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
Has anyone ever actually used the HTML DOM in Java, and do they still?

[05:16:02.0000] <virtuelv>
Dashiva: hasFeature has been considered for widgets

[05:16:03.0000] <Philip`>
(where by "HTML DOM" I mean the parts that aren't used for generic XML)

[05:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is unaware of what contexts it would be used in

[05:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. great. now Dr. Nielsen's expertise *can* be questioned :-)

[05:17:02.0000] <virtuelv>
because let's say you specify <feature name="http://example.com/directbraininterface">, and configuration disallows it, you might just want to know

[05:17:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Isn't hasFeature a generic part of DOM?

[05:18:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Dashiva: document.implementation.hasFeature, yes

[05:19:00.0000] <virtuelv>
DOM1

[05:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Maybe the return value should just be "maybe"

[05:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://grack.com/blog/2009/07/07/video-support-for-older-browsers/

[05:38:00.0000] <virtuelv>
jgraham: "maybe" and "false"

[05:38:01.0000] <virtuelv>
or "no way in hell"

[05:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
virtuelv: "buggy" and "false" seems more accurate

[05:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy, jgraham - I have opera:config#AutoUpdate|DownloadAllSnapshots set to on

[05:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but when I do "Check for updates"

[05:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me can see where this is going and the answer is "I don't know"

[05:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
it tells me I'm running the latest version

[05:58:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[05:58:04.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, you'll want to ask someone from Desktop, I think

[05:58:05.0000] <jgraham>
I can of course ask if Lachy or someone doesn't know

[05:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, if you know who does know, feel free to PM me with a name, and I'll bug them instead

[06:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Can I leave this to you? All the desktop people are in Oslo...

[06:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, I will relay your question to #staff

[06:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, I was given this as the response:

[06:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: I see. well, please convey to Rijk (or Olli or Claudio or somebody) that perhaps it's time they might want to get around to spending some time making it a "push one button" operation

[06:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, feel free to email them or comment on the desktop team blog about that

http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/07/06/ogg_theora_h_264_and_the_html_5_browser_squabble.html

[06:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: oh great. Apple enthusiasts joining the 'debate'

[06:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
for the most part, it's a reasonable article, except for a few bogus claims about Opera near the end

[06:30:01.0000] <Rik|work>
I like the historical point of view

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: well, up front they say " Ogg Theora, commercially abandoned nearly a decade ago, doesn't have what it takes to deliver video on the increasingly mobile web"

[06:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
and it seems to reject Ogg Theora as "commercially abandoned nearly a decade ago,"

[06:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah

[06:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, and they also repeat Google's claim about it's inability to use Ogg Theora due to bandwidth issues, without mentioning that claim itself is highly questionable

[06:33:00.0000] <Rik|work>
they also claim that Apple can't bet on Theora because of submarine patents but H264 may have the same problems

[06:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it has an Apple press flavor where you assume that whatever Apple is doing with the iPhone is right and then construct arguments not to contradict that assumption

[06:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or explaining how great move it is to go glossy with displays

[06:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
Rik|work, sure, there's always a chance that h.264 has some submarine patents applying to it that haven't yet surfaced, but given that it's been out for so long with so much industry support, and that none have surfaced yet, it's becoming more and more unlikely

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, the article totally misses the point regarding patents and GPLed software produced outside the U.S. and not shipped commercially

[06:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
glossy displays with sufficient anti-reflective coating may not be too bad. The glossy display on my iMac has no problems

[06:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: That article is so far from npov it cannot be described as "reasonable"

[06:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
Though, I haven't yet used a laptop with a glossy display, in enough places to judge

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: my data points are that the built-in display of my MacBook sucks horribly. (fortunately, I only use it while traveling)

[06:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: and my in-store experience with the latest Cinema Display is that it is unusably reflective

[06:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
which is bad, because having to shop for an HP or Lenovo display is a pain

[06:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
having to read technical details and stuff

[06:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and having to make compromises on how the enclosure fits into other decor

[06:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
the problem with in-store experience is that it doesn't quite match real world conditions

[06:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
They should let you borrow monitors and take them home to test them in real world conditions

[06:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the store had a window

[06:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the real world has a window, too

[06:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
The real world has many windows

[06:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
meanwhile, the old 30" Cinema Display was great in the same store under the same harsh conditions

[06:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
harsh as in having a window!

[06:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
with sunlight

[06:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
next time I'm in an apple store, I will take a look at their displays

[06:47:03.0000] <Lachy>
which should, hopefully, be some time this week, assuming they finally repair my iMac

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Bad version number in .class file

[06:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
haven't had that problem with JDK 5 before

[06:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe the world has started to move on to 6 now

[07:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Is hsivonen.iki.fi down?

[07:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Oh, it worked now

[07:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: just really slow

[07:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Okay

[07:12:03.0000] <hsivonen>
(I don't know why. It's a shared host.)

[07:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
My legacy scripts depending on PyGenx are inconvenient to move to another host

[07:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
lesson: never depend of C-backed python modules that aren't available via apt

http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/07/in-defense-of-web-developers/

[07:29:00.0000] <Rik|work>
I don't understand why zeldman loves xhtml so much

[07:29:01.0000] <Rik|work>
what does it provide over html4 ?

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
It encourages prettier syntax

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there some web server or proxy that can be configured to return 503 if there are more than n simultaneous requests to the set of URIs matching some pattern?

[07:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
right now I have trouble saying anything that wouldn't be snarky, and I've already been blamed for being snarky about XHTML-as-text/html

[07:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but it seems it's more in defense of gurus who promoted XHTML than in defense of the developers who followed them

[07:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems in defense of the tactics of picking a technology as the basis of a marketing platform that has little to do with the technology itself

[07:39:00.0000] <karlcow>
welcome to the real world, aka not browsers, but people writing xhtml everywhere :) 

[07:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
i.e. using XHTML to promote clean semantic markup, similar to using AJAX to promote asynchronous updates, and similar to using HTML5 to promote web application APIs

[07:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
"switching from HTML to XHTML was the perfect catharsis to leave behind not only the old syntax, but more important the old habits and practices of building a webpage"

[07:41:01.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: it is a discussion I already had with hsivonen in october 2007. XHTML exists. It is used. It is not served properly and not parsed by browsers as such, but people are writing xhtml in their editors. and it's what matters to them.

[07:41:02.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: yep, it helped people to look at the language in a different way.

[07:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the popularity of XHTML 1.0 Transitional doctype suggests a different thing

[07:42:01.0000] <karlcow>
xhtml 1.0 transitional suggests: target ;)

[07:43:00.0000] <karlcow>
But working again in a Web agency after a few years, I'm listening the people around me.

[07:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
"[XHTML] taught a generation of developers what good code should or could look like. It was something that was always possible in HTML4 but XHTML1 helped train people to be more thoughtful and careful with their code. And in that sense, I think it was a success."

[07:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
It seems that Zeldman's point is that promoting XHTML was good because he used it as a hook for the idea of promoting better semantics and structure, but that unfortuately gave rise to the myth that XHTML is somehow more semantic than HTML.

[07:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Myths aren't necessarily bad

[07:44:03.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: indeed

[07:44:04.0000] <Lachy>
they are when people use those myths to then promote XHTML as being better than HTML

[07:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Why is that bad?

[07:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
That argument sounds remarkably close to "people are too stupid to understand the full story so we have to present half truths instead"

[07:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
because it attaches a stigma to HTML portraying it as being less semantic, and thus not a good choice to use

[07:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
fwiw, my much more snarky "wannabe" post was set in motion by an XHTML believer complaining about OpenOffice.org's HTML output having upper-case tags

[07:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
if you look at my latest, you can tell which tags are generated by OO.o and which ones are hand-written in TextWrangler

[07:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
which is probably horribly untidy

[07:46:04.0000] <karlcow>
/me wonders in the polyglot section if I should write down the requirements to have real documents working in the two world. It will be a very tiny subset but that would be interesting at least to set that.

[07:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
using uppercase tag names is so last century. Lowercase tags are obviously superior

[07:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, in which document are you writing that?

[07:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: it's probably also very uncool to use OO.o to write HTML

[07:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: That sounds like marketing, which is what this is all about

[07:48:02.0000] <karlcow>
Lachy: http://www.la-grange.net/2009/07/05/html5-xhtml5/ I have not sent it to the WG, but MikeSmith suggested a few fixes.

[07:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: I suggest not having a polyglot section

[07:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
Using OOo (or MS Word) as a tool to write documents intended to be HTML is bad. But being able to export documents written in those formats to HTML is a good thing, if it gets implemented well

[07:49:02.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: why?

[07:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I think I'm interested in what the actual real harmful effects of promoting XHTML over HTML are, when it's used as part of the semantic markup marketing platform, because hopefully we could try to minimise similar effects when using HTML5 as part of the rich web application marketing platform

[07:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: if a polyglot section goes up on w3.org, we'll have a generation of gurus telling developers to carefully write polyglot documents without the developers quite understanding why

[07:50:02.0000] <karlcow>
I already had one comment by mail asking me to develop it further.

[07:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It seems like people ho are paid to work with HTML should have a better-than-marketing level knowledge of the technology. Being more informed allows them to make more sensible choices about their code

[07:50:04.0000] <jgraham>
*who

[07:50:05.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: head in the sand? 

[07:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: I didn't put my head in sand but instead suggested outright that people not bother with polyglot documents

[07:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
karlcow: Taking private feedback :)

[07:51:02.0000] <karlcow>
jgraham: your "should" is not aligned with real world. What I said at the beginning, welcome back to real world

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
karlcow: In your definition of polyglot documents, should it include a requirement that the syntax is processed in equivalent ways in both HTML and XHTML? e.g. <textarea>[newline]stuff</textarea> is very different in HTML vs XHTML, so it can't be safely used in polyglot documents

[07:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, nice. I have plans to discuss a lot of those issues in the HTML 5 Reference. Maybe, when you're done, I could incorporate some of that into it

[07:52:02.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: the fact that you can write polyglot documents, makes it a possibility that people will explore. :) 

[07:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
karlcow: So in your real world, the gurus should make up whatever story they think will placate the masses of web developers without worrying about the side effects of people being underinformed?

[07:53:01.0000] <karlcow>
mouahaha

[07:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: I can already foresee new myths being developed on top of the polyglot concept

[07:54:01.0000] <karlcow>
we turn into rhetorical manipulation. :) going back to work ;) sorry chaps

[07:54:02.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_vs._XHTML lists most of the syntactic differences. I think there was a few small things missing, but I can't recall what they were

[07:54:03.0000] <karlcow>
Lachy: look at the top of the document

[07:54:04.0000] <karlcow>
I cite this document

[07:54:05.0000] <karlcow>
:)

[07:54:06.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[07:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just saw the table listing syntax differences, and it seemed a little short

[07:55:01.0000] <karlcow>
Previous Version:

[07:55:02.0000] <karlcow>
    http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/01/html5-is-html-and-xml

[07:55:03.0000] <karlcow>
    http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_vs._XHTML

[07:55:04.0000] <Lachy>
maybe it's not. I'd need more than a cursory glance to know for sure

[07:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, in that table, for some of the things like Unquoted Attributes and Attribute minimisation, the cells in the XHTML column say "not allowed" accompanied by an example.  At first, it wasn't clear to me what about the example wasn't allowed.

[07:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
Then I realised that it was meant as an example of what is allowed in XHTML. It would be nice to find a way to make that clearer

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Seems like division of labour - some people spend years learning all the subtleties of markup syntaxes, and then provide recommendations which can be followed by people who don't want to waste time repeating that whole learning exercise needlessly, and those recommendations necessarily have to summarise and condense and ignore some issues so they can be understood more readily

[07:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
and I object to you using <p class=sloppy> as an HTML example of unquoted attributes. Saying it's sloppy seems to convey that it is somehow bad, even though it's a perfectly valid technique

[08:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and hopefully the people providing the recommendations can minimise the harm caused by misinterpretation of the truth)

[08:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
I would prefer it if documents like this stayed more neutral on the debate about which syntax is better to use, and let authors make a more informed choice

[08:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and those experts would still be expected to justify their arguments in detail if someone asked them about it, so they're not expecting people to blindly rely on their expert status)

[08:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: There is truth in that. In this case I dispute that "XHTML good, HTML bad" (which was roughly the message that many people got) is at the right level of simplicity

[08:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
the right message that should be conveyed to web developers is that HTML and XHTML are optimised for different requirements, and that authors should choose the one most appropriate for their needs

[08:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
If people think that quoating their attribute values and closing their tags helps them to write maintainable code then that's a decision that they should be free to make. We should have tools to help them enforce those coding standards. We shouldn't conflate that with pseudo-XHTML

[08:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
In most cases, given the current browser market, the right choice is generally HTML. But there are legitimate uses for XHTML when done right

[08:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, indeed

[08:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: So it sounds like you agree with the general idea of lying to simple-minded developers, and just have a different view (than people promoting only-XHTML-is-semantic) of whether the harmful consequences of one particular simple lie are unpleasantly (and hopefully avoidably) high

[08:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I agree that it shouldn't be necessary to know the full detail of the whole language to get started. I wouldn't haracterise that as "lying"

[08:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: "Not telling the truth", then? :-)

[08:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I also think that the language should be designed in such a way that it is easy to learn the full language)

[08:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Not really. "Not trying to present the full complexity of everything all at once but making it avaliable when necessary" sould be more like it

[08:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
*would

[08:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (The full language is a simplification of reality devised by experts, who e.g. understand all the details of what <br /> means in SGML and XML and how it's implemented in browsers and why it was promoted instead of <br/> and how common all these things are, and choose to hide all those details and just recommend "you must do this or this")

[08:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (so "learn[ing] the full language" just seems like another instance of following experts' recommendations without really understanding them)

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (and doesn't seem fundamentally different to other instances of the same thing, at higher levels than the markup language syntax)

[08:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (I hope you don't ask me to clarify my argument since I've now forgotten what my argument was or whether I even had one)

[08:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It seems like a big leap to go from "practitioners of the language should be knowledgeable enough to to make informed choices within the constraints imposed by the conformance criteria" to "there should be no conformance criteria since they represent arbitary limitations"

[08:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It does

[08:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Who is suggesting the latter?

[08:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(...in this discussion, i.e. ignoring sayrer :-p )

[08:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It seemed like the logical conclusion of your argument that "learn[ing] the full language" just seems  like another instance of following experts'  recommendations without really understanding them

[08:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
I can't believe how many of my twitter followers have joined in the "campaign" to get me on the Australian version of Beauty and the Geek, despite me not being there to participate :-/

[08:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: My argument is that people should be able to follow experts' recommendations without really understanding them, and the experts should provide recommendations to optimise that behaviour

[08:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. by providing conformance criteria for the language, and providing simple marketing terms like "XHTML" or "AJAX" or "HTML5" to encourage people to adopt a whole platformful of goodness (while trying to minimise the harm from the simplifications)

[08:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
I agree with the first part, less so with the second

[08:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
(and of course with the thrd)

[08:28:00.0000] <beowulf>
web developers don't need to understand the sticks with which they beat each other with, but it helps

[08:30:00.0000] <nikto>
and then comes the Black Swan, and your 'web developers' that just follow guidelines and expert counseling are faced to understand the 'display' property and it's values, and how this affects rendering of DIVs, SPANs, and everything

[08:30:01.0000] <nikto>
so.. a nice learning path for the very deep details should be offered to them, imho

[08:31:00.0000] <nikto>
not to mention the difference it makes when in quirks mode, or when in stric mode, etc.

[08:32:00.0000] <nikto>
the most efficient dev teams I've met had zero 'web developers'. They had developers, and graphic designers at the other side, but no glue in between

[08:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: saying that non-conforming parts aren't part of the "full language" for learning is a bit questionable

[08:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: fwiw, I didn't mean to "belittle" anyone for their preferences. What I have an issue with is telling people to jump through hoops due to bogus rationale.

[08:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(HTML5 conformance has some of that, too, IMO)

[08:52:00.0000] <adactio>
I don't recall anyone ever saying that XHTML was better than HTML; just different.

[08:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: oh, there have been people who've complained or ridiculed stuff for being valid HTML 4 but not XHTML

[08:52:02.0000] <adactio>
Citation needed.

[08:53:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm no citation, but it was certainly a popular meme

[08:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
+1

[08:53:02.0000] <karlcow>
Lachy: "At first, it wasn't clear to me what about the example wasn't allowed." Yes I agree, I will improve that.

[08:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://www.webstandards.org/learn/articles/askw3c/oct2003/

[08:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
(that article is quite balanced but still says things like "The syntax proposed by XHTML 1.0 has several important benefits")

[08:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I can't find the post that inspired me to write http://hsivonen.iki.fi/wannabe/ anymore, but it was someone saying that OpenOffice.org was wrong to emit uppercase tags

[08:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(and I do agree that lower case is nicer)

[08:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess these should be cataloged just like Namespace confusion in order to be able to respond to "citation needed" when prompted

[08:56:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: But when you lump everyone who prefers XHTML syntax into a group labelled "HTML haters", you are guilty of equal FUD as the minority who claimed that XHTML was somehow better than HTML.

[08:58:00.0000] <jacobolus>
too bad mark pilgrim isn't around. his little poem is great :)

If I say "I like XHTML syntax", that is not the same thing as saying "XHTML is superior to HTML." Just because someone else who prefers XHTML syntax has made that erroneous claim doesn't mean we share that belief.

[08:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I don't think everyone who prefers XHTML syntax is an HTML hater. I just think that using XHTML-as-text/html is a marketing thing, and has no technical basis in how it gets consumed (as has been claimed; passive voice, no citation)

[08:59:00.0000] <jacobolus>
adactio: people say "I like XHTML because ..." and then their reasons are simply wrong

[08:59:01.0000] <karlcow>
/me still fixing http://www.la-grange.net/2009/06/html5-xhtml5/

[08:59:02.0000] <karlcow>
I'll write more tonight when I have time

[08:59:03.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: no, but "I like XHTML syntax" is different from going on to give utterly bogus technical reasons 

[09:00:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: in your Q & A you made it sound like anyone who uses XHTML syntax was doing so out of a desire to feel superior.

[09:00:01.0000] <adactio>
jacobolus: http://simonwillison.net/2008/Jun/5/cafes/#c39300

[09:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I believe some are, but I don't think everyone is

[09:00:03.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I think many are just doing what gurus have told them to do

[09:00:04.0000] <jacobolus>
s/many/most/

[09:01:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: that distinction was not clear in your article. You tarred anyone who chooses to use XHTML with the same brush.

[09:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I concede that the "new and shiny" part was snarky. I think the "marketing" part was correct, though.

[09:02:00.0000] <jacobolus>
adactio: sure, and I can make my Python code conform to PEP 8, and I can write C code using some style guideline, K&R, say

[09:02:01.0000] <jacobolus>
adactio: there's no need to call that 'xhtml' though

[09:03:00.0000] <adactio>
Look, let me give you my own personal reasons why I have historically used XHTML syntax:

[09:03:01.0000] <adactio>
The extra bit of strictness makes the validator a more powerful tool...

[09:04:00.0000] <jacobolus>
really depends whether your validator is doing proper parsing

[09:04:01.0000] <adactio>
Just recently, a colleague who was using HTML 4, couldn't find a problem because it was being caused by a missing closing </p>.

[09:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: it also makes the W3C validator not report some parsing problems

[09:04:03.0000] <adactio>
I'd quite happily use HTML 4 if there were some kind of "lint" options available that enforced the strictness of XHTML syntax.

[09:04:04.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: a better solution is to make an HTML validator warn about implied tags

[09:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(yeah, I know, vaporware feature at this point)

[09:05:01.0000] <adactio>
In the absence of such a lint tool, XHTML 1 suits me quite nicely.

[09:05:02.0000] <adactio>
And I'll call it XHTML (even though I'm serving it as text/html) because there isn't a better term.

[09:05:03.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: what about <script src='...'/>? 

[09:05:04.0000] <jgraham>
If this whole thing comes down to "people want a HTML lint" then it seems like we should give up talking and just write the damn lint

[09:05:05.0000] <adactio>
Yes please. :-)

[09:05:06.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: XHTML validation trades in a different set of silently passed problems

[09:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has noticed several people in blog comments saying they like XHTML's strict syntax, so presumably they'd be happy with a lint-like tool too

[09:06:01.0000] <adactio>
Yeah, I know it's not ideal but I'm happy to live with those issues for the sake of a stricter validation check.

[09:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: HTML5 validation overall is stricter than an XHTML 1.0 DTD check

[09:06:03.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: although not for implied close tags

[09:06:04.0000] <adactio>
From my own anecdotal evidence, chatting with colleagues, an HTML lint tool would be *very* welcome.

[09:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Require explicit end tags, lowercase element/attribute names, quoted attribute values, maybe still allow valueless attributes

[09:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
(the sensible place to write the lint is as part of the validator of course which really means that I'm volunteering hsivonen. But it wouldn't be impossible to make something that didn't validate but did waarn about unquoted attributes and so on)

[09:07:02.0000] <adactio>
Something like Douglas Crockford's JSLint: cruel but fair. :-)

[09:07:03.0000] <adactio>
I too nominate hsivonen to build this. ;-)

[09:07:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me thinks JSLint is a bit excessive when it complains about semicolons after function bodies, and therefore gave up attempting to use it

[09:08:00.0000] <adactio>
Seriously though, it would be sooooo useful!

[09:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I very much see the demand for some XHTML-like lint options in V.nu. I plead having been busy.

[09:08:02.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: understandably busy!

[09:09:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: and don't get me wrong; validator.nu kicks ass.

[09:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, if I had had someone vet my post ahead of publishing, I would have toned down the snark

[09:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2009Jul/0013.html

[09:09:03.0000] <hsivonen>
but by now it's been quoted all over, so there's no point hiding it

[09:09:04.0000] <hsivonen>
at best I could put a strike-over there and add a note that it distracts from the other points

[09:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
although it seems controversial stuff gets more incoming links :-/

[09:10:01.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: ah, the Digg school of online publishing. ;-)

[09:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: it was unintentional

[09:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but I observe that saying stuff that XHTML authors take offense with gets more links faster than just-the-facts like /doctype/

[09:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ah. "personal preferences" rides again. sigh.

[09:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I guess you are unintentionally discovering the effectiveness of trolling :-)

[09:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
:-( http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/07/in-defense-of-web-developers/ spreads misinformation about the history of quirks mode and HTML 4

[09:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yeah, I noticed that too

[09:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
"A few who became disenchanted with XHTML early retreated to HTML 4, and as browsers stopped going into Quirksmode in its presence, valid, structural HTML 4 became a reasonable option again."

[09:27:00.0000] <takkaria>
I don't see Zeldman or the comments pointing out that there is an XHTML5 too

[09:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure if Zeldman is aware of it. Though, I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he is, and that he just didn't mention it.

[09:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me groans

[09:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, what are you groaning about?

[09:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
#svn can't even say whether I can rely upon all SVN checkouts of one revision being byte-for-byte equivalent

[09:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/equivalent/identical/

[09:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
wtf?

[09:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
svn:eol-style makes it fun for text files.

[09:30:04.0000] <takkaria>
as in, given two SVN checkouts of the same revision, will they be exactly identical

[09:30:05.0000] <takkaria>
?

[09:30:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah.

[09:30:07.0000] <Lachy>
if they're not, then wouldn't that be a bug in SVN?

[09:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, it's a feature.

[09:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
???

[09:31:02.0000] <takkaria>
except for svn:eol-style, I can't think of any reason why they wouldn't be

[09:31:03.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: svn:eol-style is alone a big enough problem for me.

[09:31:04.0000] <Lachy>
does svn:eol-style control whether new lines in text files are CR/CRLF/LF ?

[09:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
Lachy: yeah.  and there's a 'native' setting that checks them out as whatever is platform-native

[09:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
If svn:eol-style=native then it automatically converts between the repository and working copies

[09:32:02.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: I can't see why, unless your two checkouts are on different machines with different OSes

[09:32:03.0000] <Lachy>
grrr. What stupid moron copied that feature from FTP ASCII transfers.

[09:32:04.0000] <matt_mastracci>
Hey all...  I started working on a <video> compatibility shim for older browsers: http://code.google.com/p/video4all/   It works in virtually every browser I've tested so far, with the exception of Windows Safari w/o QuickTime installed.

[09:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It's very useful for projects that are developed partly with Windows tools and partly with Linux/OSX tools

[09:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, there are developer tools available for Windows that support LF line endings

[09:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. you set all .cpp files to native and then everyone can use their favourite text editor and you won't get spurious diffs from line-ending changes

[09:33:03.0000] <Lachy>
Unless of course, you're using Notepad, in which case, you have bigger issues.

[09:33:04.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It's more of a pain to find and configure those tools than to just make SVN do the right thing automatically

[09:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's just a pain that Microsoft continues to perpetuate that CRLF as default nonsense

[09:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be even more of a pain if they changed it

[09:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
they would need a migration strategy, which would first involve ensure all Microsoft software support LF

[09:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
and secondly would involve ensuring a zillion pieces of third-party software, much of it written in the 90s with no source code available and being used as critical pieces of business infrastructure, all support LF?

[09:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
if they had done that with Notepad in XP (even if CRLF was still the default then), and encouraged other vendors to begin adopting LF as the default in more recent years, the migration could go smoothly

[09:37:01.0000] <takkaria>
this comment wins an award: http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/07/in-defense-of-web-developers/#comment-44177

[09:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That would be great until the first time someone edited a file in Notepad and then opened it in some other program and it stopped working, and they'd blame XP for being stupid and buggy and would go back to Win98

[09:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, I suppose you might mean supporting LF only on input, not output

[09:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[09:38:02.0000] <Lachy>
at least for XP

[09:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Since Notepad is just a standard text control, it would involve either changing the standard text control (which would break a zillion other applications) or rewriting Notepad to not use that control (in which case it would be Wordpad)

[09:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
If they'd done that then, now with Windows 7 given that pre-XP users are negligable in most places (especially work environments), they could start switching to LF as default for output

[09:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
there's no reason the standard text control shouldn't support LF on input

[09:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That would be great until the first time someone edited a file in Notepad in Windows 7 and then opened it in some other program and it stopped working, and they'd blame XP for being stupid and buggy and would go back to Vista

takkaria: On the same machine they'll be identical, sure.

[09:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Win 2000 is not non-negilable

[09:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: On different machines you might have different versions of SVN with different working copy formats

[09:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, citation?

[09:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
(I'm aware of the fact that I should provide a citation for my claim too)

[09:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: See my old school.

[09:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, still running Win2k? Why?

[09:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[09:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Why pay for XP?

[09:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
they will need to upgrade by mid next year, since Win2k support ends, meaning no more security fixes

[09:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me prefers to grind skeleton warriors for XP, so he doesn't have to pay anything

[09:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
at least, no more free fixes, if I understand how Microsoft support works

[09:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, what?

[09:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Just a pointless irrelevant MMORPG reference

[10:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: if I've sown confusion, it hasn't been deliberate. on the contrary, I've deliberately tried to unconfuse people who've been confused technically as a side effect of using "XHTML" as a social marketing platform

[10:05:00.0000] <Rik|work>
anybody proposed a <input type=coordinates> for HTML5 ?

[10:07:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: understood. And for the most part, your post was just the facts ...but the bit where you (mis)characterised everyone who ever chose to author in XHTML, while clear, was an opinion, snarkily delivered. It sits awkwardly amongst the rest of the Q & A.

[10:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
"The W3C should stop writing new specifications, not only do they take so damn long, but they take years longer before they’re fully supported to a level where web professionals can use them.

[10:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
XHTML 1 works, leave it be. Go improve SVG, X3D, SMIL, or anything you want – but if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it – because fixing it WILL break it."

at least, i think the answer is yes not having checked to see if it actually is yes

[12:40:00.0000] <gavin_>
good enough for me, thanks :)

[15:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
aw, hsivonen didn't reply to mjs' idea

[15:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
were you hoping he would?

[15:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess his opinion on it is pretty relevant

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
i asked him to :-)

[15:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm waiting for his opinion before replying myself

[15:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
mjs's idea?

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
introducing a level of conformance between "conforming" and "down-played errors" that shows a validator warning but is still conforming

[15:44:01.0000] <takkaria>
I guess that makes sense

[15:45:00.0000] <gavin_>
I don't see any downsides

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
personally i'm not a big fan of new conformance levels

[15:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
we've already got three

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
and generally i don't see the point

[15:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
Transitional showed that people don't hesitate to use the low-level ones

[15:48:00.0000] <takkaria>
what stuff is downplayed errors atm?  presentational guff?

[15:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
and XHTML has shown that other people try to be as strict as possible regardless of whether it's ok or not

[15:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
so it doesn't really have the desired effect

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#conformance-checkers-0

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria: ^

[15:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
mm

[15:52:01.0000] <takkaria>
I don't know what I'd do in this situation

[15:52:02.0000] <takkaria>
four levels of conformance seems a little silly

[15:53:00.0000] <gavin_>
the point is that peope don't like being told that they are non-conformant

[15:53:01.0000] <gavin_>
yet they might like being told that they're wrong

[15:53:02.0000] <gavin_>
and since the distinction doesn't really matter in practice, you might as well accomodate them

[15:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i might be more happy to making the others downplayed errors into this "warning" class than introducing a new class altogether

[15:54:01.0000] <takkaria>
I'm just worried about falling into the HTML4 Transitional trap

[15:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
but anyway, i'd like hsivonen's input on the topic

[15:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
since right now, he's the main one this affects

[15:54:04.0000] <takkaria>
Hixie: yeah, I was thinking that might be an idea

[15:55:00.0000] <takkaria>
probably make people happier about profile="" too

[15:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm really worried about doing another transitional

[15:55:02.0000] <takkaria>
(though I'm not sure that's necessarily a good thing. :))

[15:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
well that's the thing

[15:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
profile="" and summary="" are very similar in this respect. They make people think they're doing something useful while really they are only wasting their time, even though in theory it could have been useful

[15:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
s/it/they/

[16:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think making downplayed errors into warnings (that must be reported but don't break conformance) would be a good change and one that hsivonen could probably go along with

[16:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm worried about making teh HTML4 Transitional mistake.

[16:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, profile is worse than summary in that respect. The usefulness of summary is dependent upon the competence of the author writing it

[16:10:02.0000] <gavin_>
what were the consequences of "the HTML4 transitional mistake"?

[16:10:03.0000] <hober>
right, whereas the usefulness of profile is zero, regardless of the competence of the author using it. :)

[16:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yeah, arguably profile is worse, but then arguably summary is worse because when the author inevitably screws up, he hurts more users.

[16:10:05.0000] <gavin_>
/me doesn't really know the history

[16:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
gavin_: people never transitioned.

[16:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
whereas the usefulness of profile is dependent upon a majority of authors getting it right, not just the one who chooses to use it

[16:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
gavin_: basically, people went to the lowest common denominator

[16:11:03.0000] <gavin_>
how is that relevant to this case? you're afraid people won't transition to the better markup unless it's a conformance error?

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
gavin_: i guess we might avoid that if hsivonen makes these downplayed errors into warnings that are always present, and doesn't just say "yup you're valid"

[16:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
gavin_: yeah, more or less

[16:12:02.0000] <Lachy>
I know. summary isn't particularly conducive to people getting it right

[16:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: arguably summary="" is useless because too many people have gotten it wrong already. :-)

[16:12:04.0000] <gavin_>
seems like we're mostly debating semantics :)

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
worse than semantics

[16:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
psychology :-/

[16:13:02.0000] <gavin_>
maybe the validator can call them "conformant errors"

[16:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so you'd be ok with the proposal i described, if we just made the downplayed errors into frowned-upon-but-ok? i.e. changed from "not serious errors" to "discouraged non-errors"?

[16:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, that depends on the ability of ATs being able to reliably filter out useless values, which we've been told they do, but been given no details about how

[16:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yeah, that information would definitely help

[16:14:03.0000] <Lachy>
nor how reliable it is

[16:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
we really should do usability testing of this

[16:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's hard to do usability testing for AT users, though

[16:14:06.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe the validator should do like what the Yahoo and Google page speed tools do, giving each message a red/yellow/green severity and showing them in decreasing order of severity, so you can see which issues are the most worth fixing

[16:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
because you have to go to their setups, you can't just have them come in

[16:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
if they have laptops, then you could have them come in with them

[16:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think that would be a good improvement beyond even the summary="" issue

[16:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
from what i've seen of usability studies of AT users here at google, they don't. at least not the ones we found for our studies.

[16:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: and yes, I would be in favor of that proposal

[16:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: ok. i'll see what hsivonen thinks, and will see if i can find a way to phrase it that satisfies both the desire to keep these things as second-class citizens, and the desire to allow them to some extent.

[16:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
how is that different from the downplayed errors we already have in the spec?

[16:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
a document containing a downplayed error is nonconforming

[16:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
so maybe we should have conformance levels, conceptually like the WCAG accessibility levels?

[16:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like it's going to be horrendously confusing to someone who just wants to be told whether their page is okay or not

[16:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
but then, that's getting closer to the idea of Strict/Transitional conformance

[16:22:00.0000] <gavin_>
Philip`: "good", "ok, with some problems" and "bad" doesn't seem that confusing

[16:23:00.0000] <gavin_>
but even with those three buckets there are going to be arguments as to what goes where

[16:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, my idea sucks. Don't listen to me.

[16:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"strict", "transitional", "invalid"

[16:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think "good with no warnings", "good with warnings" and "bad, there are some errors" are sensible states

[16:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that is what programmers get from compilers and such

[16:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
that seems reasonable. Though it still sucks having to settle for compromises like this just to stop the arguments.

[16:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
my personal point of view is that it's the right thing to do, not just a compromise

[16:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
because sometimes, there are things that are often but not universally bad, and the right treatment is a mandatory but nonfatal diagnostic

[16:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
some people will only care about error-free and take the warnings on a case-by-case basis, some will want their pages warning-free too

[16:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
I disagree, but fair enough

[16:31:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's fair enough, I think the problem are the people who just see "Okay" and ignore the "but"

[16:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
The validator could let you specify -Werror and Wno-foo

[16:31:03.0000] <othermaciej>
yes, the validator should be able to toggle warning classes and also optionally treat warnings as fatal

[16:31:04.0000] <Philip`>
(for all values of foo)

[16:31:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I personally would want to use it in that mode, I think

[16:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, are you suggesting this be applied to all attributes that are currently considered downplayed errors, or just to summary?

[16:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: Hixie proposed converting the whole "downplayed error" class into something warning-like (i.e. does not break conformance)

[16:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think having "error" and "warning" instead of "error" and "downplayed error" as the two classes of diagnostics makes sense

[16:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i could reluctantly be convinced of that, i think

[16:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I haven't reviewed every current use of downplayed error, so I don't have an opinion on which should become nonfatal and which should be fatal

[16:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would probably merit case-by-case review, since for some it may make sense to just convert them back to errors

[16:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i was reading a scifi story recently where people could run simulations of their mental processes on a computer, and at one point one of the characters is in a debate

[16:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
and he just ran 15,000 simulations of how the argument might play out with his simulated mental processes in "vm"s

[16:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
in 95% of cases he was convinced. so he just decided to assume he'd be convinced, and skip the 15 minutes discussion that would otherwise ensue.

[16:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i find this a fascinating concept.)

[16:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I suppose that is meta-rational

[16:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(though sometimes it's important to know why you have been convinced)

[16:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me begins simulating tomorrow's public-html discussions

[16:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
Isn't that kind of missing the part of the debate that involves exchanging information with the other participant and becoming better informed?

[16:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
the simulation included a simulation of the other participant

[16:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hmm, did annevk ever put the client rect and caret from point stuff in the CSSOM Editor's Draft?

[16:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or is it somewhere else?

[16:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
A simulation based on the first person's mental representation of the second person? (in which case the first person still wouldn't be able to learn anything new)

[16:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't recall the specifics

[16:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
"authors should be aware that additional media resources might be necessary" - but they are allowed to be unaware if they have valid reasons to be, though presumably they will have to somehow wipe their minds after carefully weighing the full implications and deciding to become unaware of it

[16:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
is that in html5?

[16:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that he is aware he is making a trivial point and ignoring all the important issues presented in the email

[16:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: No, in sayrer's recent post to public-html

[16:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[16:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me supposes a more constructive way to phrase the feedback would be to say that the proposed text uses the word "should" with no intended normative meaning, which is inconsistent with how that word is used throughout the rest of HTML 5

[16:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
but that's a boring way to say it

thanks. I was looking for where the spec said that authors could only used the defined elements and attributes, but that list is good enough

[19:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, I really can't keep up with the absurd volume of e-mail on public-html and whatwg. I had 0 mails left in either of those lists earlier today (after ignoring a whole bunch), and it's now up to 46 unread (combined) in just 12 hours

[19:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
and that's already after having read quite a few of them in the mean time

[19:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll have to read them all in the morning. Hopefully there won't be another 50 by the time I wake up!

[19:37:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy - email doesn't scale. Eventually you'll give up on efail.

[19:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
tantek, what's the alternative?

[19:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
the big problem is that the codec and summary threads are largely repetitive.

[19:40:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy - the alternative is to put content on the wiki, and have email/IRC only for sharing updates/URLs

/me ponders the bibtex vocabulary

[20:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
omg I got +1d by John Foliot

[20:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
the main use case for the bibtex stuff was drag-and-drop of content from one page into another (e.g. a wikipedia entry) with the destination having a script that automatically took the biblio data from the first page and added it to the second page's references

[20:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems to me that, on the one hand, that use case doesn't sound terribly common, and on the other hand, it could be served via script and agreed convention in absence of native support

[20:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[20:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'm gonna strip the bibtex vocabulary out. it wasn't that popular in the first place.

[20:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I do think personal information and calendar events are of greater general interest

I was just writing a short post-mortem.

[21:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to me one of the weirdest events in the history of xhtml2 was Sam Ruby's "merger" proposal on his blog which seemed to capture no interest whatsoever in the HTML WG

[21:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
even though I believe there was much intense private discussion preceding it

[21:20:00.0000] <sayrer__>

hsivonen: we were discussing whether non-fatal warnings might be a better kind of less-sever diagnostic than down-played errors as they currently stand, and also the possibility of applying that to summary=""

[00:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
note: it might be legitimate to make lack of alt="" a nonfatal warning

[00:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
since the spec says you should include alt except in exceptional circumstances

[00:44:03.0000] <hsivonen>

[00:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[02:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
see also changes under DOCTYPEs here: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-initial-insertion-mode

[02:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: so it sounds more like they are going the other way with it

[02:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: So how will they cope with non-ARM Android devices?

[02:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: no idea! fat binaries?

[02:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like Web apps are the only thing that works across all these devices...

[02:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: How will they cope with arch_that_doesn't_exist_yet?

[02:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: you should probably ask someone who knows and understands the strategy

[02:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: the question is even more interesting for Google Native Client if it catches on

[02:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
iPhone's strategy is to lock down the hardware platform and severely limit number of available models so you know what your native apps are targeting

[02:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: But I don't know anyone who does, so asking in IRC is the best thing I can do :)

[02:10:04.0000] <T-->
Hixie, just out of curiosity, what's the rationale of choosing iframes over framesets?

[02:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: "na name"

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
T--: they're more flexible, and we can't really get rid of them (they're used everywhere)

[02:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: fixed

[02:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I would personally lean towards profile="" in the obsolete but conforming bucket, but say HTML processors MUST NOT vary their processing based on it

[02:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wording looks good to me though

[02:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think this is an improvement over "downplayed errors"

[02:14:00.0000] <T-->
/me doesn't understand the ?flexible?.

[02:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: where's the normative statement that validators must warn about those?

[02:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: last subsection of that h2-level section

[02:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
i can move it up if you like

[02:14:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: works for me as is

[02:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've moved it up

[02:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[02:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
So "obsolete" is the new "deprecated"

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me growls at bug 7089

[02:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: it always has been, hasn't it?

[02:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well I mean "obsolete"+warning

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
the big difference between Transitional and the warnings is that you don't ever see "Your document is conforming!" if you have warnings, you see "You document is conforming, but with warnings"

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
with transitional, once you had the transitional doctype, you never again saw anything clearly telling you that you weren't strict

[02:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
at least, i reckon that's a difference

[02:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
Given how popular compiler warnings are I can't imagine it will make a big difference

[02:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
true

[02:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh well, we'll see

[02:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
there's not much on the list

[02:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: are you saying compiler warnings are popular, or unpopular?

[02:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: I assume they are popular because compiling software tends to give me so many of them ;)

[02:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
heh

[02:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit builds with -Werror (or equivalent) and with many optional warnings on

[02:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(although in MSVC we have to turn some off, because they are stupid)

[02:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
(In seriousness, I know that many projects have a zero-warnings policy but it hardly seems to be normal and in web-developert terms probably translates onto the people who would care about the strict/transitional distinction)

[02:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for example, if you use a high enough warning level and don't silence this one specifically, MSVC will complain if you write if (intVariable) { something(); }

[02:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it wants you to say if (!!intVariable) { something(); }

[02:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
what's the difference?

[02:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in generated code and actual effect? nothing

[02:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but for the former, it complains about an implicit conversion to bool

[02:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
and !!a isn't an implicit conversion?!

[02:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
(if (intVariable != 0) seems nicer to read)

[02:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and warns you that it may be slow, or something

[02:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not giving this as an example of a good warning!

[02:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
The Intel C++ Compiler has "info" (I think) messages, as well as errors and warnings, which say things like "order of argument evaluation is undefined" that aren't serious enough to be warnings

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok bed time

[02:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
I always get tempted to waste time avoiding any messages the compiler might output, even if they're really pointless and I shouldn't care

[02:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
since I'm just incapable of ignoring them

[02:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
and it takes a lot of effort to convince myself to lower the verbosity setting

[02:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
for WebKit we basically choose to make compiler or analysis tool messages either fatal or silenced

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: that flavor of compiler warning would have helped me avoid one classic if (foo = bar) bug in the HTML5 parser

[02:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: gcc warns you if you write if (foo = bar)

[02:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: it tells you that if you really meant to do that, you should put parentheses around it

[02:42:03.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, in #conforming-but-obsolete-features section, you basically give the same list twice, but written in slightly different ways.

[02:42:04.0000] <othermaciej>
that's much better than the GCC warning

[02:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I see. The first is for authors. The latter is the UA conformance requirements

[02:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
Didn't make sense before I turned on the highlighting stylesheet

[02:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: what really happened here is that I made the change quickly late in a review cycle for landing, so I only checked it compiled--I didn't take a good look at warning/assert smoke

[02:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so I guess no warning would have saved me

[02:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
-Werror would have saved you

[02:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
because then it wouldn't have compiled

[02:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, with the "Hide UA text" stylesheet enabled, the link to "obsolete permitted DOCTYPEs" from the "Conforming but obsolete features" section no longer works because that's written in a .impl section

[03:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
re that discussion on www-font, it would suck to even allow EOT-lite, cause then we'll get stuck with DRM-encumbered fonts from major font vendors, even though the DRM is entirely ineffective and only serves as a hinderence to authors

[03:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/allow/require/

[03:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
just make ttf/otf mandatory. Authors can still provide EOT versions as a fallback font that will work in older versions of IE, at least until support for ttf/otf is widely deployed in more up to date versions of IE

[03:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
Are Microsoft still objecting to supporting TTF/OTF?

[03:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Web fonts, the other format war

[03:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Chris Wilson gave a really clear flat refusal

[03:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
It really makes me wonder where Microsoft's interests lie: In providing the best development platform for authors, or for giving in and promoting the absurd needs of the font-foundries?!

[03:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
I guess it's the same underlying philosiphy that Microsoft uses to push various forms of DRM on other types of media

[03:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
What is the argument against permitting fonts in a format that can't easily be reused outside the web? (separate from the arguments against not supporting TTF/OTF)

[03:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is interested since his font subsetting tools makes fonts that can't easily be reused outside the web (or outside the context where they were originally used), and wonders if that's considered a bad thing

[03:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me hasn't been following the discussion but thought the issue was more to do with tying fonts to specific domains making testing a pain

[03:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/testing/deployment/

[03:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
EOT places restrictions on what domains a font can be used on and expects browsers to enforce those restrictions.

[03:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
(I could be remembering that wrongly, but I know the font foundries have been pushing for a feature like that in one form or another)

[03:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you could e.g. tweak a TTF/OTF so that it works fine in web browsers but is kind of broken if used in many other applications, e.g. by setting the embedding bits or setting the font name to "", would that be considered harmful to the world?

[03:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, because it imposes what could be considered to be a Technological Protection Measure on the font, and could be subject to anti-circumvention clauses of laws like the DMCA.

[03:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
It would be the font equivalent of the failed broadcast flag proposal

[03:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
also, that's one of the proposals that was discussed on www-style a long time ago

[03:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
and I recall someone from the Linux community saying that support for the flag would have to be integrated into the systems font handling, and thus wouldn't protect against other uses on the system anyway

[06:12:00.0000] <takkaria>
I don't think the new warning model will be like Transitional, on reflection, because you can't turn the warnings off by putting a toggle in your source file

[06:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: You feeling better?

[06:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me was about to ask that

[06:13:02.0000] <takkaria>
well, I'm standing up and lighgt doesn't hurt now. :)

[06:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sticks tongue out at jgraham

[06:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
still a bit of a headace but that's bearable

[06:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Nice weather we have here

[06:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, absolutely lovely.

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the WHATWG WordPress isn't up-to-date

[06:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: Akismet is out of date, too

[06:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yeah, I noticed that yesterday

[06:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I could update it now

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. did I just blog with a grammar error in the title?

[06:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
upgarded now

[06:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
should it be "Help test" instead?

[06:48:03.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[06:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
or "Help With Testing..."

[06:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
but Help Test seems better

[06:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: thanks

[06:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fixed.

[06:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
plugins upgraded now too

[06:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
thanks

[06:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
I should also check that our wiki installation is up to date as well later

[06:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's been quite a while since the last "this week"

[06:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
but that takes a little more effort, since I don't have a script for it

[07:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how should this quote be read? http://twitter.com/markbirbeck/status/2388701600

[07:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
I have no idea what it means for something to "be highest impact"

[07:11:00.0000] <karlcow>
trying to look for more background in http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23swdag2009

[07:11:01.0000] <takkaria>
RDFa is falling as part of a meteor shower of general web technology, and out of all of the meteorites that will hit the earth, RDFa will be highest impact

[07:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Meaning it will hit a mountain?

[07:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I'm curious what the practical difference will be as far as implementing downplayed errors vs. the new conforming but obsolete warnings.

[07:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I could read it as "be [the one with the] highest [degree of] impact"

[07:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
I thought downplayed errors meant that warnings should be issues, rather than full errors

[07:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
so it's not clear to me that these spec changes are anything more than superficial

[07:15:00.0000] <karlcow>
the ajax search  call in twitter is killing my firefox

[07:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: warnings don't need new UI code, so they are easier

[07:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, sure, but how is issuing warnigns for the current spec different from issuing warnings for downplayed errors? Or would something else have been done for that?

[07:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: downplayed errors would have counted towards making the result turn into invalid

[07:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: and the vision for downplayed errors was that they'd sort and collapse differently

[07:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, that sounds like little more than UI design decisions that aren't really affected by what the spec actually said.

[07:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the non-UI effect is that the presence of one or more downplayed errors made the document invalid but the presence of normative warnings doesn't

[07:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
so it's a very fine line between "non-conforming, but ignorable errors" and "conforming, but with warnings"

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
"non-conforming, but ignorable errors" wouldn't give you a badge

[07:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Maybe the other won't either, which makes them harder to distinguish)

[08:01:00.0000] <sayrer__>
Lachy: sometimes validator authors are nervous about stepping outside of what the spec tells

[08:01:01.0000] <sayrer__>
tells them is "invalid"

[08:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
it seems really strange that with so many browsers over the years, the idea of creating a browser OS keeps coming up. It happened with Netscape. It happened with Firefox, and now it's happening with Chrome. I suspect the only reason it didn't really happen with IE is that it was already so closely linked to Windows anyway, it wouldn't make much difference

[08:24:01.0000] <Lachy>

[08:28:00.0000] <karlcow>
[10:04]  <sayrer__> Lachy: sometimes validator authors are nervous about stepping outside of what the spec tells

[08:28:01.0000] <karlcow>
indeed. And what ever option you are choosing you get shot for your choices.

[08:29:00.0000] <karlcow>
been there, seen that (aka w3c markup validator communitie*S*)

[08:29:01.0000] <sayrer__>
I think the author conformance requirements would be better in a document titled "How to write high quality HTML"

[08:30:00.0000] <sayrer__>
then the validator could say "Don't you want to write high quality HTML?"

[08:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Why do you hate freedom?"

[08:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
"The Android browser has very little in common with Chrome on the desktop (for example, the Android browser uses Apple's SquirrelFish JavaScript engine instead of Chrome's V8)." - apart from having, like, all of WebKit in common?

[08:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
I guess WebKit is just a very minor and insificant part of the browser, compared with the JavaScript engine

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
</sarcasm>

[08:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: where do that quote come from?

[08:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
sayrer__, how to write high quality HTML should be explained in HTML5 guides and references. Normative conformance criteria belong in the spec

[08:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: The Ars article to which Lachy linked

[08:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[08:35:02.0000] <sayrer__>
Lachy: sure

[08:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: I suspect sayrer__'s point is that they shouldn't be normative conformance criteria

[08:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
but then that wouldn't be very useful

[08:37:00.0000] <sayrer__>
useful for producing interoperable markup?

[08:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
sayrer__, while we could very easily get interoperability between implementations without any authoring conformance criteria, normative conformance criteria are essential to ensure conformance checkers are interoperable and to help authors write markup properly

[08:39:00.0000] <sayrer__>
you mean lint tools must produce the same result for all input?

[08:39:01.0000] <karlcow>
interesting that the dicussion around canonical html is coming back :)

[08:39:02.0000] <sayrer__>
"properly" is not an objective quality

[08:40:00.0000] <sayrer__>
and I'll note that conformance checker interoperability is not something the WG is chartered to take on

[08:40:01.0000] <sayrer__>
but it seems tangential to me, since conformance checkers are supposed to be the means, not the end

[08:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
no, I mean conformance checkers and validators. Lints offen flag stuff that isn't necessarily non-conforming, but which you might like to consider fixing anyway

[08:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
s/offen/often/

[08:41:01.0000] <sayrer__>
why do you need checker/validator rather than a lint tool?

[08:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
it depends on your individual needs and the capabilities of the lint tool in use

[08:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. you might have a lint which checks that an HTML document fits the criteria necessary for being a syntactically correct polyglot document, but which doesn't check any other conformance criteria.

[08:43:01.0000] <sayrer__>
I guess I don't understand whats motivating your position. do you feel validators force people to write good markup in some way?

[08:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, validators are very useful QA tools to help ensure the quality of the markup and catch mistakes. Conformance criteria help to ensure that different people are using a comment set of criteria, whcih makes it easier for developers to work together

[08:45:01.0000] <sayrer__>
common set of criteria?

[08:46:00.0000] <sayrer__>
lint tools are "are very useful QA tools to help ensure the quality of the markup and catch mistakes."

[08:46:01.0000] <sayrer__>
agree or disagree?

[08:46:02.0000] <sayrer__>
my feeling is that if you want validators to interoperate, you would make rules for validators

[08:46:03.0000] <Lachy>
partially agree. I've had experience with some lint tools that report useless information that I didn't need. But, they can be depending on your needs

[08:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
and also experience with lints that fail to report info that I do need

[08:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
sayrer__, the authoring conformance criteria in the spec do apply to validators. It says that explicitly in the conformance section

[08:49:00.0000] <sayrer__>
yes, I don't think that makes much sense.

[08:49:01.0000] <sayrer__>
validators aren't authors

[08:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
validators check markup on behalf of authors

[08:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
and if there weren't a common set of conformance criteria defined, then validators would vary significantly in what they report, and they wouldn't be particularly useful

[08:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
with a common set of criteria, developers can, in theory, use their favourite validation tools (perhaps based on the UI they like most) and be reasonably sure that they'll get equivalent results.

[08:52:00.0000] <sayrer__>
I am not sure how that became a goal, and it still seems tangential, since conforming HTML5 UAs will produce equivalent results no matter what

[08:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
I honestly do not understand your POV.

[08:52:02.0000] <sayrer__>
well, let's say one validator flags <font> and one doesn't

[08:53:00.0000] <sayrer__>
and the author happens to be using the validator that doesn't

[08:53:01.0000] <sayrer__>
so a <font> element has slipped through undetected

[08:53:02.0000] <sayrer__>
what is the interoperability consequence?

[08:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
that seems like a problem that only applies to your authoring-conformance-free spec

[08:54:01.0000] <sayrer__>
well, you are saying validators won't be useful without the requirements we have now

[08:54:02.0000] <sayrer__>
in a world without them, I expect some problems will occur if you are right

[08:55:00.0000] <sayrer__>
what is the problem that has occured here?

[08:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
from a browser POV, there isn't an interoperability issue. The issue is that different tools give authors different results. This reduces their ability to rely on tools to give useful results and could cause different people to argue about what's right and what's wrong, based on nothing more than the implementation decision of their favourite QA tools

[08:59:00.0000] <sayrer__>
so all validators must produce identical results?

[08:59:01.0000] <sayrer__>
and is it so bad if people argue about what's right and wrong?

[09:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
ideally, yes, as far as issuing errors is concerned. They can issue additional useful warnings based on the user's need

[09:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
or, actually, the user's desires

[09:00:02.0000] <sayrer__>
is that requirement in the spec?

[09:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
there's nothing in the spec to say that they can't issue additional warnings

[09:01:01.0000] <sayrer__>
is there a requirement that they must not issue additional errors?

[09:01:02.0000] <sayrer__>
otherwise, different tools could give different results

[09:01:03.0000] <Lachy>
no, tools are only allowed to issue errors defined in the spec

[09:02:00.0000] <sayrer__>
oh, I missed that. where is it?

[09:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
if it issues an error, or even treates something as a fatal error, where the spec doesn't say it can, then it has violated the actual criteria specified which doesn't say to issue an error

[09:07:00.0000] <sayrer__>
so then it couldn't issue an error for elements developed later

[09:07:01.0000] <sayrer__>
or elements in other namespaces

[09:07:02.0000] <sayrer__>
afaik, there are no fatal errors in HTML5

[09:08:00.0000] <sayrer__>
so far, I don't think there's anything in the spec that will enforce the level of interoperability you claim

[09:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
a spec that defines new elements would also update the relevant conformance criteria

[09:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
elements in other namespaces have their own criteria applying to them defined in their respective specs

[09:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
the parsing requirements allow implementations to treat errors as fatal instead of applying the corrective steps specified.

[09:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
"The error handling for parse errors is well-defined: user agents must either act as described below when encountering such problems, or must abort processing at the first error that they encounter for which they do not wish to apply the rules described below."

[09:13:00.0000] <sayrer__>
oh, that's very damaging to interoperability

[09:13:01.0000] <sayrer__>
but I thought that hedge existed for validators

[09:13:02.0000] <sayrer__>
it seems to have changed

[09:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
it depends on the needs of the specific implementation. Browsers, for example, couldn't really get away with aborting on errors in practice. But there are lots of other tools for which graceful error recovery is not essential

[09:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
A validator is one such use case for that

[09:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
Some (non-validator) tools really want streamability, and aborting on certain parse errors lets them do that

[09:15:02.0000] <sayrer__>
Lachy: not sure it is useful to claim they are conformant to the same spec

[09:15:03.0000] <sayrer__>
Philip`: yeah, a spider for instance

[09:15:04.0000] <Philip`>
(and they can streamably handle all conforming documents)

[09:16:00.0000] <sayrer__>
that last part is not true, since they can streamably all non-scripted conforming documents

[09:16:01.0000] <sayrer__>
streamably handle

[09:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
from memory, the adoption agency algorithm is one that affects streamability

[09:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
sayrer__: I'd expect most spiders would want to accept arbitrary input, and so they'd have to non-fatally handle invalid documents

[09:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
(hsivonen knows more about that, though)

[09:17:02.0000] <sayrer__>
Philip`: that's good point

[09:18:00.0000] <sayrer__>
I'll make a note about this

[09:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
sayrer__: I'm thinking of e.g. a tool that applies some kind of transformation to an HTML document, and doesn't want to buffer the whole document in memory

[09:18:02.0000] <Lachy>
sayrer__, tools that wish to incorporate an HTML5 parser into existing XML tool chains, and which require streamability, are likely to opt to abort on some errors

[09:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. a CMS that allows the author to write HTML, but which uses XML for everything else on the back end

[09:19:01.0000] <sayrer__>
they will probably opt out of more than just that

[09:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wrote a web service that converts HTML to XHTML streamingly, but (if he remembers correctly) it also aborted on cannot-serialise-to-XML errors

[10:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/video-more-than-just-a-tag/ - "<video id="myVideo" src="myFile.ogv"/>" - isn't that syntax going to break badly?

[11:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
we really should do more to promote better quality fallback, beyond the useless "You're browser doesn't support this"

[11:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
even a simple <a href="video.ogg">Download and watch</a> would be better

[11:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I could imagine a script that generates fallback for video elements based on <source> and @src

[11:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: is your code for generating inputs that visit various tokenizer states publicly available?

[12:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I think the latest version of the code is http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/svn/tokeniser/ (particularly http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/svn/tokeniser/test_gen.ml)

[12:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
though it's very out-of-date, and also very ugly

[12:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
and quite possibly quite buggy

[13:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: there are lots of broken links from the author-only section

[13:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[13:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
that really makes it useless in many cases

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
well like all the DOM stuff's <dfn>s are in the impl section

[13:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
so all the domintro green boxes point into the impl section

[13:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what to do about it

[13:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The sumamry attribute description looks OK to me but I suggest not referncing <caption> explicitly as a replacement, just the whole techniques section

[13:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think <a @name> could have a similar description

[13:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
like "This attribute was used in older versions of HTML to allow fragment identifiers o be associated with particular places in the document"

[13:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
how about saying it was similar to what ID does now

[13:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
checked in

[13:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: perfect, thanks

[13:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: btw, i think there's a difference between a whole spec, and a requirement in a spec

[13:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: and in particular on the theora issue, the requirement in question is just importing another spec entirely, which i think is a particularly special case.

[13:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I agree that the theora thing is a somewhat different case

[13:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
But I think e.g. svg-in-HTML is quite a similar case

[13:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
in the sense that it is more useful to have a spec with support from 3/4 major vendors if one announces that they will not support it

[13:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
than to not have any spec at all

[14:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: if they're going to implement regardless, then yes

[15:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: I think your proposed @summary text may be unnecessarily long and so unlikely to be read (the current text on alt has this problem)

[15:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
However I'm not sure

[15:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: it would be at the end of the already long section on how to provide table explanations

[15:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it is not overly long compared to the rest of that section

[15:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but

[15:15:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not wedded to my exact wording, it was just an example of how to provide the right information

ezyang: you testing surrogate handling?

[00:31:00.0000] <ezyang>
Uhh, sort of 

[00:31:01.0000] <ezyang>
So Hixie landed a change to the spec which implies that crazy stuff like that should get passed through without harm 

[00:31:02.0000] <ezyang>
But that doesn't have any legal surrogates... 

[00:34:00.0000] <ezyang>
I think I should send him mail about this 

[00:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ezyang: aside from lone surrogates, the weirdo characters that can now be used as numeric references were already available if you used them as UTF-8 in the raw stream

[00:39:00.0000] <ezyang>
UTF-8 doesn't even have a mechanism for building something that long... 

[00:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ezyang: what were you about to complain to me about?

[00:40:00.0000] <ezyang>
It was my fault; after double checking with the spec all of your changes were correct. 

[00:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ezyang: UTF-8 can build code points until 0x10FFFF just fine

[00:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[00:40:03.0000] <ezyang>
On an unrelated note, have you looked at r3374?

ezyang: the changes to the Windows-1252 table are questionable, but I'm not sure if they are what existing browsers do

[00:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"If the number is in the range 0x0001 to 0x0008" ... "error" is good

[00:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so, the C1 range stuff I'd have to double-check, but the rest is good

[00:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[00:58:00.0000] <ezyang>
hsivonen: The interesting bit is how error handling changed 

[00:59:00.0000] <ezyang>
Instead of replacing it with U+FFFD, we pass it through. 

[00:59:01.0000] <ezyang>
This results in hilarity with large numeric entities 

[00:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ezyang: larger than 0x10FFFF?

[00:59:03.0000] <ezyang>
yep 

[00:59:04.0000] <Philip`>
ezyang: I think numericEntities.test and unicodeChars.test were generated by me with a Perl script that I might have not uploaded anywhere

[01:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. those should still becode U+FFFD

[01:00:01.0000] <ezyang>
Yep 

[01:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
if the spec now says otherwise, it's a bug

[01:00:03.0000] <ezyang>
I wrote a script to convert them, so don't worry about it 

[01:00:04.0000] <ezyang>
Well, Hixie very deliberately changed it to match browser behavior 

[01:00:05.0000] <hsivonen>
ezyang: what's browser behavior for > 0x10FFFF?

[01:00:06.0000] <ezyang>
Firefox simply ignores the character 

[01:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that's not good

[01:01:01.0000] <ezyang>
Don't have access to other browsers at the moment

oops, i thought i'd already made > 10FFFF get not parsed as a charref

I thought Firefox wrapped values larger than 2^32

[01:01:04.0000] <ezyang>
I could have missed that cluedump 

[01:01:05.0000] <Hixie>
webkit treats &#x110000; as &amp;#x110000;

how do I get the DOMString out of a text node in IE?

[01:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's been a long time since I've written IE workaround JS

.data

[01:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
thanks

[01:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
no, that's not it

[01:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nodeValue is supposed to be a prop on the object...

[01:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. does IE go crazy if a node value contains a bad character?

[01:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nope. that's not the reason

[01:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
something is going badly wrong in my testing in IE

[01:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I feel clueless

[01:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, whatever IE does, it's not mapping the unmapped characters of Windows-1252 C1 range to U+FFFD

[01:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
.data definitely gets you the text out of Text node in IE last i checked

[01:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Opinions on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503210 for Web DOM Core?

[01:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
re bug, no opinion. what's the use case?

[01:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm failing to get even innerHTML out of an element or .length out of a text node in Live DOM Viewer in IE

[01:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
have you tried with just regular text?

[01:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe their serialiser is barfing

[01:12:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: serializing any DOM as a JS script that recreates the DOM

[01:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I tried with 'a'

[01:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: same result, which is weird

[01:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's the use case for serializing any DOM as a JS script that recreates the DOM?

[01:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
odd

[01:13:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: fuzzing

[01:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
so testing? not a platform feature?

[01:13:06.0000] <Hixie>
does the innerHTML part of the live dom viewer itself work?

[01:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yes

[01:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
then i dunno what's going on

[01:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: did you implement the spec or webkit behaviour for table taint in the html5.parser?

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: WebKit behavior

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
anything to report?

[01:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nothing regarading Web compat regarding taint to report

[01:25:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: which version of IE?

[01:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the only problems have been with Gecko-only test suites

[01:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the only taint problems that is

[01:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: IE8 on Windows XP SP3

[01:26:03.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: AFAICT IE8 is broken in the live dom viewer

[01:26:04.0000] <jgraham>
At least for me on windows 7

[01:26:05.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: well, it's broken in a really subtle way

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
because I can w() the text node object

[01:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: 

[01:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
er

[01:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: k

[01:27:04.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: oh. Well the whole w() function is broken for me

[01:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll make <table><b>do</b> <b>do</b> do <b>do</b> <b>do</b></table> parse as "dodo do dodo" instead of "do do do do do" tomorrow then

Hixie: nice

not really, but it's hard to argue with your points :-)

the list of things in html5 i disagree with is growing quite long

[02:02:00.0000] <Mrmil>
Hi, imagine a category tree structure and you are to select a category for your article, how would you do that? <select> with nested <optgroup>s seems to be an interesting idea but you cannot select XYZ category marked up with label="XYZ category" because it is, well, a label. I looked into the archives, saw some mails about it, but the spec is silent about this...

[02:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Mrmil: <select>/<option> with indentation of the option text to indicate nesting?

[02:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
(That doesn't seem very nice but I guess it sort of works)

[02:31:00.0000] <Mrmil>
Philip`: Yeah, we're currently using that, but I don't think it's too accessible. If the optgroup mechanism was capable of doing it, it would be awesome

[02:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if something like <details><legend><input type=radio>Category</legend><details><legend><input type=radio>Sub-category</legend><input type=radio>Sub-sub-category</details></details> would be appropriate semantics

[03:31:00.0000] <takkaria>
Shane seems to think that walled garden

[03:31:01.0000] <takkaria>
+s are worth supporting explicitly

[03:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
and presumably worth supporting as first-class citizens of the language, rather than using <div class> and data-* attributes or similar extensibility mechanisms

[03:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure I take people seriously who come out with statements like "[HTML 5 is a] bloated monstrosity that already kills the battery on your phone" 

[03:37:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm not sure I take people seriously who answer "why modularise a spec?" with "because modularisation itself is the benefit"

[03:38:00.0000] <takkaria>
though I guess the answer was also "because of the mindset behind it", but that seems to be to be someone who aims for theoretical purity and would probably be unsuited to actually editing HTML5 in a way that wasn't theoretically pure

/me notes it was jax from Opera who brought up phone batteries

[03:43:01.0000] <takkaria>
you could split HTML5 up into multiple modules and not have any more extension points than you have now, though

takkaria: Indeed, which is why the important thing is the mindset behind M12N (of providing well-defined extensibility points that are on an equal footing to the HTML markup itself) and not the mechanism of splitting the spec into modules

[03:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: jax is Jonny Axelsson

[03:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Opera employee

[03:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
or former one now, maybe

[03:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: I figured that out after finding his blog :-)

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
former?

[03:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me hasn't read the blog yet

[03:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I'm not sure if he still works for Opera

[03:49:03.0000] <hsivonen>

[03:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>

[03:57:04.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, I'm just wondering if you've had a chance to work on the selectors api test suite yet.

[03:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, what does -o-link-source do?

[04:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me guesses it sets rel or something

[04:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I can report that, of the bits of HTML5 we have implemented so far, none seem to be particularly bad for phone battery

[04:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It makes the element into a link, using the -o-link of the current or next element (or something like that)

[04:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(In that example, both lines use the href from the second line)

[04:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[04:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, maybe 'next' chooses the next element (in tree order) that has -o-link

[04:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
so you could e.g. say <td style=-o-link-source:next><img src><a href=... style=-o-link:attr(href)>...</a></td> or whatever

[04:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
(to make the whole cell into a link)

[04:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks he ought to set up some wiki for himself

[04:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But I already treat my blog like a wiki in a lot of ways

[04:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Do you have edit wars with yourself?

[04:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Rarely, just constantly building upon what I wrote earlier

[04:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Do you mindlessly vandalise your pages?

[04:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not sounding much like a wiki at all

[04:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Have you /read/ gsnedders poetry?

[04:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: No :-p

[04:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: in parts I agree with the mindless. I'm not sure whether it's really vandalism though.

[04:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
I like to think of it as mindless vandalism of the mind

[04:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, but my mind was already mindlessly vandalised before writing them.

[05:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
grr. why have my GWT Eclipse launch configs become unlauchable...

[05:44:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: hey, I haven't had a chance yet - I've needed to finish up some other things before moving on to that

[05:44:01.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: it's on my list, hoping to tackle it very soon

[05:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[05:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone happen to know how to make Eclipse re-acknowledge the ".launch" file name extension?

[05:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Safari with <!-- a --   !> is interesting

[05:55:00.0000] <pesla>
hsivonen, i *think* you can just assign file associations in General -> Editors -> File Associations

[05:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
heh. IE8 has the same comment buffer trimming strategy I implemented as opposed to what Hixie specced, except they haven't been careful enough with edge cases to hide the impl. details

[05:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Upon >, they trim the accumulated buffer by two from the end

[05:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
pesla: can't find a way to associate it with launching as opposed to an editor :-(

[07:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[07:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, my build seems to be way more out of date than I thought

[07:03:02.0000] <jgraham>
(2009-07-03)

[07:03:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
this is with very latest minefield -- today or yesterday

[07:03:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
and same thing with html5.enabled false

[07:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, doesn't Minefield do automatic updates for you every day?

[07:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: I see the problem - the text is yucky and un-antialiased :-(

[07:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: you can turn that auto-update thing off

[07:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: good eye!

[07:14:03.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, ok. Why would you, though?

[07:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: because it's stupid?

[07:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
is that a question or a statement?

[07:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: It offers to upgrade every day but I often ignore it

[07:15:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: are you asking or making a suggestion?

[07:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Are we playing questions?

[07:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
Mine automatically downloads the updates and installs them whenever I restart.

[07:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tries to write Ruby

[07:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Which kind of Ruby?

[07:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, that's a very short word to write, but well done. You succeeded.

[07:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Didn't Lachy just lose?

[07:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ph

[07:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: The shiny one

[07:18:03.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, we were playing a game?

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Animal, vegetable, or mineral?

[07:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, Animal

[07:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: The shiny one.

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
So gsnedders is writing a Ruby that is a shiny animal?

[07:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes.

[07:21:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(And I'm saying that just because Hixie can't, because he says he never lies)

[07:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Couldn't that be a lie?

[07:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hah! No wonder he's doing so well at controlling the future of the intarwebs!

[07:39:00.0000] <eighty4>
is <b> and <i> actually going to be left in html5?

[07:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
Why wouldn't they be?

[07:46:00.0000] <eighty4>
seems they is all ready represented by <strong> for example. And it doesn't seem to be a good example for when to use them. Or why would the specs say this: "In the previous example, the correct element to use would have been strong, not b."?

[07:47:00.0000] <eighty4>
uhm... nevermind that quote :)

[08:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
eighty4, http://lachy.id.au/log/2007/05/b-and-i

[08:01:00.0000] <eighty4>
Lachy: thanks :D

[08:06:00.0000] <eighty4>
Lachy: but given there definition how is the names of them motivated? <aside>, <article> and so on describes their intended use. How does <b> describe it's use? Or isn't that important?

[08:08:00.0000] <beowulf>
eighty4: how does b not describe it's intended use?

[08:08:01.0000] <eighty4>
Sorry if I'm bringing up already discussed stuff. Haven't read up on my html5 :/

[08:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
So I have a problem. I have a test harness which loads testcases into an iframe. It is not impossible that those testcases will cause infinite loops or other bad behaviour so it would be nice to be able to set a timeout and kill the script if the timeout is reached

[08:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Howwever this doesn't seem to be easy; the event loop seems to prioritise running the existing script above anything else. 

[08:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
(run to completion I guess)

[08:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
eighty4, b is intended for use cases which are commenly represented typographically in bold text, but for which no specific semantic element exists

[08:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
eighty4, it would be unreasonable to have to create separate semantic elements to individually cover each of those cases, when it wouldn't gain any benefit over using the generic element

[08:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
Is there some way I force the source of the iframe to change before the testcase script has finished running?

[08:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
similarly for the i element

[08:15:03.0000] <eighty4>
beowulf: from what I understand it's not intended to represent bold text but rather like Lachy just wrote "text usually written in bold"

[08:15:04.0000] <jgraham>
(or close the window with the iframe in or delete the iframe or something, as long as it causes the script to die)

[08:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
eighty4, the names are retained for backwards compatibility reasons. It's best not to read too much into just the name of the element. It's the definition that matters mose

[08:17:00.0000] <eighty4>
Lachy: that explanation was good :) Not sure I'm agreeing with you but still.

[08:17:01.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: I'm guessing that setTimeout() isn't being your friend

[08:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I don't know of any way to achieve that, unless perhaps setting the iframe's window.location to a new page interrupts any scripts running within the iframe

[08:17:03.0000] <eighty4>
Lachy: I got that backward compatiblility reason :) Just not a big fan of that either.

[08:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
eighty4, it's really just a matter of being pragmatic over theoretical purity

[08:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: setting the <iframe>.src doesn't 

[08:18:02.0000] <eighty4>
Lachy: have nothing to do today and haven't been reading much about html5 so I'm catching up.

[08:18:03.0000] <eighty4>
I'm not intending to start an argument

[08:18:04.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, what about iframe.contentWindow.location?

[08:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: OK I will try it

[08:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
eighty4, no worries. You've been much more pleasant and understanding than the person I debated this with over twitter 2 days ago

[08:20:00.0000] <eighty4>
Lachy: I'm not really bothered with html5 having it, but I can imagine it being missused.

[08:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
indeed. It will be.

[08:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm not sure it makes any difference if it's "misused"

[08:21:01.0000] <takkaria>
the idea that <strong> is more accessible than <b> in any way is a red herring

[08:22:00.0000] <eighty4>
takkaria: but <b> will still give bold text I assume?

[08:22:01.0000] <takkaria>
well, yeah

[08:22:02.0000] <takkaria>
just like <strong> does

[08:22:03.0000] <eighty4>
true

[08:22:04.0000] <takkaria>
they are equivalent on the vast mojority of pages

[08:22:05.0000] <takkaria>
except those select few which change default styling for either

[08:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me mutters about how badly designed the 'this' semantics are in javascript

[08:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm, deleting the iframe seems to work well

[08:24:01.0000] <eighty4>
takkaria: but still, <strong> have semantic meaning while <b> doesn't. From what I understand

[08:24:02.0000] <takkaria>
they both have meaning

[08:25:00.0000] <eighty4>
* just not as clear semantic meaning then :)

[08:25:01.0000] <takkaria>
I'm not sure <strong> has a particularly clear meaning either

[08:25:02.0000] <eighty4>
it have a better meaning for me at least. But that doesn't really say anything

[08:26:00.0000] <takkaria>
they're basically synonyms, discussing which one is "better" seems to be a waste of everyone's time

[08:26:01.0000] <takkaria>
I seem to have acquired a stronger view on this than I used to have. :)

[08:27:00.0000] <beowulf>
i've developed the strong view that it just doesn't matter

[08:27:01.0000] <eighty4>
takkaria: I'm doing my best on wasting my time on meanless stuff right now. Third day on my "time off"

[08:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
I really wish people had never used the word "semantic" in conjunction with the web, "meaning" is much less opaque and you couldn't get consturctions like "semantic meaning"

[08:32:00.0000] <eighty4>
But I'll stop bothering you now

[08:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
eighty4, without <i>, which element would you use to mark up a ship name, which is conventionally rendered in italics?

[08:35:00.0000] <eighty4>
Lachy: <title>, <name> or something similar. But yes. It would be a challange to figure out what that element should be named

[08:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
so you're advocating creating a new element for each case like that?

[08:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
even though there are potentially dozens of such cases?

[08:35:03.0000] <eighty4>
no, not really. Haven thought about it that much

[08:36:00.0000] <eighty4>
It just feels like there should be a better name for <i> then i

[08:36:01.0000] <eighty4>
but I guess there isn't

[08:36:02.0000] <takkaria>
a better name for representating traditioanlly italicised text than "italic"? :)

[08:37:00.0000] <eighty4>
it seems there should ba a name for the italic "meaning"

[08:37:01.0000] <eighty4>
*should be

[08:38:00.0000] <eighty4>
/me doesn't like his new espresso.

[12:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
I really wish people would stop referring to HTML5 as "the spec to build a browser"

[12:43:00.0000] <sicking>
takkaria, indeed, it's not just for browsers

[12:43:01.0000] <sicking>
and you need a lot more to build a browser, like http and css

[12:43:02.0000] <takkaria>
given that I refer to it fairly often when writing JS, I think it's a wholly inaccurate title given only to rile people

Hixie: what fun would that be?

[16:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm very surprised by Joshue's outright rejection of my rather practical proposal for making that particular use of canvas accessible.


2009-07-10
[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh Lachy's post reminds me that i need to follow up with the canvas issue

[17:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what did you think of my suggestions for making that canvas example accessible? Were they reasonable given the contstraints, or is Joshue right about it being ridiculous?

[17:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why you would use canvas for that use case at all

[17:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
(...and it already has an accessible version anyway)

[17:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
though that one seems to be missing the descriptions

[17:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Animated image maps sound ridiculuous to me

[17:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, changing table taint is gonna be such a pain

[17:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you're going to all the trouble of maintaining a kind of scene graph DOM, you might as well just use SVG and then you won't have all the weirdness and restrictiveness of image map shapes

[17:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
that won't get you accessibility though

[17:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
(though for some reason, svg gets a free pass)

[17:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/ridiculuous/ridiculous/

[17:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I know that specific page probably shouldn't use canvas, but there are lots of other interactive uses of canvas

[17:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I don't see why animated image maps would be ridiculous. If you wanted to support keyboard navigation while still providing the same visual layout, how would you do it without throwing out the canvas entirely?

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can't do it properly right now without using either svg or crazy image map stuff

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know how to make it possible though

[17:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
The image map keyboard navigation order will be completely unrelated to the spatial positions of the areas, so it's not a good way to provide keyboard navigation of the graphical display

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
keyboard navigation is the one aspect of making canvas accessible that i might be able to figure out

[17:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
if you know the positions of the areas on the screen, it's conceivable that you could calculate a reasonable tab order and either set tabindex or do the complicated thing of reording the area elements in the DOM

[17:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
Anything that gives a linear keyboard navigation order will be operating over a separate view of the data from the non-linear graphical view, so it seems unhelpfully complex to try to mix both the views together instead of just providing two independent views

[17:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. by providing a hook for the canvas to say how it is willing to handle focus movement while the canvas is focused

[17:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
(where one view might be <canvas> and the other view might be a <table> or <ul> or something)

[17:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, providing 2 separate views doesn't solve the problem that Steve raised, which is that the original should be accessible, instead of having to maintain two completely different views

[17:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
although, in this case, as I mentioned in my email, the table view is probably useful for more than just accessibility reasons

[17:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
what if we took the concept of the image map and provided an API to declare a specific region of the canvas as being an active region which can respond to events?

[17:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
and which can recieve focus

[17:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
canvas.clearEventHandlers(); ctx.addEventHandlerOnClickInsideCurrentPath(function (evt) { ... })

[17:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
Then a backwards compatibility layer could possibly be provided by script libraries that generate equivalent image maps in the DOM

[17:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I was thinking something like: region = context.createActiveRegion(...); region.addEventListener(...);

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
that might be even better than doing it manually

[17:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'll be fun the first time someone creates a hundred active regions per frame, and forgets to delete them all before starting the next frame

[17:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah that's the main reason i prefer the manual approach

[17:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, hopefully the wai will advise us as to the best approach

[17:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it might be better to just move the regions around, rather than delete and create new

[17:49:01.0000] <aboodman>
does anyone know of a demo anywhere of app cache that works in firefox 3.5?

[17:49:02.0000] <aboodman>
the web fails me

[17:51:00.0000] <aboodman>
uh, n/m, found something

[17:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
do we have a list of known uses canvas, like Yahoo Pipes, Bespin, and this Web Tools directory, from which we can analyse the use cases?

[17:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
Would be useful to have things like that listed in a wiki

[17:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use cases for a declarative canvas interaction API, I guess?

[17:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
good, looks like we do have some http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/AddedElementCanvas#head-c43887ef27c016a20e53d16718ab16a398b6899d

[17:53:01.0000] <roc>
what is the difference between "declarative canvas interaction API" and "SVG"?

[17:53:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, yeah. Any non-interactive canvas probably wouldn't need much beyond traditional fallback content, just like a regular image

[17:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Canvas is cooler than SVG

[17:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
It would be sensible to see how many of the use cases could be better handled with SVG, but I guess if the original developers chose canvas (despite it requiring lots of manual code to process input) then they must have had reasons

[17:56:00.0000] <roc>
performance tends to be one reason

[17:57:00.0000] <roc>
but it seems plausible that maintaing some set of parallel structures is likely to hurt performance

[17:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
roc, it's better to pave the cowpaths and let them keep using canvas in more accessible ways, than to try and get everyone to use SVG instead

[17:58:00.0000] <roc>
I don't agree

[17:58:01.0000] <roc>
building a bunch of new canvas APIs and then discovering it's approximately as crappy as SVG would have been would be a terrible outcome

[17:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
no-one is suggesting building a set of APIs that are as crappy as SVG

[18:00:00.0000] <roc>
sure, no-one starts out with that intention

[18:00:01.0000] <roc>
anyway

[18:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure what you're trying to say now

[18:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sure the SVG WG didn't plan to make something "as crappy as SVG" as roc put it

[18:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
you started out questioning why we needed to develop declerative canvas APIs instead of just using SVG, but then said SVG is crappy. So I'm confused

[18:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
so why would your idea not end up being "as crappy as SVG"?

[18:01:04.0000] <roc>
I'm saying that adding some kind of parallel, accessible view of the canvas content may well destroy the reasons that people like to use canvas in teh first place

[18:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
roc, the new APIs suggested in here wouldn't be a parallel accessible view.

[18:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
the backwards compatible image map approach I suggested could be considered that way though

[18:03:00.0000] <roc>
you're talking about declaring "active regions"

[18:03:01.0000] <roc>
how is that not a parallel, accessible view?

[18:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
because it wouldn't just serve accessibility reasons. Imagine being able to declare an active region, and then just listen for clicks there, instead of having to calculate where on the canvas the click occurred

[18:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's still a parallel view which is accessible

[18:05:00.0000] <roc>
the cases where canvas wins most over SVG are where the information is dense

[18:05:01.0000] <roc>
like graphs, or an RTS where every pixel is custom rendered

[18:06:00.0000] <roc>
in those cases, you'll have zillions of active regions

[18:06:01.0000] <roc>
if you only have a few active regions, then you probably only have a few shapes, and you can use SVG

[18:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/spritepick/example.html

[18:07:00.0000] <roc>
pretty cool

[18:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
roc, what other possible way is there that could solve the problem?

[18:07:02.0000] <roc>
I don't know

[18:07:03.0000] <Philip`>
That probably counts as dense information

[18:07:04.0000] <roc>
not all problems have solutions

[18:07:05.0000] <Lachy>
then how could we improve on the solution the idea to solve some of its own problems?

[18:07:06.0000] <Philip`>
What is the problem anyway?

[18:07:07.0000] <roc>
another problem with the active region approach is that it's bolted-on accessibility

[18:08:00.0000] <roc>
authors just won't use it

[18:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
the problem is making canvas accessible to people other than sighted people with a mouse

[18:08:02.0000] <roc>
or they'll use it wrong

[18:08:03.0000] <roc>
especially if there's a measurable performance hit

[18:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: as i said, the other solution is to provide a hook for script so that when the canvas is focused, if the user tabs or directionally navigates the focus, the canvas can say "ok keep the focus in the canvas, i can handle that one"

[18:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
roc: They might use it if it's the easiest way to support interactivity (i.e. clicking on regions), and a side-effect is that it can be exposed in a more accessible way

[18:09:02.0000] <Lachy>
there doesn't really seem to be a way for it to not be bolt on accessibility. But, as I said before, it could be leveraged for more than just accessibility purposes

[18:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
roc: It's kind of a pain to put onclick on the canvas and then have to manually work out which object was clicked on, so an API that makes that easier might get used by people who don't care about accessibility

[18:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, that sounds far more complicated than letting the browser itself help out

[18:10:01.0000] <roc>
Philip`: maybe, except for the problem I noted about having large numbers of regions

[18:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: maybe, i haven't compared the resulting code

[18:11:00.0000] <roc>
If the canvas contents are changing, then you have to maintain the set of regions and their geometry

[18:11:01.0000] <roc>
seems to me that's probably actually harder than writing your own picker code

[18:11:02.0000] <roc>
maintaining cached stuff persistently is almost always harder than just recomputing something whenever you need it

[18:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm assuming you could just destroy and recreate all the regions every frame, at the same time as you're recreating all the rendered paths

[18:12:01.0000] <roc>
if you're doing that, then the actual code that walks the regions to do picking is relatively easy

[18:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Hooray for garbage collectors)

[18:13:00.0000] <roc>
maybe if you did beginRegion(...); draw draw draw; endRegion(...)

[18:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
interesting idea. So the region would include any pixel that was drawn on

[18:19:00.0000] <roc>
yeah

[18:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
What does "drawn on" mean?

[18:21:00.0000] <roc>
whatever we want it to mean

[18:21:01.0000] <roc>
that would be more convenient than writing your own custom picking code, so I can believe that people might actually use it

[18:21:02.0000] <roc>
and it might perform OK, since the browser can compute bounding boxes for you

[18:21:03.0000] <Philip`>
I can imagine it would relatively common to e.g. draw a shadowed box, and want to respond to the mouse being over the box and not its shadow

[18:21:04.0000] <roc>
and probably already does for invalidation etc

[18:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
but also to draw an image with transparency, and want to respond to the mouse being over non-zero-alpha bits

[18:24:00.0000] <jwalden>

where do people get the idea that HTML5 is officially released?

[18:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
it is officially released

[18:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's been officially released since about 2004

[18:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
it seems more like that the forum post meant finalised, not just a public draft

[18:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
what does "finalised" mean

[18:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
you mean like xhtml2? :-)

[18:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
no, I mean like being finished and published as a Rec

[18:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
but if that's not what the post meant, then it's not clear why he would use langauge like "Officially Released" in that context

[18:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
unless he thinks this is the first time it's been public

[18:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
by the time html5 is a REC, nobody will care

[18:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
we'll be all working on HTML6 or even HTML7 (assuming we don't go with what I would like to do, which is just make HTML a living document with no meaningless versioning)

[19:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
so you would just keep it like it is on the whatwg copy with section specific status markers forever?

[19:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[19:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
we could effectively do that if we just treat the Recs as stable snapshots, and keep going with the same spec instead of starting fresh each time (which wouldn't be a good idea, anyway)

[19:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
that would require a change to the w3c process though

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can't do LC->CR->PR->REC if you're just doing RECs as snapshots

[19:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
not really, since each time you begin work on the next version, you just fork the spec into, e.g. an HTML5 or HTML6 branch, which then continues along the Rec track while the trunk keeps going

[19:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
just like how software branches quite happily go through alphas->betas->release candidates->final

[19:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh hell, i'm not maintaining two branches of html5

[19:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's bad enough for code

[19:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not maintaining a 15 year branch

[19:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
how else do you intend us to start on HTML5 within the current w3c process then?

[19:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
*HTML6

[19:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
we can't, with the current process

[19:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i think the problem is the process

[19:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
but with your model, it seems difficult for any specific section to ever be marked stable and stay that way for very long

[19:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[19:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's the point

[19:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
there is no stability here

[19:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's an ever-evolving platform

[19:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
the specs should reflect that

[19:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
but by publishing a stable snapshot, it allows implementers to clearly distinguish the stable sections from the new unstable sections

[19:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
so e.g. if video becomes widely implemented with its current feature set, and then you want to go add some new APIs after that, the new unstable stuff would be mixed in with the previously stable stuff

[19:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i disagree with your use of the word "clearly"

[19:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we're trying to make it easier to recognise new features, then we should work on that specifically

[19:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
having said that, i don't know how to do that, especially when the new features integrate deeply with e.g. navigation

[19:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I can understand why maintaining forks won't work too well. It doesn't really work too well for XHR and XHR2, like Anne is doing

[19:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't ever work well

[19:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
it only vaguely works for software projects when they have very short lifetimes (weeks at most) and few checkins (just patches for crashes and stop-ship bugs)

[19:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
anything that has to either track another branch, or have bugs fixed in two or more branches, or merge back into another branch later, is a disaster

[19:35:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
There is never going to be anything like stable sections. I'm currently implementing drag & drop APIs with backward compatibility. They're largely implemented but there are lots of little quirks that live through major releases. I think it'll remain like that for quite a while.

[19:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
sebmarkbage, in which browser?

[19:39:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
I'm implementing JS legacy compatibilty for MooTools and while doing that, working on patches for WebKit.

[19:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
software is never perfect or frozen, yet we still ship it every once in a while

[19:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
not sure if this is a plausible model for specs

[19:43:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
That's the essence of HTML 5 IMHO. If you could do perfect frozen models, it'd be called XHTML 2. But the internet is a moving organism of legacy code. That somehow works.

roc: btw, I'm pretty sure I told Hixie that canPlayType would cause the exact mistake you made to be extremely common

[22:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if it's too deployed to change now :-(

[22:23:02.0000] <roc>
I told him too

[22:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
at the very least, it should not have been named to sound like it returns a boolean

[22:23:04.0000] <roc>
I make that mistake about every time I use it

[22:23:05.0000] <othermaciej>
something like playabilityForType()

[22:23:06.0000] <othermaciej>
or to make the "no" case return false

[22:23:07.0000] <othermaciej>
or split into mightPlayType() and canDefinitelyPlayType()

[22:23:08.0000] <roc>
yeah

[22:24:00.0000] <roc>
having the "no" case return false would screw with non-JS bindings

[22:24:01.0000] <roc>
Would www-font be useful? Maybe.

[22:24:02.0000] <roc>
at least it would be less painfully unuseful.

[22:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I didn't even know your code was buggy from memory, it was only when I tested that I found it was always saying "YES"

[22:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(wanted to confirm that our canPlayType bug was properly fixed)

[22:25:02.0000] <roc>
hehe

[22:25:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so basically, if you and I can't understand how the API works, despite commenting on it in detail in the past, it is clearly broken

[22:25:04.0000] <roc>
yes, that was my snarky point

[22:26:00.0000] <roc>
I also implemented it

[22:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought i'd fixed the things you mentioned, didn't realise i'd failed to address this particular point. i agree that we should fix this.

[22:28:00.0000] <roc>
returning the empty string would work

[22:28:01.0000] <roc>
we could probably ram that into a Firefox update

[22:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
empty string would work for JS, yes

[22:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in other languages, it would be harder to make it accidentally do a boolean check

[22:29:02.0000] <roc>
yeah

wait, I'm not sure as to Java

[23:03:02.0000] <roc>
however

[23:03:03.0000] <roc>
this seems to be a situation where most people using the API are probably using it incorrectly already

[23:04:00.0000] <doublec>
Not from what I've seen

[23:04:01.0000] <doublec>
But they check for "probably" and "maybe" explicitly and fail on anything else

[23:04:02.0000] <doublec>
 it seems

[23:04:03.0000] <roc>
that's OK

[23:04:04.0000] <doublec>
yep

[23:04:05.0000] <roc>

so, I think I should implement HTML5-compliant document.write timing behavior

[00:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
basically prevent it from timeouts and such

[00:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
is it correct that insertion point is

[00:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
 1) Not defined when document.write runs synchronously and is not breaking on </script>

[00:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
 2) Defined when document.write breaks on </script>

[00:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
 3) Defined when normal tokenization executes inline script on </script>

[00:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
 4) Defined when an external non-defer script's load completes and it is run.

[00:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
 5) (Not yet but per sicking's email will be) when the network stream has ended, there are only defer scripts left and a defer scripts is executed

[00:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
 6) Not defined at any other time

[00:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Correct?

Hixie: is there a maximum for script nesting level that follows from everything else?

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it seems that Gecko doesn't execute a script if the script is in a noscript or noembed container in the tree at the time that execution is attempted

[02:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>

Hixie: does this if block comply with HTML5? http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/base/src/nsScriptLoader.cpp#550

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: have you looked at the Gecko script blocker concept? does HTML5 deal with it somehow?

[02:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: as far as I can tell, HTML5 executes inline non-async scripts immediately, but Gecko may spin the event loop if there's a script blocker in effect

[02:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the script nesting level concept was removed from Gecko a while ago

[02:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: while it was in Gecko, did it inspire the current spec text?

[02:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so, if a script's parent has been moved to a different document and the script does document.write(), does it blow away the other document?

[03:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It seems that if I want to avoid seriously refactoring Gecko's script execution code

[03:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(and I want to avoid it)

[03:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I need to make scripts not only know their document but their originating parser

[03:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
well, I suppose having a weak ref to the parser from parser-inserted script nodes isn't too serious bloat...

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
cause if I don't make them know their originating parser and scripts are moved between documents that both have active parsers, bad stuff could happen, I think

[04:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like it

[04:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
They still provide radio streams using Real

[04:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but default to Flash)

[04:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess Flash has hurt Real pretty seriously

[04:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like they also provide WMA of radio streams

[04:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah the BBC tries pretty hard to cover all its bases and is pretty reluctant to remove old stuff

[04:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hasn't used RealPlayer in ages

[04:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
(get_iplayer says "flashaac1,flashaac2,realaudio,wma" for radio streams; "flashaac1,flashaudio,iphone,realaudio" for old radio programmes)

[04:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
("flashnormal" for live TV streams; "flashhd1,flashhigh3,flashlow1,flashlow2,flashnormal,flashvhigh2,iphone,n95_wifi,subtitles" for old TV programmes (at least ones available in HD))

[04:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes their HD content - 1280x720 H.264 looks pretty good, and it's only 1.4GB per hour

[04:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also, no adverts and I don't even have to pay the TV Licensing fee)

[04:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
there could well be prior art on it anyway, since play lists have been around for years and the idea of splitting videos up and playing them sequentially isn't new

[04:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
though it sucks that Apple decided to include the equivalent of the broadcast flag :-(

[04:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh there's even that kind of thing lurking in there :-(

[04:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, it was mentioned in the ars technica article

[04:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
Apparently it's just a flag that indicates whether clients are allowed to cache it or not

[04:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
so of course it's a completely inneffective form of DRM, but it could well be subject to anti-circumvention clauses like the broadcast flag was

[05:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is async an HTML5 invention or an IE thing?

[05:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
on scripts

[05:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think it's an HTML5 invention

[05:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: OK. thanks

[05:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, does IE even support it?

[05:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I don't see it on MSDN

[05:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
nor do I

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
If authors start using the async attribute ahead of browsers, the feature will be pretty much poisoned...

[05:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
is there any evidence that they are?

[05:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
I've not seen much written about it at all

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: there seems to be existence proof that it has been used in the wild once

[05:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: view source on http://samaxes-demos.appspot.com/samaxesjs/toc-jquery.html

[05:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
it probably wouldn't hurt too much though, as long as authors don't use it and then stupidly rely on the script executing synchronously

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"as long as", yeah...

[05:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I don't have much faith in authors not doing stupid things either

[05:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
for many cases, they'd be better off using defer instead, since the difference between waiting for the script to be available and the page to finish downloading would be negligable in most cases

[05:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
and at least defer is supported by IE

[05:23:00.0000] <Rik|work>
and firefox now ?

[05:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
I haven't heard about it being supported in firefox, but possibly

[05:25:00.0000] <Rik|work>
http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/defer/

[05:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm quite surprised that such a useful feature has taken so long to be deployed in other browsers

[05:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
especially given that people have used increasingly complex methods of achieving effectively the same result

[07:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
I was going to see if I could have a go at doing some video codec comparisons between theora, dirac and h.264, but with a slightly improved methodology over what was used here http://people.xiph.org/~greg/video/ytcompare/comparison.html

[07:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
unfortunately, I can't obtain ffmpeg right now

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are you intending to compare the quality of the codec format, or the quality of ffmpeg's implementation of them?

[07:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
one problem with that previous methodology was that the source video he created used a lossy codec, and so artifacts from that were passed through to the the resultant h.264 and theora versions

[07:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's how codecs get used in practice

[07:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, from what I've read, ffmpeg seems to have the latest version of schroedinger in it for encoding dirac, and it also allows me to encode the Big Buck Bunny images into a lossless source video

[07:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I'd expect quality 100 MJPEG not to invalidate the methodology

[07:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
People don't upload lossless videos to YouTube - they just copy the MPEG-2 that their camera recorded or the XviD that they generated on their computer or whatever

[07:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: also, non-computer-generated video will have been through DCT anyway

[07:16:03.0000] <Lachy>
it's better to eliminate unnecessary losses in quality before the final encodes

[07:16:04.0000] <hsivonen>
either as MJPEG or as DV

[07:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the interesting thing is to test with the kind of crappy source material that gets uploaded to YouTube

[07:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: whose camera records MPEG-2?

[07:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
As someone mentioned on the list, any comparison should look at varying kinds of source material, e.g. clean CG animations and camera-phone videos and cartoons and TV recordings etc

[07:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thought cameras were DV, MJPEG and H.264

[07:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
since some codecs might be good at some and rubbish at others

[07:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No idea, I just made it up

[07:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
oh, and many camera phones are MPEG-4 SP

[07:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, the interesting thing is to elimiate as many variables as possible and ensure you're only testing the quality of the encoders

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: In that case, maybe you should use a pure black image as the source video, to fully eliminate the variability in the input

[07:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
also, I'm not enitrely sure that quality 100 MJPEG is lossless, and he also had another lossy step before that when he resampled the images to 480x270 using ImageMagick

[07:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I think the right thing to test is substantial random sample of raw YouTube material with YouTube's current H.264 encode and Thusnelda with constant settings for the whole sample per Thusnelda config

[07:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: because in practice YT doesn't hand tune

[07:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: because in practice, it's a comptetition against H.264 as practiced by YT--not ideal H.264 encode

[07:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: and because real world has crappy source video

[07:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: as long as you don't crop after 100 MJPEG, MJPEG should be fine

[07:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
so, that doesn't mean it's not useful to have true comparison that only tests the codecs in a way that is unaffected by other external factors

[07:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(since the JPEG blocks will align with the video codec blocks anyway)

[07:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(and video codecs most likely do something sufficiently DCT-like anyway)

[07:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: depends on what you are trying to prove

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Video compression is all about tradeoffs, and if you only use one source video then you're only seeing one data point and have no idea what tradeoffs were made that harm other equally-important inputs

[07:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, my plan was to encode the PNGs into a lossless huffyuv encoded video (since that's supported by ffmpeg) and then use that as the source for comparing dirac and theora, and possibly h.264

[07:25:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I think it is well known that H.264 is better in an ideal world

[07:25:03.0000] <jgraham>
The question is is it substantially better under real wworld conditions

[07:25:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: what kind of camera are you getting your video from?

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: RGB to YUV is kind of lossy, I think

[07:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I'm using the Big Buck Bunny images that were used in the previous test

[07:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I still don't understand what you're trying to show

[07:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, if you know of another lossless codec that is supported by an available tool, which will then allow me to reencode as dirac and theora, let me know

[07:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I'm trying to test the quality differences primarily between dirac and theora

[07:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
The absolute quality difference?

[07:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
what do you mean by the absolute quality difference?

[07:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well I don't really mean "absolute"

[07:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
I mean you seem to want perfect input

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I think my point is that "lossless" is kind of meaningless, since almost any processing of video loses at least a little bit of data (even if it's just converting colour formats), though I'm not sure it's a particularly interesting or relevant point

[07:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
And then will presumably fix something (bitrate? encoding time?) for output

[07:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
yes, so that the only thing being tested is the codec quality, and so that any artifacts in the video are purely as a result of the final encode, rather than any previous step

[07:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, yes, I will eliminate as many variables as physically possible

[07:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
OK but that seems irrelevent to video on the web

[07:31:02.0000] <jgraham>
I suspect it will show you that dirac is no good at small file sizes compared with theora and H.264 is better than both

[07:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
At large file sizes Dirac will be good

[07:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
From what I've heard, Dirac is currently aimed mainly at very-high-bitrate applications, so it wouldn't be very interesting to compare at low YouTube-style bitrates

[07:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
What Philip` said

[07:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
has anyone watched hi-def stuff on youtube? :)

[07:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: I've tried, but Flash uses up all my CPU juice and it goes all jittery :-(

[07:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
(mplayer is perfectly happy with fullscreen 720p, though)

[07:35:00.0000] <takkaria>
I've uploaded a couple of hi-def videos to youtube, so it seems like Dirac might be suitable for that

[07:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
(As Philip` or someone said the right test for video-on-the-web is to take multiple types of real world (i.e. lossy) input, reencode it to H.264/Theora/Dirac in a way that takes roughly the same time as youtube and produces roughly the same file sizes as youtube, and compare the resulting output)

[07:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees http://lwn.net/Articles/326830/ saying "If you are archiving video, building a unencumbered-bluray, or squeezing production grade 1080 HD video into 270mbit SD channels, Dirac is what you want. If you are webcasting with under a couple of megabits per second, Theora is what you want"

[07:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
though I'm not sure how much that's justified by data, or where the balancing point would be

[07:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
testing with lossy input makes it harder to compare the result, since so many of the artifacts in the output will be a direct result of the input, rather than the re-encoding process

[07:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
A hard-to-compare result sounds better than a result that's meaningless to anyone who wants to use the codecs in practice

[07:40:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Since the real world input is ally lossily encoded trying to remove that from the tests makes the tests less relevent

[07:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
if you take a look at the input avi file used in http://people.xiph.org/~greg/video/ytcompare/comparison.html it's incredibly lossy, which isn't useful

[07:40:03.0000] <Lachy>
well, I disagree with both of you

[07:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: It depends what you are looking at. But if you are interested in video on the web you need to look at the type of source material that people actually use for video on the web

[07:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
Losslessly encoded sources are only one (rather rare) type of source material

[07:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
so, I'm only interested in the quality of the final encodes, since the results of encoding a lossless input to multiple encodings should show the same relative differences in output quality, as would a lossy input, but make it much clearer to judge the result

[07:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
That seems like a huge and, I think, provably false, assumption

[07:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
Are you assuming the quality of the output is directly proportional to the quality of the input?

[07:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
(e.g. if the lossly initial encoding is compresses in blocks then a lossy subsequent encoding that works with the same block size will look better than one that uses a totally different compression scheme, or has the blocks offset or something)

[07:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/l//

[07:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
(even if the other encoding scheme is "better" given ideal input)

[07:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
right, so if my input video used a lossy codec which unfairly favoured one of the output codecs due to block sizes or whatever, then the test would be biased.

[07:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems like saying that if you have e.g. a lossless PDF document full of text and compress it as PNG and JPEG then PNG will do pretty well, and asserting that if you print out the PDF and take a photograph so you've got a lossy version then PNG will be relatively just as effective as before

[07:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, yeah, that['s true

[07:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Which is why the interesting test is to look at the actual inputs that people use. 

[07:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
that may also be interesting, but that doesn't mean what I want to do isn't

[07:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
Right, it's just not interesting for the video-on-the-web problem (except the tiny fraction of the problem that involves losslessly encoded input)

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Actually the tinier fraction that involves losslessly encoded input with the same kind of colour range and detail and motion as the one you're testing with)

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has noticed that iPlayer programmes with bright primary red/blue backgrounds tend to look terrible and blocky around the edges of the foreground, and wonders if that's an artifact of H.264 or something else

takkaria: You got an email address you prefer?

jgraham: andi⊙to

[08:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting that Vorbis is missing in the BBC action even though it works today and BBC is interested in RF codecs

[08:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
enough to put money into Dirac

[08:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
As far as I'm aware, it doesn't work in the sense that you could serve it over the web and most people would be able to listen to it without installing any new software

[08:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: that doesn't mention Thusnelda, which suggest the test may have used a stale encoder

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: That seems quite likely (and apparently the tests were performed "Q2-2008")

[08:25:00.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: any particular reason?

[08:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: I used your @opera email address instead

[08:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
If you didn't get an email, I got it wrong :)

[09:15:00.0000] <remysharp>
hi, I'm having some trouble understanding the effectAllowed and dropEffect attribs in drag and drop - can anyone give me a helping hand for a min?

[09:23:00.0000] <remysharp>
okay - is dropEffect effect supposed to be on the dragged element or on the element we're dropping on to?

[09:23:01.0000] <remysharp>
it looks like (in the browser) that I'm supposed to use effectAllowed on the dragged element

[10:27:00.0000] <ezyang>
Nice! Once I fix the DOM issues, HTML Purifier 5.0 will also use html5lib 

[10:33:00.0000] <sypasche>
Hixie: ping

[16:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I can understand people who want to write a strict syntax (subset), but is there really anything stricter about using <br/> than <br>? If anything, it leaves you open to <br/> vs <br />

[16:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Could've saved a lot of trouble if people had talked about strict HTML rather than saddling it on XHTML

[16:29:00.0000] <hober>
indeed

[16:55:00.0000] <tantek>
Dashiva - back in the day, many of us *did* talk about strict valid semantic HTML.

[16:56:00.0000] <tantek>
but HTML by then had already earned too much of a "presentational" reputation, even among web designers, especially among programmers.

[16:57:00.0000] <tantek>
XHTML 1.0 was an opportunity to present valid semantic HTML anew, and for the most part, it worked/works quite well.

[16:58:00.0000] <tantek>
eventually a lot of us started referring to good use of XHTML/HTML by the shorthand (X)HTML, which was sufficient to include those that really wanted to just use HTML4 really well.


2009-07-11
[17:06:00.0000] <tantek>
Dashiva - here is a short list of minor advantages to using XHTML rather than HTML: http://tantek.com/log/2003/01.html#L20030114t1345

[17:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
JavaScript variable scoping is great fun

[17:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: What does the fourth column in the http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html table mean? (It seems to lack a column heading)

[17:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
fixed

[17:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, indeed

[17:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be nice if Opera didn't display the entire table before the canvas

[17:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
it shouldn't display the table at all

[17:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: that was a reasonable list of reasons at the time - I think nowadays most of them have been addressed by HTML5 or just general market changes

[17:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I think it just totally fails to implement canvas child nodes correctly

[17:15:00.0000] <tantek>
HTML5 certainly goes a long way towards addressing  them, and certainly the web authoring community has made very good progress in better use of semantic (X)HTML.

[17:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
It parses <canvas> kind of like <script> or something

[17:16:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej, the reliable input to XML tools however is still a non-trivial advantage. For example, two very common microformats tools, X2V and Optimus, are both written in XSLT.

[17:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: odd

[17:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: file a bug

[17:16:03.0000] <tantek>
if parsing a page fails as XML, then the tools run tidy on the page to "clean it up" before retrying

[17:17:00.0000] <tantek>
since tidy is known to overly clean things up (e.g. strip elements with no contents, even if they have class and title attribute), it's still better to published well formed XML via XHTML.

[17:18:00.0000] <tantek>
also performance, as obviously trying once is faster than trying twice with a tidy clean step in the middle.

[17:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: I think html5lib and such are making that advantage less and less relevant

[17:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but sure, it might not be deployed in all the right places yet

[17:22:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej, I tend to agree, over time the magnitude of the advantage is likely to decrease due to tools like html5lib.

[17:22:01.0000] <tantek>
and yes, for now and the near future however, I can say it still very much makes a difference.

[17:23:00.0000] <tantek>
frankly, it's turned out to make more of a difference (e.g. the microformats XSLT tools people wrote) than I expected it to when I wrote that blog post 6 years ago.

[17:24:00.0000] <syp_>
Hixie: is it safe to assume element.classList will need to be case insensitive in quirks mode?

[17:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
syp_: no

[17:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well - it's only an advantage for microformats XSLT tools in the case where people are using such tools on content they control

[17:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
syp_: it is not safe to assume that

[17:25:00.0000] <syp_>
hmm, ok

[17:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
syp_: it might be true, though; what does the spec say?

[17:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if tools like that need to be able to extract from anything on the web, then it's outright a bug in those tools that they use libtidy when faced with HTML instead of XHTML

[17:25:03.0000] <syp_>
Hixie: it doesn't say anything for the moment, so I guess it means case sensitive.

[17:25:04.0000] <tantek>
sure, they may switch to using html5lib instead of tidy over time

[17:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
syp_: k. That seems best.

[17:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
syp_: you can't be in quirks mode in a conforming doc anyway.

[17:26:01.0000] <tantek>
but even with that substitution, the performance difference will still exist. one process step vs. two process steps with a html5lib conversion in the middle.

[17:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
crap meeting gotta go

[17:26:03.0000] <tantek>
To be clear, I've never really had much hope for XML on the web. Extensibility and everyone making up their own vocabularies means less likelihood of communication (especially across time), not more.

[17:26:04.0000] <tantek>
Thus XML methodologies were kind of doomed from the start as far as an update to the basic communication format of the Web. Never mind the ridiculous "must fail" approach.

[17:26:05.0000] <syp_>
Hixie: ok thanks

[17:27:00.0000] <tantek>
s/ridiculous/impractical

[17:28:00.0000] <syp_>
Hixie: I saw some comments in the mailing list about that, and other parts of the spec where classes are handled in a case insensitive way, that's why I was wondering.

[17:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: the downside risk to XHTML served as text/html is that there's no handy validator to tell you that your document is a correct chameleon document

[17:29:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - the W3C validator does just fine.

[17:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so there's the risk of making something that will be misinterpreted depending on what tool is reading it

[17:29:02.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: does it have a special "appendix C" mode?

[17:29:03.0000] <tantek>
it validates it as XHTML, even if served as text/html

[17:29:04.0000] <othermaciej>
validating as XHTML is not validating whether it means the same thing interpreted as HTML and XML

[17:30:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - last I checked it hard *warnings* for Appendix C violations on XHTML 1.0 documents served as text/html.

[17:30:01.0000] <tantek>
s/hard/had

[17:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that's probably good enough

[17:30:03.0000] <tantek>
that's kind of what I figured too.

[17:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(only remaining risks would be to obscure script issues, but that's only an issue if serving to real browsers as both mime types, not so much to pure data processing tools)

[17:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I hope validator.nu gets a chameleon checking mode even though I bet hsivonen hates the idea of chameleon documents

[17:31:02.0000] <tantek>
agreed. and it's impractical to serve anything but text/html to browsers.

[17:32:00.0000] <tantek>
or rather, it's impractical to depend on "must fail" MIME types, e.g. serve application/xml(+*) to browsers.

[17:33:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej I for one like chameleon documents, and even code too.

[17:33:01.0000] <tantek>
see for example: http://tantek.pbworks.com/CassisProject

[17:34:00.0000] <tantek>
such chameleon documents/code typically have greater utility than either of the two single formats/languages on their own.

[17:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: that's wild

[21:55:00.0000] <abii>

[00:23:00.0000] <gmaxwell>
I see that Till Halbach's dirac/theora/h264 comparison was mentioned. Beyond the point about it being old, three independent parties have been unable to reproduce his results using the same software versions. While H.264 and dirac numbers have good agreement, his theora numbers are ~15dB lower than anyone else gets (on Akiyo, for example).  In spite of this he has been unwilling to check his measurements or post any notes on this point.   T

[00:23:01.0000] <gmaxwell>
his is further supported by his example image:  http://etill.net/projects/dirac_theora_evaluation/include/visual_comparison.png  The sequence being  original, dirac at 67kbit/sec, theora at 18kbit/sec, h264 at 17kbit/sec, while the charts theora is show as something like 10dB worse than the dirac which is clearly not the case from the example.  ::shrugs:: Take that for what you will.

[00:26:00.0000] <gmaxwell>
As far as the prior comments about what I sent to youtube—  The provided upload limits and supported formats constrained my choices.  The MJPEG was the best I they appeared to accept, and anything larger would have interacted poorly with the upload size cap.   The Theora and Youtube started from the same input. ::shrugs::   But if you're worried about points like this you've missed the point of the comparison, it was intended to be an ord

[00:26:01.0000] <gmaxwell>
er of magnitude kind of thing.   A detailed comparison would require many kinds of input, etc. 

[00:27:00.0000] <gmaxwell>
And would have been an enormous amount of work, which I can't justify spending my time on because the people I work with would never consider using H.264 in any case due to the licensing.

[00:27:01.0000] <gmaxwell>
Cheers.

/me tries to work out why photobooth won't start if you have no physical monitor plugged in

[21:31:01.0000] <jacobolus>
anyone know exactly which browsers treat --!> as a comment end?

[21:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
and why if you start it while a monitor is plugged in, and then take the monitor out, the preview window goes white, but you can still take pictures

[21:32:00.0000] <jacobolus>
/me noticed hsivonen's note that his parser doesn't do it yet, but that apparently it's supported elsewhere

[22:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jacobolus: hsivonen raised and HTML WG bugzilla bug for that, did you see it?

[22:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>

[22:27:00.0000] <jacobolus>
MikeSmith: so do all major browsers support that?

[22:27:01.0000] <jacobolus>
i.e. close the comment when they see --!>

[22:28:00.0000] <jacobolus>
(I guess I could test out a bunch of them.... but I thought someone might know)

[22:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jacobolus: I don't know myself. I guess the way to be sure is to test it and see what you get

[22:29:01.0000] <jacobolus>
ok

[22:29:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but based on hsivonen comments there, it seems like that do

[22:29:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
*they do

[22:35:00.0000] <jacobolus>
FF 2&3, & Safari 4 do, but Opera doesn't seem to

[22:35:01.0000] <jacobolus>
maybe I should file an opera bug

[22:37:00.0000] <jacobolus>
(though they probably know this, w/ annevk &c. paying attention)

[22:52:00.0000] <jacobolus>
oh wow, the opera behavior is odd indeed

[22:52:01.0000] <jacobolus>
if it only finds --!>, then it treats it as a comment ending

[22:52:02.0000] <jacobolus>
but if there's --> anywhere later, it'll use that as the end of the comment

[22:53:00.0000] <jacobolus>
swallowing anything in between

[22:53:01.0000] <jacobolus>
so adding a comment way down the page completely changes rendering

[22:53:02.0000] <jacobolus>
I guess I will file that bug

[23:01:00.0000] <jacobolus>
for any opera devs here, bug 258698

[23:07:00.0000] <jacobolus>
example html that causes this behavior in latest Opera 10 preview: http://pastie.textmate.org/542877

[23:30:00.0000] <jacobolus>
(hsivonen/Hixie: you might be interested in that... dunno)

[01:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: If I remember correctly, if it reaches EOF with an unclosed comment then it re-parses and closes the comment on the first >, or something like that

[01:09:00.0000] <jacobolus>
huh. well I can put in multiple 'fake' comments and they work fine

[01:09:01.0000] <jacobolus>
but as soon as I add a real one, even way down the page, they all break

[01:09:02.0000] <jacobolus>
you could be right that that's the behavior. I'll test a bit

[01:10:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: huh, you seem to be right

[01:10:01.0000] <jacobolus>
so they probably already had this as a bug

[01:11:00.0000] <jacobolus>
sadly, the database is closed...

[01:13:00.0000] <jacobolus>
yeah, it seems to eat everything up to the first > it finds, if it can't find a -->

[01:13:01.0000] <jacobolus>
which means that it tends to eat some opening tag

[10:18:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Just getting cloudier and cloudier

[10:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
So I am wondering about implementing the new table character data stuff in html5lib

[10:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like a good idea to me

[10:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems like it might be nice to return all character data from the tokenizer together rather than special casing whitespace in some circumstances

[10:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
So all the logic about whitespce being special would be on the treebuilder side

[10:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
But I'm not sure if this is just crazy talk or not

[10:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what hsivonen does

[11:39:00.0000] <Simetrical>
So <!doctype html> actually triggers different behavior from old doctypes, it seems?

[11:39:01.0000] <Simetrical>
That's . . . bad?

[11:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
Simetrical: Depends which old doctypes you mean

[11:39:03.0000] <Simetrical>
Well, I'm working on switching Wikipedia from XHTML 1.0 Transitional to HTML 5.

[11:40:00.0000] <Simetrical>
When I switch the doctype, rendering breaks.

[11:40:01.0000] <Simetrical>
That will make things *much* more complicated.

[11:40:02.0000] <Simetrical>
I had thought that the doctype was chosen specifically so it would trigger standards mode in all browsers, but it seems that's not quite the case.

[11:40:03.0000] <Simetrical>
Hmm.

[11:40:04.0000] <Philip`>
Simetrical: If I'm reading the table on http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/ properly, XHTML 1.0 Transitional is "Almost Standards"

[11:40:05.0000] <Simetrical>
Yeah, I just read that too.

[11:40:06.0000] <Philip`>
(and <!doctype html> is "Standards")

[11:41:00.0000] <Simetrical>
Okay, I'm going to have to come up with a test case here.

[11:41:01.0000] <Simetrical>
Because I'm seeing the rendering break in Chrome.

[11:41:02.0000] <Simetrical>
I'll figure out what's going on.

[11:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hopefully there shouldn't be that many differences between almost-standards and standards

[11:41:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't remember exactly what the differences are, though

[11:41:05.0000] <Simetrical>
Oh, I see.

[11:42:00.0000] <Simetrical>
Hmm.

[11:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/ already talks about Almost Standards

[11:42:02.0000] <Simetrical>
Current MediaWiki doctype: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

[11:42:03.0000] <Philip`>
"which implements the vertical sizing of table cells traditionally and not rigorously according to the CSS2 specification"

[11:43:00.0000] <Simetrical>
It looks like the doctype change is switching three browsers from "almost standards" to "standards".

[11:43:01.0000] <Simetrical>
Specifically including . . . all recent browsers.

[11:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
That sounds correct

[11:44:00.0000] <Simetrical>
So more changes will be required to ensure that pages continue to render correctly.

[11:44:01.0000] <Simetrical>
Ugh.  Okay.

[11:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like image-in-table is about the only difference

[11:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Images%2c_Tables%2c_and_Mysterious_Gaps etc

[11:45:01.0000] <Simetrical>
We have some of those, I guess, but that's not the difference I'm seeing.

[11:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, what difference are you seeing?

[11:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
or maybe it's better to wait for a test case :-)

[11:46:01.0000] <Simetrical>
Well, look at any page of Wikipedia in the default skin.  The whole nav bar thing on the left below the logo gets pushed down below the end of the page in Chrome 3 with an HTML 5 doctype.

[11:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, same in Safari 4.0

[11:54:00.0000] <Simetrical>
But not Firefox 3.5.

[11:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Nor Opera

[11:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Might be some kind of WebKit bug

[11:57:01.0000] <Simetrical>
If it breaks the site for all Safari users, that means we can't switch the doctype right now.

[11:57:02.0000] <Simetrical>
I'm trying to make a minimal test case.

[11:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's approximately zero benefit in changing the doctype, so it doesn't seem worth hurting users

[11:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
though I suppose it's nice to make browsers do Standards instead of Almost Standards

[12:00:00.0000] <Simetrical>
Well, the idea is to actually deploy valid HTML 5, which means switching the doctype.

[12:00:01.0000] <Simetrical>
My understanding is that the point of the HTML 5 doctype is to make sure that old content will work.

[12:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think the point is to make old content work the same as if it used an old Standards mode doctype (e.g. XHTML Strict), and also to be as short as possible

[12:02:00.0000] <Simetrical>
Aha.

[12:02:01.0000] <Simetrical>
You know, it might be WebKit-specific JavaScript hacks in MediaWiki itself.

[12:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
If there wasn't quirks mode, then HTML5 would probably have no doctype at all

[12:02:03.0000] <Simetrical>
Yes, agreed.

[12:02:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, that's possible

[12:02:05.0000] <Simetrical>
Okay, bingo.

wikibits.js is the problem.

[12:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me has tried playing with the CSS briefly and couldn't see what the problem was

[12:03:02.0000] <Simetrical>
I just started removing chunks of the head and body.

[12:03:03.0000] <Simetrical>
When I removed the script tags the problem stopped.

[12:03:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray for browser sniffing :-)

[12:03:05.0000] <Simetrical>
Yeah.  :(

[12:06:00.0000] <Simetrical>
I'm not sure it's the browser sniffing . . .

[12:10:00.0000] <Simetrical>
Bingo, KHTMLFixes.css.

[12:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Excellent, IE silently rejects EOT fonts if the Font Family Name is not a prefix of the Full Font Name

[12:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
(even though an equivalent font works perfectly well in the rest of Windows)

[12:17:01.0000] <Philip`>

Okay, Wikipedia HTML 5 deployment back on track.

[12:59:00.0000] <Simetrical>
Serving a five-year-old CSS fix for KHTML to modern WebKit development versions = epic fail.

[20:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
"The WebSocket JavaScript API provides the equivalent of a desktop style TCP connection, limited to text-based payloads for now, because JavaScript does not yet have a byte or ByteArray type."

[20:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I thought Javascript does actually have a byte type

[20:26:00.0000] <doublec>
nope

[20:26:01.0000] <doublec>
arrays of numbers is what you need to do for byte arrays

[20:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[20:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
What's the rationale for it not having a byte type?

[20:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
array of numbers and improper string are the two ways of doing it

[20:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there is no rationale, just hasn't been done yet

[20:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(although I don't think there is really a good strawman spec before the ECMAScript committee yet for a type to hold binary data)

[20:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
array of numbers is much much much less efficient than a proper ByteArray could be

[20:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess it'll be especially limiting in the case of WebSocket-based apps

[20:29:01.0000] <doublec>
yes

[20:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"The WebSocket wire protocol itself can represent either binary or text payloads, so languages other than JavaScript that do have a binary representation can choose to send binary data to a WebSocket server in the raw, rather than having to encode the binary data as text."

[20:30:01.0000] <doublec>
I wrote some code to read/process Ogg files from JavaScript and used the improper string approach

[20:30:02.0000] <doublec>
but it's not cross platform afaik since there's no way to say 'give me binary data' from xmlhttprequest

[20:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, seems like we are going to have a much more compelling need for it, once websocket gets supported in browsers

[20:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there is already a pretty compelling need for it

[20:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
binary XHR is a pretty big use case

[20:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
IMO

[20:36:03.0000] <othermaciej>
there's no clean way to either upload or retrieve binary data via XHR

[20:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: so nobody's submitted a spec proposal to the ECMAScript TC yet?

[20:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: there have been some vague proposals

[20:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe I will try to propose something more concrete

[20:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
this is the biggest hole in standards development right now IMO

[20:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: concrete proposal would be great to have

[20:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I want to be the first to write a VOIP server in Javascript :)

[20:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there's bigger pieces missing there than binary data

[20:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
like the ability to play and record raw audio data

[21:18:00.0000] <heycam>
Web IDL has arrays now though, so you can have a type octet[]

[21:19:00.0000] <heycam>
it's not quite the same as the original ES3 ByteArray

[21:19:01.0000] <heycam>
no constructor

[21:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that solves the Web IDL side, but not how you represent it in ECMAScript

[21:24:00.0000] <heycam>
there's http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#es-array

[21:24:01.0000] <heycam>
or do you mean something else

[21:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I see, I didn't know about that

[21:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I will amend my comment to: I don't think that's a very good way to represent binary data in ECMAScript

[21:30:00.0000] <slightlyoff>
othermaciej: generally as an objection to some sort of binary array? or the particulars of this outline which doesn't require changes to JS to do it?

[21:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
slightlyoff: I think it's a poor design for a type to deal with binary data

[21:30:02.0000] <slightlyoff>
ah, OK, +1 to that = )

[21:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think a binary data type should be immutable, like JS strings

[21:31:01.0000] <slightlyoff>
hrm

[21:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or maybe have an explicit copy to get a mutable variant

[21:31:03.0000] <slightlyoff>
I'd prefer that we have a Packed array type

[21:31:04.0000] <slightlyoff>
and maybe we have fixed and non-fixed variants

[21:32:00.0000] <slightlyoff>
with ByteArray being a subclass of that

[21:32:01.0000] <slightlyoff>
(or uses it to mix in)

[21:33:00.0000] <slightlyoff>
making it immutable seems maybe less important than not needing to accomidate the sparseness

[21:33:01.0000] <heycam>
othermaciej, is it just the mutability that you think is a poor choice?

[21:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
because a key use case is to hold underlying raw data buffers

[21:34:00.0000] <slightlyoff>
so there are some cases where we'd like to enforce the length that was handed up?

[21:34:01.0000] <heycam>
there's a concept of read only arrays: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#dfn-read-only-array

[21:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: well, I'm concerned in general about Web IDL minting new types to that extent

[21:34:03.0000] <heycam>
and fixed length ones too: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#dfn-fixed-length

[21:34:04.0000] <slightlyoff>
ugg

[21:35:00.0000] <slightlyoff>
I mean, not bad, but they seem poorly integrated w/ JS as a language

[21:35:01.0000] <slightlyoff>
(which prolly means JS needs to catch up)

[21:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it has a whole lot of concepts that aren't really used by the existing IDL-using specs, and defining them in this way will make things awkward when/if JS can better represent some of these concepts in the language itself

[21:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I have to go soon

[21:35:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but as a parting note

[21:36:00.0000] <heycam>
that's a good point, sure

[21:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
perhaps programming in Cocoa has spoiled me, but my experience with NSData convinces me that binary data should be its own kind of basic data type, like strings, rather than treating it like a kind of array

[21:37:00.0000] <heycam>
i've never programmed in cocoa so i don't know what goodness NSData gives you

[21:37:01.0000] <heycam>
but anyway, please do comment on the list when you get a chance

[21:37:02.0000] <slightlyoff>
fair enough, but I'd like that discussion to happen vis-a-vie JS rather than WebIDL, which sounds like what you're suggesting too

[21:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not really specific goodness, just the clarity

[21:37:04.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, I think this is an issue for the ECMAScript group

[21:38:00.0000] <heycam>
they don't seem interested in pushing ByteArray right at the moment

[21:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Web IDL should maybe trim back some of the more novel inventions

[21:38:02.0000] <heycam>
and i think we (the platform) need something like that soon

[21:38:03.0000] <slightlyoff>
they is us....I say we push it = )

[21:38:04.0000] <heycam>
othermaciej, sure, sometimes i think i get carried away with the novelties

[21:38:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I will try to do a review with an eye towards that soon

[21:39:00.0000] <heycam>
great thanks

[21:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: by "input table", I think Simon meant this:

[21:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#input-type-attr-summary

[21:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[21:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what to do about that

[21:53:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I don't see what can be done about it either

[21:53:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
no way to fit the width on a normal page

[21:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, I guess the headings could be shortened/abbreviated

[01:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: seen https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503632 yet?

[01:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
bug in bugzilla?

[01:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: sure, but I think it reveals a parser compat issue

[01:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
i get screwed up output in safari

[01:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hi everybody

[01:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan!

[01:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: did you see the XMLSerializer text/html issue yet?

[01:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: are you planning on working on a spec that covers XMLSerializer?

[01:08:04.0000] <zcorpan>
i haven't seen anything yet :)

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand what's going on here

[01:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
why is this breaking safari?

[01:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
the testcase works as it claims it should in safari

[01:09:03.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: dunno

[01:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh i guess there might be comments in the source or something?

[01:09:05.0000] <Hixie>
fundamentally, if we don't have reparsing, which we can't for security reasons, there's not much we can do as far as i can tell

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
we can't be perfectly backwards compatible with browsers that have the security bug

[01:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: there is. If you are not in escape

[01:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and

[01:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
without having that bug ourselves

[01:10:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you see ", you open an escape until " that prevents <!-- from starting an escape

[01:10:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: likewise for '

[01:10:06.0000] <Hixie>
say what?

[01:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
and what if there's a \' in the string?

[01:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
or if it's in a regexp?

[01:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
If you are parsing CDATA and you aren't in a <!-- escape, and you see ", start a new kind of escape until "

[01:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's ridiculously overly complicated

[01:11:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: true

[01:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: But I think we do need some restrictions on where a <!-- escape can start

[01:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: some approximation that prevents it from starting within a JS statement or a CSS property

[01:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i would much rather remove the entire cdata escaping mechanism nonsense, than try to handle this case.

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
especially given that as written, the spec actually handles this case in the authoring conformance criteria

[01:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
i blanch at the thought of explaining even more complicated rules

[01:14:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: whether that helps depends on how often this happens in the wild

[01:14:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and whether it appears on high-profile sites

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Do IE, Gecko, WebKit and Opera all parse back and forth in this case?

[01:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
standards land is a wacky wacky place

[01:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: what now?

[01:16:02.0000] <jgraham>
What is the point of the escaping test span stuff?

[01:16:03.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: which case is being discussed?

[01:16:04.0000] <othermaciej>
just everything about it

[01:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the point is that <!-- ... </script> ... --> should not end scripts

[01:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=500937

[01:17:02.0000] <zcorpan>
/me has 1182 unread emails

[01:17:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: oops. I answered the wrong question

[01:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503632

[01:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: does it?

[01:18:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Is that needed for compat?

[01:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: does it appear on high-profile sites? I don't know.

[01:18:04.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Welcome back :)

[01:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I believe <!-- ... </script> ... --> is required for compat

[01:19:01.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: thanks

[01:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I haven't researched it myself

[01:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i'd like to see how far we can go without having to support this case. given that bugzilla is already broken in safari because of it, i have optimism

[01:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
possibly misplaced optimism

[01:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
but optimism nonetheless!

[01:20:03.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: disabling <!-- in strings won't do much for web compat i think

[01:20:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: maybe we should make <!-- have the escaping effect only if it is preceded by:

[01:20:05.0000] <jgraham>
/me only has pessimism

[01:20:06.0000] <hsivonen>
1) only whitespace

[01:20:07.0000] <hsivonen>
or

[01:20:08.0000] <hsivonen>
2) // and then only whitespace

[01:20:09.0000] <hsivonen>
or

[01:20:10.0000] <hsivonen>
3) /* and then only whitespace

[01:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: there are pages that have <!-- at the end of scripts

[01:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: and they require the escaping effect?

[01:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Equivalent to the cases where ecmascript engines treat <!-- as the start of a comment

[01:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
whee! do we need to roll an ES parser into the HTML5 tokenizer?

[01:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: given the effects on conformance, i'd rather not make any changes unless it is deemed absolutely necessary for compat. (which isn't that high a bar, in practice)

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: (but is a high enough bar to slow us down here)

[01:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: See http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Web_ECMAScript#HTML_comments for the treatment of <!-- by ecmascript engines

[01:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
how hard it would be to make a small state machine that picks up regexp literals from within an EcmaScript program?

[01:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
with reasonable probability that is

[01:24:03.0000] <hsivonen>
not with 100% accuracy

[01:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is hopeful that you are overcomplicating this

[01:26:00.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, hsivonen, which existing browser requires that <!-- ... </script> ... --> doesn't end scripts? I just tested non-HTML5 parsing Minefield, Safari, and Opera, and they all close it

[01:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy_: make sure you have a trailing </script>

[01:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy_: so you don't get caught by the reparsing behaviour

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders who introduced this stuff into browsers in the first place

[01:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not that it matters anymore

[01:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, wow. Yeah, my original test was flawed.

[01:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's crazy

[01:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
probably Lou Montulli

[01:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or at least, I mentally blame him for anything that is terrible about browsers

[01:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: which browser is the "script-created parser" stuff and document.open() modeled on?

[01:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
a composite sketch of the various browsers

[01:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmmkay.

[01:39:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: you could have used window.name to store state across form submission in v.nu

[01:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: interesting. thanks

[01:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I *think* Gecko doesn't have the concept of a script-created parser

[01:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in the sense that you could find out later if a parser was script-created

[01:40:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should add that!

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can tell without a separate flag

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
by checking to see if the insertion mode is defined or not

[01:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
iirc

[01:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: they expect reparsing but only break in minor ways

[01:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
whether it's undefined or whether the nesting level is non-zero, maybe

[01:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
i forget

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh maybe also the encoding confidence being irrelevant is another way of telling if it's script-created or not

[01:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: my test for insertion point defined is a bit of a hack

[01:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
basically the only thing "script-created parser" matters for is whether d.o and d.c do anything

[01:43:03.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm. i now have 2046 unread emails :(

[01:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm a bit nervous about trusting that certain invariants hold so that I don't need a dedicated flag

[01:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[01:44:02.0000] <zcorpan>
/me considers reading the spam and deleting everything else

[01:44:03.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: How did the number increase? Did you unread some mail?

[01:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that's why i have a separate flag in the spec :-)

[01:44:05.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: opera didn't download it all at first

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: editorial: "not undefined" is not quite nice. "defined" is nicer

[02:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
defined means something different than not undefined in this context, sadly

[02:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
or can be interpreted differently, shall we say

[02:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[02:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hopes !mParser->IsInsertionPointDefined(key) does the right thing nonetheless

[02:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
well the point is that in the context of the spec, the insertion mode is always defined, it's just sometimes defined to have the value "undefined"

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you see what i mean

[02:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[02:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fwiw, in order to avoid refactoring the Gecko script execution code, my IsInsertionPointDefined() is quite detached from the spec

[02:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I hope it is black-box equivalent, though

[02:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in particular, I think it's quite easy to break it accidentally when implementing async scripts

[02:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do you happen to have a test suite for document.open() and insertion point?

[02:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
you might find some stuff on hixie.ch either under tests/adhoc/html/parsing or adhoc/dom/level0/ or something

[02:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno how correct it is though

[02:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok. thanks

[02:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the vague mention of form submission encoding in the non-UTF-8 case seems good enough for me

[02:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[02:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/level0/write/004.html doesn't have a pass condition, right?

[02:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ah. demos

[02:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me *always* misses the text at the bottom of the directory listing

[02:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah it's not very clear. and i don't always mark up which are demos anyway.

[02:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sayrer: you there?

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/level0/write/005.html just says Kittens! and doesn't stop loading

[02:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh noes. the failure to load is caused by my upcoming patch. :-(

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
is it supposed to lead?

[02:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
load

[02:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
(i didn't check the test)

[02:57:00.0000] <olliej>
hsivonen: i like the idea of a kittens only version myself

[02:57:01.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: maybe kittens and puppies rather than budgies?

[02:57:02.0000] <boblet>
hey all

[02:57:03.0000] <olliej>
/me doesn't particularly like budgies

[02:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it finishes loading in Gecko without my upcoming patch and in Safari and in Opera

[02:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I didn't test IE yet

[02:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so I assume it should finish loading!

[02:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
these tests are funny, the server is explicitly inserting pauses

[03:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not really sure why that test should finish loading

[03:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean... there's no EOF as far as I can tell

[03:01:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: timeout perhaps?

[03:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ooh! maybe my flush timer just sucks

[03:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
what if it was running in another frame and some other script poked more text into it?

[03:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
long after the timeout fired?

[03:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno

[03:01:05.0000] <Hixie>
these tests give me headaches

[03:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
me too. at least if I defer lunch due to them any longer

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on a completely different note, I think Theora.org should have a page that authors can link to in order to clue their users in on how to get a Theora-capable browsing setup

[03:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the page should be vendor-independent

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
currently pointing to Firefox 3.5 and XiphQT for Safari

[03:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and over time adding Opera 10.next and Chrome 3 as those ship

[03:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I think an association that I'm a member of might find such a page useful, since simply promoting one vendor wouldn't look right for the association)

[03:09:01.0000] <boblet>
A question regarding the header element; the content model is flow but no header or footer element descendants. That means it could contain a section, but the contained section couldn’t contain a header, right?

[03:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
right

[03:09:03.0000] <boblet>
So that means a complex page header (eg containing sections with headers) will need to be a section huh

[03:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
the nested section could contain <h1>s and <hgroup>s and such like

[03:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it couldn't contain its own <header>

[03:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you have an example of when that might make sense, though, let us know

[03:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
the idea of restricting it was we couldn't find any case where it made sense, and we found lots of cases where it didn't and we wanted to discourage people misusing it for those cases

[03:11:00.0000] <boblet>
hmm, ok. It does make sense, I just wanted to check I was understanding it

[03:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if what i specced about the origin of <img> elements in the case of redirects, data:, javascript:, etc, is true

[03:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
is the origin of <img> elements only relevant for <canvas>?

[03:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
or do we use it for anything else?

[03:57:00.0000] <boblet>
later all

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. in IE8, 005.html fails and gives an MS KB reference

[03:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
KB297917

[04:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
why don't I get to bail out and point to a KB article on hard stuff?

[04:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
did it give a url? i can't find that kb on the web

[04:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It didn't

[04:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Google found me a page in Polish

[04:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah me too

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Oops. my typo

[04:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
KB927917

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
it says it doesn't occur in IE8

[04:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Well, I got the number from IE8

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
was it in IE7 mode?

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
it explicitly says this was an IE7 bug fixed in IE8

[04:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it says <!DOCTYPE HTML>

[04:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
on that page

[04:04:04.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder when js libraries will implement sessionStorage with fallback to window.name

[04:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Browser Mode: IE8 Document Mode: IE8 Standards

[04:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: says IE8

[04:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[04:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: wouldn't be the first time MSDN isn't quite precise about IE behavior

[04:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
this is beyond "not quite precise"

[04:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
+  <p>Authors should not specify a <code

[04:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
+  title="attr-img-border">border</code> attribute on an

[04:13:02.0000] <zcorpan>
+  <code>img</code> element if its value is the string "<code

[04:13:03.0000] <zcorpan>
+  title="">0</code>".

[04:13:04.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: sounds like border="1" is fine

[04:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
i've fixed that already

[04:13:06.0000] <zcorpan>
oh

[04:13:07.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[04:13:08.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[04:13:09.0000] <Hixie>
i realised the same thing later when i was editing something else

[04:13:10.0000] <Hixie>
i was like, wait, wtf am i saying here

[04:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
it now reads:

[04:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
Authors should not specify a border attribute on an img element. If the attribute is present, its value must be the string "0". CSS should be used instead.

[04:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this is interesting: http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-July/020961.html

[04:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the bit about GStreamer

[04:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if they are going to end up plugging into system media frameworks + ensuring availability of an Ogg codec set

[04:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yeah, I was surprised he mentioned that publicly. We've known about it internally for a while.

[04:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the part that had me curious was "when using GStreamer" which implies it is used sometimes but not always

[04:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy is probably not free to comment on the matter (but if you are, feel free to enwisen us)

[04:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: could be for non-desktop Linux-based deployments

[04:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh, this is just great. I get different results inside and outside gdb

[04:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or I'm doing something wrong

[04:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
No, I'm just confused

[04:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm getting different results loading 005.html by navigating to it and loading it by session restore

[04:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, I haven't been informed about what exactly we can say about this, so I probably shouldn't reveal any more

[04:31:00.0000] <foolip>
it's been publically known that we use GStreamer internally since OVC

[04:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey, it's philipj

[04:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: thanks for all your feedback on the spec so far, it's been great

[04:32:02.0000] <foolip>
but certainly won't always, on embedded devices as such

[04:33:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie, and thank you for editing it :)

[04:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: what about Windows and Mac?

[04:34:00.0000] <foolip>
well... what specifically about them?

[04:35:00.0000] <foolip>
how do we guarantee support for our "baseline"?

[04:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: presumably Windows and Mac don't use GStreamer, so what will they use?

[04:36:00.0000] <foolip>
we'll bundle the decoders we need

[04:36:01.0000] <foolip>
if that's DirectShow decoders, internal decoders or something else I'm quite sure I shouldn't say yet

[04:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: I see

[04:37:00.0000] <foolip>
as I mentioned at OVC we've tried doing DirectShow, it kind of works, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone

[04:39:00.0000] <foolip>
the primary reason to use GStreamer on UNIX is to not have to handle the 10^10 different audio output API:s, not because it can decode theora/vorbis

[04:41:00.0000] <foolip>
anyway, rest assured that we won't simply use the platform framework in all instances, that way it's impossible (very hard) to get consistent behavior of even the simplest stuff

[04:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in 005.html, the first document.write should fire when insertion point is not defined, because the act of inserting a script-created script element with src causes the script to run only when src has loaded, right?

[04:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so the script shouldn't be running at the appendChild stage anyway?

[04:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I think my insertion point hack might not be handling all event loop interleavings right

[04:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
aaargh

[04:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
basically, it seems that I get the wrong results when I think the next script that going to be run from the event loop is one whose load is parser-requested, but a script-inserted script gets run from the event loop

[04:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if it's even possible to get the insertion point stuff right without refactoring how Gecko loads an runs external scripts

[05:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if it happens that the code I now have is correct per spec, the behavior I get doesn't match any shipped browser

[05:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not sure what I've done exactly

[05:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I get confused by which document JS 'document' points to after document.open()

[05:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
specifically, if a script was created by parser 1, then an implied document.open() happened that blew the parser away and then the parser-created script does document.write() I'm not sure if I got insertion points right

[05:08:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me agrees with roc about (new Audio()).autobuffer

[05:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if the parser that created a script was aborted by document.open() and then the script does document.write(), where should it write?

[05:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: into the new script-created parser whose insertion point is always defined?

[05:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
i want to say yes

[05:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i'm too tired to stand by that yes with the full force of my convictions

[05:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I see

[05:10:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I'm going to hack on the validator for the rest of the day and sleep on document.write

[05:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it would be awesome to have expected results for 005.html

[05:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not 100% sure on what your earlier question means, but it will probably make more sense when i awake in about 10 hours

[05:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
send me an e-mail asking me to update the tests

[05:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
and i'll try to do it

[05:11:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: OK

[05:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Gecko distinguishes between the HTML5 pending external script concept and script-created external scripts spinning the event loop while waiting for the network to do its thing

[05:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: does prince support css transforms?

[05:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[05:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
howcome would know

[05:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok now i must sleep

[07:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ooooh

[07:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me reads the news about the xhtml2 wg

[07:37:00.0000] <takkaria>
you did have a lot of mail ^_^

[07:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder why http://www.w3.org/2009/06/xhtml-faq.html doesn't mention microdata or ?style=author

[07:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: the spec should use <hgroup>

[07:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, is today the first time you heard about the XHTML2 being discontinued?

[07:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: yeah, i've been on vacation

[07:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[07:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: So when are you going to become the HTML5 test czar?

[07:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders if you missed any other big news for the past few weeks

[07:57:02.0000] <zcorpan>
http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http%3A%2F%2Fw3.org - now with alt="" support!

[07:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: likely, i still have 1700 unread emails

[07:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: We came surprisngly close to something that may yet lead to consensus on the @summary issue

[07:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, we did?!

[07:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Anolis does different stuff with img in the TOC)

[07:59:02.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: it's hard to say.  I might get round to looking at it around the end of August, I suppose

[08:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, yeah, but I was also thinking about major world news stuff too. Though I'm going to assume you haven't been completely cut off from civilisation.

[08:01:00.0000] <takkaria>
the world news can be summed up mostly as "the world is still going to shit, some good things happened too"

[08:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: The use of should not rather than an implied must not and specific advice about how to do better seemed to bring us closer to agreement than we have been at any point so far, although I may be misreading the situation

[08:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I thought the change that made summary conforming but obsolete would make people happy, but there are still a lot of people sustaining their objections

[08:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
(even though that particular change made me unhappy, I can live with it if I have to)

[08:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, I don't remember anything good happening recently

[08:08:00.0000] <takkaria>
someone did a cool bike stunt in London the other night

[08:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: good things happening recently: dhyatt starting working on a datagrid implementation for Webkit, Chrome team started on Web Sockets implementation, and there's also a Web Sockets patch for Mozilla that's received some review

[08:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh, and Mozilla has hashchange support now too

[08:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, got a link to a video?

[08:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, cool. I didn't know that.

[08:12:00.0000] <takkaria>
Lachy: Lachy http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8147714.stm

[08:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow

[08:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Got a link that doesn't need Flashy?

[08:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
*Flash

[08:16:01.0000] <takkaria>
no

[08:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
from the more bad news desk http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/07/13/1330220/NASA-Plans-to-De-Orbit-ISS-in-2016?from=rss

[08:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: That hardly counts as bad news. ISS has been a total disaster

[08:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders when it's meant to be completed

[08:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Well it was /meant/ to be completed years ago

[08:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I mean the current meaning. :P

[08:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: I was actually thinking about the html5 testsuite the other day.  I guess it would be useful to have it in place by October for LC, and I should have time and energy before then to sort it out

[08:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, in what way?

[08:21:02.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: someone else can always do it, though. :)

[08:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: It has taken forever, cost far more money than it was supposed to and done no useful science (whilst taking money that could otherwise be used for science projects)

[08:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: i guess i was more exposed to world news during my vacation compared to when i work

[08:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: s/science projects/useful science projects/ I assume you mean as it has done some, just not useful ones.

[08:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think it has done some stuff like "lets do some experiments designed by schoolkids about growing crystals in space"

[08:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
It may even have done the odd actually valuable thing. But a lot of stuff that was designed to work with the ISS had to be abandoned or reworked as independant missions

[08:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
So per unit currency it has been an epic failure for science

[08:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, that depends if you consider experiments like this to be useful or not. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaHLwla2WiI In any case, it's pretty cool;

[08:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: That hardly needs a space station to do, just something in freefall

[08:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
A plane in freefall would work as a container for that

[08:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not even convinced that it has taught us anything useful about going into space aprt from maybe "don't do it like this"

[08:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
It has ushered in an era of International cooperation!

[08:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But Mongolia isn't involved!

[08:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, the Zero G company that does flights like that only last about 30 seconds each time, which isn't much for doing experiments.

[08:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: It depends what experiment you want to do :)

[08:30:03.0000] <Phae>
those Zero G experiences are expensive. i was looking them up just the other day.

[08:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
Phae, how much are they?

[08:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
To the extent that that counts as a science experiment it could be done on the shuttle or something

[08:32:00.0000] <Phae>
well, once you've got there... http://www.elite-expeditions.co.uk/zgbook.htm

[08:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
Phae: Probably cheaper than the ISS, though :-)

[08:32:02.0000] <Phae>
sure

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, they even charge $195 for the non-flyer package. https://www.gozerog.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=reservations.welcome

[08:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Phae: When NASA owns both such things and the shuttle, I'm sure they'd say it was cheaper in terms of operation costs :)

[08:34:02.0000] <Phae>
aye

[08:35:00.0000] <Phae>
it would be ace, but it's a pretty expensive rollercoaster like experience, i imagine :)

[08:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Phae: I doubt rollercoasters let you fall vertically without being attached to anything at 9.81 m/s :)

[08:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder why they cost so much. They're just flying a modified Boeing 727, and surely they aren't that costly to operate

[08:36:01.0000] <Phae>
yeah, but for such a short period of time

[08:36:02.0000] <Phae>
by the time you got the hang of it, you'd be onthe floor again

[08:36:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Probably insurance, as flying vertically down is somewhat dangerous. Then you have supply/demand.

[08:37:00.0000] <Phae>
and there's not a competitive enough number of operators, probably

[08:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think they're the only commercial operators of such flights

[08:37:02.0000] <Phae>
well, there you go

[08:37:03.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: They might well be quite costly to operate given the number of passengers, but it is more about market economics 

[08:37:04.0000] <jgraham>
I was surprised at how cheap they are

[08:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, cheap?!

[08:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Likewise

[08:38:02.0000] <jgraham>
(for the record ISS cost something like 100 billion euros over its lifetime)

[08:38:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: They could quite easily charge 5 times what they do. You get a whole 727 between around 10–15 people or so I guess

[08:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: And provided they are the only supplier, there is a fair amount of demand, so I expect they could charge more.

[08:40:00.0000] <Phae>
but still, would you spend �2500 to be weightless for 30 seconds, 15 times?

[08:40:01.0000] <Phae>
that's what makes it expensive or not

[08:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
If I liked that sort of thing and had the cash, sure

[08:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
It's aimed at people with substantial disposable income

[08:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
not at people who go to butlins

[08:41:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Phae: I don't particularly have much interest in it.

[08:41:04.0000] <Phae>
yeah, so to those people it's cheap

[08:42:00.0000] <Phae>
if you think you ened to have substantial disposable income to make it worthwhile, ti's not cheap :P

[08:42:01.0000] <Phae>
it's*

[08:42:02.0000] <Phae>
need* ugh.

[08:42:03.0000] <takkaria>
it sounds like one of those things that if you had a lot of money just lying around, you might as well do, really

[08:42:04.0000] <Phae>
sure

[08:42:05.0000] <Phae>
i would if i did

[08:42:06.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, what is "butlins"?

[08:42:07.0000] <Phae>
haha

[08:42:08.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks behind his sofa

[08:43:00.0000] <Phae>
butlins is like, cheesy family vacation place. think cold, bored, brits in seaside resorts

[08:43:01.0000] <takkaria>
also used for festivals sometimes

[08:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Mainly used by those who cannot afford to go abroad, as far as I can tell.

Oh, it was already posted to the list

[11:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
from a quick glance, it seems they're ignoring all the concerns over namespaces, prefixes, CURIEs, etc. Oh well.

[11:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
although, they have notes about it. So maybe they will do something about it

[12:08:00.0000] <hober>
could someone with wiki admin privleges delete http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Hafez

[12:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[12:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
done

[12:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
hober, do you have a wiki account?

gsnedders: I just pushed something to html5lib that might make the not putting of html elements in a namespace work

[13:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
Needs tests though

[13:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Well seeming I'll probably soon move on to making Anolis work with the namespaces (so it works with XHTML too), I'm not entirely sure how relevant it is :)

[14:13:00.0000] <gmiernicki>
oi... anyone know if localStorage is accessible via web workers?

[14:14:00.0000] <gmiernicki>
ive been reading through the forum threads, and got quite confused as most discussions pertain the the browser implementations

[14:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: There's no pleasing some people

[14:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: No, there isn't.

[15:16:00.0000] <gmiernicki>
there's no helping people it seems either, sometimes

[15:16:01.0000] <gmiernicki>
back to google i suppose...

[15:25:00.0000] <Spark^>
I need to use a more recent version of html5lib for python than 0.11 as I'm getting infinite recursion problems. Can anyone suggest what reasonably stable version I should check out as the trunk (or the mercurial equivalent term) gives me other errors.

[15:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Spark^: Before jgraham started merging stuff around a month ago.

[15:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Spark^: 759c5bd902 is what I use in places

[15:30:00.0000] <Spark^>
nothing like me dropping in at the deep end! i like the visualisation of branches in google code, but haven't a clue how i check out a particular revision!

[15:32:00.0000] <Spark^>
will hg update 759c5bd902

[15:32:01.0000] <Spark^>
do it?

[15:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
You probably want "-r 759etc"

[15:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I don't know if you want "update" or not

[15:35:00.0000] <Spark^>
hmmm, i guess 'invalid syntax' on "byte-compiling build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/html5lib/treewalkers/_base.py to _base.pyc isn't good" :(

[15:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: update or up

[15:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Spark^: What version of Python?

[15:36:02.0000] <Spark^>
2.5

[15:36:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Can I shrug my shoulders and go to bed?

[15:37:00.0000] <Spark^>
i should do the same. you've got me a lot further on, so thanks for your help.

[15:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That rev worked today for me

[15:38:01.0000] <Spark^>
if i could drive google's thingy to show me changes to that file i'd maybe be able to select a revision close by

[15:38:02.0000] <Spark^>
probably something stupid i'm doing

[15:38:03.0000] <Spark^>
like, i'm not 100% sure that update or pull worked

[16:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, I just read through that RDFa in HTML draft, and there are so many issues with it

[16:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
from the last paragraph: "Since CURIE prefix mappings have been specified using xmlns:, and since HTML attribute names are case-insensitive, CURIE prefix names declared using the xmlns:attribute-name pattern xmlns:<PREFIX>="<URI>" should be specified using only lower-case characters. For example, the text "xmlns:" and the text in "<PREFIX>" should be lower-case only. This is to ensure that prefix mappings are interpreted in the same way between HTML (case

[16:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
-insensitive attribute names) and XHTML (case-sensitive attribute names) document types."

[16:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
that seems to indicate that there are some unspecified problems when using uppercase, but says nothing about how to handle it. Though, presumably, it doesn't really matter, since the parser lowercases them anyway, and it's only a problem if you are making a polyglot document

[16:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's not really clear if that's what it means though

[16:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
"If an author is unsure of the final encapsulating DOCTYPE for their markup..." -- what the?

[16:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to understand what happened to the "URLs" stuff in http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-duerst-iri-bis

[16:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
did larry just make invalid URIs conforming?

[16:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused

[16:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
man in that algorithm has gotten seriously corrupted since it was in html5

[16:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
and there are entire sections missing now

[16:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
sigh

[16:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me adds it to his list of things to e-mail about

[16:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
that mail from Larry doesn't have a link to the draft. Where can I find it?

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just posted it

[16:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[16:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh. I didn't read that far back, that's a whole 8 messages back


2009-07-14
[17:01:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: any comment on https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26925 ? I'm going to fix it soon, if it's ok spec-wise

[17:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
ap: commented. btw can you fix http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/offline/004.html also?

[17:17:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: what's the problem with that one? I don't see a distinctive FAIL in Safari 4.0.1 on Mac

[17:17:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: btw, the question was not about parsing manifests

[17:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you open it three time, it'll fail in one of the windows

[17:17:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: e.g. you go to http://server/app.html#foo, and then to http://server/app.html#bar

[17:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[17:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
huh

[17:18:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: alternatively, you can have manifest#foo in manifest attribute

[17:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah that's a bug, drop an e-mail? it can just be a link to the bug

[17:20:00.0000] <StationsPatient>
aloha, is there a simple way to replace html entities with html5lib in python?

[18:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
i swear half the people in the acknowledgements are there because they pointed out that i'd misspelt occurred.

[18:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
how embarassing

[18:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: you should color-code the acknowledgements and do the tag-cloud thing with names in various point sizes

[18:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or even different fonts

[18:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
comic sans, etc.

[18:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[18:57:00.0000] <nessy>
lol

[19:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anybody know if gecko has a Server-Sent Events implementation?

[19:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me finds https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338583

[19:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: yt?

[19:13:02.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, yep

[19:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#es-unsigned-long

[19:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: do you know of any way to prove that implementations are actually using ToUint32() here?

[19:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
rather than ToInt32() followed by clamping?

[19:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me notices Wellington Fernando de Macedo is same developer who's working on the WebSocket implementation

[19:14:01.0000] <heycam>
clamping how

[19:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
setting any value < 0 to 0 or something

[19:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to work out which attributes are _really_ long and which are _really_ unsigned long

[19:15:00.0000] <heycam>
apart from testing each one individually to see what happens when you assign or call with a negative number...

[19:16:00.0000] <heycam>
i guess for some it's not going to be possible to tell

[19:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
so, if they really do use ToUint32(), and i set them to -1, their value should be some non-zero positive number right?

[19:18:01.0000] <heycam>
right

[19:18:02.0000] <heycam>
2**32 - 1 i think

[19:19:00.0000] <heycam>
hard ones to test would be e.g. HTMLOptionsCollection.length

[19:19:01.0000] <heycam>
you're likely to run in to memory limits i'd guess

[19:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
holy crap, found one -- safari <input size> really works like that

[19:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries IE

[19:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
interesting, IE throws an exception for numbers < 0

[19:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
or ignores it

[19:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
sorry, clamps, not ignores

[19:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: how would you feel about changing that algorithm to use ToInt32() and then convert numbers less than 0 to 0 instead of using TUint32?

[19:28:00.0000] <heycam>
if you can show that that's the common behaviour, sure

[19:28:01.0000] <heycam>
i think i wrote it that way for consistency with how unsigned integers are handled by ES built in functions, can't remember if i did any/much testing

[19:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[19:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
will write tests

[19:36:00.0000] <heycam>
great

[19:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie, heycam: what we do in many places is convert ToInteger() (to get an integral floating point number) and then filter out NaN and out of range values

[19:41:00.0000] <heycam>
it would be nice if the conversion behaviour were consistent across all uses of unsigned long / unsigned short

[19:41:01.0000] <heycam>
othermaciej, do you know if different conversion behaviours for different attributes/operations is needed for compatibility?

[19:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: no idea, we never thoroughly researched this

[19:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I'm wrong, it looks like we use toInt32 for everything, which seems wrong to me

[19:47:00.0000] <heycam>
so infinity/nans get treated as 0

[19:47:01.0000] <heycam>
?

[19:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/webidl/attributes/001.html

[19:55:00.0000] <heycam>
interesting

[19:55:01.0000] <heycam>
so did you find any impls that do ToUint32?

[19:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
webkit for <input size>

[19:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
but that's it

[19:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
however, they all do random other things

[19:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's no consistency that i've found

[19:56:02.0000] <heycam>
i wonder what it's like for methods that take unsigned longs

[19:56:03.0000] <heycam>
there might be more consistency there

[19:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
well so it turns out that html5 is all self-contradictory about 'long' attributes 

[19:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is why i'm worried about those

[19:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. it says various contradictory things about what reflects what

[19:58:00.0000] <heycam>
in terms of whether the reflected properties should clamp or whatever?

[19:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think i may convert everything to signed longs

[19:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[19:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
it also contradicts itself on how to parse some of the attributes

[19:59:00.0000] <heycam>
at least if they're signed longs then you can define the conversion for negative values

[19:59:01.0000] <heycam>
(if you don't care about values >= 2**31)

[20:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[20:01:00.0000] <heycam>
otoh unsigned longs seem "nicer" in some way

[20:01:01.0000] <heycam>
in that it would better describe the set of allowed values

[20:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[20:02:00.0000] <heycam>
if it's safe to make all of these convert in the same way, then i'd rather they be unsigned long and to define the conversion in webidl to be whatever way is decided

[20:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
that is definitely ok by me

[20:02:02.0000] <heycam>
the "if it's safe" i don't know about.  if they're all doing random other things...

[20:03:00.0000] <heycam>
i think something other than ToUint32 would be good

[20:03:01.0000] <heycam>
since it's not exactly intuitive

[20:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
well right now IE either throws or clamps to zero

[20:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
i vote for "clamps to zero"

[20:03:04.0000] <heycam>
and how about for NaN, Infinity, non-Numbers?

[20:04:00.0000] <heycam>
and non-integer numbers

[20:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
ToInt32() then clamp to zero

[20:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
they do all do TInt32() first when they don't throw

[20:05:00.0000] <heycam>
ok.  so we'll never care about values >= 2**31?

[20:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
not for these i don't think

[20:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't tested if they handle big values

[20:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
but we can always do a TInt64 then clamp on both ends if necessary

[20:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
ToInt64

[20:06:02.0000] <heycam>
testing for big values would be good

[20:06:03.0000] <heycam>
if it doesn't break the test

[20:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/webidl/attributes/002.html

[20:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
results are all over the place

[20:18:00.0000] <heycam>
there's a "defaults to zero" that should be "defaults to one" in the script

[20:19:00.0000] <heycam>
if they're all over the place, i would like "supports big numbers" to be the one we choose

[20:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
fine by me

[20:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what does "supports big numbers" mean?

[20:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
bigger than 32-bit?

[20:22:02.0000] <heycam>
bigger than 31-bit

[20:22:03.0000] <heycam>
well, numbers that are in an unsigned 32-bit int that aren't in a signed one

[20:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so it means "unsigned 32-bit" then?

[20:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
it means that the conversion from Number doesn't clamp past 2**31

[20:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
(test 002 isn't testing signed vs unsigned)

[20:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
(test 001 does that)

[20:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: do you want mail on this?

[20:25:00.0000] <heycam>
yep that'd be good thanks

[20:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
do you have a test for whether conversion clamps at 2^32?

[20:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
no, but i'll add one

[20:25:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(also, I should add, a possible weird browser behavior is to wrap around instead of clamping at whatever the limit is; hopefully no browser actually does that)

[20:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh some do

[20:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
one also just converts 4294967290 to -2**31

[20:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
in certain cases

[20:28:00.0000] <heycam>
the wrapping around is what is in webidl currently :)

[20:28:01.0000] <heycam>
due to the use of ToUint32

[20:28:02.0000] <heycam>
ToInt32 would do that too, mind

[20:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
most browsers wrap around due to the use of ToInt32() at least in some cases

[20:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
webkit does it the most

[20:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok nobody seems to support >2**32

[20:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, at one point for WebKit we had the idea of using a different, non-wrapping conversion for signed values

[20:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or for unsigned, whatever

[20:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
IE is strangely inconsistent on this

[20:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
like they have different code for each attribute

[20:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
and it gets copied and pasted around with different changes accumulating

[20:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
basically round the floating point double to the nearest integer (in the mathematical sense, not necessarily machine int), then clamp to boundaries and clean up non-finite values, then convert to appropriate machine type

[20:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
that seems like what webidl should say, imho

[20:35:00.0000] <heycam>
would cleaning up non-finite values be setting to 0?  or, say, make +Infinity into the largest value in the set?

[20:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
actually it should probably truncate or floor rather than round to nearest

[20:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but you get the idea

[20:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would guess NaN should go to 0 and +/- Infinity to min/max values in the range

[20:37:00.0000] <heycam>
/me brb lunch

[20:37:01.0000] <heycam>
that sounds reasonable btw

[20:38:00.0000] <Hixie>

[20:51:00.0000] <shepazu>
is anything being done about javascript's inability to round?

[20:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
inability to round?

[20:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
you mean the way it doesn't follow IEEE rules for rounding?

[20:54:01.0000] <shepazu>
when trying to round to particular significant digits (like $4,308,543.23, or such), you sometimes get rounding errors

[20:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
you mean using toFixed()? or something else...?

[20:56:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: I should come up with a specific example... I kept running into it when I was doing financial planning software, a while back... I will need to look back at my notes before I can speak intelligently on it

[20:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[20:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh you might mean the normal base-2 behaviour of floats

[20:56:03.0000] <shepazu>
of course, there are several IEEE rounding rules

[20:57:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: I might mean that, I'll have to figure out what you mean :)

[20:59:00.0000] <shepazu>

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273371/real-vs-floating-point-vs-money

[20:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
the ES group was looking at fixing that

[20:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
dunno if they did or not

[21:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
(the problem fundamentally isn't JS, it's that you shouldn't use binary floating point numbers for fixed-point maths)

[21:01:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie, yes, that's the very problem.

[21:01:01.0000] <shepazu>
right, but I just want a solution :)

[21:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
use integers

[21:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
and divide by 100 everywhere

[21:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
or 1000, or whatever accuracy you need

[21:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
s/everywhere/for display/

[21:02:01.0000] <shepazu>
doesn't always work, if you don't know that accuracy you need

[21:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
(that's basically all that a decimal type would do)

[21:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
why wouldn't you know the accuracy you ned?

[21:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
need

[21:02:05.0000] <shepazu>
honestly, I should look back at it... I don't recall if I finally found a solution that worked

[21:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ECMAScript does follow IEEE rounding rules

[21:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there is an ongoing proposal to add a decimal floating point type to ECMAScript

[21:27:00.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: ok, thanks

[22:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: for Math.round() it seems to not use the even-up odd-down rule (or whatever the rule is, i forget the details) but to just go towards the appropriate signed infinity

[22:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
(document.all == undefined) && (undefined == undefined) && (document.all != document.all)

[22:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
true or false?

[22:36:00.0000] <gavin_>
true

[22:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
why? :-)

[22:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
and in what browsers?

[22:38:00.0000] <gavin_>
because that's what Gecko returns and I'm horribly biased ;)

[22:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
biased returns false

[22:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
er

[22:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
gecko even

[22:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
returns false

[22:39:01.0000] <gavin_>
not my gecko

[22:39:02.0000] <gavin_>
huh, trunk differs from 3.5.x

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090709 Minefield/3.6a1pre

[22:39:04.0000] <Hixie>

[22:39:05.0000] <gavin_>
3.5.x returns true

[22:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
that's ancient history :-)

[22:39:07.0000] <Hixie>
but that's weird

[22:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
why would this change

[22:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
and why would it ever return true?!

[22:40:02.0000] <gavin_>
I bet it's peterv's fault

[22:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
in Safari, it's surprisingly true that document.all != document.all

[22:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have no idea why

[22:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
probably a bug with the ==undefined magic

[22:41:02.0000] <gavin_>
(I suspect https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482788 changed that behavior)

[22:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
document.all == document.all is false

[22:57:00.0000] <ukai>
i'm wondering we call "Web Socket", "WebSocket", "web socket" or "web sockets"...  cf. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27206

[22:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
"Web Socket" is the name of the technology, WebSocket is the name of the interface, and the other two are informal.

[22:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually "Web Sockets" is the name of the technology, iirc

[22:58:02.0000] <ukai>
what is the difference between "Web Socket" and "Web Sockets" ?

[22:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
one is singular and one is plural :-)

[22:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like i used the plural for the API and the singular for the protocol

[23:00:00.0000] <ukai>
hmm, which configuration flag name do you recommend to enable the technology?

[23:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[23:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't matter :-)

[23:01:02.0000] <ukai>
ok :-)

[23:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ukai: I think when speaking about the feature, people just sort of naturally tend to call it "Web Sockets" (plural, with a space)

[23:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
like saying, "Server Sent Events" or whatever

[23:04:02.0000] <ukai>
ok, i'll use "Web Sockets"

[23:04:03.0000] <ukai>
thanks!

[23:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ukai: btw, I'm really looking forward to seeing what you guys get done

[23:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean on the Web Sockets work you're doing

[23:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
楽しみに

[23:06:01.0000] <ukai>
you can find the work-in-progress code on http://codereview.chromium.org/155079

[23:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh cool

[23:06:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks man

[01:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: did you intend to allow spaces in itemprops?

[02:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok, seriously? draconian parsing mode for text/html?

[02:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I can't believe this is an idea that more than one person sees favorably

[02:29:00.0000] <takkaria>
arrgj

[02:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
that's terrible

[02:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
can't someone just lobby their favourite browsers to include hsivonen's validator or something?

[02:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or, if you want draconian parsing in every browser likely to implement HTML5 within a decade, use XML

[02:38:01.0000] <takkaria>
that works too

[02:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems like a silly idea but I assume that from the pov of the spec it would be rather simple; it would force the parser into "bail on first parse error" mode

[02:40:00.0000] <takkaria>
aye

[02:40:01.0000] <takkaria>
it does seem to be the kind of thing that should a browser toggle for authors, rather than an author toggle for users

[02:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed'

[02:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And then someone will use strict mode, develop with a current browser, try it with a more up to date browser, and find it breaks and blame the new browser.

[02:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
I thought everyone agreed that the "important financial transation" argument was bunkum

[02:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
r3401 does not affect validators?

[02:44:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=3400&to=3401

[02:44:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ↑

[02:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: It doesn't because the definition of what is valid is above that, and you don't care about parsing rules.

[03:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: does it require new error messages?

[03:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen, gsnedders - I wasn't sure if that part of the spec related to integer datatype-checking or not

[03:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: could not Web Socket protocol just use port 80?

[03:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: In the context of XML in general, or HTML specifically?

[03:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe people will start performing financial transactions over Twitter, and if its response page aborts in the middle of a transaction tweet then you'll be wishing HTML had draconian error handling

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: hehe. Mr. Safe turns to Twitter

[03:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Mr Safe?

[03:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Mr.+Safe%22+site%3Atbray.org

[03:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: In any context. If you care about errors introduced during transmission, sign the message. If you care about the server sending a complete message add application-specific checking of the message that goes well beyond XML-well-formedness

[03:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
(in general if you don't trust the server code you have lost anyway afaict because a server that has a bug leading it to cut off a message like <amount>1234</amount> could just as well have a bug that led it to produce <amount>12345</amount>

[03:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
)

[03:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: What if you care about errors introduced during serialisation (e.g. running out of buffer space and truncating the message), after you've validated the application data and before you've done any transmission?

[03:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, I suppose you do something like compute a checksum of the application data (not of the serialisation) and then transmit and check that

[03:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
For example

[03:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Plus make those errors fatal on the server

[03:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
"someone will use strict mode, develop with a current browser, try it with a more up to date browser, and find it breaks and blame the new browser." - it sounds like the proposal is that someone will copy-and-paste parsing=strict from wherever, develop in the latest version of IE (which doesn't support the feature), and then their users use a browser in which it fails "in-[their]-face"

[03:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
so you don't even need to worry about browsers changing over time, because nobody expects IE to ever implement it anyway

[03:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if I should reply to the strict mode thread

[03:41:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
I don't think I have anything to add to the strict mode thread except http://tinyurl.com/d5gs7f

[03:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. someone made a Java impl of the public suffix list stuff but chose to offer it under a GPL-incompatible license

[03:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
even though it's a port of a C++ implementation that was GPL-compatible

[03:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Could you ask them to change the license?

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I suppose I could

[03:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
<html parsing=strict parsing=loose> - I wonder if that would be a fatal error

[03:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me supposes it can't be implemented properly without reparsing anyway

[03:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I assume we would have no reparsing and just use whatever the defined attribute precedence is if it is declared multiple times on the same element

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I agree with your assessment

[03:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: But is the error fatal if it occurs after the fatality attribute has been parsed but before the element with the fatality attribute has been emitted?

[03:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually, I suppose you could just keep a pointer to the first parse error and then fatalise it once you've found the fatality indicator

[04:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i'd like a plain text version of html5. useful when you want to find something quickly

[04:00:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: like http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/html40.txt

[04:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: links -dump or something like that?

[04:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
or lynx or whatever it is

[04:01:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: yeah

[04:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: http://gsnedders.html5.org/html5.txt

[04:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: is it always up to date?

[04:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: No, I could set up a cron job to do it though

[04:06:01.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: thanks!

[04:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
22013 links

[04:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe the internal links are a bit useless to print out

[04:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: OK, I set up cron to update it every day now

[04:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: thanks

[04:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Needs charset

[04:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Does it? What?

[04:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: There's non-ASCII characters like © in html5.txt but no charset specified

[04:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
&#50980;&#49437;&#52268; (Channy Yun)

[04:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I saw that.

[04:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess the problem is at the Lynx end

[04:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Where is DanC's web addresses draft?

[04:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/href/draft.html is the latest?

[04:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
It would be nice to get the text in wikipedia-style or markdown format instead

[04:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
http://milianw.de/projects/markdownify/

[04:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: There is also http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/html2text/ although I don't reccommend trying the online service with the HTML 5 spec

[04:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems like it shouldn't be so difficult to implement such a tool based on html5lib but I don't have time, of course

[04:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
w3mmee

[04:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: might it be conceivable that sometime soon you could have bandwidth for speccing DOMParser and XMLSerializer?

[04:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: dunno

[05:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't imagine that speccing them would take very long

[05:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder if someone is willing to take over editing of web dom core

[05:04:01.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe someone from mozilla or apple

[05:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: if we could find someone willing to do that, would you be willing to commit to writing up domparser and xmlserializer?

[05:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: maybe :)

[05:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[05:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wouldn't be entirely against doing it himself

[05:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I kinda want to spec XMLSerializer and DOMParser, but I expect not to have the bandwidth for the next 6 months even if I otherwise got an OK on doing it

[05:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Why doesn't HTML5's rendering section touch on framespacing?

[05:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: i think because gecko and webkit ignore it

http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/167

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: one of the permitted but obsolete doctypes triggers the quirks mode in Mac IE 5. Do you not care?

[05:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's the one used on ln.hixie.ch :-)

[06:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, Mac IE 5 has been obsolete for years. It's just as irrelevant now as Netscape 4.

[06:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I guess it's OK. After all, <!DOCTYPE html> triggers the quirks mode in Netscape 6.0

[06:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
wow, I didn't know that

[06:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Um, Netscape 6 was irrelevant when it was current wasn't it? ;)

[06:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/ :-)

[06:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/168 should produce a U+FFFD element, right?

[06:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, no, Netscape 6 was relevant for a short period around 2002/03 (whenever it was released)

[06:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
or maybe it was 2001. I can't remember. But I know I used it while I was at Uni.

[06:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
"relevant" in the sense that it often hung before crashing whereas sometimes it just crashed (I used it too)

[06:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: don't speak ill of the dead

[06:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: They're dead, what will they do about it?

[06:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
;)

[06:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, relevant in the sense that it was one of the few decent alternatives available during the early years of IE6's monopoly.

[06:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
(obviously the work that went in to Netscape 6 eventually led to something rather good. But that release was way way too early)

[06:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Am I right in thinking Fx 3.6 (with HTML5 parser) trims data at U+0000 (and inserts a U+FFFD at the end)?

[06:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
and by "decent", I mean "available and not IE"

[06:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: IE5/Mac was decent and was IE :P

[06:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, IE5/Mac wasn't available on Windows

[06:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, are you planning to report HTML5 parse errors through Minefield's error console?

[06:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
Is that possible to do?

[06:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: yes, eventually, if it doesn't poison perf and if someone else doesn't override me

[06:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
cool

[06:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, will that involve just parse errors, or will it effectively incorporate the HTML5 validator, and report, e.g., content model errors too?

[06:31:01.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: no, the parser can't create elements that start with U+FFFD

[06:31:02.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: will be a text node

[06:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: It's extremely unlikely to get content model errors from C++ code in Gecko

[06:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I encourage people to port the above-parser layer of V.nu to JS & Firebug, though

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: also, it's extremely unlikely that Gecko would whine about per-character parse errors like non-characters

[06:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: ah, k

[06:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Because of perf?

[06:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: yes

[06:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
would anyone want to suggest wording for the normative warning on @summary?

[06:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I suggest ""

[06:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I can have a go if you like

[06:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me puts on fair ground accent, "Come on! Have a go!"

what about border='0'. "Hixie wants YOU to use CSS."? :-)

[06:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: s/to use CSS.//

[06:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Maybe keep it in small type, actually

[06:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hmm. It's hard to come up with credible warnings for these.

[06:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"id is a more fashionable attribute than name." maybe?

[06:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. actually, that one is easier 

[06:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
something like "Consider putting an id attribute on the nearest container instead of using <a name>

[06:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: For name just say "Warning: the name attribute on a elements is obsolete. The id attribute should be used to serve the same purpose"

[06:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
"Consider summarising the purpose and structure of the table in the prose surrounding the table, rather than using the summary attribute, to make it available to more people who might find it useful."

[06:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: For border, wouldn't it make sense to say that it becomes messy if you want to style other parts of the table with CSS?

[06:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
Correction: "Consider summarising the purpose and structure of the table in the surrounding prose, rather than using the summary attribute, to make it available to more people who might find it useful."

[06:55:03.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: For summary maybe something like "Warning: the summary attribute on tables is obsolete. Authours should instead provide information about the structure of complex tables in a <caption> element or in the surrounding prose usis aria to associate the description with the table (more...)"

[06:55:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: border=0 is for <img>

[06:56:04.0000] <Lachy>
"Consider specifying <code>a img, img[usemap] { border: 0; } in CSS instead"

[06:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: "Removing the image border in CSS means you don't have to think about it the next time you add an image" :)

[06:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
why can't Firefox and IE just remove that hideous border by default?

[06:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Then how will you know if you've visited the image link before? :)

[06:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should try writing a patch for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=452915

[07:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I wonder if the rendering section covers this now

[07:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: did you intend to make space characters in the name attribute conforming but obsolete?

[07:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
weren't spaces in name a problem?

[08:27:00.0000] <takkaria>
strict parsing specified in CSS?  what?

[08:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think we should have <script>document.enableStrictParsing(true)</script>

[08:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
document.write already means there's coupling between the parser and the script engine, so it's a natural place to put it

[08:29:01.0000] <jgraham>

now if only we could apply those techniques to all software updating

[11:02:00.0000] <Spark^>
anyone have any good ideas for a stable version of html5lib for python? i did manage to get rid of one error by doing hg update tip rather than hg update (which I assumed would be the same?) but i'm still getting an error at runtime in html5parser.py (processDocType)

[12:46:00.0000] <Lachy__>
Now I am completely confused by Leif's CSS based @media proposal for strict HTML parsing. It just makes no sense to me.

[12:49:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy, when did strict HTML parsing ever make sense? (independent of syntax/format)

[12:50:00.0000] <Lachy__>
tantek, it doesn't

[12:53:00.0000] <hober>
Doug's use case could be addressed by a Firefox plugin / lint tool

[12:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
hober, that depends on exactly what Doug wants

[12:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
which isn't clear from his initial proposal

[12:56:00.0000] <hober>
I took his use case to be "developer changes markup (served as text/html), hits reload, immediately sees in his browser some indication of parse errors"

[12:57:00.0000] <hober>
basically, his first bullet point

[12:57:01.0000] <tantek>
hober - that use case is better addressed by a text editor that validates markup while you're editing, and flags errors (perhaps after waiting 1-2 seconds after you're done typing)

[12:57:02.0000] <hober>
totally agreed

[12:57:03.0000] <tantek>
no need to reload in browser to check validity

[12:57:04.0000] <tantek>
and much faster to have it in the editor

[12:57:05.0000] <hober>
[which is why I'm working on that :)]

[12:57:06.0000] <tantek>
heck, even use red squiggly lines like spellcheckers

[12:57:07.0000] <Lachy>
hober, yes, that much is clear, but what's not clear is exactly what he wants to be considered as a parse error

[12:58:00.0000] <hober>
Lachy: indeed.

[12:58:01.0000] <tantek>
to indicate invalid tags, attributes, attribute values

[12:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
like, does he want unquoted attributes to be considered an error (like XML), or for that to be perfectly fine like it is in normal HTML

[12:58:03.0000] <hober>
should it yell about a missing (or present) solidus, etc.

[12:58:04.0000] <tantek>
/me makes a Lazyweb request: Text editor that does HTML validity checking in realtime/inline similar to the way that modern text editors check spelling with red squiggly lines.

[12:59:00.0000] <hober>
tantek: assuming you're authoring xhtml5 with nxml-mode in Emacs, and plug in this stuff http://github.com/hober/html5-el/tree/master you've already got that. :)

[13:00:00.0000] <hober>
the line isn't squiggly, but it is red

[13:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
tantek: Text editor validation doesn't help when you're writing code that generates markup dynamically

[13:27:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip' - it does for text editors that can open an HTML file via HTTP URL.

[13:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
tantek: That seems less convenient than opening the HTTP URL in a web browser (with a valiator extension), and I thought the point was to make it more convenient

[13:30:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip` - I can see reasons for each use case.

Hixie: I think hsivonen's question is about <span item="foo"><span itemprop="bar baz">...</span></span>

[15:47:02.0000] <hober>
IIRC item foo has two properties, bar and baz

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: send mail about spaces in name=""

[15:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: pong

[15:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
hober: if that's what he meant, then yeah, that's two properties... is the spec vague about that?

[15:49:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, so we ran into an minor issue implementing .files on drag-n-drop dataTransfer

[15:49:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503598#c18

[15:49:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, basically, we don't want to expose the files during drags

[15:49:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, but i suspect we want to expose the fact that there are files in there

[15:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah you should only expose them ondrop

[15:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks at the bug

[15:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
(same applies to all data, not just files)

[15:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you get arun to finish his draft, i'll spec this in the html5 spec immediately

[15:52:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i'm talking with Arun fairly often about the draft, i think a new one is on the way

[15:52:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i don't think it'll change substantially though from previous one. Possibly introducing the local-uri thing

[15:53:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, though the lifetime still seems like a big problem to me

[15:54:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, and I think we might drop the FileDialog for now. Because ya'll are wossies ;)

[15:56:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, so in general for drag-n-drop, pages won't know at all even what type of data is in the datatransfer until the drop event?

[15:57:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, seems useful for the page to know if it will be able to handle the datatype before accepting the drop

[15:57:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, this would be orthogonal to the .files issue

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: what's the problem with the lifetime? and i hope he'll split File into File and some base interface, too

[16:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: the problem with not knowing the types is an open issue with the dnd model iirc

[16:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The @parsing thing doesn't seem like a good fit for markup

[16:25:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, the problem with the life time is that I suspect Document lifetime is slightly too short

[16:25:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Browser error reporting, symlinks, mod_rewrite with type override...

[16:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: for the types, i expect we'll expose .types in all events in the future

[16:25:04.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, for example sticking the uri into a sessionStorage in a wizard-type page

[16:25:05.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, sounds good re .types

[16:26:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, we'd just need to define a type for files

[16:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: well we can always increase the lifetime later if we think we need to... but i think it'd be better to define a way to track the actual File or FileData objects rather than passing the URI around

[16:27:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, yeah, that's an alternative

[16:27:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i'd still like for Storage to be able to hold File/FileData objects

[16:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the temporary URI design is probably not workable

[16:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I need to catch up on the discussion though

[16:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i don't see another solution for reusing file data unless we basically add a parallel set of features across the entire platform to support File objects everywhere, and that seems painful

[16:28:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the problem is, you have to make sure that temporary URIs for files are unguessable, and also that they are never reused

[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
why and why?

[16:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
they have to be unguessable or you have a security hole

[16:29:02.0000] <othermaciej>
an attacker in a different window could read the URI

[16:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
no, they are origin-blocked

[16:29:04.0000] <othermaciej>
assuming you want the URIs to be passable via postMessage for instance

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
you'd pass the File object

[16:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
not the URI

[16:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
in that case, they are inferior to the ability to pass a File since you can't transfer the capability

[16:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
correct

[16:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
they're not meant for passing around

[16:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
they're meant for plugging a File object into an <img> or <video> or some such

[16:30:06.0000] <othermaciej>
so it seems like adding srcFile attributes to the few HTML element interfaces that need them would be simpler

[16:30:07.0000] <Hixie>
or <iframe>, or CSS, or any number of things

[16:30:08.0000] <Hixie>
that seems unworkable to me

[16:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
we'd have to go through the entire platform duplicating everything, defining how one overrides the other, etc

[16:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
it'd be an epic disaster in terms of getting interop

[16:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(I don't think <iframe> or CSS really need them, but maybe I'm wrong)

[16:31:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, why make them origin blocked rather than unguessable?

[16:31:04.0000] <othermaciej>
the use case is for a preview

[16:32:00.0000] <sicking>
I think CSS and <iframe> is useful for things like building a HTML editor

[16:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think giving <img>, <audio> and <video> a way to take their source from a file instead of a URI would mostly satisfy the use case

[16:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
building an HTML editor would admittedly need support everywhere you can embed something

[16:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if you wanted your HTML editor to work without having to upload the resources first

[16:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I thought the main stated use case was for previews before uploading

[16:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(any text resource you can already preview by reading the file yourself)

[16:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
temporary URIs are certainly more general, but more complicated both to use and to implement for the simple preview use case

[16:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: because they can leak easily (e.g. referer headers)

[16:35:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, hmm... good point

[16:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think that temporary URIs are actually any more complicated on the long term

[16:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
they would be a much more localised implementation

[16:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
rather than spreading support all over the place, redefining processing models, etc

[16:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
a more localized implementation of something way more complicated, and with tricky security implications

[16:36:01.0000] <sicking>
if we make the uri origin blocked then I'm not sure there are any security issues I can think of off the top of my head

[16:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm not convinced it's that complicated. Why would it be that complicated?

[16:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
tracking the temp URIs and implementing lifetime and origin blocking is the piece of code that would be both complicated and security-sensitive

[16:37:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, btw, doesn't data: uri suffer the same problem of leaking through referrer then?

[16:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: data: URIs aren't particularly secure

[16:38:00.0000] <sicking>
origin blocking doesn't seem that hard to implement security, granted it might be different in non-gecko browsers

[16:38:01.0000] <sicking>
securely

[16:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it's just a table of ID,origin,file,document; when a document closes, you remove all the corresponding rows; whena url is dereferenced, it returns its origin and data

[16:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: unless your URI handling is especially weird, this seems relatively straightforward

[16:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: if lifetime is document but scope is origin, you have to be careful never to reuse an ID

[16:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's one example of a potential subtle bug

[16:40:01.0000] <otherarun>
So the requirement is for both unguessability and origin-restriction.

[16:40:02.0000] <otherarun>
(the first, unguessability, may be easy -- UUID or something)

[16:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: not reusing an ID is trivial, just increase a number.

[16:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
unguessability doesn't matter if they are origin restricted

[16:40:05.0000] <sicking>
at least not as important

[16:41:00.0000] <sicking>
though <img> is cross origin

[16:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i don't really understand the not reusing an ID thing, though

[16:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it's easier to avoid repeating if the URI doesn't have to be unguessable

[16:41:03.0000] <sicking>
/me didn't follow the reuse ID thing either

[16:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
so long as you don't create a new URI that's equal to a still-active URI, why does it matter if the ID is reused?

[16:41:05.0000] <othermaciej>
if you reuse an ID then it could lead to another page from the same origin that has the wrong URI reference to load the wrong file, instead of getting an error

[16:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
that seems like a not especially worrisome case

[16:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, that page could just randomly come up with a string that happens to be one that happens to be registered to its own origin too

[16:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
even if the ID wasn't reused

[16:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
note that File references wouldn't have this problem at all, since the engine can know the lifetime of a File object but it can't know the object of a URI string

[16:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: yes, that's another flaw with the magical URI scheme

[16:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it just has much more potential for bugginess to use a magic string instead of a capability-carrying object reference

[16:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think that considering this a flaw is like considering pointers to be flawed because if you come up with a random number that happens to point into your address space, you'll dereference something instead of getting an access violation

[16:43:03.0000] <othermaciej>
to identify a temporary and origin-restricted resource

[16:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
pointers are flawed! that's why we don't have them in ECMAScript

[16:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug* i'm not convinced this is a problem

[16:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i mean i'm happy to make the URIs be unlikely to be reused and unlikely to clash

[16:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. by using UUIDs

[16:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
(clash with random values, i mean)

[16:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't think it's a problem

[16:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's just a sloppy design, in my opinion

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
but in any case, it's trivial to create a sequence of non-duplicate IDs that are statistically not going to clash with random numbers

[16:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
not saying we can't make it work, but it will be much more bug-prone than the alternative

[16:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's far less sloppy than adding a parallel set of APIs everywhere :-)

[16:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
i strongly disagree with that

[16:46:05.0000] <Hixie>
having to add two entry points to every processing model is orders of magnitude more likely to be buggy

[16:46:06.0000] <Hixie>
and in weird ways that are hard to work aorund

[16:47:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
Speaking of dnd... The current draft doesn't specify when pageX, clientX, screenX positions are available on the DragEvent. Gecko currently sets these to zero on the source node. It should be available on all IMHO. Is there any known security issues to this?

[16:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I doubt it. Just say srcFile always takes precedence over src, or the most recently set takes precedence, or whatever. Done.

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: hah

[16:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if only it were that easy

[16:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
It would be like an hour or two of implementation work to do HTMLImageElement.srcFile and I would be confident it is right

[16:48:03.0000] <othermaciej>
a temporary URI vending scheme, I would expect to be finding bugs months later

[16:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and you'd get the origin checking right for when that <img> is used with createPattern() ?

[16:49:00.0000] <sicking>
the downside is that we can't make it work as widely as URIs work. For example for CSS backgrounds. But i'm not sure that that is that important

[16:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: yeah, that's really the main downside

[16:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: an <img> loaded from a File shouldn't have cross-origin taint, since if you have the file reference you can get the bits of the image

[16:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or at least, cross-origin taint for createPattern() would serve no useful purpose

[16:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm just saying that there are FAR more complications here than first meets the eye

[16:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. we'd have to change the conformance rules to make sure <img> without src="" would be valid

[16:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
the <video> resource selection algorithm would become even more complex

[16:51:01.0000] <roc>
I'd prefer the URI approach from an implementation point of view. If we do the .file approach we'll have to wrap the file in a URI-like-stream internally anyway

[16:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyone relying on selectors like  img[src]  would have to now know they couldn't always rely on it

[16:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm willing to believe there may be complications, I just can't think of any (at least, none that would make it tricky for implementations)

[16:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are so many small things that would have to be defined if we added a parallel API everywhere

[16:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I think the challenges with the URI approach are not so much about using it internally, but in using that URI string as a handle to the resource

[16:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
you also couldn't use .innerHTML suddenly, you'd have to create the markup and then poke the file in afterwards

[16:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I'm not really sure it's needed everywhere

[16:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think it's needed everywhere, e.g. i can't think of any time i'd want to put it in <blockquote cite="">

[16:54:01.0000] <roc>
Maintaining a file dictionary doesn't seem that hard, except for lifetime management. How does that work?

[16:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the only use case I've heard mentioned for that is a full-featured HTML editor that either works offline or is unwilling to upload resources before using them in editing

[16:54:03.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I can!

[16:54:04.0000] <Hixie>
roc: my proposal is to make the URIs stop resolving once their Document has been closed

[16:55:00.0000] <sicking>
/me has to take off

[16:55:01.0000] <roc>
ok

[16:55:02.0000] <sicking>
so far I don't feel strongly either way

[16:55:03.0000] <roc>
sounds good to me

[16:58:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
othermaciej: It could really be all kinds of offline app scenarios such as spreadsheets or whatever.

[16:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sebmarkbage: I don't think spreadsheets need the ability to reference a temporary file from CSS to work offline

[16:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
being able to read the file text, plus maybe ability to display loaded images, should be enough


2009-07-15
[17:07:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
Anything needing to embed image or video. I should be able to use them in img, video, css or canvas. I like the URI approach since it's ubiquitous.

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
good lord

[17:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
what a lot of new feedback

[17:35:00.0000] <hober>
yeah, that teal line has been trending upward for quite a bit there

[17:39:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
Hixie: Where is the most appropriate place to leave new feedback? Forums? Mailing list?

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
mailing list is most ideal

[17:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
see the top of the spec for details

[18:15:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
Has there been any talk about explicitly specifying various mouse gestures? Like iPhone pinch could trigger onzoomin/onzoomout. I also think it'd be good to have something like draggable="gesture" that'd only trigger events on the source node.

[18:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
sebmarkbage: that's more of a suggestion for the events work -- www-dom⊙wo

[18:40:00.0000] <heycam>
sebmarkbage, and i think olli pettay sent a mail to public-webapps or www-dom recently asking if there was any interest in speccing gesture/touch events

[18:42:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
thx. I will look through the archives.

[00:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: fixing

[00:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[00:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
dispense with the IDE, man. that's stuff for sissies :)

[00:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: does it work now?

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I read comments on Zeldman's blog and now I'm having a "someone's wrong on the Internet" moment again

[00:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
appeals to the TAG even: http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/13/html-5-nav-ambiguity-resolved/#comment-44699

[00:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: works now -- thanks

[00:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: which part of the v.nu is emitting the new warnings?

[02:17:00.0000] <takkaria>
the zeldman comments are pretty amazing

[02:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
takkaria: in what way?

[02:18:01.0000] <takkaria>
there's somsone there claiming they're going to have to relearn most of the stuff they know to the code a website with the advent of HTML5

[02:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[02:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess my comment is still in a moderation queue.

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes blog comment systems said "Your comment is awaiting moderation" when it is

[02:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the commenter using the handle "Luke" is onto something

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
who used the "it will help screen readers" line?

[02:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
of the new sectioning elements, only <nav> has been put forward as being able to help screen reader users, as far as i'm aware

[02:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: hasn't footer been, too? and every one of them by the logic that if ARIA landmarks help, the HTML5 structural elements should, too

[02:25:01.0000] <takkaria>
apparently adding role="" is a much more incremental step than <header>/<nav>/ et all

[02:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
People have talked about using the sectioning elements to do an automatic "skip to content", which mainly helps screen reader users

[02:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Better outlining seems like it wwould help screenreader users, as does "skip to next article" even without good use of headings

[02:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: Opera Mobile has a heuristic "skip to content" feature

[02:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Does it work better than e.g. Opera's "next page" heuristic?

[02:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: presumably this stuff could tie into that feature, too

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it works amazingly well. I wish Mini had it, too.

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i can't wait til blogs are all federated across wave 

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
it would make tracking these comments and responding properly so much easier

[02:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe that happens when all Java jar dependencies are federated over Maven

[02:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me onders if wave uses the term "federated" because it sounds vaugely like something from Star Trek so subconciously suggesting 23rd Century technology

[02:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Can't you just follow the RSS comment feeds?

[02:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
i can't respond to RSS comment feeds and have them appear in the other person's RSS feed

[02:30:00.0000] <hober>
jgraham: we just need a wave app on our communicators, err, iphones.

[02:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: it uses it because that's what jabber uses, iirc

[02:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
OK, well s/wave/jabber/ in the above then :)

[02:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[02:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I tend to get an enterprisey vibe from "federated"

[02:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
probably from associations with WS-* stuff

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I do think that federated SSO, chat, etc. are good

[02:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
"enterprise" also has the startrek feel :-P

[02:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
heh

[02:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
WS-* has a StarWars feel, though :-)

[02:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah. Talking about things being "federated to your enterprise" seems like a winning strategy because it allows CEOs to like out their Picard fantasy

[02:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/like/live/

[02:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me gestures angrily in the general direction of whoever invented the syntactic sugar for declaring multiple variables in one declarator

[03:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: Scripts that modify the page as it is being parsed - is not error handling

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but there's no doctype!

[03:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the section doesn't discuss the doctype :)

[03:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, John Allsop may have a valid point about the <footer> content model that he mentioned here http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/13/html-5-nav-ambiguity-resolved/#comment-44699 - Sites like YouTube and Flickr group the links in their footers by category. Although they currently use table layouts to achieve it, it seems reasonable to do that with sections

[03:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: details! :-P

[03:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: (i'm happy to change that section title if you can find a better one -- drop me a mail)

[03:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: those are <section>s. They're at best paragraphs.

[03:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe <dl>s

[03:11:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, I'm not sure if they're the type of sites he's referring to though. That's just the closest I could find that matches his description

[03:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
well when he sends his feedback like he told me he would we'll see :-)

[03:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i think it is now undefined what document.bgcolor does when document.body *is* a frameset

[03:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: send mail, i'm in the middle of a massive edit

[04:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/ is missing header-whatwg

[04:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[04:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm rewriting the script

[04:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
it still has bugs

[04:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks at the W3C version instead

[04:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: btw, I plan to write a cron job that will generate a multipage version of the W3C copy

[04:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I meant to do it today, but didn't

[04:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
today being, it's 19:20 here and I need to get some food and alcohol of some form

[04:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but to give a heads-up, I would like to also set up a .htaccess file so that the index file for the multipage version becomes the default

[04:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
with a link to the single-page one

[04:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[04:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which I realize might break some people's bookmarks and such

[04:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm mentioning because when I do get it set up, I would need for you to add the link on the single-page version

[04:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
your source, I mean

[04:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me also set up http://gsnedders.html5.org/html5.txt semi-jokingly

[04:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: there's at least one SDO I know of for which that format looks optimized 

[04:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
good job

[04:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: how are you generating it? Lynx?

[04:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: But we don't have all the proper form feed characters and such like in the right place

[04:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: yeah

[04:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: it has a very IETF-like flavor

[04:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: I think I like link #19944 best

[04:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: I quite like #772

[04:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yes, good old #772

[04:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
solid gold

[04:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zen-like

[04:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but outside of that instance, the combination of plain text with ridiculously long fragment IDs has its own kind of aesthetic quality

[04:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: The WHATWG multipage one has a script that ensure bookmarks to /#foo will get redirected to /bar.html#foo etc

[04:28:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
(scare quotes implied in my statement above)

[04:28:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: OK, maybe I can make use of that

[04:28:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
after I actually get around to doing it

[04:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
instead of just talking about, repeatedly

[04:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you talk about doing the work enough times, someone else will do the work to shut you up

[04:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
great strategy

[04:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will try that

[04:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
will try it later

[04:30:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
in the mean time, I noticed that the beer clock rang 90 minutes ago

[04:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I must depart

[04:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: Good bye, fair well, and best wishes for your future life!

[04:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me fires up his chopper and heads to the rock shop

o_O

[04:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I could well imagine Jukka blasting us for making it valid had we done that

[04:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
he wants the character references that refer to numbers that aren't the specified numbers to be conforming?

[04:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand that e-mail

[04:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
he says it's undefined but it should be allowed?

[04:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
how does that even make sense

[04:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: maybe you could ask him what he wants

[04:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
since he thinks html5 is pointless, i don't see much point asking him

[04:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fair enough

[04:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
when did Jukka flip the bozo bit on us?

[04:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I need some kind of Mail.app trick for dealing with duplicate email on 3 mailing lists plus self

[05:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
route your mail through gmail

[05:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
it filters dupes

[05:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno when jukka flipped the bit, but it was a while back

[05:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok i now have less e-mail on the pile than this morning. Only by 3 e-mails, but still.

nn

[05:45:00.0000] <takkaria>
hm, I just discvered the CSS property table-layout

[05:46:00.0000] <takkaria>
I wonder how I've gone so long without knowing it exists

[05:47:00.0000] <takkaria>
I think I'd actually have preferred not to know about it...

[05:47:01.0000] <RyanRoberts>
FF2 supports it so probably a while ;)

[05:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
hmm I'm not sure I remember that one either

[05:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well I have a vauge memory of having encountered it before

[05:50:00.0000] <RyanRoberts>
actually I maybe mistaken

[05:51:00.0000] <takkaria>
table-layout: fixed is an abomination, it lets you tell tables to not pay attention to the size of the content of its cells when calculating layout

[05:52:00.0000] <RyanRoberts>
it's CSS2 isn't it? I rarely use tables so not used it often but I'm sure I've come across it.

[05:52:01.0000] <takkaria>
yeah, css2

[05:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess someone decided that the default algorithm was slow/complex/hard to specify and thought "I know why don't we add an option"

[05:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
But the mailing list archives don't turn anything up

[06:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, table-layout: fixed; actually has some benefits. You just have to be careful about how you use it.

[06:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Google has criteria for phasing out support for old browser versions

[06:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Revenue from ads for old browsers users < cost of supporting old browser versions, perhaps

[06:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, one benefit is that it makes table columns equal width by default, which is otherwise difficult to achieve when the number of columns can vary but you always want the table to be a set width regardless

[06:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/tests/canvas/suite/tests/results.html uses table-layout:fixed

[06:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how much RAM I'd need not to beach ball all the time

[06:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, how much RAM do you have?

[06:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
4 GB

[06:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
which apps are causing the beach ball so frequently?

[06:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess the combination of multiple browsers, IDEs and operating systems

[06:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
virtual machines that reserve large chunks of RAM are a killer

[06:09:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh. yeah, if you keep multiple OSs running in VMs all the time, there's not much you can do about it

[06:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
You could get faster swap space

[06:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
although, it wouldn't hurt upgrading to a new machine with 8GB or RAM

[06:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
Can you use SSDs as swap yet? and does that work well?

[06:10:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Why would you have ever been unable to?

[06:10:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: Macs that can host more than 4 GB of RAM are expensive and large

hsivonen, the new MacBook Pro's support 8GB. Just buy your RAM from a 3rd party supplier, instead of through Apple

[06:11:02.0000] <jgraham>
(like they would die after an alarmingly small number of rewrites)

[06:11:03.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. I was unaware of MacBook Pro accepting 8 GB

[06:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps I should pay up and get one of those

[06:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, as of the most recent update, they do

[06:12:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Would it actually be a blocker for you to use a Mac Pro as your main development machine and just use a laprop when travelling?

[06:12:03.0000] <jgraham>
THat seems like a more sensible solution

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: Mac Pro seems like an overkill in every dimension except RAM

[06:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Hmm. It just seems worryingly shortsighted to upgrade to a machine in order to use its maximum amount of RAM

[06:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since probably in 1 year you will want more again

[06:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, a dual Quad Core Mac Pro with 32 GB of RAM would be awesome!

[06:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I could also try running a manual garbage collection of my Firefox tabs once in a while

What's the W3C IRC server?

[06:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
irc.w3.org with weird port

[06:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
6667 or 6665 but not the one that's normal

[06:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
either port 6665 or port 80 works

[06:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if port 80 complies with Architecture.

[06:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think they care too much if it does. They just need it to bypass overzealous port blocking

mookid, do you dislike such people enough to not feel like saying hi to them as well?

[08:34:02.0000] <mookid>
that's bad enough

[08:34:03.0000] <mookid>
I didn't say I hated you

[08:34:04.0000] <mookid>
I think you're hillarious

[08:34:05.0000] <mookid>

[10:10:00.0000] <ezyang>
So, if something is ignored but "not conforming", does that result in a parse error? 

[10:10:01.0000] <ezyang>
A "non-conforming error"? 

[10:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
ezyang: If something is not said to be a parse error, then I would expect that it's not a parse error

[10:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though it could still be a conformance failure)

[10:14:02.0000] <ezyang>
Sure. 

[10:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
So I'm not sure what your query is :-)

[10:15:01.0000] <ezyang>
The html5lib spec doesn't give me a lot to work on in terms of algorithms that convert nonconforming HTML to conforming HTML  

[10:15:02.0000] <ezyang>
erm, s/html5lib/HTML 5/ 

[10:15:03.0000] <Philip`>
In general that's impossible

[10:15:04.0000] <Philip`>
since it's not even possible for a machine to determine whether a document is conforming or not

[10:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I suppose you'll have to choose what set of errors you want to restrict yourself to fixing

[10:17:00.0000] <ezyang>
Oh yeah, of course. The goal is "anything that is machine detectable" 

[10:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
ezyang: Still not possible (at least in some sensible way) e.g. if alt were mandatory there would be no way to take an image with no alt value (machine detectable) and insert the correct alt value

[10:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
Even in more simple cases my feeling is that "you don't want to do that" even though clearly some people do want to do that

[10:20:01.0000] <ezyang>
haha. My algorithm there is to insert the filename, or some configurable value. 

[10:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
ezyang: Fail

[10:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Will you handle stuff like <table><tr><td><td rowspan=2><tr><td colspan=2></table> too? :-)

[10:21:02.0000] <ezyang>
Philip`: I don't handle that yet, but it's presumably an algorithm I could write. 

[10:21:03.0000] <jgraham>
ezyang: Seriously there is nothing good about inserting the filename automatically and a bunch of bad things. Please don't do it

[10:22:00.0000] <ezyang>
Can I... insert a Zen koan? 

[10:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: The good thing is that the validator will give you a tick, and that's what really matters

[10:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: :(

[10:24:00.0000] <ezyang>
Unfortunately, that's the most user visible, and I have a commitment to not break that. 

[10:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: From an a11y POV, you don't want to add an alt attribute to some useless value.

[10:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I presume the main point of a non-conforming-to-conforming converter is to let you get ticks, because in terms of e.g. preserving the author's intent it's going to be worse than HTML5's processing requirements for non-conforming content)

[10:25:01.0000] <ezyang>
I mean, ideally the form processor would be smart enough to recognize these unresolvable cases and ask the user what they actually meant. 

[10:26:00.0000] <ezyang>
Philip`: The other point of nonconforming to conforming is because it means we can unambiguously determine intent. 

[10:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
?!?

[10:26:02.0000] <ezyang>
The space of conforming HTML is much smaller than nonconforming HTML, and browser behavior much better studied. 

[10:26:03.0000] <ezyang>
sorry, bad word choice 

[10:26:04.0000] <ezyang>
When I say intent, I mean, the way browsers will deal with it. 

[10:27:00.0000] <ezyang>
i.e. it gives desirable security properties. 

[10:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Once all browsers use HTML 5 parsers, that's no longer the case.

[10:27:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't understand how original code -> magic black box -> conforming code really helps

[10:27:03.0000] <jgraham>
I certianly don't see how it is a security issue

[10:27:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: XSS

[10:27:05.0000] <Philip`>
ezyang: If the goal is to fix markup that will have browser behaviour differences, then that seems very different to translating all non-conforming markup

[10:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Conforming code can have XSS holes

[10:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. you wouldn't have to worry about img with no alt even if it was non-conforming

[10:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: <a href=`javascript:alert("so sue me")`>asd</a> will run the JS in IE but is non-conforming

[10:28:03.0000] <ezyang>
Right, so there are multiple issues here. 

[10:28:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Actually, I don't think that is non-conforming.

[10:28:05.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Right so you should strip that in a sanitizer, conforming or not

[10:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you would have to worry about conforming code like <!--[if IE 6]><script>alert("oh no")</script><![endif]-->

[10:29:01.0000] <ezyang>
From the XSS standpoint, syntactic conformance is a huge plus. Not as much for tags, although by whitelisting to conformant tags and then further removing problem tags, you further restrict things. 

[10:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It probably should be non-conforming, though, for the very reason that IE will execute that

[10:29:03.0000] <ezyang>
Philip`: I explicitly disallow comments because of the fact that they commonly carry out of band information that is exploitable 

[10:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
ezyang: So you're making a sanitiser, rather than a tool to convert non-conforming markup to conforming markup?

[10:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
For XSS I would have thought that applying sanitization based on the HTML5 algorithm is enough. Whether the result is conforming or not is irrelevant

[10:30:02.0000] <ezyang>
But not just that 

[10:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It's both

[10:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
That sounds needlessly complex :-)

[10:30:05.0000] <jgraham>
Certianly whether it has alt attributes is irrelevant

[10:30:06.0000] <gsnedders>
http://htmlpurifier.org/demo.php

[10:31:00.0000] <ezyang>
From a marketing standpoint, it also makes sense to fix any conformance errors so that users can have the nice fuzzy feeling of a Green validator check. 

[10:31:01.0000] <ezyang>
It is then that alt attributes are relevant. 

[10:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: Even if that actually makes them less accessible?

[10:31:03.0000] <jgraham>
ezyang: It feels like we have got to the real reason for wanting conforming output

[10:31:04.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: And quite possibly makes them non-conforming in another way?

[10:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
or rahter "valid"

[10:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
*rather

[10:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(As I'd hope giving useless @alt would be non-conforming, as I hope it requires an alternative to the image)

[10:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
We could add a <pretendthisisconforming> element to HTML5 so people can get validator ticks without having to make their code worse

[10:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: The problem with trying to make code valid is you can quite easily make it a lot worse from a conformance and accessibility point of view

[10:33:01.0000] <ezyang>
I think alt is the big offender. 

[10:36:00.0000] <ezyang>
So, to reiterate, conformance has various benefits: 1. you get validator ticks, 2. syntactic conformance makes XSS harder, 3. conforming HTML has more regular browser interpretation, letting us canonicalize the interpretation 

[10:36:01.0000] <ezyang>
You roll over accessibility in the img alt case, but this can be fixed by smarter form processing, and is fairly isolated. 

[10:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: 1 is not a benefit.

[10:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
1 is not a benefit on its own. 2 seems extremely dubious to me. 3 is probably true but since you are basically just putting things through a magic black box you still won't get the results you expect in many cases

[10:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: 2 doesn't need validity

[10:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: 3 can't really be done programmatically.

[10:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(I say 2 doesn't need validity as it can be done just by doing stuff token-by-token)

[10:40:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(You can get a lot of the benefits of 2 just by parsing then serializing, and doing nothing more)

[10:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://htmlpurifier.org/demo.php?filter%5BAutoFormat.PurifierLinkify.DocURL%5D=%ef%bf%bf

[10:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
Actually if you have any attacks that htmlpurifier prevents but the html5lib sanitizer does not you should really file a bug on us

[10:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes that that was reported before and fixed, so is a regression

[10:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: We won't stop <script>alert("foo")</script> though

[10:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: No attacker would think we're stupid enough to try just writing a script tag, so they'll never know

[10:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, wait, duh

[10:43:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: THe sanitizer will strip that

[10:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>
sanitizer, not serializer

[10:46:00.0000] <ezyang>
Philip`: That... should have been fixed. 

[10:46:01.0000] <ezyang>
Oh, that's a bug in the form code, not in the purifier 

[10:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
(There's http://htmlpurifier.org/demo.php?filter%5BAutoFormat.AutoParagraph%5D=cheese too)

[10:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
I like how Sourceforge has adopted a colour scheme in which its forum messages are thin light grey text on a light blue background, and if I look at my laptop screen from an angle greater than twenty degrees then the text entirely disappears

[10:49:00.0000] <ezyang>
gsnedders: There is one main point that requires some sort of tree building algorithm, which is preventing user HTML elements from leaking to the parent tree. 

[10:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: Sure, just parse and serialize to get there.

[10:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: Nothing more than that is needed for that,

[10:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: Also, both myself and jgraham have doubts over two, as most of the issues will be fixed by parsing and serializing the tree, provided you quote attribute values and special case one or two things like < in tag name

[10:50:03.0000] <ezyang>
Whitelist philosophy means that I should very thoroughly inspect attributes and recursively parse data formats (i.e. CSS to URI) 

[10:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: Sure, but that doesn't have anything to do with building a balanced tree

[10:51:01.0000] <ezyang>
It also means that I should know exactly what tags that I'm going to allow. 

[10:51:02.0000] <jgraham>
Parsing CSS is a good idea. I would like to add that to html5lib

[10:51:03.0000] <ezyang>
Ok, so the core issues 

[10:52:00.0000] <ezyang>
building a conforming tree, and generating required attributes 

[10:52:01.0000] <ezyang>
Which y'all would like to convince me to not do. 

[10:53:00.0000] <ezyang>
Everything else that HTML Purifier is useful, no? 

[10:53:01.0000] <ezyang>
*is doing 

[10:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: You cannot create a conforming tree programmatically. You can, however, produce a valid tree.

[10:54:00.0000] <ezyang>
oh yes, that's what I meant 

[10:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
ezyang: I expect so althogh I don't know what all the other things it is doing are

[10:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: Everything else meaning what?

[10:54:03.0000] <ezyang>
With regards to fulfilling HTML 5 conformance requirements 

[10:55:00.0000] <ezyang>
We want to fulfill syntactic conformance, which you get from tokenizing the stream 

[10:55:01.0000] <ezyang>
We want to build a tree, which has its own conformance things associated with it (i.e. <b><i>f</b></i>), which you get from tree-building 

[10:55:02.0000] <jgraham>
The point about trying to create valid markup is that the main benefit seems to be a happy feeling conformance tick but there are substantial costs in terms of complexity, possibilites of harming end users, possibility of automagically misinterpreting the markup

[10:56:00.0000] <ezyang>
We want to recursively validate attributes, which increases conformance 

[10:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What does HTML Purifier aim to do? Does it aim to produce secure markup, does it aim to produce valid markup?

[10:56:02.0000] <ezyang>
It aims to do both. 

[10:56:03.0000] <ezyang>
You could remove maybe 15% if you got rid of the valid markup requirement, specifically valid trees and attribute generation. 

[10:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Fundamentally the latter is not a useful goal.

[10:57:01.0000] <ezyang>
The primary complexity comes from whitelisting and attribute validation 

[10:57:02.0000] <ezyang>
Possibly. 

[10:57:03.0000] <gsnedders>
You will get a lot of it from just parsing and serializing the tree, certainly

[10:57:04.0000] <gsnedders>
But that is a side-effect, more than anything else.

[10:57:05.0000] <ezyang>
Which is why I'm planning on swapping out most of my code for html5lib when the PHP impl gets stable enough 

[10:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Basically, I think what you need to do is parsing the input stream, remove elements/attributes on whitelist, remove some more attributes based upon their value, then serialize, quoting attribute values.

[10:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I think that should get you security.

[11:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and remove comments)

[11:01:00.0000] <ezyang>
gsnedders: I argue that removing attributes based on value is the wrong paradigm (it should be machine-semantic deconstruction of each attribute), but yes, essentially. 

[11:01:01.0000] <ezyang>
And remove comments, yep. 

[11:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: What's the difference?

[11:01:03.0000] <gsnedders>
ezyang: That is, ultimately, just inspecting the value. No?

[11:02:00.0000] <ezyang>
Semantic deconstruction means that attribute values might change. 

[11:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
The html5lib sanitiser has e.g. a regexp for detecting 'safe' style attribute values, and throws out any attribute that doesn't match, I think

[11:02:02.0000] <ezyang>
Canonicalization of a URL or CSS string is more important 

[11:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, OK

[11:02:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, right.

[11:02:05.0000] <ezyang>
Right. That kind of regex doesn't make me feel safe 

[11:02:06.0000] <Philip`>
Me neither

[11:02:07.0000] <ezyang>
Although theoretically it might be secure. 

[11:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
For most attributes though, it is just looking at the value and nothing more

[11:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And I'm throwing together stuff from the top of my head :)

[11:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
The person who discovered the regexp takes exponential time on certain inputs probably wasn't too happy

[11:03:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me was just discussing that with jgraham

[11:03:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Your hair?

[11:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(the use of the regex that is)

[11:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Both of us think having a proper CSS parser would be better)

[11:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
(The stuff from the top of your head, that is)

There is one more thing that HTML Purifier does, and that's enhance HTML. 

[11:04:04.0000] <gsnedders>

Take something that normally didn't have meaning and transform it accordingly

For example, turning plaintext URLs into links

Well that sounds like an OK function is your users want it

ezyang: Can you just stick with purifying? :P

[11:05:03.0000] <ezyang>
I mean, you kind of /need/ these features if you're going to be writing HTML raw.

You can cut some corners, since style="" is much simpler than <style></style> 

[11:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
I tried using a Python CSS parser once, but it seemed to have something like quadratic time complexity and so it was unusable for typical large inputs

I would also argue that you need to whitelist the values of CSS properties, since you don't want to enumerate against browser proprietary extensions

I still wonder if, one day, a browser will add support for a specific combination of tags that results in JavaScript being executed. 

[11:16:01.0000] <ezyang>
and in separate contexts it's ok. 

[11:19:00.0000] <ezyang>
Seems very unlikely. 

[11:20:00.0000] <ezyang>
Ok, so here's what's going to happen. HTML Purifier 5.0 will be able to operate as "make it valid omgwtf" and "make it secure" 

[11:21:00.0000] <ezyang>
For interest of backwards compatibility, "make it valid omgwtf" will be the default.  Conscientous developers who don't care about validity can turn that off.

And then have the fun of evangelism to dissuade people from using the former.

Email? 

[12:17:00.0000] <JoePeck>
Hello.  Is there any way to access the current page's response headers via Javascript, like you can access an AJAX Requests response headers (with xhr.getAllResponseHeaders etc).  And if not, why not or was it just not thought of?

[12:19:00.0000] <JoePeck>
Since you can just spawn an AJAX request for the current page, and get the headers that way, I think it should be allowable for Javascript to have access to the response headers of the current page.  At least I can't think of a realistic security concern.

[12:35:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
JoePeck: As far as I know you can't and I agree. It is an oversight.

[12:36:00.0000] <JoePeck>
Hmm, should I make a formal email to the mailing list?

[12:39:00.0000] <mookid>
no

[12:39:01.0000] <mookid>
the response is the response

[12:40:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
Scripts should be able to resolve things such as relative URIs if the HTTP header "Content-Base" is used. We shouldn't have to use meta or base tags for that.

[12:40:01.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: but the headers aren't available to Javascript?

[12:40:02.0000] <mookid>
the client side doesn't, and shouldn't, be able to modify the response - it just is what it is

[12:40:03.0000] <gsnedders_>
ezyang: Yes, email. You know these things?

[12:40:04.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: not modify, access.  What about custom headers?

[12:41:00.0000] <JoePeck>
not that it would make any sense to modify the response headers... they are the response headers =)

[12:43:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
Out of curiousity, what headers would you like to access? Custom only?

[12:44:00.0000] <JoePeck>
sebmarkbage: actually, someone in ##javascript wanted to access the "Date" header sent from his server

[12:44:01.0000] <JoePeck>
but I could think of accessing the Content-Type and custom headers

[12:44:02.0000] <JoePeck>
as possible use cases

[12:44:03.0000] <mookid>
wait - what

[12:45:00.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: it seems I have a difficult time explaining this because everyone seems to respond with a "what?" =(

[12:45:01.0000] <mookid>
you can't read response headers?

[12:45:02.0000] <JoePeck>
Here was my example page: http://bogojoker.com/x/xhr/headers.html

[12:46:00.0000] <JoePeck>
you can read the response headers, but only for an AJAX Request

[12:46:01.0000] <sebmarkbage>
You can read response headers off of XHR but not for the current document.

[12:46:02.0000] <JoePeck>
exactly

[12:46:03.0000] <sebmarkbage>
I.e. you'd have to make another request to find that out.

[12:46:04.0000] <JoePeck>
sebmarkbage++ thanks =)

[12:47:00.0000] <mookid>
yeah well that's a good example of what a ridiculously poor HTTP client most browsers are

[12:47:01.0000] <mookid>
you'll get the "we need a use case" nonsense

[12:48:00.0000] <takkaria>
...

[12:48:01.0000] <mookid>
the reality is that they didn't read the RFC properly

[12:48:02.0000] <JoePeck>
well, why get the response headers from an ajax request?  If there was a use case for that then they all apply for this case as well

[12:48:03.0000] <takkaria>
you can be a perfectly good HTTP client without exposing request headers to JavaScript

[12:49:00.0000] <mookid>
browsers are crap HTTP clients

[12:49:01.0000] <JoePeck>
I agree with takkaria on that

[12:49:02.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: and what would you suggest as a good HTTP client?

[12:49:03.0000] <takkaria>
that may or may not be true, but it's irrevelant to exposing things to JS

[12:49:04.0000] <mookid>
one that behaves as though the developers read the HTTP RFC

[12:50:00.0000] <JoePeck>
hmm the "and" makes that statement sound stuck up, I don't mean that, I'm just curious

[12:50:01.0000] <mookid>
take a look at the Accept header for most browsers

[12:50:02.0000] <mookid>
go read the RFC

[12:50:03.0000] <mookid>
and try and work out what these people were thinking

[12:50:04.0000] <mookid>
if anything at all

[12:50:05.0000] <mookid>
probably too busy doing crack and beating their wives

oookay

[12:51:01.0000] <mookid>

[12:51:02.0000] <mookid>
there's no use case for appropriate Accept headers

what about HTML5 providing a mechanism for protocol level content negotiation?

[12:52:01.0000] <mookid>
nope - no use case

[12:55:03.0000] <sebmarkbage>
I'm sorry, you lost me at crack. The use case of being able to read headers is that it allows for a cleaner model as opposed to for example meta tags. Meta data that belongs in HTTP could then stay there.

[12:56:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm all for self descriptive messages

[12:56:01.0000] <mookid>
that's probably why you lost me

[12:57:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm in favour of keeping that stuff in the message headers

[12:57:01.0000] <mookid>
good luck convincing these guys that HTTP is relevant to their 'ground breaking' work

[12:57:02.0000] <mookid>
unless there's a use case for it

mookid: What's inappropriate about the Accept headers browsers send? (And I'm totally serious about asking that, I know what the spec says, and it seems perfectly sane to me.)

mookid: Because then people will complain that they don't claim to support application/xhtml+xml just as well as it does text/html

why don't you read that post

[13:04:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
I am reading it.

[13:06:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
IE's seems sane insofar as it lists what it supports, but all equally, which is a bit odd. I would expect it to prefer text/html. WebKit's is odd seeming that image/png is there (I do also wonder why application/xml is equal to application/xhtml+xml and above text/html, but providing a generic XML MIME type along side application/xhtml+xml doesn't seem entirely crazy). Firefox seems the sanest, though.

[13:06:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me wonders what we send

[13:06:02.0000] <mookid>

oh right

[13:06:05.0000] <mookid>
oh you're probably sane =)

[13:06:06.0000] <gsnedders_>
(As we are only mentioned in passing as being sane)

[13:06:07.0000] <gsnedders_>
text/html, application/xml;q=0.9, application/xhtml+xml, image/png, image/jpeg, image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, */*;q=0.1

[13:07:00.0000] <mookid>
eww

[13:07:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
That doens't seem quite so sane.

[13:07:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
*doesn't

[13:07:03.0000] <gsnedders_>
If anything, that's the least sane.

[13:07:04.0000] <mookid>
well this is academic anyway since there's no need for HTTP content negotiation because "you can put it in the URI"

[13:07:05.0000] <mookid>

I think Accept headers make most sense for embedded resources 

[13:09:00.0000] <mookid>
well they make no sense in practical web app terms

because you can't specify them in context to a browser in HTML

Yes you can. <img /> 

[13:09:03.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: so if a person asks for blah.html and their Accept header states they would want xml over html you should respect the Accept header and give them xml?

let me just say something

[13:09:06.0000] <Philip`>
Ooh, this discussion again

[13:09:07.0000] <ezyang>
JoePeck: No, since you explicitly specified what content type you want with .html

[13:10:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
ezyang: File names are meaningless.

[13:10:02.0000] <mookid>
say I have something called /resource - and I have 2 representations of that resource in json and xml; but they are the SAME resource

[13:10:03.0000] <JoePeck>
ezyang: thats what I thought, so most of this doesn't seem crazy to me. =)

[13:10:04.0000] <gsnedders_>
ezyang: If you have both representations of the resource, you should give them XML.

[13:10:05.0000] <mookid>
I don't want /resource.xml and /resource.json because those URIs are 2 separate resources

[13:10:06.0000] <ezyang>
gsnedders_: How so? If you want to turn on Multiviews, you better damn well be serving files w/o extensions 

[13:10:07.0000] <mookid>
URIs are *opaque*

[13:10:08.0000] <mookid>
which is extremely important

[13:11:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
ezyang: Well, I mean extensions are.

[13:11:01.0000] <JoePeck>
"those URIs are 2 separate resources" those 2 URIs don't need to exist, they just need to be parsed.

[13:11:02.0000] <mookid>
the fact that we've been forced into using the URI for this is irrelevant it's bad practice if the two document types are representations of the same resource

[13:11:03.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: When does it become important, though?

[13:11:04.0000] <mookid>
good god.

[13:11:05.0000] <ezyang>
mookid: I agree. But there still needs to be a mechanism for explicitly specifying the desired content type 

[13:11:06.0000] <mookid>
caching./

[13:12:00.0000] <mookid>
caching caching caching

[13:12:01.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: its much easier to work with something you can modify easily, like the URI, then the header which goes along

[13:12:02.0000] <mookid>
JoePeck: no it's not

[13:12:03.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: But you need to vary caching based upon the Accept header then, which means you gain nothing by having the same URI for both.

[13:12:04.0000] <JoePeck>
would you suggest changing browsers to have 2 textfields, one for the URI and one for the preferred accepted mimetype?

[13:12:05.0000] <mookid>
ezyang: the best way to do that is an accept attribute in hypermedia tags

[13:13:00.0000] <inimino>
/me makes popcorn

[13:13:01.0000] <JoePeck>
lol =)

[13:13:02.0000] <mookid>
so <a accept="application/json" href="/resource">

mookid: But why do you want to override the browser default?

[13:13:04.0000] <ezyang>
==gsnedders_ 

[13:13:05.0000] <mookid>
 because it depends on the context

[13:13:06.0000] <ezyang>
Then the resources are not identical. 

[13:13:07.0000] <gsnedders_>

I like mookid's accept attribute

WHATWG don't

[13:14:00.0000] <JoePeck>
but still

[13:14:01.0000] <mookid>
there's not a good enough use case

[13:14:02.0000] <JoePeck>
if you want to get something by typing a URI into your big honking location bar

[13:14:03.0000] <JoePeck>
what would you suggest then?

[13:14:04.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: You need a more specific use case.

[13:14:05.0000] <mookid>
I'd suggest if you're putting a URI into a browser you want HTML

[13:14:06.0000] <mookid>
:)

[13:14:07.0000] <JoePeck>
if not embedding the mime type into the URI (like .xml or .json) you're going to need 2 peices

[13:14:08.0000] <mookid>
but say..

[13:14:09.0000] <mookid>
I fancy pdf

[13:15:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: Just, "it depends on context" isn't very specific.

[13:15:01.0000] <JoePeck>
ahh, I don't like that =(

[13:15:02.0000] <mookid>
you don't like that if the resources are differnet

[13:15:03.0000] <mookid>
if the resources are different they need different URIs

[13:15:04.0000] <mookid>
if they are the same they need the same URI

[13:15:05.0000] <JoePeck>
gsnedders_: seems decent enough.  If your application wants to to force the browser to interpret things in a certain way then you should be allowed to?

[13:15:06.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: Something like, "I want to make available a PDF representation of the document", is a lot more precise

[13:16:00.0000] <mookid>
gsnedders_: I gave you an example

[13:16:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: Where?

[13:16:02.0000] <mookid>
I have an application that has /resource I want to link to

[13:16:03.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: But why do you want to override the Accept header?

[13:16:04.0000] <mookid>
and on another HTML5 page I want to link to both the json and xml

[13:16:05.0000] <mookid>
I CANT DO THAT

[13:16:06.0000] <mookid>
WITHOUT AN ACCEPT ATTRIBUTE

[13:16:07.0000] <JoePeck>
whoa. calm down

[13:16:08.0000] <gsnedders_>
Why do you want to link to both?

[13:16:09.0000] <inimino>
mookid: then you have two resources, get over it

[13:17:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
To give a use-case, you need to answer that.

[13:17:01.0000] <mookid>
because I want to give my clients a hyperlink to both states

[13:17:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
Why?

This is what I was trying to say previously.

ezyang: It does have that implication, actually

[13:20:05.0000] <takkaria>
you should just call it document.html and document.pdf

[13:20:06.0000] <mookid>
takkaria: then you don't understand the HTTP or URI spec and don't belong in this discussion

[13:20:07.0000] <JoePeck>
takkaria: "could" not should

[13:20:08.0000] <jgraham>
No one tries opening a URI that works in their web browser in their PDF viewer and expects to get a PDF back

[13:20:09.0000] <takkaria>
mostly because it just works, and in this world-wide web of indifference, something that just works is pretty good

[13:21:00.0000] <ezyang>
Now, my interpretation of the matter is that PDF has a distinct identity from the HTML document. 

[13:21:01.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: I don't understand the harshness...

[13:21:02.0000] <mookid>
because of the shit I went through last time

[13:21:03.0000] <mookid>
and blatant ignorance

[13:21:04.0000] <ezyang>
So, a more appropriate URI for it would be foo?publishable 

[13:21:05.0000] <ezyang>
To carry the semantic meaning of this other resource. 

[13:22:00.0000] <ezyang>
And like it or not, "pdf" very concisely expresses the semantics you expect. 

[13:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
JoePeck: mookid is somewhat bitter because he spent something like two days ranting about this before and people refused to accept that they were ignorant heathens 

[13:22:02.0000] <JoePeck>
lol, okay thanks for the context

[13:22:03.0000] <JoePeck>
I see what he wants

[13:22:04.0000] <ezyang>
A more reasonable use-case for negotiation is .jpg and .png, where joe user sees no difference between them. 

[13:22:05.0000] <jgraham>
and he was the only one who understood the web architecture

[13:22:06.0000] <JoePeck>
but ultimately, I just see putting it the URI as much easier

[13:22:07.0000] <mookid>
the main gain for sticking to single URIs for multiple representations of the same resource is the cache invalidation you get across all representations of a resource when you modify the resource

[13:22:08.0000] <Dashiva>
Who started the time machine in here?

[13:23:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm not the only one

[13:23:01.0000] <mookid>
Philip` got it

[13:23:02.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: is there no way in HTTP

[13:23:03.0000] <mookid>
it's pointless anyway there's HTTP functionality you are denying developpers on the basis that "you don't think it's really necessary"

[13:23:04.0000] <JoePeck>
to make two URIs equivalent?

[13:24:00.0000] <mookid>
no

[13:24:01.0000] <JoePeck>
/me puts up shield

[13:24:02.0000] <mookid>
URIs are opaque

[13:24:03.0000] <mookid>
good question :)

[13:24:04.0000] <jgraham>
mookid: I get the idea. I get the fact that some people think it would be nice if things worked that way. I think it is impractical in reality

[13:24:05.0000] <mookid>
what?!

[13:24:06.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: Should we allow every single HTTP header to be set by the page?

[13:24:07.0000] <mookid>
actually I dont think that's a bad idea

[13:24:08.0000] <Philip`>
I don't entirely remember whether I got it

[13:24:09.0000] <Philip`>
or what it even was

[13:24:10.0000] <JoePeck>
so this could be solved in HTTP by making two URIs have an equivalent HTTP cache uri?

[13:24:11.0000] <Philip`>
and whatever it was, I guess I didn't keep it

[13:25:00.0000] <mookid>
JoePeck: that means you have to couple your caching mechanisms to your application

[13:25:01.0000] <mookid>
it's inefficient and brittle

[13:25:02.0000] <JoePeck>
no the HTTP client

[13:25:03.0000] <mookid>
yeah again

[13:25:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Did you get it now, or the last time mookid was here?

[13:25:05.0000] <mookid>
you can do that but it's coupling to your application

[13:26:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me gets the idea, gets why people want multiple representations of a single URI, but thinks some things (like changing content-type) are impractical in the real world

[13:26:01.0000] <mookid>
that's not your choice.

[13:26:02.0000] <mookid>
just support the protocol

[13:26:03.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: is it? if you have /resource.html and /resource.pdf can you return and say these are both "/resource" and thus invalidate the cache when one changes

[13:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: The last time

[13:26:05.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: What should @accept do on protocols apart from HTTP?

[13:26:06.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I haven't bothered reading the conversation this time, since it seems exactly the same as before

[13:28:00.0000] <mookid>
erm

[13:28:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: Also, what else in HTML is specific to HTTP?

[13:28:02.0000] <mookid>
what?

[13:28:03.0000] <mookid>
POST?

[13:28:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me has no idea where the http protocol mandates that HTML pages should be able to change the browser headers via the DOM

[13:28:05.0000] <gsnedders_>
mookid: HTML isn't tied to HTTP, by and large. form@method I guess is, but otherwise not

[13:28:06.0000] <mookid>
jgraham: yeah bad luck it's not spelled out for you

[13:28:07.0000] <mookid>
probably a bit much.

[13:28:08.0000] <mookid>
wouldn't worry about it too much

[13:28:09.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Also I'm distracted by watching pretty graphs and hoping Slashdot doesn't hurt my server

[13:28:10.0000] <takkaria>
/me puts up a Don't Feed The Troll sign (scare quotes implied) and goes to make risotto

[13:28:11.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: what about what I said before

[13:28:12.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me goes to get washing

[13:28:13.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: What type of risotto?

[13:28:14.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: just a mushroom and pepper one, nothing fancy

[13:28:15.0000] <mookid>
JoePeck: there's nothing stopping you introducing that kind of logic into your client or caches

[13:28:16.0000] <JoePeck>
as it exists right now is that possible? Or does that mean the browser can only cache 1 representation of /resource at a time?

[13:28:17.0000] <mookid>
but that's the opposite philosophy underlying HTTP

[13:28:18.0000] <jgraham>
/me is just enjoying a break from packing

[13:29:00.0000] <mookid>
URIs are meant to be *opaque* which means that if they aren't the same - they aren't the same

[13:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Have you covered the "multiple representations of the same URL confuses users" angle yet?

[13:29:02.0000] <mookid>
nothing more complicated

[13:29:03.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: okay, I don't see what you mean this time. I've gotten all the REST (hahaha, my puns...)

[13:29:04.0000] <mookid>
Dashiva: that is utterly irrelevant but thanks a bunch

[13:29:05.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Did that one

[13:29:06.0000] <JoePeck>
hmm okay

[13:29:07.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: Was it dismissed out of hand like last time?

[13:29:08.0000] <mookid>
it's irrelevant

[13:30:00.0000] <mookid>
it's not your descision

[13:30:01.0000] <JoePeck>
I would say developers are not users =)

[13:30:02.0000] <JoePeck>
we have to deal with this crap because we made it that way =)

[13:30:03.0000] <JoePeck>
if we can't make it usable to our users it was our own fault

[13:30:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: You are on slashdot?

[13:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
JoePeck: Regular users deal with URLs, though. They should be able to do so without having to learn about http black magic

[13:31:01.0000] <mookid>
Dashiva: you don't know what you're tlaking about and even if you did it's not your place to decide for the world how that's dgoing to work

[13:31:02.0000] <JoePeck>
well, lets say you put a URL into your browsers address bar

[13:31:03.0000] <JoePeck>
and get back a popup saying

[13:31:04.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Yes

[13:31:05.0000] <JoePeck>
"Would you like this in HTML, PDF, or XML"

[13:31:06.0000] <mookid>
haha

[13:31:07.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Where?

[13:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: hence the worrying about it

[13:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: http://slashdot.org/

[13:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I was hoping for something more specific

[13:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/07/15/170217

[13:33:00.0000] <mookid>
JoePeck: so yep there you go - we don't need an accept attribute because we can "just put it in the URI"

[13:33:01.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: well, I understand what you're going for.  And actually I do agree with you.  But I think too few people care about getting it right when you can just take the easy way out

[13:33:02.0000] <mookid>
yup pretty much it

[13:33:03.0000] <mookid>
just ignorance basically

[13:33:04.0000] <JoePeck>
who cares if your cache has a .html and .pdf representation out of date

[13:33:05.0000] <JoePeck>
is what it boils down to, for me

[13:34:00.0000] <JoePeck>
mookid: cheers on sticking up for yourself though =)

[13:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: The game looks nice

[13:34:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Between a few developers and all the users, the users get priority. That's just how it is.

[13:35:00.0000] <mookid>
it's got nothing to do with that

[13:35:01.0000] <mookid>
you're not a fucking gatekeeper

[13:36:00.0000] <mookid>
excuse my language 

[13:36:01.0000] <mookid>
but that is the *most* pathetic response

[13:36:02.0000] <mookid>
out of the lot

[13:36:03.0000] <JoePeck>
Dashiva: how many users use FTP even though they don't know how its done under the hood. How many people know DNS is complicated yet it just works. Speaking of "it just works" Apple does magic with DNS to get Bonjour working and the User never knows.  I think usability always has a solution (my 2¢)

[13:36:04.0000] <Dashiva>
JoePeck: Usability is why we use URLs instead of contenet negotiation

[13:36:05.0000] <mookid>
jesus

[13:36:06.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It's quite a long way from being a decently playable game, though :-(

[13:37:00.0000] <JoePeck>
Well, I'm going to stop here

[13:37:01.0000] <mookid>
:)

[13:37:02.0000] <JoePeck>
I could argue though =)

[13:37:03.0000] <mookid>
now you might understand why I approach it the way I do

[13:37:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, trolling always works. Keep it up.

[13:37:05.0000] <JoePeck>
well, sorry, but I don't think yelling would ever open up someone elses mind like this debate would

[13:38:00.0000] <mookid>
Dashiva: you're form of trolling is far more irritating

[13:38:01.0000] <JoePeck>
need to have happen in order for the other side to get the "aha" moment

[13:38:02.0000] <Dashiva>
mookid: Maybe one day you will sit down and consider the possibility that you might just be wrong. Just maybe.

[13:38:03.0000] <mookid>
well I'm not

[13:39:00.0000] <JoePeck>
ultimately I think you're right.  They haven't given you a good reason that you aren't (cause you aren't)

[13:39:01.0000] <mookid>
and I'm betting I've given this more though than you.

[13:39:02.0000] <mookid>
since it's my proposal and everything

[13:39:03.0000] <mookid>
+ you're primary reason for resistance (i.e. protecting *your* poor users) is pretty silly 

[13:40:00.0000] <mookid>
the crazy thing about this is that it doesnt stop you carrying on using the URI

[13:40:01.0000] <JoePeck>
I said I was going to stop, and I will now =)

[13:40:02.0000] <JoePeck>
cheers

[13:40:03.0000] <mookid>
cheers Joe

[13:40:04.0000] <mookid>
:)

[13:41:00.0000] <mookid>
only case I can see you getting pissy about is page refresh

[13:42:00.0000] <mookid>
but if each page request is a state

[13:42:01.0000] <mookid>
that includes all the headers

[13:42:02.0000] <mookid>
then refresh should work fine

[13:44:00.0000] <mookid>
but that is really my own problem - if you don't like it and want to use browser defaults and URI conneg then you can continue to and ignore the accept attribute all together

[13:44:01.0000] <mookid>
there's no reason we can't do both together

[13:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
mookid: As a piece of general advice, if you want to convince people of something, particularly something that they are sceptical of, being pissy doesn't help. 

[13:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
In fact quite the opposite

[13:51:01.0000] <mookid>
yeah need a ciggy :)

[13:51:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me is aware he isn't saintly

[13:52:00.0000] <mookid>
well sorry for being a nob head

force of habit

[13:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: You may want to updat your bio

[13:54:00.0000] <mookid>
the popular HTTP-centric API for java called JAX-RS only supports HTTP conneg

[13:54:01.0000] <mookid>
so it's not just me :P

[13:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It's only about five years out of date

[13:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It misses out > 20% of your life

[14:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me 's SVN server is currently doing about 30Mbit/s, which probably isn't a lot in absolute terms but it seems like quite a bit when you've scaled up from an average ~50kbit/s a few days ago

[14:13:00.0000] <mookid>
you got pr0n on a svn server?

[14:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
No

[15:21:00.0000] <Hixie>

hi all

[21:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: hey

[21:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
HOT in Tokyo

[21:34:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith:  hi Mike. How’s things?

[21:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hot

[21:34:02.0000] <boblet>
haha, was just gonna ask that :D

[21:34:03.0000] <boblet>
Sorry I haven’t uploaded that photo of you to Flickr yet (hehehe)

[21:35:00.0000] <boblet>
was good to catch up and meet your team too

[21:37:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith:  does the spec explicitly state that things like incorrect nesting are wrong? I could only find nesting mentioned in an error handling example…

[21:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: no, not about incorrect nesting specifically

[21:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't know what you'd classify as other things like incorrect nesting

[21:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: lemme qualify that statement

[21:41:01.0000] <boblet>
The good coding practices that were taught via XHTML—closing elements, not dropping optional elements that add meaning etc

[21:41:02.0000] <boblet>
non-tag soup stuff

[21:41:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
those are best practices, not errors

[21:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
misnested tags are a real error

[21:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
a parsing error

[21:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
not dropping optional elements is a best practice

[21:42:03.0000] <boblet>
aah ok. but neither are currently mentioned right?

[21:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
those best-practice things, no

[21:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
IMHO, those are not appropriate for the spec

[21:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but should just be in authoring guides instead

[21:43:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
in particular, closing elements for which the end tag is not required is an optional authoring choice

[21:43:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
in the case of the HTML syntax

[21:43:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
in the XHTML syntax, it is a parse error

[21:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because end tags are always required in XHTML

[21:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, either that or self-closing start tags

[21:44:02.0000] <boblet>
ok—thanks for the clarification

[21:44:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
about misnested tags in particular

[21:44:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
the spec does not explicitly define what misnested tags are 

[21:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or define what misnesting of tags is

[21:45:01.0000] <boblet>
the old <b><i></b></i> chestnut is in 9.2.8

[21:45:02.0000] <boblet>
but only as an example

[21:45:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
what it does say explicitly is, "an elements contents must be contained within the element's start tag and end tag"

[21:45:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
or something very similar to that

[21:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
(despite the quotes, I'm paraphrasing from memory)

[21:46:01.0000] <boblet>
heh, was gonna ask you for a reference there

[21:46:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie reckons that statement is clear enough. but IMHO it could be clearer

[21:46:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
see the Writing HTML documents section

[21:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#elements-0

[21:48:01.0000] <boblet>
got it

[21:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
"The contents of the element must be placed between just after the start tag (which might be implied, in certain cases) and just before the end tag (which again, might be implied in certain cases)."

[21:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but if you have some specific proposed text that you think would make it more clear, that would be great

[21:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
i added more about that to the intro recently

[21:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: URL?

[21:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#a-quick-introduction-to-html

[21:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
"Tags have to be nested correctly"

[21:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool

[21:50:03.0000] <boblet>
aah—that’s what I was after. Thanks Hixie

[21:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why anyone would ever get to the conclusion that <b>...<i>...</b>...</i> would be correct, though -- so i don't understand why we need to explicitly say it's wrong

[21:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's never been right

[21:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
why would anyone even consider that it might be right?

[21:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
now we need to define what "nested correctly" means

[21:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I can see somebody who's not familiar with HTML or markup thinking it should be fine

[21:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
how can it ever be a valid representation of a tree?

[21:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's not absolutely intuitively wrong

[21:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
my not-familar-with-HTML person would respond, "um, What's a tree?"

[21:52:03.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: that’s why you’re a spec writer and cat wrangler, and not teaching people how to code :D people are … creative

[21:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
people who don't know what a tree are shouldn't be reading the spec (at least not without learning what a tree is) -- the whole spec is designed based on the tree concept

[21:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
true

[21:54:01.0000] <boblet>
unfortunately I think a lot of authors still feel the spec (or an official version of it) should be written for them

[21:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
well lachlan is working on a guide

[21:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i can't write the normative spec without referencing trees

[21:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
not in a comprehensible fashion, anyway

[21:55:03.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: are there any plans on expanding your “HTML5: The Markup Language” into an author’s guide?

[21:55:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
no

[21:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
no plans for expanding it all beyond the very limited scope it has now

[21:56:01.0000] <boblet>
it’ll be interesting to see what Lachlan comes up with

[21:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I prefer contracting rather than expanding

[21:56:03.0000] <boblet>
hehe

[21:56:04.0000] <boblet>
delegating works well too

[21:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
expanding is one of the biggest problems we have in spec/standards development

[21:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
"scope creep"

[21:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
start out with a small, focused information need, then add enough people, next thing you're doing is project SpaceX 

[21:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
building a rocket ship to the moon

[21:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's not just in standards development, actually

[22:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
in my experience in product development, it's pretty much the same with functional specs

[22:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
especially if you involve the customer

[22:00:02.0000] <boblet>
well, everyone wants more

[22:00:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I guess so

[22:00:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
you solve that problem by not trying to make everybody happy

[22:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
by realizing that you *can't* make everybody happy

[22:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and instead try to get done what's actually most important and most necessary

[22:01:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me puts his schoolmarm cap on

[22:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, about misnested tags, for somebody who doesn't think of HTML in terms of trees or tags as delimiters, but instead as, say, flags or something, then it's not obvious

[22:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, those people are dunces

[22:04:02.0000] <boblet>
now now

[22:05:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: schoolmarms are supposed to be both prim and *proper*

[22:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
replace it with whatever politically-correct words

[22:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
jesus wept

[22:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
http://daten.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/src/cc-license-markup/generator2.xhtml

[22:05:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[22:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
only took like 3 hours for someone to make that - three hours after they learnt of the existence of the feature

[22:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's in addition to jgraham and Philip` both implementing parsers for microdata within 24 horus of the feature being invented

[22:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's something about microdata that really makes people code!

[22:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
wish i knew what it was so i could reproduce it in other specs

[22:06:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
good old itemprop

[22:06:04.0000] <boblet>
har!

[22:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nice but hardly seems to me at least like an indicator that microdata is taking the world by storm

[22:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
one dude plus jgraham plus Philip` 

[22:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh it's clearly not yet

[22:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's hardly even enough for a human wave

[22:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just amazed at how people learn about it and code something within literally hours

[22:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think i've ever specced anything else that has had that effect

[22:08:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
there's a lot people paying attention, that's for sure

[22:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and people want to try out new stuff 

[22:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I guess much or most of the other stuff you're thinking of is stuff that requires native support in browsers

[22:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe

[22:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
this doesn't, so people can try it more quickly and do stuff with it

[22:10:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and people do want to use new stuff from HTML5

[22:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
even if all they're doing is changig their doctype to <!doctype html5>

[22:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in some cases

[22:11:02.0000] <boblet>
speaking of itemprop, was my feedback in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0489.html to the right place?

[22:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: yeah it's on the pile

[22:12:00.0000] <boblet>
cool—just wanted to check I wasn’t doing it wrong

[22:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, I want to complete my thought on misnested tags, for what it's worth (which is basically nothing, but I'll do it anyway)

[22:13:00.0000] <boblet>
please do

[22:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
don't encourage me

[22:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
dangerous

[22:13:03.0000] <boblet>
har!

[22:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can imagine somebody seeing a <b> start tag a sort of just meaning "bold on" and </b> end tag as "bold off", and they can turn on and off wherever

[22:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's all

[22:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
not a brilliant point

[22:14:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
but point nonetheless

[22:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
sure, if they don't realise that tags represent elements, but think they represent on-off flags, then that makes sense

[22:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
clearly many people do

[22:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
but if you get to the point in the HTML5 spec where you are looking at the syntax, then you'd better have realigned your worldview by then, because otherwise you really haven't been paying attention :-)

[22:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway i try to introduce the idea of elements vs on-off in the intro

[22:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
i can make it even more explicit if you want

[22:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. i could include an actual DOM tree

[22:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
send mail if you think that would help

[22:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: or post some suggested text to this bug:

[22:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6953

[22:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[22:18:00.0000] <boblet>
ok, if I can find a better way of wording it…

[22:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: as for my "dunce" comment I'm reminded of this quote from Doug Crockford

[22:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
"I've discovered that most of the world's body of JavaScript programs is crap."

[22:19:00.0000] <boblet>
that’s more stating the obvious than dunce :P j/k

[22:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
my point being that in general, we are not dealing with geniuses here

[22:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, I retract that wording

[22:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's an unkind way to put it

[22:20:02.0000] <boblet>
I do think that authors have the idea that the spec is for them (rather than implementors), and the lack of best practices from an author perspective makes it harder for authors to learn

[22:21:00.0000] <boblet>
as you say they should buy a book, but I think because the spec is official authors treat it as canon

[22:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: I personally think there's too much best-practices stuff in the spec already, and that most of what is in there that could be seen as best-practices authoring info should be a different document

[22:23:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: I think it’d be a great idea to have a ‘for implementors’ version and a ‘for authors’ version. Not practical now, but later on…

[22:23:01.0000] <boblet>
I think that’d be the biggest thing you could do to improve the level of coding across the web

[22:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think instead we should just do what other standards-development organizations do, and make the specs totally unfriendly to non-implementors

[22:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
even down to the formatting

[22:24:02.0000] <boblet>
har! ummm… you think they’re not already? ;-)

[22:24:03.0000] <boblet>
granted, you could try a lot harder

[22:24:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
forget HTML, we give you plain text. eff off if you don't like it

[23:15:00.0000] <boblet>
later all

[00:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: proposal: add a separate warnings.sch file for "Conforming but obsolete" attributes, with a note in the README explaiining what it's for

[00:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
good idea? bad idea?

[00:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: good idea.

[00:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK, I'll open a bug

[00:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because I probably won't get to it today and I'll need a reminder

[00:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but if you get to it before me, lemme know

[00:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me counts

[00:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
only 5 attributes, so I guess it'll be quick to do

[00:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders if he can manage to do it before he has to change trains

[00:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=621

[00:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I assigned it to myself

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: thanks

[01:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: if/when you have a minute, I'm still trying to wrap my head around what kinds of deployments of Web sockets we might expect to see. Right now, thinking in particular about if/how it needs to work with existing Web servers

[01:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so, a question -

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
classic example would be gmail's IM application

[01:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
imagining that somebody implements a module for Apache that adds WebSockets protocol support

[01:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me nods

[01:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: so that IM app would not be implemented with an actual Web server at all anyway

[01:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
tyoshino: hello

[01:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: well, right now it is, using XHR and long polling and all that. But yeah, it'd be much better just to have a dedicated IM server.

[01:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[01:18:01.0000] <tyoshino>
hello!

[01:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: assuming if somebody did add a module to Apache to do the actual handshake stuff, I guess I don't understand what would happen after that

[01:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean, it's not a Web server anymore after that

[01:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
well there are two ways one could integrate this with apache

[01:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
for the IM case

[01:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
either you could have a dedicated apache module that, after the handshake, does exactly what the dedicated IM server we just talked about would do

[01:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
or, you have an apache module that is someone like the CGI module, in that after the handshake, it hands the socket over to some other script, and that script does the chatting back and forth

[01:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: OK, thanks

[01:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I understand the specific-application dedicated module case fine

[01:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Google FAIL. Searching for AWWW doesn't find me the Architecture but pictures of cute hegdehogs.

[01:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
tyoshino: hot in Tokyo

[01:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wish I was in Karuizawa today

[01:58:01.0000] <tyoshino>
Yeah

[01:58:02.0000] <tyoshino>
Mee too :) Hot is okay but high humidity is really really bad.

[01:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[02:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
tyoshino: maybe if you guys have a developer who's an Apache hacker, he/she could implement a Websockets module for Apache

[02:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
mod_websocket

[02:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47485

[02:08:00.0000] <tyoshino>
I see.

[02:10:00.0000] <tyoshino>
I dunno if there's such people. Our working plan for server is still in flux.

[02:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
tyoshino: I guess you will need some server-side thing to test against anyway. though it doesn't need to be a full Web server of course

[02:11:01.0000] <tyoshino>
Yes.

[02:13:00.0000] <tyoshino>
As Fumitoshi wrote in the design documents, we're developing a simple Web Socket server by Python for testing.

[02:14:00.0000] <tyoshino>
That's only server-side work we're doing for now.

[02:14:01.0000] <remysharp>
tyoshino: have you seen the obited.org project? it might cover some of what you're doing

[02:15:00.0000] <tyoshino>
Oh, really? Looking...

[02:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks around Michael Carter

[02:18:01.0000] <tyoshino>
I see. Maybe this one http://orbited.org/svn/orbited/branches/0.5/daemon/orbited/websocket.py

[02:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
tyoshino: talk to Michael Carter

[02:18:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
wherever he is

[02:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there was a period of time when he was on #whatwg quite a bit

[02:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but that's been a while

[02:19:02.0000] <tyoshino>
ok. thanks for the info.

[02:19:03.0000] <tyoshino>
thanks, mike and remysharp.

[02:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I dunno I rather like cute pictures of hedgehogs

[02:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
although Architecture of the World Wide Web does appear half way down the first page for me

[02:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: so I know that the summary attribute is now listed in "Conforming but obsolete features" section, but I see that the "Content attributes" field for the table element still just has only "Global attributes", without "summary"

[02:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah the top half of the spec doesn't list any of the things that trigger teh warnings

[02:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[02:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Did element.spellcheck previously return true/false (as booleans?)

[02:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_03/hedgehogSOLENT2708_800x495.jpg

[02:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Did Philip`really just drag this channel down to the lows of the Daily Mail?

[02:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
gsnedders: yes

[02:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: so is it accurate to now say that in the current draft, "the summary attribute on the table element is now valid, with a requirement for validators to warn that it is obsolete"?

[02:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Sorry, I was just following the link from http://www.fupenguin.com/2009/02/clearly-lemurs-have-zero-personality.html :-(

[02:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
my daughter says my mustache makes me look like a ハリネズミ、which I think is same as hedgehog

[02:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
Initially I assumed that the title of that blog was some sort of anti-linux rant

[02:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: No, it's just anti-penguin

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: yes

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: it's accurate, though it's not how i would put it :-)

[02:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I already answered myself.

[02:44:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: OK

[02:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i was answering your earlier question

[02:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: So was I.

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[02:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
i thought you were answering your Philip` question

[02:45:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: how would you word it?

[02:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
"The summary attribute is obsolete. Use one of these many other techniques instead."

[02:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can see that's accurate, but less precise

[02:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: It is more helpful for authors though

[02:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: it's missing a piece of information, which is that the attribute is also "conformant"

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: personally i'm fine with not mentioning that :-)

[02:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
I didn't disagree that it was less precise. But given a binary choice between thw two formulations I would go with the one that gives the best advice on how to produce a useful document, not on how to produce a conformant document

[02:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
(in practice such a binary choice is not necessary)

[02:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
people are going to figure it out anyway

[02:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and describe it in their own terms

[02:51:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
regardless of how we put it

[02:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
How to produce a useful document or the fact that summmary is conforming?

[02:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: that summary is listed in the spec as a "Conforming but obsolete feature"

[02:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: All the more reason to focus we we write on how to produce a useful document then

[02:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"content attribute" means an element.getAttribute() attribute?

[02:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Yes - content attributes are attributes in the DOM, while DOM attributes are properties in JS

[02:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I think)

[03:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[03:23:00.0000] <mookid>
the Accept header drama continues! http://newmediacampaigns.com/page/webkit-team-admits-accept-header-error#comments :D

[03:25:00.0000] <mookid>
I didn't include a 'full' use case though so I'm probably wrong

[03:25:01.0000] <mookid>
-_-

[03:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mookid: is that your blog?

[03:26:01.0000] <mookid>
no that's my comment

[03:26:02.0000] <mookid>
I'm mike

[03:26:03.0000] <mookid>
KrisJordan is some other dude building a PHP REST framework

[03:26:04.0000] <mookid>
smart guy

[03:27:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm the one with the charming smile

[03:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
the Accept header (and conneg in general) is such a bad idea

[03:27:02.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: 

[03:27:03.0000] <mookid>
care to elaborate?

[03:27:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I must say that lengthy blog posts are not my favorite way to receive bug reports

[03:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's hugely complex

[03:27:06.0000] <mookid>
good lord

[03:27:07.0000] <Hixie>
and it doesn't really do anything useful

[03:28:00.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: read my response

[03:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's confusing to people

[03:28:02.0000] <mookid>
caching is useful.

[03:28:03.0000] <mookid>
layering is useful

[03:28:04.0000] <othermaciej>
also turning my reddit comment into a pretext for a second equally lengthy blog post is also kinda weak

[03:28:05.0000] <mookid>
uniform resource identifiers are important

[03:28:06.0000] <Hixie>
conneg screws up caching, too

[03:28:07.0000] <mookid>
no it doesnt

[03:28:08.0000] <mookid>
that's what the Vary header is for

[03:28:09.0000] <mookid>
know about that?

[03:28:10.0000] <Hixie>
Vary is another disaster :-)

[03:28:11.0000] <othermaciej>
multiple representations for one URI is not really a useful feature IMO

[03:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
mookid: hey! long time no see

[03:29:01.0000] <mookid>
yo dude

[03:29:02.0000] <mookid>
=)

[03:29:03.0000] <othermaciej>
generally using multiple URIs is better

[03:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[03:29:05.0000] <mookid>
did you even read my comment?

[03:29:06.0000] <othermaciej>
so I guess I agree with Matthe Markus

[03:29:07.0000] <Hixie>
i wish HTTP had never introduced conneg

[03:29:08.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: do you know anything about REST at all?

[03:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
haven't read yours yet

[03:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I must admit that REST is a belief system I don't fully comprehend

[03:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i'm not a big fan of REST

[03:30:03.0000] <mookid>
well

[03:30:04.0000] <mookid>
if you aren't

[03:30:05.0000] <mookid>
that's frankly irrelevant

[03:30:06.0000] <mookid>
and the fact that one ofthe key architects of HTTP

[03:30:07.0000] <Hixie>
you brought it up :-)

[03:30:08.0000] <mookid>
defined REST

[03:30:09.0000] <jgraham>
Just because something has a fancy acyronym and a PhD thesis doesn't mean that it's right

[03:30:10.0000] <mookid>
it's can't be wrong

[03:30:11.0000] <othermaciej>
Roy Fielding is kind of a blowhard

[03:31:00.0000] <mookid>
he wrote the fecking RFC

[03:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: Appeal to authority doesn't mean it is right.

[03:31:02.0000] <takkaria>
/me giggles a little

[03:31:03.0000] <mookid>
it's nothing to do with authority and everything to do with common fecking sense

[03:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'm all for using methods on URLs instead of doing everything using POST data

[03:31:05.0000] <mookid>
the simpole fact is

[03:31:06.0000] <mookid>
we can live together

[03:31:07.0000] <mookid>
with you using URIs badly

[03:31:08.0000] <mookid>
and me using them properly

[03:31:09.0000] <mookid>
if you just include the mechanism in the spec

[03:31:10.0000] <Hixie>
but IMHO using the same URL for multiple "representations" is just taking it too far

[03:31:11.0000] <MikeSmith>
Kris Jordan.. I think we've discovered who Mr. Last Week is. some similarities there

[03:31:12.0000] <Hixie>
in the other direction

[03:31:13.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: Oh bollocks I forgot the DVDs again

[03:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: no worries, I'll live :)

[03:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
Sorry

[03:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: nah, Kris Jordan may think his pet bug is the most important in the universe, but he doesn't descend into the scatological

[03:32:03.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: HTTP provides the mechanism whether you like it or not, I should be able to use it - and the only reason I won't in HTML is because you don't *think* it's right

[03:33:00.0000] <mookid>
and the only reason you can provide is

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll have to add HTTP to the list of specs I have to go fix once I'm done fixing HTML :-)

[03:33:02.0000] <mookid>
'the client and intemediary implementations don't work properly'

[03:33:03.0000] <mookid>
well they don't work properly

[03:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's not the only reason

[03:33:05.0000] <mookid>
becausenobody uses them

[03:33:06.0000] <Hixie>
i just think it's a bad idea

[03:33:07.0000] <mookid>
because they arent practical at the moment

[03:33:08.0000] <mookid>
because HTML and browsers are crap

[03:34:00.0000] <mookid>
it's a self-fulfilling prophecy of The Stupid(tm)

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
the whole conneg thing, and the multiple files per URL thing, are IMHO unnecessary complexity that don't really solve any important problems that can't be solved more easily in simpler, already-usable manners

[03:34:02.0000] <mookid>
did you read my comment

[03:34:03.0000] <mookid>
about layering?

[03:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[03:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: What if someone were to try and shoot you whilst you were walking home and, had you had the DVDs, they would have stopped the bullet?

[03:35:01.0000] <mookid>
well how do you suppose that you fix that issue of cache invalidation?

[03:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I read your comment about caching

[03:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not really applicable to individual tweets, since they are not supposed to change

[03:35:04.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: hmm, I'll just have to put my ipod where I would have put the DVDs, I imagine it's thickert anyhow :)

[03:35:05.0000] <othermaciej>
it might apply to a twitter *feed*

[03:36:00.0000] <mookid>
ok ok but let's hypothetically suppose that twitter allowed you to update a tweet

[03:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but PUT would not be the right way to update a twitter feed, and it would be wrong to give a twitter feed a long cache lifetime

[03:36:02.0000] <mookid>
which is perfectly feasible and useful functionality

[03:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: what you describe doesn't help either -- if one person has downloaded the tweet, and you PUT to it, how does their cache get invalidated?

[03:36:04.0000] <mookid>
that's client side caching

[03:36:05.0000] <mookid>
not intemedirary caching

[03:36:06.0000] <othermaciej>
if tweets can be updated at any time, they can't have a long cache lifetime

[03:36:07.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: if you have a different intemedirary [six] cache, it is

[03:37:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm talking server side reverse proxy caches.. you know.. those things that are SUPER efficient

[03:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(intermediary caches and client caches follow the same expiration rules)

[03:37:02.0000] <mookid>
and allow you to SCALE an application

[03:37:03.0000] <mookid>
when you're actually building REAL applications

[03:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
the server-side caches can do whatever you want, you control them

[03:37:05.0000] <mookid>
instead of hypothetical use cases

[03:37:06.0000] <Philip`>
("six"?)

[03:37:07.0000] <mookid>
YES

[03:37:08.0000] <Hixie>
sic, sorry

[03:37:09.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: yeah you can

[03:37:10.0000] <mookid>
and if you have to teach it about URI structures

[03:37:11.0000] <mookid>
and dot notation

[03:37:12.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: so when you PUT to foo.bar, clear the cache for foo.*

[03:37:13.0000] <mookid>
it's coupled to your appp

[03:38:00.0000] <mookid>
that's tight coupling and that's bad news

[03:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if you have multiple reverse proxy servers, you need custom logic to keep their caches valid

[03:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if you have exactly one, that doesn't sound very scalable to me

[03:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: how do you propose to invalidate the cache for the feeds when you PUT to the tweet?

[03:38:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I think you meant "six [sex]"

[03:38:05.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: what? any PUT would invalidate all caches for that resource

[03:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: the feed is a different resource

[03:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the feed is a different resource than any individual tweets in it

[03:39:02.0000] <mookid>
yeah..?

[03:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but it depends on the content of all tweets in it

[03:39:04.0000] <mookid>
a feed should be a series of links

[03:39:05.0000] <Hixie>
so how would it get invalidated when you update the tweet?

[03:39:06.0000] <mookid>
if you can't design hypermedia systems properly that's not my problem

[03:39:07.0000] <Hixie>
or when you add a new tweet?

[03:39:08.0000] <mookid>
well

[03:39:09.0000] <mookid>
look

[03:39:10.0000] <Philip`>
mookid: So if you want to read a feed containing n messages, you'd have to make n+1 HTTP requests?

[03:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm quite capable of designing a hypermedia system, i'm just asking you how you would do it since you seem to want a particular weird feature that as far as i can tell, doesn't work

[03:40:01.0000] <mookid>
feed : [ "/tweet/123", "/tweet/1234", etc.. ]

[03:40:02.0000] <mookid>
that's my feed

[03:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
twitter would be pretty useless if instead of a stream of tweets, the UI was a page of links to tweets

[03:40:04.0000] <mookid>
oh look

[03:40:05.0000] <mookid>
HYPERMEDIA

[03:40:06.0000] <Philip`>
mookid: That doesn't seem very scalable

[03:40:07.0000] <mookid>
that's how hyperlinks work

[03:40:08.0000] <mookid>
and it's very scalable

[03:40:09.0000] <Hixie>
you're not answering the question

[03:40:10.0000] <mookid>
yes it is

[03:41:00.0000] <mookid>
you're asking me how it would invalidate the feed if you updated

[03:41:01.0000] <mookid>
if wouldn't

[03:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't imagine how n+1 requests vs 1 request is scalable, particularly since n might get very large

[03:41:03.0000] <mookid>
that's the trade off of REST vs. RPC

[03:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: how would a DELETE to a tweet invalidate the cache for the feed?

[03:41:05.0000] <othermaciej>
so basically you are saying that the UI of twitter is intrinsically not RESTful?

[03:41:06.0000] <mookid>
exactly

[03:41:07.0000] <othermaciej>
(since it is a page of content, not a page of links)

[03:42:00.0000] <mookid>
it's semi restful

[03:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
REST sounds like a huge waste of time then

[03:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
sounds to me like mookid just proved that REST is a bad idea

[03:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm impressed

[03:42:04.0000] <mookid>
what?

[03:42:05.0000] <othermaciej>
if it can't be used to build useful apps like Twitter

[03:42:06.0000] <mookid>
IT CAN

[03:42:07.0000] <mookid>
it's just isnt

[03:42:08.0000] <Philip`>
There's a difference between being "a huge waste of time"/"a bad idea", and being unsuitable for some subset of use cases

[03:42:09.0000] <othermaciej>
if you change the UI of Twitter to be useless it can

[03:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm still curious about how a DELETE to a tweet would invalidate the cache for the feed

[03:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
I bet a cheese sandwich is intrisically not RESTful either

[03:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but a page of links to dozens of 140 character messages would be a poor UI

[03:43:03.0000] <mookid>
it's hillarious that you todgers have such a problem with the style used IN THE DESIGN OF THE HTTP PROTOCOL

[03:43:04.0000] <mookid>
hello...?!

[03:43:05.0000] <takkaria>
it does seem pretty mad to suggest performing n HTTP requests for the feed page of Twitter, when each tweet probably contains fewer characters than teh HTTP request header

[03:43:06.0000] <othermaciej>
many aspects of the HTTP protocol are kind of useless in practice

[03:43:07.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: don't worry, we have huge problems with the design of the URI and HTML specs too :-)

[03:43:08.0000] <mookid>
othermaciej: the reason for tha tis because browsers and HTML are crap

[03:44:00.0000] <mookid>
not because there's anything wrong wiht HTTP

[03:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
personally I have a bone to pick with TCP as well

[03:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and IP

[03:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
i thought TCP was pretty good actually

[03:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
though i guess i don't know it as well as HTTP, HTML, and URIs

[03:44:05.0000] <Hixie>
DNS on the other hand is a disaster

[03:44:06.0000] <Hixie>
though not as bad as SMTP, which is epicly bad

[03:44:07.0000] <othermaciej>
the main design problem is that it ramps up so slowly and uses excess round trips per connection

[03:44:08.0000] <othermaciej>
although TCP is mostly good

[03:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
TCP is not the best thing for high packet-loss networks, like mobile-phone networks

[03:45:01.0000] <mookid>
othermaciej: that wouldn't be a poort UI, that would be a RIA

[03:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
so mookid, could you let me know how a DELETE to a tweet would invalidate the cache for the feed?

[03:45:03.0000] <mookid>
why don't you ask the HTTP team that question

[03:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
they HTTP team isn't telling me that I should add features to HTML

[03:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/they/the/

[03:46:02.0000] <mookid>
no because they can't be bothered with these levels of pomposity I assume

[03:46:03.0000] <olliej>
/me is glad he has no knowledge of http, or in fact anything much below html :D

[03:46:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me is glad he doesn't even know anything about HTML

[03:46:05.0000] <olliej>
Philip`: actually i think i might be with you at that

[03:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
olliej: nearly every part of the technology stack we work with is severely boned

[03:47:01.0000] <olliej>
Philip`: the dom isn't really html

[03:47:02.0000] <olliej>
othermaciej: i know :-(

[03:47:03.0000] <olliej>
/me stabs JS

[03:47:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean, I guess I can't complain much about Ethernet

[03:47:05.0000] <olliej>
and Canvas

[03:47:06.0000] <olliej>
and SVG

[03:47:07.0000] <Philip`>
Wires are a stupid idea, too

[03:47:08.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: well, let me know when you find an answer, since that seems to be a key part of your argument (namely that the reason you would use one URL is that it makes caching automatically work)

[03:47:09.0000] <olliej>
Philip`: we should have stuck with pigeons

[03:47:10.0000] <Philip`>
And who came up with the idea of atoms?

[03:47:11.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah but Ethernet scales to wireless networks

[03:48:00.0000] <mookid>
actually DELETE's are pretty rare

[03:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
not for twitter posts they're not :-)

[03:48:02.0000] <mookid>
the technical answer is you'd DELETE the tweet and PUT a new representation of the feed minus the link

[03:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
the _client_ has to update the feed?!

[03:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
how can the client safely PUT the feed when it doesn't know the server's latest state?

[03:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
Do you need some kind of concurrency control for that?

[03:49:03.0000] <takkaria>
hah

[03:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
how about the feed of other users who are subscribed to you?

[03:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
surely hte client wouldn't be allowed to PUT to those

[03:50:00.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: I didn't say what was PUT'ing the feed .. :)

[03:50:01.0000] <mookid>
the server can make that call

[03:50:02.0000] <mookid>
the server handling the DELETE

[03:50:03.0000] <mookid>
can make the PUT call

[03:50:04.0000] <mookid>
but you'd know that

[03:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
why can't the server make the call to PUT the new .json and .xml versions then?

[03:50:06.0000] <othermaciej>
the server should PUT to itself to update its own reverse proxy?

[03:50:07.0000] <mookid>
obviously

[03:50:08.0000] <mookid>
othermaciej: right

[03:50:09.0000] <mookid>
it would address it via it's URI

[03:50:10.0000] <Hixie>
sounds like you just solved your own problem and don't need conneg anymore!

[03:50:11.0000] <mookid>
that's called a ... distributed system1

[03:50:12.0000] <mookid>
!!!

[03:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm glad i could help

[03:51:01.0000] <mookid>
no..

[03:51:02.0000] <mookid>
look at the costs

[03:51:03.0000] <mookid>
on the DELETE

[03:51:04.0000] <mookid>
and on the update

[03:51:05.0000] <mookid>
think about it..

[03:51:06.0000] <mookid>
*DING*

[03:51:07.0000] <Hixie>
i think that if you look at the costs it is blatently clear that nobody is ever going to implement what you describe

[03:51:08.0000] <Philip`>
Layering would be a nice concept if it actually worked

[03:51:09.0000] <mookid>
welcome to the real world ian

[03:52:00.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: I don't know what makes you so sure about that

[03:52:01.0000] <mookid>
look at JAX-RS

[03:52:02.0000] <mookid>
or any modern web framework

[03:52:03.0000] <mookid>
all going REST direction

[03:52:04.0000] <mookid>
all have HTTP client libraries

[03:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: ashton kutcher has over 2 million followers, if he does a DELETE, there's no way any sane implementation is going to do 2,000,000 PUTs to update his followers' feeds

[03:52:06.0000] <mookid>
that's client-side caching

[03:53:00.0000] <mookid>
that's completely different

[03:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: No, it's not.

[03:53:02.0000] <mookid>
YES IT IS

[03:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be awesome if you could get the server to DDOS its own reverse proxy

[03:53:04.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: My twitter.com/home is different to yours

[03:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
no i'm talking about the server-side "reverse proxy" cache of those people's feeds

[03:53:06.0000] <mookid>
yeah that's bad design

[03:53:07.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: So how should personalized data appear?

[03:53:08.0000] <mookid>
twitter.com/home should not be the same for every user

[03:53:09.0000] <mookid>
twitter.com/user123/home ?

[03:53:10.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: however you do it, you still have to update the feed for each user

[03:53:11.0000] <mookid>
you're all for URIs

[03:53:12.0000] <mookid>
oh wait

[03:53:13.0000] <gsnedders>
But you still need to invalidate caches for 2,000,000 of those, which doesn't scale.

[03:54:00.0000] <mookid>
NO YOUR NOT!

[03:54:01.0000] <mookid>
that's utter nonsense and it's not like you've solved that by using a URIA

[03:54:02.0000] <mookid>
I'm talking about server side caching

[03:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
hey i'm just repeating what you said

[03:54:04.0000] <gsnedders>
But you said we should PUT a new feed representation

[03:54:05.0000] <othermaciej>
someone should launch a fully RESTful competitor to twitter, I can see it would have just automatically solved all their early scaling problems

[03:54:06.0000] <mookid>
to avoid hitting processors and persistent storage

[03:54:07.0000] <Hixie>
you said after we do a DELETE, the server should PUT to all the urls that are affected

[03:54:08.0000] <gsnedders>
And that's what we're doing

[03:55:00.0000] <mookid>
othermaciej: pretty much

[03:55:01.0000] <takkaria>
luckily, "being woefully inefficient" is not the same as "scaling well"

[03:55:02.0000] <mookid>
you do realise that the enterprise community is pretty much agreed that REST is the solution to their scalability and interop problems right?

[03:55:03.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: We're talking about server side caching too.

[03:55:04.0000] <mookid>
and the latest Java API for REST development is entirely Accept header driven

[03:56:00.0000] <mookid>
no you arent

[03:56:01.0000] <mookid>
because a DELETE

[03:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
We _are_.

[03:56:03.0000] <mookid>
would invalidate the cache

[03:56:04.0000] <mookid>
for EVERYONE

[03:56:05.0000] <mookid>
if it was server side

[03:56:06.0000] <mookid>
and polled

[03:56:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes, we're talking about that.

[03:56:08.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what the collary for godwins law that applies when someone mentions "enterprise"

[03:56:09.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: i'm just trying to understand why you need to share one URL between three resources so that they all get invalidated at once, when other resources still need to be invalidated and can't get the same effect.

[03:56:10.0000] <takkaria>
we're back to star trek again :)

[03:56:11.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: they don't need invalidating

[03:57:00.0000] <mookid>
because the collections contain hyperlinks

[03:57:01.0000] <mookid>
not the data itself

[03:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: so when ashton kutcher deletes a tweet, how does it get removed from my personal feed?

[03:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
assuming i were to follow ashton kutcher

[03:57:04.0000] <mookid>
you'd poll his feed and it'd have the link removed

[03:57:05.0000] <Hixie>
(i've no idea who ashton kutcher is, he's just a random name i picked from http://twitterholic.com/)

[03:57:06.0000] <gsnedders>
So we need to make more requests?

[03:57:07.0000] <mookid>
polling is how HTTP works

[03:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Kirk's Law?

[03:58:01.0000] <mookid>
unless you want to get into Comet and crap like that

[03:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: so i have to poll all the feeds of all the people i'm subscribed to every time i want to view my feed?

[03:58:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Add it to wikipedia

[03:58:04.0000] <Philip`>
Oh wait, takkaria already made the Star Trek connection :-(

[03:58:05.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: right

[03:58:06.0000] <othermaciej>
seems like you could just put a very short freshness lifetime on the feed and get the same effect

[03:58:07.0000] <Philip`>
while I was busy looking on Wikipedia to work out who was a captain of the Enterprise

[03:58:08.0000] <Hixie>
mookid: so when barack obama views his twitter feed, he has to do 773,210 HTTP requests?

[03:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: I can currently get Twitter.com/home with all my followers in one request. You are proposing to make me have to do n+1 requests, where n is the number of tweets. When I have to pay over £100/MB from my phone, I want as little overhead as possible, and HTTP requests have an overhead.

[03:59:01.0000] <mookid>
that is ONE use case

[03:59:02.0000] <mookid>
and yes

[03:59:03.0000] <mookid>
that is how it would work

[03:59:04.0000] <mookid>
if it was RESTful

[04:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: When you are paying that puch you don't want to be browisng the web

[04:00:01.0000] <mookid>
yes 700k requests is ridiculous

[04:00:02.0000] <mookid>
but so is FOLLOWING 700k people

[04:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
it would be streeful, not restful, if a user had to make 773,210 HTTP requests each time they reloaded their feed

[04:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
stressful, rather

[04:00:05.0000] <mookid>
read^

[04:00:06.0000] <Hixie>
it might be ridiculous, but it's what he does

[04:00:07.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: Also, if REST is more efficient, how is making 700k requests more efficant than 1 request?

[04:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I don't think he personally reads all the content on his Twitter feed)

[04:01:01.0000] <mookid>
ok so we've establised people use twitter moronically because they have stupid policies

[04:01:02.0000] <mookid>
so

[04:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
robert scoble follows 101,915 people and he actually does read them, from what i understand

[04:01:04.0000] <mookid>
that means there is no situation where that would be useful?

[04:01:05.0000] <mookid>
no he reads his @'s I imagine

[04:01:06.0000] <Hixie>
that's still an impossible number of HTTP requests per reload

[04:01:07.0000] <mookid>
depends really

[04:01:08.0000] <takkaria>
/me watches the goalposts move, apparently of their own accord

[04:01:09.0000] <mookid>
layered architecture and all

[04:02:00.0000] <mookid>
have a non-cacheable feed resource which populates itself with internal HTTP calls

[04:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the point is, if you think about a real app and not a toy problem, the benefit of cache invalidation of alternate representations of a resource on PUT/DELETE vanishes

[04:02:02.0000] <mookid>
is the best solution

[04:02:03.0000] <mookid>
well I'm in the real world doing this

[04:02:04.0000] <othermaciej>
because in general, you will have to invalidate dependent resources on a change

[04:02:05.0000] <mookid>
building servers/client/intemediaries

[04:02:06.0000] <Hixie>
even if we ignore the people who live on twitter, i follow 101 people, should i really have to do 101 HTTP requests to read my feed?

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
that seems crazy to me

[04:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
certainly not efficient

[04:03:02.0000] <mookid>
hence my comment about layering

[04:03:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: If the document has a script-created parser and a script inserts an external script to the DOM, when the newly-inserted script loads, should it be able to do document.write without implying document.open?

[04:03:04.0000] <mookid>
and a time cached/non-cacheable feed resource

[04:03:05.0000] <othermaciej>
and if you can update dependent resources, then you could update alternate representations at different URIs

[04:03:06.0000] <gsnedders>
You said enterprise would benefit from it, and they quite often control their entire stack from server down to client, so why can't you get any enterprises to use something with @accept?

[04:03:07.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yes (it'll write to the end, iirc)

[04:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: If there really is that much to gain, I would expect that to have been done by now.

[04:04:01.0000] <mookid>
mmm

[04:04:02.0000] <mookid>
it's happening as we speak

[04:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: OK. I wonder if Gecko's parser key infrastructure lets me do that right easily...

[04:04:04.0000] <mookid>
loads of CDNs are RESTful using intemediaries

[04:04:05.0000] <mookid>
and HTTP messages

[04:05:00.0000] <mookid>
but hey - that's only the real world

[04:05:01.0000] <mookid>
I wouldn't worry about that

[04:05:02.0000] <mookid>
just make broad sweeping statements and assumptions

[04:05:03.0000] <mookid>
that's probably good enough

[04:06:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, if things are going to happen anyway, why are you complaining so bitterly? :)

[04:06:01.0000] <mookid>
...

[04:06:02.0000] <mookid>
HTTP content-negotiation isn't practical *until* hypermedia formats support it

[04:06:03.0000] <mookid>
well it's semi-practical

[04:06:04.0000] <mookid>
it's a lot harder than it needs to be

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
HTTP content-negotiation isn't a great idea anyway, as we've just discussed, it doesn't really solve any problems that aren't easily solved in another way anyway

[04:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
life would be better if we could just drop it altogether

[04:07:02.0000] <mookid>
it's irrelevant that's subjective assumption on your part

[04:07:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think I'll try to hack an approximation for now and see if it accidentally does the right thing...

[04:07:04.0000] <mookid>
and an ignorant one at that

[04:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know if i'd go around telling people they were ignorant if i was the one saying that updateing a feed should require hundreds of requests...

[04:08:01.0000] <mookid>
...

[04:08:02.0000] <mookid>
.

[04:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that's the scalability benefit of RESTful design

[04:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it scales you from one request to hundreds or even thousands

[04:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
like DUH

[04:09:03.0000] <mookid>
*sigh*

[04:09:04.0000] <mookid>
do you have any idea how stupid that looks?

[04:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me can imagine this whole conversation being played out with s/conneg/WS-*/

[04:10:01.0000] <mookid>
it doesn't require hudnreds of requests it requires one to the tweet resource.. which will invalidate the SERVER SIDE CACHE

[04:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Scoble has client-side twitter filters

[04:10:03.0000] <mookid>
which the clients are polling anyway

[04:11:00.0000] <mookid>
this is stupid anyway the tweet is used as an example of a resource with multiple representations

[04:11:01.0000] <mookid>
not a perfect candidate system for RESTful architecture

[04:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's a perfect candidate system for RESTful architecture then?

[04:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we should be looking at perfect exampels

[04:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
rather than flawed ones

[04:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
since flawed ones would naturally not lead us to appreciate the full power of the REST system

[04:12:01.0000] <mookid>
why don't you go read up

[04:12:02.0000] <jgraham>
From my position of ignorance twitter looks like more or less the simplest type of system that has to scale 

[04:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
most web apps of interest tend to have multiple resources depending on the same underlying piece of server-side data

[04:12:04.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: actually twitter has to propagate state changes to be reflected via many URIs, so it seems pretty hard to scale (and I gather that it was in fact hard)

[04:13:00.0000] <mookid>
there are elegant ways to solve that with REST I just can't be bothered, and it would be largely wasted on you anyway

[04:13:01.0000] <mookid>
I doubt you would understand it

[04:13:02.0000] <takkaria>
I don't get why some people need a metanarrative about the most pure way to build systems.  surely, if you want to build a system, you just build it so it works and in as sane a way as you can manage?  ther'es no need for religious devotion toward the one true way

[04:13:03.0000] <mookid>
I'm not claiming my way is best I'm just telloing you that the HTTP spec enables my method

[04:13:04.0000] <mookid>
and one of the things holding me back

[04:14:00.0000] <mookid>
is HTML

[04:14:01.0000] <mookid>
there's no reason we can't both have our own philosophies and solutions

[04:14:02.0000] <mookid>
you can ignore the attribute all together

[04:14:03.0000] <mookid>
and use as many URIs as you want

[04:14:04.0000] <mookid>
for whatever you want

[04:15:00.0000] <mookid>
so you're effectively denying me something that would be relatively simple to executre on the basis you don't "agree"

[04:15:01.0000] <mookid>
I think it's more likely that you don't "understand" but whatever

[04:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Yeah I know it was hard to scale. I mean conceptually it's a pretty simple system, but maybe that's less relevant than the underlying difficulty of propogaing the tweets

[04:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it has a very simple UI, but not a very simple architecture

[04:16:01.0000] <mookid>
lol.

[04:16:02.0000] <mookid>
:)

[04:16:03.0000] <mookid>
you people.

[04:17:00.0000] <mookid>
hello people in the future reading this - I'm sorry.

[04:17:01.0000] <mookid>
I tried.

[04:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Sure.

[04:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm trying to think of a real, popular Web app that doesn't have dependent resources as a major part of its functionality

[04:18:02.0000] <mookid>
...

[04:18:03.0000] <mookid>
they're not dependant resources

[04:18:04.0000] <mookid>
they're representations of the same resource

[04:19:00.0000] <mookid>
hence why giving them separate resource identifiers is mal practice

[04:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
mookid: I'm glad you psychically determined what I was talking about

[04:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the issue? cache-invalidating dependent resources without having to re-check cache consistency with the origin server?

[04:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
now let me figure out how the reddit.com homepage is an alternate representation of the same resource as every article page

[04:20:00.0000] <mookid>
what?

[04:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: there's not really an issue

[04:20:02.0000] <mookid>
make sense

[04:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: the point of discussion, such as it is, is whether content negotiation is a useful feature that can solve real problems in the context of RESTful design

[04:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: The point of the discussion is to rehash the same discussion that we had on the same topic a while ago

[04:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Withot any new information 

[04:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
*Without

[04:22:02.0000] <mookid>
I don't really see what the problem is here - HTTP provides the mechanism and you're plain ignoring it

[04:22:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I've been told (though I didn't see it in the scrollback) that the motivation for bringing up this general topic is the desire for an <a accept=""> attribute so that you can control the Accept header the browser sends when following a link

[04:22:04.0000] <mookid>
right

[04:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I thought we already figured out that content negotiotion is mostly BS

[04:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me digs up notes

[04:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: mookid is not on board that particular train

[04:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Accept-Language: for content: FAIL; for UIs: just might work sometimes

[04:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
<a accept=""> seems bad to me, because it means the linking resource has to have knowledge of which representations of the linked-to resource all possible UAs will want

[04:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Accept-Encoding: success but arguably an architectural flaw (compare with Transfer-Encoding)

[04:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Accept-Charset: pointless. obsoleted by UTF-8

[04:24:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Accept: FAIL

[04:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Accept only works for PNG vs. GIF, but no one uses it that way

[04:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which seems flawed - the whole point of Accept is that different clients may prefer different representations

[04:25:02.0000] <mookid>
lol

[04:25:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Word document vs. HTML document vs. PDF depends on what the user is planning on doing next

[04:26:00.0000] <mookid>
this has to be one of the most ridiculous discussions I've ever had

[04:26:01.0000] <roc>
I can't believe you guys got sucked into this

[04:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
mookid: we have found a point of agreement

[04:26:03.0000] <Philip`>
mookid: More ridiculous than the last time the same points were discussed?

[04:26:04.0000] <mookid>
possibly

[04:27:00.0000] <mookid>
at the end of the day - that attribute would not break anything you wanted to do, you could just ignore it and be none the wiser

[04:29:00.0000] <mookid>
you're making a descision on behalf of the entire human race

[04:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems to me that <a accept=""> violates the REST philosophy

[04:29:02.0000] <mookid>
ok well the Atom Publishing Protocol has a similar concept

[04:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
a resource representation shouldn't be telling a client what representations of another resource it should prefer

[04:30:01.0000] <mookid>
why?

[04:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
krijnh: "cision on behalf of the entire human race

[04:30:03.0000] <jgraham>
Curiously all decisions one makes affect the whole human race.

[04:30:04.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa

[04:30:05.0000] <hsivonen>
sorry

[04:31:00.0000] <mookid>
yeah but these descisions, unfortunately, have a large impact on the world

[04:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because the whole point of Accept is for the client to tell the server what representations it prefers

[04:31:02.0000] <mookid>
right

[04:31:03.0000] <mookid>
so if I have an HTML page

[04:31:04.0000] <othermaciej>
if the server is deciding what representation should be sent, it doesn't need to tell the client to tell it what to send, it can just send it

[04:31:05.0000] <mookid>
which provides links to a resource and says to the user 'html, xml, or json'

[04:32:00.0000] <mookid>
the user clicks it

[04:32:01.0000] <mookid>
they should probably get the right representation

[04:33:00.0000] <mookid>
othermaciej: there's no way of doing that in stateless system

[04:33:01.0000] <mookid>
that's what headers are for.

[04:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes there were some kind of moratorium on codec debates

[04:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
there is a moratorium in the whatwg on adding to threads without adding new information

[04:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: not very effective, it seems :-(

[04:50:00.0000] <roc>
Maik Merten just added some information

[04:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
great

[04:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I'm now very confused with http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/level0/write/005.html

[04:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I tweaked things a bit and how I get behavior that looks like the old Gecko behavior even though I didn't mean to do so

[05:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
does anyone know what problem some people want solved by introducing <a href="..." coords="...">...</a> for image maps?

[05:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
it'd be a better design than <area> if we didn't have <area> already

[05:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, sure, but given that we do have area, what problem would be solved by it?

[05:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me get an epiphany on how to fix document.write from external non-parser-inserted scripts when there's a script-created parser

[05:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
*gets

[05:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(or is it "has". I get my idiomatic verbs wrong)

[05:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: "has" I guess

[05:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok

[05:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, when parsing innerHTML, if the context node is just root, when resetting the insertion mode it is set to "After head"

[05:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
How is there no body created?

[05:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, duh

[06:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/170

[06:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Red in all current browsers green (and two body elements) with HTML5

[06:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/171 is a bit more interesting

[06:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
the HTML5 approach certainly makes sense.

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the HTML5 behavior is desirable for off-the-main-thread parsing

[06:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
unless there are cases where sites are relying on the behaviour of current browsers for this case, the HTML5 behaviour makes a lot more sense.

[06:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: having two body elements seems bad though. It also seems possible that it is a compat issue\

[06:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: IIRC, we resolved as INVALID a bug report of similar nature in Gecko

[06:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
In what sense similar? and for what? The HTML5 parser?

[06:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=493882

[06:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: not with the HTML5 parser

[06:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I'm not against the HTML5 behaviour if it doesn't break sites

[06:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
this makes less sense to me. It's equivalent to the previous test, except that it uses divs instead. http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/172

[06:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
yet in HTML5 Gecko, it only results in one div, not two

[06:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that's an interesting case

[06:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder what's going on there

[06:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems like it should end up with the first div as the previous sibling of the head element

[06:40:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, no wait...

[06:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
When the innerHTML runs, it should remove the original <body> from the DOM and replace it with whatever the innerHTML algorithm produces

[06:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Because subsequent operations in the original parser don't read from the DOM but from the sooe with the original body, the elements never end up in the DOM

[06:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
sooe == stack of open elements

[06:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(apart from the html element which is already in the DOM)

[06:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does any document define an error-recovery algorithm for decoding UTF-8?

[07:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, doesn't the UTF-8 spec define something about replacing invalid sequences of octets with U+FFFD? What else do you need?

[07:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: how long is a sequence

[07:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: that's the question

[07:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: does the UTF-8 spec define that?

[07:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I thought that was defined, though my knowledge of UTF-8 parsing is very limited

[07:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: you need the UTF-8 torture test from Markus Kuhn's site

[07:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: assume it's the spec :-/

[07:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me guesses that there is a reasonable chance that Philip` knows Marcus Kuhn personally

[07:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders who Marcus Kuhn is (apart from someone in CS at Cam)

[07:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: a tattoo artist: http://www.marcuskuhn.com/

[07:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/Marcus/Markus/ :-p

[07:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me attended security and Unix lectures by him

[07:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, a tattoo artist that also gives talks on security and Unix on the side? :-)

[07:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I spy with my little eye something beginning with j

[07:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Now I can't see it!

[07:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, how can you play a game of I spy, when you can't actually see the thing?

[07:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
but since guessing games are fun, was it a jelly bean?

[07:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, I could see it at the time.

[07:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It just moved.

[07:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is it a jelly?

[07:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No

[07:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me thinks he is more of a he than an it

[07:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or rather a him

[07:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, maybe

[07:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me turns to face the tyranny

[07:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(and go to the bin)

[07:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, was it jgraham?

[07:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes.

[07:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
woo hoo :-)

/me bows in deference 

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me is starting to come to the conclusion that enough people think footers should be able to contain sections that we should just go ahead and allow it

[15:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
(sigh)

[15:45:00.0000] <hober>
hmm

[15:45:01.0000] <hober>
so <footer> would basically be for any back-matter?

[15:46:00.0000] <ezyang>
Mmm, I'm not quite sure I would call it back-matter 

[15:47:00.0000] <hober>
 like rfc2629bis' <back>

[15:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: do that and <footer> will lose any real distinction from <section> except in name

[15:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
same content model, just different name

[15:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe that's what people actually want

[15:58:00.0000] <ezyang>
you would think that footer would be fairly unambiguous 

[15:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ezyang: people use the same names for different things

[15:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: <section> is in the outline, that's the big difference

[15:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems like the general pattern that's may be emerging is that trying to be helpfully prescriptive in the spec about constraints on the content models of the structural elements is, in practice, maybe not going to be helpful

[15:59:03.0000] <ezyang>
Yeah, though I thought the web design community had formed a consensus on the design pattern of the "header" and the "footer" 

[15:59:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: can you imagine that somebody might next ask, why is footer not in the outline algorithm?

[16:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: they haven't asked that for <header>

[16:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
basically this would make <header> and <footer> symmetric

[16:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ezyang: I don't think the web design community has formed a consensus on anything. any single thing.

[16:00:03.0000] <ezyang>
:-/ Very possible. 

[16:00:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: symmetry is good. it makes things simpler for people

[16:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ezyang: and Web designers may have different notions of what a footer is than, say, people who design outline algorithms

[16:02:00.0000] <ezyang>
I'm pretty sure they don't think footers go in outline algorithms. 

[16:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

Yeah. Totally not appropriate in the outline algo 

[16:04:03.0000] <hober>
I can imagine the blog post above marked up in an <article>

[16:05:00.0000] <hober>
but I can imagine this footer as <footer><section><h2>The Fine Print</h2>...</section>...</footer>

[16:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hober: to me, the footer is the just part that has derek (at) powazek (dot) com in the left column

[16:05:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the Fine Print part is a sectin

[16:05:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
section

[16:05:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
with navigational content

[16:06:00.0000] <hober>
from that article: "So new here is a wayfinding footer - the kind of stuff that's usually ignored in sidebars. Will it help people stay on the site and surf around? I don't know - you tell me."

[16:07:00.0000] <hober>
I'm not saying I disagree, MikeSmith, but I think that's the crux of the confusion. People think of different things when they think of footers.

[16:07:01.0000] <hober>
I can imagine Derek's footer (the big one) participating in *the page*'s outline

[16:07:02.0000] <hober>
but not *the article*'s outline

[16:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hober: agreed that it's clear people think of different things

[16:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
i'd suspect most people would call that a footer

[16:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
to me, it could just as well be a nav

[16:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the physical placement of that content in the footer seems to me arbitrary

[16:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
at the footer of the page, I mean

[16:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it could be presented as a pop-up

[16:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I would myself tend to think of footer content as something that makes the most sense at the end of the document flow

[16:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
like the stuff that comes at the very end of a movie

[16:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>

good god i hate the ietf process

[17:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently there's some meeting going on so i can't upload new drafts

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's amazing to me that the ietf explicitly _prevent_ progress during their meetings

[17:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, i know meetings aren't usually productive in the first place, but actually preventing progress is just stunning

[17:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
meetings in general can be pretty productive, even standards meetings sometimes

[17:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I had a boss at a previous job who tried to institute a "everybody stands" (no sitting) meeting policy

[17:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
to force everybody to actually focus on talking to each other and getting something done

[17:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
he also had a "no food at meetings" policy

[17:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as other kinds of meetings, if you're doing direct product-dev work for real paying customers, it's pretty hard to avoid meetings

[17:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
though those meetings also aren't always productive. they're just necessary

[17:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
then there are "apology" meetings...

[17:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe that's something more unique to Japan

[18:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
go to a meeting to "apologize" to customer for mistakes you actually did not make, but were in fact either the customer's fault or their hand-picked system integrator's fault

[18:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you admit mistakes, surely they'd sue you

[18:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
lawsuits are pretty rare in Japan

[18:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
actual contracts are kinda rare too

[18:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least in my limited experience (doing professional-services type customized product development)

[18:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and even when customers do sign contracts, they feel free to ignore them if they want. or change the terms unilaterally

[18:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
when dealing with big companies here, you're pretty much at their mercy

[18:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the threat of losing future business with them is enough to make you do what they say

[18:06:00.0000] <mookid>
[13:37] <Philip`> If you encode the desired content-type in the URI, it's not possible for a general-purpose HTTP-processing device to understand what's the resource identifier and what's the content-type selector, because there's no standard for encoding that stuff in URIs

[18:07:00.0000] <mookid>
[13:38] <Hixie> Philip`: such a standard or convention could be easily established

[18:08:00.0000] <mookid>
[13:40] <Philip`> Hixie: You couldn't establish it in a way that wouldn't conflict with other people not following that standard and perfectly legitimately happening to use the same magic URI query parameter or whatever the content-type thing is stored as

[18:09:00.0000] <mookid>
:)

[18:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
I have no idea what any of that means

Hey all, can anyone tell me the WhatWG stance on role, either the ARIA or the ‘bestowing semantics’ variety?

[01:32:01.0000] <takkaria>
I'm not sure there is a WHATWG "stance" per se

[01:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
ARIA is scheduled to get merged into HTML5 whenever the ARIA group are done dealing with their last call comments adequately

[01:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
(er "merged" in the sense that it will be conforming to use ARIA in HTML5 - i don't expect to copy the text in verbatim or anything)

[01:33:02.0000] <boblet>
ok

[01:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i expect it'll just be a list of attributes, a list of constraints on when they can be used, and a reference to the ARIA author and implementor specs)

[01:34:01.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: any idea if that will be eg in time for October?

[01:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[01:34:03.0000] <tantekc>
Hixie, what are your standards for "merged" in the sense of conforming to use and referencing external specs rather than copying the text in verbatim etc.?

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno, it hasn't come up before :-)

[01:37:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: what about the ‘using role for adding semantic meaning’ idea? I’m guessing there’s a reason for <nav> rather than <ul role="nvaigation">…

[01:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
how is it different to class=""?

[01:41:00.0000] <boblet>
I’m guessing because the semantic meanings are formally and officially defined, and that implementors then add support for these meanings where appropriate

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh. then how is it different to elements?

[01:43:00.0000] <boblet>
I guess because then the semantics can be applied to more than one element, depending on which one was most appropriate

[01:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
isn't that just like nesting?

[01:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really understand the problem this would solve

[01:46:00.0000] <boblet>
I’m personally happy with the whole new elements approach—I think it’s conceptually simpler to add a few new elements than use div with role (or class) for everything, and easier to teach. I’m trying to understand the difference between John Allsopp’s approach and adding new elements.

[01:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
one difference is it that elements can be further subclassed

[01:48:01.0000] <boblet>
It certainly seems like the Microformats approach has paid off in faster implementation for the problems they’ve addressed, so I can see the logic to role being more amenable to rapid changes vs adding new elements

[01:48:02.0000] <boblet>
hey Mike

[01:48:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey

[01:48:04.0000] <boblet>
by subclassed are you meaning with classes or with nesting?

[01:48:05.0000] <tantek>
boblet - indeed.

[01:49:00.0000] <tantek>
after the experience with microformats and the ability to assign *multiple* semantics to a single element, it's pretty clear to me that the one element = one tag = one meaning design of SGML/HTML/XML is fundamentally flawed.

[01:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: if you used <div class=section> for bunch of sections and then you want to to further distinguish between kinds of sections, you don't have a class attribute to use to subclass them any more

[01:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: depends what you're solving, but yes

[01:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: if we were designing a new markup language from scratch, this would be a good discussion to have :-)

[01:50:01.0000] <tantek>
space separated set of class names for semantics has provided far better flexibility in terms of more easily marking up content that web authors actually publish.

[01:50:02.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: well only if you’re using IE6 ;-)

[01:50:03.0000] <tantek>
MikeSmith - not true - you can add additional class names to provide additional semantics in your class="section" example.

[01:51:00.0000] <boblet>
woops, I think I might have started something :)

[01:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: tantek's right, I'm wrong. :)

[01:52:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: well, as I said you’re right for IE6 (and CSS styling)—it only sees the first (or was it last?) class name

[01:52:01.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, I asked the above question (re: reference vs. wholly incorporate) because I am revising hCard, hCalendar, hReview, hAtom with bug fix revisions that incorporate numerous issue resolutions (including your issue regarding conformance criteria for user-agents and authors).

[01:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if authors want to do <div class="section something"> instead of using <section class="something">, the existence of a <section> element does not prevent them from doing that

[01:54:00.0000] <tantek>
e.g. hCard 1.0.1, hCalendar 1.0.1. - at that point I'm confident that those specifications will be more thorough, and incorporate more issue resolutions than the corresponding pre-defined microdata vocabularies of vcard/vevent.

[01:55:00.0000] <tantek>
not to mention be backed by actual experience from numerous authors publishing hCards and hCalendar events as defined.

[01:56:00.0000] <tantek>
and thus it should be reasonable to consider incorporating hCard and hCalendar vocabularies by *reference* rather by redefinition inline in the HTML5 spec.

[01:57:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: I think that web authors perceive class as an ad hoc system, rather than something official. While Microformats have pushed it a long way, I think that a W3-defined vocabulary of semantics (either new elements or role values) are far more official. Also I’m guessing implementors would feel the same—they’d be more likely to build functionality on something that’s defined (by W3) rather than something that’s just

[01:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: you got cut off there

[01:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: i think we're actually going to take out the few vocabularies that are in there already (the vcard and vevent ones, and the licensing works one)

[01:58:01.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, this is just a heads up of work in progress. I will re-raise the issue when hCard 1.0.1 and hCalendar 1.0.1 drafts have been published. In either case, I do think it is premature/unwise to include pre-defined microdata vocabularies.  Hopefully the updates to hCard and hCalendar will make that even more clear.

[01:58:02.0000] <boblet>
too wordy—my bad. how far?

[01:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: and put them in their own specs

[01:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: i haven't worked out what should happen reference-wise

[01:58:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
to "that's jus..."

[01:58:06.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: it might be that we end up with a section that mentions vocabularies that use various features like class="" (assuming microformats continue to use those instead of item/itemprop) and item/itemprop

[01:58:07.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: in a non-normative way

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: in which case i'd be happy to link to some normative definitions if there are some

[01:59:01.0000] <boblet>
RT: Also I’m guessing implementors would feel the same—they’d be more likely to build functionality on something that’s defined (by W3) rather than something that’s just agreed (by users of Microformats etc)

[01:59:02.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, the licensing works one will take more effort because it requires completion of the in-progress "licensing microformat", however it will very likely have similar to features to what you've written up - as you seem to have come to many of the same conclusions as the licensing microformats brainstorming efforts.

[01:59:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: but none of us want something official if it overly restricts authors. the point is to try to find some kind of sweet spot. to provide more authoring ease without locking people into something official that ends up restricting and confusing them too much

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: that's no coincidence, the microformats wiki was one of my main crib sheets :-)

[02:01:00.0000] <tantek>
we do seem to agree that the ccREL as designed is problematic due to it's ability/encouragement for license proliferation, which IMHO is a fatal design flaw. http://microformats.org/wiki/licensing-brainstorming#ccREL_issues

[02:02:00.0000] <tantek>
s/it's/its duh

[02:02:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: well, I think new elements could also be considered fairly restrictive (in terms of number and release cycle)

[02:03:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, that is good to hear that the pre-defined vocabularies will be taken out of the HTML5 spec.

[02:03:01.0000] <boblet>
That’s why the potential of eg role values being defined in a Microformats-like way but by WhatWG/W3 seems really interesting—official and well-thought-out like elements, but faster release cycle like µF

[02:03:02.0000] <tantek>
As far as microformats use of class vs. item/itemprop, it is likely that for the forseeable future microformats will continue to make use of the class attribute for backwards compatibility.

[02:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
as an implementor, I don't have a problem in principle implementing things based on microformats, just because they are not W3C-official or whatever

[02:04:01.0000] <tantek>
However, I believe it does make sense to advocate use of HTML5's features when authors are able to do so (are able to depend on them based on their use cases), and it is more advantageous to do so.

[02:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the main problems with microformats (neither completely fatal) are that parsing has historically not been defined very tightly, and the trickiness of figuring out the right browser UI to expose them

[02:05:01.0000] <tantek>
This will likely be an extension of the "How to use microformats in HTML5" work in development, that advocates use of the <time> element etc.

[02:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(from a browser implementor perspective)

[02:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one thing I like about microdata is that it takes you from parsing to a data model in a precisely defined way

[02:06:01.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej, I will encourage you to review the hCard 1.0.1 and hCalendar 1.0.1 drafts regarding the thoroughness of parsing definition. it is my intent to make those definitions thorough through both prose and test cases.

[02:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so microdata-based formats could start defining things at the data model level

[02:07:00.0000] <tantek>
I agree, the parsing to data model description of the general microdata feature is quite admirable.

[02:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: I did say "historically", cause I haven't reviewed recently

[02:07:02.0000] <tantek>
(btw parsing details are a known issue that I've resolved as needing additional work for hCard 1.0.1 and hCalendar 1.0.1)

[02:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one other thing I like about microdata is that it exposes the data model through a nice DOM API, which is friendly to data extraction via client-side script or client-side logic in general

[02:09:00.0000] <tantek>
we are doing something similar in microformats for our recent test-suite update efforts: http://microformats.org/wiki/test-suite

[02:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hCard and hCalendar are probably among the microformats that are most interesting for likely built-in browser features, if anyone ever goes there

[02:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would really like to support hAtom as well, but that probably won't happen unless our feed parsing code is open sourced and a motivated individual can take matters into their own hands

[02:12:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - does it help that there is existing open source XSLT that you can incorporate to transform hAtom to Atom and then just pipe that into your existing support? http://rbach.priv.at/Microformats/hAtom2Atom/

[02:12:01.0000] <tantek>
specifically, available under the The W3C Open Source License per http://rbach.priv.at/Microformats/hAtom2Atom/readme.txt

[02:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: I expect HTML's release cycle to be remarkably quicker once HTML5 is done

[02:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: the people who originally wrote our support are no longer with the company and left a... very creative combination of diverse technologies that... provides an intellectual puzzle for those of us on the team

[02:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so it doesn't actually help that much directly, but thanks for the reference

[02:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: the main problem with HTML that made HTML5 take so long was the utterly woeful state of the HTML and DOM HTML specifications prior to HTML5, in terms of conformance criteria for implementors (of all classes, not just browsers), and in terms of missing features altogether (DOM level 0 in particular)

[02:14:01.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - that's too bad. perhaps as you say you can open sourcce the feed parsing code as part of WebKit and thus enable folks to improve it.

[02:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think open sourcing the code would also likely lead to it being greatly simplified and improved

[02:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: that makes sense (using class for back compat vs using microdata when it makes sense going forward)

[02:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
because WebKit has much higher standards for code quality than most Apple-internal code

[02:16:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - in case you want to try experimenting with that code with a bunch of other microformats folks/devs to bounce ideas/thoughts off of - I encourage you (and anyone else here interested in microformats development) to participate in microformatsDevCamp July 25-26 http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2009-07-25-dev-camp

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
one thing that's unclear to me when it comes to splitting off the vocabularies is how to handle the HTML->Atom and HTML->RDF sections

[02:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: that's kind of a little bit disturbing to hear (about Apple-internal code standards vs Webkit standards)

[02:17:01.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, that's good to hear, and not surprising, given that we both have a bit of a bias for back compat, while incrementally improving things in the future.

[02:17:02.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, HTML to Atom will likely be handled in the hAtom update.

[02:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: indeed :-)

[02:17:04.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: so you're saying, given how terrible WebKit is, you're surprised Macs and iPhones even boot?

[02:17:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[02:17:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
no, not at all man

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
specifically i mean how to handle http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#atom

[02:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: HTML->RDF isn't really a custom vocabulary

[02:18:02.0000] <tantek>
HTML -> RDF is more complicated (everything is more complicated with RDF) and will require an update to XMDP

[02:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
and how to handle http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#rdf

[02:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: no but it references the custom vocabularies

[02:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: HTML->Atom is not a custom vocab at all either

[02:18:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: just that I would hope Apple-internal code standards would be as exacting was you guys

[02:18:07.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: but it reuses the vcard vocabulary to get people's names out and suchlike

[02:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: we have hundreds of people looking at our code every day

[02:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me catches up on othermaciej's actual joke

[02:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think i might just leave those parts in the html5 spec proper and have references out -- it's not like the reference needs to be normative

[02:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
few projects are like that, open source or not

[02:19:04.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, I wonder, if the 'profile' attribute helped enable XMDP, and thus automatic conversion from HTML to RDF, would that be sufficient to add it back (in contrast to say, the "about" attribute, which is brand new as far as HTML is concerned).

[02:19:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: yeah, understood. it's unique in a number of ways

[02:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or at least quite exceptional in a number of ways (if not unique)

[02:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and we tend to attract people who are fussy about code quality details

[02:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: not sure what you mean

[02:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: the HTML->RDF section is "automatic conversion from HTML to RDF" already

[02:20:04.0000] <tantek>
but requires the new "about" attribute IIRC

[02:20:05.0000] <Hixie>
there's a new "about" attribute?

[02:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
we may be talking about something else

[02:21:01.0000] <tantek>
I thought I saw a diff that introduced it - perhaps relating to the licensing vocab

[02:21:02.0000] <tantek>
I did notice that the citation/bibtex vocab got removed

[02:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
there's an itemprop="about" field, if that's what you mean, but that's not really RDF-specific (though it is a key part of the subpart of the HTML->RDF conversion concerned with converting microdata)

[02:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
(that's just one part of the algorithm though)

[02:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
(there's lots of other stuff in that algorithm, like converting <blockquote cite=""> to RDF statements, etc)

[02:22:02.0000] <tantek>
yes - I believe that's what I'm referring to.

[02:22:03.0000] <tantek>
(the itemprop="about" thing)

[02:24:00.0000] <tantek>
frankly, I think the whole approach of encouraging the inclusion of invisible hyperlinks in content (what the "about" design does in RDF/RDFa) is fundamentally flawed. the "dark data" problem as it were.

[02:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah. that's why i like itemprop=about -- it encourages people to use <img> or <a href=""> to say what they're talking about

[02:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was quite honestly surprised that RDFa really doesn't make the licensing use case as easy as microdata can

[02:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
i sent a mail about that where i showed what i thought the best you could do with RDFa was, and it was surprisingly verbose compared to what i ended up with with microdata

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
including some duplication of data, which violates what i thought was an RDFa design goal (DRY)

[02:26:01.0000] <boblet>
sorry—cake attack

[02:27:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: The aim is to make it impossible to create multiple body elements except by using DOM manipulation, right?

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: not especially, why?

[02:28:01.0000] <boblet>
tantek: will current Microformats be released in Microdata format at some stage?

[02:28:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: See my email to public-html yesterday

[02:28:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Just having two body elements seems somewhat ugly

[02:29:00.0000] <tantek>
boblet - doubtful. but will likely happen is that microformats.org will document how to use *any* microformat generically using microdata syntax. watch this page for updates: http://microformats.org/wiki/html5

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: it's on the pile

[02:30:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Yeah, I knew it would be :)

[02:30:02.0000] <boblet>
thanks, will do

[02:30:03.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: I understand about the work required in HTML5. Good to hear you think post-HTML5 release cycles will be faster

[02:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
ideally i'd like html to move to a continuous development cycle instead of the w3c process of long drawn out lc/cr/pr/rec

[02:32:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, a continuous development cycle may be possible if you incorporate TDD.

[02:32:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Just publish second, third, fourth, etc. edition of HTML 5, hence avoiding that.

[02:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
TDD?

[02:32:03.0000] <tantek>
test driven development

[02:33:00.0000] <tantek>
thus each feature can quickly progress through wd/ts/cr via interop

[02:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think it'd be possible even without that

[02:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
though it would certainly help

[02:33:03.0000] <tantek>
relatively in parallel

[02:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is the forking of the spec source, not the testing 

[02:34:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Using some sane VCS should mitigate most of that

[02:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's hard to implement against a constantly evolving snapshot

[02:34:02.0000] <boblet>
I hope *all* major browser makers have got on the train by the time that happens :)

[02:34:03.0000] <tantek>
as long as the tests are clustered by / attached to section of the spec, presumably the tests would fork along with their respective spec prose.

[02:34:04.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - believe me, I sympathize with that.

[02:34:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: that's unaffected by this, since in practice all the implementation work happens before we get to LC anyway

[02:34:06.0000] <othermaciej>
and it's hard to be confident in an implementation without a thorough test suite, which is also very hard to develop against a constantly evolving snapshot

[02:34:07.0000] <tantek>
(ahem, CSS 2.0 vs. CSS 2.1 etc.)

[02:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: hopefully - some HTML5 features that seem useful still have 0 implementations

[02:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: i'm not aware of any good VCS that handles forking over multiple years in what i would consider a "sane" manner

[02:35:02.0000] <tantek>
btw in terms of "how do I use microformats with a specific version of HTML", I drafted this as a start: http://microformats.org/wiki/HTML3

[02:35:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: I think is mainly depends on quite how much they diverge

[02:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: i'd expect that to be "a lot"

[02:35:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: I expect HTML 6 would mainly add stuff to it

[02:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
if i add stuff into the middle of the navigation algorithm, no amount of VCS is going to keep me sane

[02:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but really the challenge for using the spec is not just new features (where naturally you look there first) but rather aligning old implementations of features that used to be in the mutual reverse engineering domain with the spec

[02:36:02.0000] <takkaria>
othermaciej: it's also hard to write tests for a evolving snapshot, which is part of the problem...

[02:36:03.0000] <othermaciej>
takkaria: indeed - I believe I mentioned that above

[02:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yeah

[02:37:00.0000] <takkaria>
othermaciej: ah, I misparsed :)

[02:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it will be very hard to every fully support HTML5 without a "bug fix only" branch

[02:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[02:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(a bug-fix-only branch of the spec that is)

[02:37:04.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: returning to the elements vs role conversation, while you’re not starting from scratch I perceive HTML5’s structural elements as new as role would be, so I’m still wondering why elements over role

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: oh if we keep adding new features, we'll never get to the point where there are two full impls, sure

[02:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
a version of the spec that only corrects errors, doesn't add new functionality, so that you can go through methodically without it changing out from under you

[02:38:02.0000] <boblet>
are there any advantages of using elements, or conversely are there any disadvantages of using roles?

[02:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: because <foo> is nicer to type than <z z="foo">

[02:39:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: yep, that’s a good reason

[02:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: if the syntax made it easier to have nodes in the DOM be given multiple labels at once, e.g. if the syntax had <a b c> as equivalent to <c b a> or <b a c> or whatever, that'd be a very different story

[02:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
software projects pretty commonly have stable and new development branches, rarely ones that live for years, but that is not unprecedented

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yeah, it may be that that the benefits to implementors are worth the pain to the spec writer :-)

[02:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i've never heard of any project that had a branch that lasted more than about a month where people on the project haven't complained that it was a mistake

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
and i've heard of _many_ such branches

[02:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit has had stable branches last over a year that we actually shipped off of, but they didn't have direct new development and the longer you go the harder it gets to backport fixes

[02:42:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - indeed, your revising of specs points are good ones.

[02:42:01.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: not sure I understood that :) what about <ul role="aside nav"> vs <aside><nav><ul> for article section links?

[02:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
we didn't really complain about that except to the extent that backporting bug fixes is less fun than new development

[02:42:03.0000] <tantek>
for this reason I'm simultaneously editing an hCard 1.0.1 and hCard 1.1.

[02:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
although the one time we tried feature development based on an old branch - it was hell

[02:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: <aside><nav> is redundant, just use <nav>, but in general i'd say the role="" alternative looks much uglier and doesn't really get you any useful benefits.

[02:43:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
othermaciej: It'd be nice to have an infinitely large test suite and a no-regressions policy so you could always ship the latest code :)

[02:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: again, because of the way the DOM works, there are things that are much harder to do if you put the semantics in attributes

[02:43:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(But yeah, that's mainly idealistic)

[02:43:05.0000] <othermaciej>
sadly, our test suite is not yet infinite

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: e.g. <z z="audio applet"> -- does it have an HTMLAudioElement interface, or an HTMLAppletElement interface?

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: does it spawn an applet or play audio?

[02:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: similarly, consider the huge pain that <input type=""> has been in terms of changing the implementation of the widget dynamically

[02:44:03.0000] <othermaciej>
<input type="bad design">

[02:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: what happens when a script changes a <z z="iframe"> to a <z z="embed">?

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it's the same design as role="", basically

[02:45:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Is that really any worse than changing tagName?

[02:45:02.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: ok thanks for the detailed explanation. I think I understand the issue a lot better now. Will have to chat more about this with John the next time he’s over

[02:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: preaching to the choir, sir

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: you can't change tagname

[02:46:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
localName?

[02:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
you can't change localname either

[02:46:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
readonly too

[02:46:04.0000] <othermaciej>
although type="" is more narrowly scoped and the corner cases of the behavior are now reasonably well defined, so it's relatively tamed

[02:46:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
How boring.

[02:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there is renameNode() in DOM Level 3 Core

[02:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it certainly was significant effort to define how on earth to handle type="" changes :-)

[02:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I would expect browser-hosted implementations to always make a new node for that

[02:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
(renameNode() creates a new node and copies the attributes over, basically)

[02:48:00.0000] <boblet>
It’d be a good idea for this to be addressed in the FAQ sometime as it’s a pretty popular topic atm (eg recent zeldman.com article comments)

[02:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it gives implementations the option to actually change the existing node's tag name, but that would be dumb

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: please feel free to collect the responses here into a coherent entry for the faq and to add it :-)

[02:50:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: d’oh! :)

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it's especially bad if it means some UAs return the same node and others have two nodes

[02:50:02.0000] <boblet>
oh btw if anyone has the time (har!) to check out some articles I wrote on HTML5 I’d appreciate some feedback

[02:51:00.0000] <boblet>
The most recent one is: http://bit.ly/TE2TL “HTML5 structure—HTML4 and XHTML1 to HTML5”

[02:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I could rant for a long time about the many bad ideas in the DOM, but I'm just going to remind myself of the channel topic

[02:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[02:53:00.0000] <boblet>
thanks for your time all. Later!

[02:54:00.0000] <tantek>
heh indeed

[02:54:01.0000] <tantek>
that seems like an appropriate note to call it a night.

[02:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:54:03.0000] <tantek>
thanks for the updates and feedback Hixie and othermaciej.

[03:00:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me normally calls this a morning

[03:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/test/html/semantics/video/support/video.php - chrome seems happy to ignore mime type in <video>

[03:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
doublec: ^

[03:19:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: You've gone for the night! Go way!

[03:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
i did?

[03:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: what's the actual type of that video?

[03:21:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: it's an ogg/theora/vorbis file

[03:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
huh. i don't remember installed xiph codecs, i wonder when i did that

[03:25:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
When you thought it was a good idea?

[03:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i just updated webkit and now it's giving a crash dialog all the time... but the safari window is still open and more or less usable

[03:27:01.0000] <zcorpan>
oh well

[04:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the problem <div role=navigation> solves compared to <nav> is the parsing of <p>foo<nav><p>bar... in legacy browsers

[04:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's it?

[04:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's what has everyone up in arms?

[04:07:00.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, yeah, that and the perception that role="" is more extensible than creating new elements

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought everyone wanted to write XHTML-like strict syntax with closing tags and everything, so implied </p>s wouldn't make a difference

[04:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: btw, regarding your earlier comments about XSLT, XHTML and performance: with the Validator.nu HTML Parser, the step of serializing as XHTML5 and reparsing as XML is optimized away

[04:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: (earlier as in a week or so earlier)

[04:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I'm leaning towards making implied </p> closes warnings even when V.nu users don't ask for it

[04:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: with the new structural elements, omitting </p> may be a real compat issue 

[04:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: but not for e.g. <p><p>?

[04:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I might like it to silently accept <p>...<p>... and <div><p>...</div>, but warn if the </p> is implied by a start tag other than <p>

[04:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I can imagine that making it an unconditional warning for <p>foo<p>bar could annoy people

[04:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: makes sense

[04:12:03.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i think p and form have weird parsing in various browsers

[04:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<p><form>, <form><p></form>x, etc

[04:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
<p><table> in ie7

[04:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: if you have an option to warn for all implied tags, you could make it clear in the UI that it's for debugging rather than Superior Correctness

[04:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: any suggestions on how to make it clear?

[04:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Debugging options: show messages for implied tags

[04:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe could have them as Info rather than warning

[04:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: yeah, info makes sense

[04:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the other problem that role=navigation solves is that you can overlay role=navigation onto an <ul>

[04:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: no, I don't understand why the extra DOM node / CSS box for <nav> is an issue

[04:20:02.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: discussion on that blog post I linked to yesterday is on-going, be good to get some feedback from your end :)

[04:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish we could put a swift end to the "HTML is sloppy" meme, but I guess it's futile to try as long as implied tag messages on V.nu are vaporware

[04:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the question "what problem does it solve" sort of asks for the answer to be a problem, not a random feature of questionable value :-P

[04:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish i understood why implied tags are sloppy

[04:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I know

[04:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: feel free to ask people who prefer role=navigation why they prefer it

[04:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I also don't understand why it's important to care about being consistent with <br> vs. <br/> within a document but not so important to care about consistency with <br/> vs. <br />

[04:24:00.0000] <mookid>
Hixie: implied tags will bring pain and hurt the same way that semi-colon insertion causes problems in javascript

[04:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I think the difference between <br>, <br/> and <br /> isn't something a validator should whine about. I think it's something that a "reformat code" command in a text editor should fix

[04:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why people want the /> at all

[04:25:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Because it is explicit and you don't need to remember what tags are implicit

[04:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
i really hate it personally

[04:25:03.0000] <mookid>
it's the parser equivalent of bank-bailouts

[04:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: i really can't say i've ever found that a problem

[04:25:05.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: you need to remember which tags are implicit anyway.

[04:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
allowing /> has the drawback that people think they can write <div/> too

[04:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: </p> won't help you when you write <p>foo<table>...</table>bar</p>

[04:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: indeed

[04:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: /> confuses the mental model people have

[04:26:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: Yeah, right. But if you disallow implicit tags…

[04:26:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me doesn't think doing so is a good idea though

[04:26:06.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, warning about implied </p> when it's implied by one of the new HTML5 sectioning elements would be valuable for compat reasons. But warning about when it's implied by <p> or <div> is too much

[04:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: what about <p><form>?

[04:27:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me thinks unquoted attribute values starting with ` should be non-conforming, for IE compat.

[04:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: what about <p><table>?

[04:29:00.0000] <mookid>
you poor people realy have to go through all this stuff every day don't you?

[04:30:00.0000] <mookid>
pretty thankless task

[04:31:00.0000] <mookid>
good on you :)

[04:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe knowing when omitting quotes is OK should be positioned as professional 1337 skillz instead of positioning quote omission as sloppy :-)

[04:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, zcorpan, I'm not sure about those

[04:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
IIRC, HTML5 says those should imply </p>, right?

[04:34:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: yes

[04:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I used to like always quoting just to avoid wondering whether I had to

[04:34:03.0000] <Lachy>
which browser doesn't do that? Is it just IE?

[04:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
now I drop the quotes only when I'm sure they are not needed (e.g. attribute value is a single purely alphanumeric word)

[04:35:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
IE < 8 and IE 8 when not in IE8 mode

[04:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I still like providing implied open and close tags because the more I learn about the rules for those, the less confident I am of ever getting them right

[04:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, ok. that makes them problematic, at least for now

[04:37:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
othermaciej: If you ignore where whitespace goes they aren't that complex

[04:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, I never found the rules for implied tags complicated. At least for HTML4, they seemed fairly intuitive.

[04:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the only time I've had trouble with authoring quoteless attributes was when I had /> immediately after

[04:37:03.0000] <hsivonen>
those two features aren't nice together

[04:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, do you always include <tbody>?  From my experience, that's one of the few that most people leave out

[04:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
no, not <tbody>

[04:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I didn't even know it existed until after I started working on a Web browser

[04:38:03.0000] <Lachy>
I usually leave it out, except when I also use <thead>

[04:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
of course that's almost 8 years ago now

[04:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I was thinking to myself who might have the record for working the longest continuously on a single browser, and I am betting it's someone at Opera

[04:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
at least if you don't count Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox as a single browser lineage

[04:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
we have a number of people who have worked more than 8 years at opera

[04:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, that's possible. We have a few staff who've been here for 10 years. Then there's people like Jon and Håkon who've been here since the beginning.

[04:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: hyatt's high up on that list i'm sure

[04:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: howcome wasn't at opera since the beginning

[04:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
IE had a break and I count Netscape --> Firefox as a discontinuity although I'm not going to declare exactly where it happened

[04:42:03.0000] <Lachy>
wasn't he?

[04:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
brendan too

[04:42:05.0000] <Hixie>
(brendan would be high on the list i mean)

[04:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh on a single browser

[04:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah

[04:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
as opposed to browsers in general

[04:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
hm

[04:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
hard to say what a single browser is really

[04:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
netscape->firefox probably was less of a change than some opera releases

[04:43:06.0000] <othermaciej>
on browsers continuously in general, then yeah, probably some Mozilla people have a good claim

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dan Mosedale would probably be high on the list

[04:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
would he still count as "working on a browser"?

[04:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. MailCo...

[05:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
"< Lachy> IIRC, HTML5 says those should imply </p>, right?" ... "I never found the rules for implied tags complicated" - if they're not complicated, why did you sound so uncertain about those cases? :-)

[05:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I couldn't remember if HTML5 changed those rules.

[05:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
I remember there was discussion about doing that, at least for <p><table>

[05:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
this is why i don't change the rules willy nilly and try to keep them as simple as possible :-P

[05:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
So it sounds like they are a bit complicated

[05:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, you also quote mined me.  I also said "At least for HTML4, they seemed fairly intuitive."

[05:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a Mail.app solution for marking dupes in www-archive read if I've already read them in my WHATWG/public-html folder?

[05:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
he doesn't like my solution :-P

[05:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
(route all mail through gmail)

[05:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, how does routing it all through gmail help?

[05:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
gmail coallesces duplicate e-mails

[05:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
my mind just exploded

[05:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: how does gmail figure out what my preferred folder for a given email is? or do they show up in all folders but get marked read?

[05:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
steven pemberton just told me something was "not valid, but permitted"

[05:08:05.0000] <Lachy>
wtf?

[05:08:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: URL?

[05:09:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Is there any way to get the interface of an element (given a DOM element node)?

[05:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: if you get multiple copies of an e-mail, it picks one of them and junks the rest. so, if you're using Sender: headers or some such for filtering, you get a random one.

[05:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
(this also means that if you're cc'ed on a message to a w3c list, you won't have the X-Archived-At headers, which is making it harder for me to give y'all a link to the aforementioned message)

[05:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ah. when an email is sent to hsivonen⊙if, public-html and www-archive, I'd prefer to see only the public-html copy

[05:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2009Jul/0117.html

[05:10:03.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I filter most of my mail based on the List-Id using .procmailrc

[05:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah, you'd likely get the hsivonen⊙if copy (since gmail would see that one first)

[05:10:05.0000] <Hixie>
(i use recipient filtering to get around this)

[05:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: wow. (at Steven)

[05:12:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
So he's basically just saying HTML 4.01 has rules for invalid content.

[05:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: that reminds me of the novel interpretations of what XML 1.0 says about error handling

[05:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
If it's permitted, what is not permitted?

[05:13:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me isn't sure he understands the email

[05:14:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Still, is there any way to get the interface implemented by a DOM element node?

[05:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It makes sense that it's permitted in the sense that nobody will come and shoot you if you write it, even though it's invalid, but that applies to all strings of bytes so it's not a very interesting distinction, and I'm not sure what sense makes more sense)

[05:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
I'd want a way to have my mail filtering work much more like usenet newsgroups work with good clients. i.e. Dupes get filtered into individual mailing list folders, but when one is read in one folder all dupes with the same message ID get marked as read too.

[05:15:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
he doesn't really explain what "permitted but invalid" means

[05:15:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
maybe you have his permission to make invalid documents

[05:15:02.0000] <othermaciej_>
(thanks Steve!)

[05:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
I find Steven's message confusing, since he claims that HTML5 conflates the issue of conformance and processing, but it is in fact his claims that seem to do that

[05:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
since he quoted a processing requirement to back up his claim that something was permitted, despite being invalid

[05:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, his understanding of HTML vs. XHTML and MIME types is even more twisted. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2009Jul/0118.html

[05:20:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: Find a normative statement to disprove that.

[05:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, disprove what?

[05:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I think the opinion on MIME types is not news

[05:21:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: Find something that means that MIME types have to describe the data.

[05:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: i plan to include that statement in my updates of the mime registrations for text/html and application/xhtml+xml, fwiw

[05:23:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
And that isn't going to happen until we reach REC, I guess

[05:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, "Content-Type specifies the media type of the underlying data." -- RFC 2616 section 7.2.1

[05:24:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: That's an informative statement.

[05:25:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: There was a long discussion about this on ietf-http-wg

[05:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
in a normative section?

[05:25:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That doesn't make it normative.

[05:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: i plan to start doing it next month, dunno how the ietf will take it though

[05:26:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hmm, text/html and application/xhtml+xml are only informational RFCs

[05:26:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
And as they are informational, I don't think you can have normative requirements (as otherwise it isn't informational)

[05:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
...for now

[05:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the MIME type dictates processing, it makes sense that it should dictate conformance

[05:31:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
othermaciej: What, normatively, says the MIME type dictates processing?

[05:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
what makes sense is to figure out how to spec that soundly, rather than to quibble about whether it is the case

[05:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
christ it's late

[05:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
when did that happen

[05:31:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Well, you said "nn" several hours ago

[05:31:05.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders|work: nothing says that normatively - it's just true as a fact of reality

[05:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
i was saying that to tantek who said he was going to bed

[05:32:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Oh, OK. I thought you were too.

[05:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
lord no, it was barely midnight

[05:32:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me facepalms

[05:33:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me still wants an answer to his question (of whether you can find out what interface a DOM element implements)

[05:33:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Like whether it is just HTMLElement or some sub-interface)

[05:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders|work: you mean from code?

[05:34:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
othermaciej: Yes, from JS

[05:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, if (elm instanceof HTMLFooElement) { ... } else if (elm instanceof HTMLBarElement) ...

[05:36:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: No way to just get the name as a string or whatever?

[05:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
instanceof would be a sound way - a hackier way would be to toString() it and remove the "[object " prefix and "]" suffix

[05:36:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, toString() could work, but no guarantee of its reliability

[05:36:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(neither of these techniques will tell you all implemented interfaces, just the one that the implementation considers the "class")

[05:37:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: Unreliable how?

[05:37:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
othermaciej: Yeah, right

[05:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I seem to recall some spec adding requirements for toString (can't remember if it was HTML5 or Web IDL)

[05:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
toString() will fail for some elements like HTMLAnchorElement (<a>) which stringify

[05:37:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but I don't think IE will do it

[05:38:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oh yay

[05:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
good point

[05:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the RDFa TF thread is http://archive.scripting.com/2003/06/13#When:8:12:30AM all over again

[05:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
julian and i actually agree on something

[05:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
IE8 seems to do it properly in IE8 mode, but IE7 mode and earlier generally just return "[object]" for most elements

[05:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
now i KNOW i have to go to bed, i'm clearly halucinating

Quick, go quiet in here!

[05:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: research time :-) type="video/..." or type="audio/..." (or single quotes)

[05:41:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: i'd like to know common values for the ... in html pages

[05:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me must get back to work. I need to answer complicated questions for my US work visa, explaining why the US should let Opera employ me there, instead of hiring a US citizen.

[05:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I hope it can wait, since I should probably unplug my computer to avoid the possibility of it getting lightninged and I have no battery power left

[05:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: sure no rush

[05:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
Remind me later if I forget :-)

[05:43:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: I do like how a country founded on immigration is so hostile to immigrants

[05:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or possibly without quotes

[05:45:00.0000] <remysharp>
gsnedders|work: can I ask a Q about your outliner?

[05:45:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
remysharp: Sure

[05:45:02.0000] <remysharp>
when it hits a section that doesn't have a title, it says untitled section

[05:45:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Right

[05:45:04.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, yeah, a lot of countries are becoming like that, unfortunately

[05:46:00.0000] <remysharp>
sorry - just checking what I wanted to ask - one mo...

[05:46:01.0000] <remysharp>
the spec says re: section: "typically with a heading"

[05:46:02.0000] <remysharp>
but if it doesn't contain a heading, is an outliner going to assume the heading then?

[05:46:03.0000] <remysharp>
this doesn't really come across in the current spec - so just checking really.

[05:47:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
remysharp: That's up to the implementer

[05:47:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
remysharp: I took the solution of giving "Untitled Section"

[05:47:02.0000] <remysharp>
okay, but it's fair to say that it could just be ignored in the TOC too?

[05:48:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Yeah

[05:48:01.0000] <remysharp>
I guess in a way, your outliner is making me question my use of <section> - so perhaps I should have used a <div> in certain places.

[05:48:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I think Anolis does that, but mainly because I meant it to say "Untitled Section" but I screwed up :)

[05:49:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
remysharp: Yeah, I wanted to point out untitled sections there

[05:49:01.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders|work: maybe you should make "Untitled Section" italic or something

[05:49:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
remysharp: But otherwise it's somewhat missing some sections, which seems suboptimal for an outline

[05:49:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
zcorpan: Yeah, probably

[05:50:00.0000] <remysharp>
Here's the url I'm running it against: http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffull-frontal.org

[05:50:01.0000] <remysharp>
The thing is - 

[05:50:02.0000] <remysharp>
is that it's putting untitled section at the top level

[05:50:03.0000] <remysharp>
which looks like the title of the toc

[05:50:04.0000] <remysharp>
*doc

[05:50:05.0000] <remysharp>
but it's not - I've used a <section> to align the page to the centre

[05:51:00.0000] <remysharp>
rather than a <div> because IE would render the background of the <div> with JS off - so it's a reasonable work around to wrap with a <section>

[05:51:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
zcorpan: It should do that now

[05:51:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
No, it throws an error now

[05:51:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
fail

[05:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
remysharp: if you just want to center the page, don't use <section>

[05:52:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Now it works

[05:52:02.0000] <remysharp>
zcorpan: what would you suggest?

[05:52:03.0000] <Lachy>
remysharp, as a rule of thumb, I recommend that content with its own heading should use section (or other appropriate sectioning element), and otherwise just use div

[05:52:04.0000] <zcorpan>
remysharp: center the <body>

[05:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders|work: nice

[05:54:00.0000] <remysharp>
zcorpan: I'm going to test centering the body, but I'm not sure that's the right solution.

[05:54:01.0000] <remysharp>
As the big man said: I'll be back.

[06:01:00.0000] <remysharp>
zcorpan: centering half works

[06:01:01.0000] <remysharp>
technically it's the right thing

[06:02:00.0000] <remysharp>
but from a styling point of view, it means we (authors) lose flexibility to style our documents

[06:03:00.0000] <remysharp>
bah, I'm not sure there's a right answer, except whether untitled sections (i.e. lacking headings) should be included in the TOC since the spec says "typically"

[06:10:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me is feeling distinctly "meh" at late '80s The Sisters Of Mercy

[06:13:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me notes that coincides with the time that goth rock became popular… coincidence?

[06:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders who The Sisters of Mercy are.

[06:16:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sisters_of_Mercy

[06:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
they appear to only be popular in the UK

[06:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
which would explain why I haven't heard of them or any of their songs

[06:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. crap. It seems I have a broken hard disk, and I lost data again.

[06:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
something that I had sworn would never happen again

[06:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, no backup?

[06:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
but I hadn't had the time to make everything work with my RAID

[06:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I think there's a time window of photos without backups

[06:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ooh. ooh. maybe I do have that stuff on two disks

[06:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe I just lost some scanned receipts whose hard copies exist off-site anyway

[06:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm angry that other people are allowed to blow up bedrock and there's nothing I can do to keep them from sending shockwaves to my office

[06:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, do you know what it would cost to get the data professionally recovered

[06:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: too much

[06:29:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[06:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: at least it was too much when I last had a hard drive incident in 2004 or 2005

[06:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
is the disk functional at all?

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It makes bad noise and doesn't automount

[06:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok. That might make it difficult to use data recovery software

[06:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
however, I have an offsite backup that was taken just a couple of days before that disk was cloned

[06:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and since then, I have done very little that I don't also have on the internal drive

[06:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, I guess I'll just have to bite the bullet, take the offsite backup and merge it and the internal drive state to a RAID

[06:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm hoping I never run into that problem again. Although, I need to keep increasing my amount of storage space.

[06:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the reason why I hadn't taken the RAID to use is that I was unable to get my whole home directory working off NFS

[06:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I'm going to try to use AFP with ~/Library on a local disk and everything else symlinked to the RAID

[06:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
so far, I'm up to 8TB worth of external drives. It's not quite enough though

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I started to use Flickr in order to have an in-the-cloud copy of my photos, but I'm 7 months behind getting my photos uploaded

[06:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
I want an in-the-cloud copy of my ripped DVD collection. But I don't have the bandwidth up upload 2TB worth of ISOs, nor any cost effective storage provider

[06:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
well, there are a ton of backups of popular culture around

[06:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
where?

[06:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm worried about data I produce myself and the isn't on Flickr, on hsivonen.iki.fi, in svn or in hg yet

[06:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
in any DVD store

[06:38:03.0000] <Lachy>
that defeates the purpose of ripping the data off the discs in the first place

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I did the stupid, stupid thing when the failed drive started making noise. I turned it off. I should have kept in on and started to copy it to another drive immediately.

[07:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't quite understand how he complains about it being Hixie's spec and a despotic regime, and then complains about design by committee - surely it can't be both?

[07:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if he's missing something

[07:08:00.0000] <takkaria>
I think that's part of the problem

[07:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me also wonders if the hate mail has been actually sent by people or by *a* person

[07:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder why anyone would be sending him hate mail about HTML5?

[07:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
maybe it would be worth contacting him for clarification

[07:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: thanks!

[08:08:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Does Mozilla still support HTMLUnknownElement?

[08:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, <foo></foo><script>w(document.getElementsByTagName("foo")[0])</script>

[08:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
apparently, yes

[08:10:00.0000] <takkaria>

no, just in Gecko, and only for textareas/textboxes.

ah, right. Hm - let me try to explain better

[09:38:03.0000] <remysharp>

you can override it

[13:44:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
I want to ask a question to solve a discussion from #html: If one is abandoning XHTML for a page, should he use the new doctype or an HTML 4 doctype? How do older browsers handle <DOCTYPE html>?

[13:44:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
s/#html/#css/

[13:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sidnicious: It makes old browsers render in standards mode (instead of quirks mode)

[13:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sidnicious: See e.g. the table near the bottom of http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/

[13:48:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
The people I'm talking to think of HTML 5 as separate from HTML 4, and believe that it's dangerous to use the new doctype until HTML 5 is officially supported by every popular browser

[13:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Sidnicious: It is officially supported to some extent in all browsers.

[13:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
Sidnicious: Every popular browser behaves precisely the same if you use <!DOCTYPE html> as if you use e.g. <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

[13:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sidnicious: (That also works the other way, so you can use HTML5 features like <canvas> and <video> with an HTML4 doctype exactly the same as with the HTML5 doctype)

[13:53:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Philip`: Great, thank you.

[13:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Sidnicious: The only difference is in what is conforming, and what throws a validation error (though almost everything from HTML 4.01 Strict is conforming HTML 5)

[15:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"Mark as read" on 500 emails feels good.

[15:15:01.0000] <takkaria>

Heh. Fair enough.

[15:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Actually, that's not true, when dealing with quick 2.5" HDs disk space is fairly expensive, but I have bigger issues than email)

[15:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Disk space is really cheap until you've got one byte more data than you have storage, and then it's really expensive

[15:20:01.0000] <ezyang>
gsnedders: you can totally have asubscription and instruct it not to send you messages. 

[15:21:00.0000] <Philip`>

Hixie wrote it. Don't assume it will be.

[15:26:01.0000] <gavin_>
(why is it locally generated to begin with?)

[15:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
gavin_: Because Hixie told me to write the script to do it on the server, and I haven't written it yet.

gavin_: I think the idea is that when you click a use of a definition, it jumps to the use by giving it a locally-generated ID (because normally it's just an <a href> without an id)

[15:28:00.0000] <gavin_>
I see

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
gavin_: the definition is the bold word that says "not handled"

[15:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
gavin_: it's just a constant. It could say "after which the error is either grapefruit or pineapple:"

[15:36:00.0000] <gavin_>
that's not what I'd call a definition

[15:37:00.0000] <gavin_>
but I get it now

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that it's not really a definition. not sure what the definition would be though

[15:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's like "true" and "False"

[15:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, talk about preaching to the choir http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2009Jul/0127.html

[17:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: amusing

[04:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is tempted to do more work on HTTP parsing

[04:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it sensible to use ABNF but state that alternations must be matched from left to right?

[04:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: yeah, I think it would be. as long as you made that clear in the spec

[04:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It means I don't end up with things like: ( [ ":" *LWS ] 1*header-content-nc [ *LWS ":" ] / 1*":" / 1*header-content-nc 1*LWS ":" *LWS header-content [ *( header-content / LWS ) header-content ] ) *LWS

[04:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That was an attempt to give everything that doesn't match another rule :)

[04:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
If the order of matching is important, that sounds like a fundamental shift from the usual notion of a language grammar

[04:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
*( %x00-09 / %x0B-FF ) LF is a lot simpler :)

[04:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
(since normally grammars just define a set of matching strings, and it's irrelevant how you matched it)

[04:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The URI spec relies upon such a restraint though

[04:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
It sort of sounds like you want to define a new type of alternative, such that "Rule1 / Rule2" matches if Rule1 matches or else if Rule1 doesn't match and Rule2 does match

[04:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
but that matches exactly the same as the normal type of alternative

[04:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I may be misunderstanding what you want

[04:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Peh. If anyone complains I'll just say that RFC 3986 and 3987 (URI and IRI respectively) do this too.

[04:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/exactly the same/exactly the same set of strings/

[04:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose it makes more sense if you have an unambiguous grammar and you're interested in which rules match

[04:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is there any way to easily work out a rule that represents everything that doesn't match another rule?

[04:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
in which case it seems like the 'correct' thing to do would be to define an AABNF which adds a new unambiguating-alternative rule

[04:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
because then it would be well defined and unambiguous and everything

[04:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dammit

[04:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: help me out please

[04:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
  File "tools/spec-splitter.py", line 64, in ?

[04:42:05.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I don't think it is

[04:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: missing python module?

[04:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: ?

[04:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
or a not-up-to-date one?

[04:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: ...but I could be wrong

[04:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/it is/there is/

[04:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, there is.

[04:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That makes a lot more sense.

[04:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: my lxml too old, maybe?

[04:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nm

[04:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll run it from another host where I can actually make the sure packages are up to date

[05:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Hmm, I'm probably wrong, but I don't know why

[05:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: I think it requires lxml 2.0

[05:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
but that's the only version issue I know of

[05:01:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: yep, I think so. and I updating to 2.0 on the host I was trying this on would be too much of a PITA, so I'll just run it from my own server

[09:28:00.0000] <inimino>
gsnedders: what you describe is basically a PEG

[09:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
a PEG?

[09:29:01.0000] <inimino>
rather than BNF

[09:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me points out he isn't a compsci guy

[09:30:01.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar

[09:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
inimino: I do, however, need something formally defined to enough of an extent to use in a spec.

[09:45:00.0000] <inimino>
PEGs are quite formally defined, but if the protocol is byte-oriented you might want to use the ABNF notation for terminals anyway

[09:45:01.0000] <inimino>
it's fairly common to treat ABNF this way and there are even some parser generators that treat ABNF like something it's not

[09:46:00.0000] <inimino>
technically it's impossible to generate an efficient parser from an ABNF since they can be ambiguous

[09:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
inimino: Yeah, right, I know.

[13:07:00.0000] <guyzmo>
hi

[13:08:00.0000] <guyzmo>
I'm parsing an html page with html5lib, and I get troubles when I want to get contents

[13:08:01.0000] <guyzmo>
like when I'm in an anchor element, shall I use toxml() to get the XXX part of : "<a>XXX</a>" ?

[13:08:02.0000] <guyzmo>
(haven't found any other way)

[14:10:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: Why does section 11 of the HTML5 spec use the XHTML namespace while defining style for HTML5-only elements?

[14:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
GPHemsley: All HTML5 elements are parsed into the XHTML namespace

[14:36:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Philip`: Oh. Is that implicit?

[14:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
GPHemsley: It's explicit in the spec that that happens, but the markup doesn't have to have any xmlns attributes or anything

[14:37:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
k

[15:15:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
What's the difference between <embed> and <object>? Is one favored over the other?

[15:20:00.0000] <jcranmer>
<embed> is specifically plugin related, IIRC

[15:20:01.0000] <jcranmer>
that is, I'm pretty sure an image/*-in-embed wouldn't work

[15:56:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
jcranmer: What about Flash?

[15:56:01.0000] <jcranmer>
/me doesn't know anything

[15:56:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
k

[15:57:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Strangely, you also cannot style <object>, it seems. It styles the fall-back underneath. :/


2009-07-19
[19:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: can an unquoted attribute value contain a solidus?

[19:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, I guess it can

[19:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nm

[01:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wow. Lovely weather.

[01:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
wasn't the margins on <section> and company zcorpan's idea

[06:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
document.getItems() is a pretty generic name, hope it doesn't lead to confusion

[06:12:00.0000] <hendry>
zcorpan: oh. urm. It's not obvious to me what h1 I should put there on the body root. I'd rather not have anything.

[06:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hendry: you could wrap the <article> around the "Spanish sensibilities" section

[06:14:00.0000] <hendry>
zcorpan: true

[06:14:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hendry: "Archives Links" seems like it shouldn't be a heading, maybe <nav>

[10:25:00.0000] <nslater>
why does this document talk about MIME types instead of media types:

[10:26:00.0000] <nslater>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/

[10:26:01.0000] <nslater>
also, I notice this:

[10:26:02.0000] <nslater>
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#media-types

[10:27:00.0000] <nslater>
which has a section called "media types" and then talkes about MIME types

[10:29:00.0000] <nslater>
hmm, this also seems to use the two interchangeably:

[10:29:01.0000] <nslater>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html

[10:30:00.0000] <nslater>
are these oversights, or is there some specific distinction the working group is intenting to highlight? sorry if I'm missing anything obvious, this is just a drive-by comment after skimming some linked from intertwingly.net

[11:06:00.0000] <ehird>
wow — [[That’s where we are with HTML. If we were designing a spec from scratch, it would look much like XHTML 2, which I described elsewhere as “a beautiful specification of philosophical purity that had absolutely no resemblance to the real world”, and which was aborted by the W3C last week.]] — no comment required; it practically satires itself

[11:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
nslater: Just editorial inconsistency.

[13:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, you're now an admin for the whatwg blog

[13:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me starts carrying out his plan for world domination

[13:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, where exactly did that spammer inject that crap into?

[13:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: footer

[13:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
in the template?

[13:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll just restore that from backup

[13:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Yeah, the footer.

[13:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I could just delete it from the admin panel :P

[13:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I can just as easily restore the entire template directory, so we don't miss anything

[13:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
crap. The most recent backup has it too. Looks like we were hit a while ago without anyone noticing

[13:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just installed a fresh copy of the default kubrik theme

[13:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me excitingly finds a trivial way to make a .ttf file that crashes Opera on OS X, but seemingly no other browsers and no other OSes

[13:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders where crashes reported via Opera's magical popup error-reporting dialog box go to

[13:27:01.0000] <takkaria>
the internal BTS

[13:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, I think the WP-Cache plugin is making it harder to erradicate the spam :-(

[13:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
I just need to figure out how to force it to invalidate the cache

[13:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
done

[13:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: Hmm, I guess it's a part of the BTS that I can't see

[13:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
Philip`: I'm guessing as much, anyway

[13:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: Oh, okay

[13:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Where in BTS? I've never seen them.

[13:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess Desktop team though anyway

[13:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I just changed my SSH keys for everything recently. I suppose I could also change the password, but I will have to look up what it is and find out how to change it

[13:35:01.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders/Philip`: hm, I may be mistaken then

[13:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, to prevent that from happening again, I made all of the template directories non-writable

[13:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
so if anyone ever wants to edit the templates, ask me first

[13:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
nslater: fixed the "media types" section title; where else are they used interchangeably?

[13:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: thanks, good work

[14:01:00.0000] <nslater>
Hixie: hey, well just poked around whatever documents I could find in google, and I seem to find both being used. shouldn't "media type" be the one you use? MIME is old, and for email. right?

[14:03:00.0000] <nslater>
"An Internet media type,[1] originally called a MIME type after MIME and sometimes a Content-type after the name of a header in several protocols whose value is such a type, is a two-part identifier for file formats on the Internet." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type

[14:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
nslater: the term "media type" is also used for things like "screen" vs "tv" vs "braille" so it would be confusing to (continue to) call MIME types "media types", so that's why we try to use "MIME types" for those

[14:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
(MIME types don't really talk about "media" per se so the term "media type" is very misleading)

[14:12:00.0000] <nslater>
Hixie: that's an interesting point, but at this stage, I think the generally accepted name is media type and it would seem weird to ignore that, especially if that introuces nomenclature discrepencies with the rest of the W3C cannon. is it really that much of an issue? I'm guessing that its meaning can be accurately infered from context. you're not likely to talk about Internet Media Types and @media types in the same sections

[14:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
nslater: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-source-element talks about media types and MIME types in adjacent normative paragraphs

[14:13:01.0000] <nslater>
heh, that was quick!

[14:13:02.0000] <nslater>
/me checks

[14:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
(though it tries to avoid the term "media type" altogether to reduce confusion for precisely this reason)

[14:14:01.0000] <nslater>
wow, that document has caused firefox to grey out under gnome!

[14:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh let me send you a link to the multipage version

[14:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
hold on

[14:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#the-source-element

[14:17:00.0000] <nslater>
hmm, if "media type" was hyperlinked each time, like I see "media resource" is, would that not help? I'm actually strugling to see the other use of media type in this section. can you give me a bit of text to search for? 

[14:18:00.0000] <nslater>
"The media  attribute gives the intended media type of the media resource, to help the user agent determine if this media resource is useful to the user before fetching it. Its value must be a valid media query."

[14:18:01.0000] <nslater>
.. I think that's the bit

[14:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
Right, the type attribute is a MIME type, the media attribute is a media query.

[14:19:00.0000] <nslater>
which could be reworded to "The media  attribute gives the intended type of the media resource" maybe? dunno

[14:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
"media resource"?

[14:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's the media type of the resource

[14:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. whether it's intended for screen, or projection, or whatever

[14:19:04.0000] <nslater>
I just copied that from the document

[14:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
(the hyperlinking solution would fail in the print copy)

[14:20:01.0000] <nslater>
"The media attribute gives the intended media type of the media resource"

[14:20:02.0000] <nslater>
to:

[14:20:03.0000] <nslater>
"The media attribute gives the intended type of the media resource"

[14:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
what kind of type?

[14:20:05.0000] <Hixie>
media type? MIME type? codec type?

[14:21:00.0000] <nslater>
hmm..

[14:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. the long and short of it is the word "media type" is being used to mean, well, the kind of media, and the word MIME type is being used for MIME types

[14:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
because that avoids the confusion

[14:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
at least a little

[14:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
i can mention this explicitly in the terminology section if you like

[14:21:05.0000] <nslater>
I notice that IANA uses both at the same time, which really helps:

[14:21:06.0000] <nslater>
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/

[14:21:07.0000] <nslater>
heh

[14:21:08.0000] <nslater>
Hixie: yeah, that might be a good idea

[14:23:00.0000] <nslater>
both these documents use "media type" as a section header fwiw:

[14:23:01.0000] <nslater>
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#media-types

[14:23:02.0000] <nslater>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html

[14:23:03.0000] <nslater>
there may be more, I didn't check

[14:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
the TR page is obsolete, don't worry about that

[14:23:05.0000] <nslater>
sure

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
the only remaining mention of "media type" in the other one is talking about media types

[14:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
not mime types

[14:25:00.0000] <nslater>
okay cool

[14:27:00.0000] <nslater>
thanks for the feedback too, didn't know if irc was appropriate for minor comments

[14:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's ok, e-mail is preferred if you want it to definitely be responded to :-)

[14:31:00.0000] <nslater>
:p

[14:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
(You might have to wait three years for the response, though)

[14:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think my record is about 4 years

[14:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
nowadays it tends to be about a month

[14:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
nslater: ok added a paragraph to the intro section; let me know if it can be improved.

[14:49:00.0000] <nslater>
Hixie: what URI should I check?

[14:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
the one you posted

[14:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html

[14:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
bottom of this section: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#resources

[14:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
(these pages are all just different views on the same document i edit)

[14:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
(personally i prefer the whatwg one because it has nicer styles and has some scripted aids, but it's all the same content)

[14:56:00.0000] <nslater>
Hixie: looks good to me

[14:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[14:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[15:04:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me is not under any impression that "MIME type" is an obsolete term

[15:06:00.0000] <nslater>
GPHemsley: it's not obsolete, but it is (or was originally) specific to email, it's use as co-opted by WebArch has largely been replaced with "Internet media type"

[15:06:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
I don't think I've ever heard that term before this conversation

[15:07:00.0000] <nslater>
well, you learn something new every day! ;)

[15:08:00.0000] <GPHemsley>

Hello

[19:39:00.0000] <amites1>
anyone here work with the python version of html5lib?? I'm working on debugging an error with processSpaceCharacters and would appreciate any advice

[19:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
amites1, jgraham and annevk do, but they're not here at this time of night.

[19:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
amites1, gsnedders|work or Philip` too may be able to help though

[19:43:00.0000] <amites1>
doesn't seem like any of them are on right now

[19:44:00.0000] <amites1>
I appreciate your looking out

[19:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
amites1, they'll most likely be here within about 5 or 6 hours when they wake up

[19:45:00.0000] <amites1>
*Grin* if I don't have it figured out by then

[19:45:01.0000] <amites1>
changed servers and upgraded a couple things, everything but PDF generation went smooth

[20:46:00.0000] <takkaria>
/me giggles a bit at the WAI procedure thread

does python have the equivalent of the C-like ?: operator?

[21:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks!

[01:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
I can't see what exactly in the proposed procedure that we're not doing, beyond the fact that we haven't yet reached a mutually agreeable solution

[01:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
and that won't happen as long as the WAI PFWG continues to do nothing but push for one specific solution, without accepting or working with any alternatives

[02:28:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: I'm probably not a good person to speak to about html5lib for future reference

[03:30:00.0000] <roc>
I can't stand everyone in public_html being politely dishonest to one another

[03:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to be politely honest

[03:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: sometimes it's not possible to be both polite and honest at the same time

[03:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and you need to make a choice

[03:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
i usually shut up in those cases

[03:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
me too

[04:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I'm considering being honestly impolite

[04:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but it seems like it would be a waste of time and energy in this case

[04:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I recommend you going with your instincts there.

[04:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: sometimes being honestly impolite is useful

[04:40:00.0000] <roc>
it doesn't work too well online unfortunately

[04:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, if you were to be honestly impolite on the mailing list, what would you say?

[04:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
or rather, what point would you want to make?

[04:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy, given the people who love to read our logs and send creepy emails about them, that would amount to a cowardly way to post to the list

[04:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could say it in our secret IRC channel instead

[04:43:02.0000] <Lachy>
--> #whatwg-cabal

[04:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: how do you know I haven't?

[04:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
shh, don't tell anyone!

[04:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you guys do set up a secret cabal list could you please log it so that i can find your discussions when i do google searches for relevant discussion?

[04:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
can't you use Google's abusive monopolistic control of the internet to just log all the traffic anyway?

[04:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
We could set up the list on Google Wave, so Hixie can use the secret wiretap backdoor to track and analyse the discussions

[04:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
we need a way to allow robots to index the content, but to keep it secret, a way to block unwanted humans from heading it.

[04:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
and we don't yet have a Human Exclusions Protocol (humans.txt)

[04:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm going to go to bed before your conspiracy theories get me in trouble

[04:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
nn :-)

[04:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: you need to run with that Human Exclusion Protocol idea. do an IETF Internet draft

[04:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, I was just thinking about an April Fools RFC for that :-)

[04:59:01.0000] <dbaron>
Would it apply if Koko the Gorilla starts using a Web browser?

[04:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[05:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hmm, reading some blog posts for the past few weeks it seems like a remarkable number of people really had faith in XHMTML2

[05:19:00.0000] <mookid>
is it going to be possible for javascript to render other formats like PDF in html5?

[05:20:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: I guess the main issue with that is lack of a binary data type

[05:20:01.0000] <mookid>
hmm

[05:20:02.0000] <mookid>
ok

[05:20:03.0000] <mookid>
frustrating because the only option right now is to popup a new window

[05:20:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: Otherwise, I don't think there's anything stopping you (from converting to either HTML/SVG elements, or rendering onto a canvas)

[05:20:05.0000] <mookid>
eww that's pretty gnarly

[05:20:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: Not just use object or something?

[05:21:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: Well, how else would you render it with Javascript?

[05:21:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: Am I missing what you meant?

[05:21:02.0000] <mookid>
situation I'm in - if I make XMLHttpRequest to a pdf document

[05:21:03.0000] <mookid>
how do I get that rendered?

[05:22:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Convert it to a data URI and set an object's data to it?

[05:22:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Why not just set the object's data to the URL you request with XHR?

[05:23:00.0000] <mookid>
cos it's got custom headers :P

[05:23:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I was guessing that

[05:23:02.0000] <mookid>
there is one way that I guess would work - which is to render a flash app and pass the data into that

[05:23:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
If it contains any null bytes, be warned that Opera at least truncates responseText at that

[05:24:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Converting it to a data URI should work, though

[05:24:01.0000] <mookid>
yeah XMLHttpRequest is pretty bad

[05:24:02.0000] <mookid>
are there any plans to update/fix that?

[05:24:03.0000] <mookid>
can we at least drop the XML infront of it?

[05:25:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
The null issue? I guess the answer is I can't comment on that.

[05:25:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
We can't really drop the XML in the name because thousands of sites rely upon it being there

[05:25:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Http is equally misleading, as you can make FTP requests too in theory

[05:25:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(or any other scheme)

[05:25:04.0000] <mookid>
can't you just change it and make the old name a pointer?

[05:25:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Yes, but is it worthwhile changing that?

[05:26:00.0000] <mookid>
well I think it can be improved anyway

[05:26:01.0000] <mookid>
the spec could be more vigorous wrt the HTTP spec

[05:27:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
We're gonna have to keep backwards compat with XHR forever, more or less, so adding an alias doesn't help.

[05:27:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Vigorous in what way?

[05:27:02.0000] <mookid>
3xx forwards are very bad right now in XHR

[05:27:03.0000] <mookid>
+ the object could be structured in a more intuitive fashion

[05:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://cloudofdata.com/2009/07/does-linked-data-need-rdf/

[05:28:01.0000] <mookid>
nah it doesnt

[05:28:02.0000] <mookid>
:P

[05:28:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: That can't really be changed for backwards compat. reasons

[05:28:04.0000] <mookid>
gsnedders|work: ok so is there room to create a new client library?

[05:29:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: I doubt it'll be added at a browser level (on grounds that XHR already exists)

[05:30:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: What's your issue with redirects?

[05:30:01.0000] <mookid>
well they're inconsistent and the object makes it very hard to get a handle on what's actually going on

[05:30:02.0000] <mookid>
the implementations are inconsistent

[05:31:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That's an implementation issue, and all are moving towards the current WD

[05:31:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Actually, I expect the current ED

[05:32:00.0000] <mookid>
maybe I'm not up enough on XHR but redirects follows are automated for some 3xx codes right?

[05:32:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
For "HTTP redirects"

[05:36:00.0000] <mookid>
scariest idea ever

[05:37:00.0000] <mookid>
give your javascript sandbox namespaces a URI

[05:37:01.0000] <mookid>
then I can give an object a data URI

[05:39:00.0000] <mookid>
so essentially what you're saying is I can't use XHR response data to render a PDF?

[05:39:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
huh?

[05:40:00.0000] <mookid>
nvm =)

[05:40:01.0000] <mookid>
having an accept header attribute would make my life a lot easier.. ;D

[05:41:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Take the responseText, encode as base64, then add before that data:application/pdf;base64,

[05:41:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
How does that not work?

[05:41:02.0000] <mookid>
what do you do with that from there though?

[05:42:00.0000] <mookid>
I can't render it or make it available to save to disk in a browser sandbox

[05:42:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
var obj = document.createElement("object"); obj.data = foobar;

[05:42:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Then add the obj and if there is a PDF plugin installed, it'll render.

[05:42:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
*add the obj to the tree somewhere

[05:42:04.0000] <mookid>
oh right hmm lol

[05:43:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm sure I read somewhere you can't do that

[05:43:01.0000] <mookid>
is that new?

[05:44:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
No, but I'm pretty certain that should work

[05:44:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
If it doesn't, you've hit browser bugs

[05:44:02.0000] <mookid>
sound, cheers

[05:44:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
There may be some other way that I haven't thought off, though.

[05:44:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Do PDFs contain null bytes often?

[05:45:00.0000] <mookid>
haven't looked into that yet

[05:45:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
As I say, any containing null bytes will fail in Opera

[05:46:00.0000] <mookid>
ok bear with me here - if the browser has no plugin installed - there's no way to provide a save to disk dialogue box?

[05:51:00.0000] <mookid>
MikeSmith: was that link for me?

[05:54:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: What the browser does in that case is implementation dependant behaviour.

[05:54:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: But there's no way to force a browser to provide a save dialogue without running in a privileged state

[06:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
mookid: what link?

[06:13:01.0000] <mookid>
the RDF one

[06:14:00.0000] <mookid>
RDF vs. LinkedData

[06:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nope

[06:14:02.0000] <mookid>
k

[06:14:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
that was for all us, for our collective edification

[06:14:04.0000] <mookid>
sweet

[06:14:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
mookid: you have an interest in linked data?

[06:14:06.0000] <mookid>
Hmmm - I'd like to say yes

[06:14:07.0000] <mookid>
but honestly I'm not realy qualified to say that

[06:15:00.0000] <mookid>
I know REST and I'm working on a layered platform

[06:15:01.0000] <mookid>
but I'm not using RDF

[06:15:02.0000] <mookid>
so that article sounds good to me

[06:15:03.0000] <mookid>
granted.. RDF seems like a pretty nice tool for 'fractal' data graphs

[06:16:00.0000] <mookid>
it's just more cost to my project right now

[06:16:01.0000] <mookid>
I'm all set up to introduce an additional RDF layer whenever I need :)

[06:16:02.0000] <mookid>
thanks to URI's and content negotiation

[06:16:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
sometimes it costs more to add stuff later

[06:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't actually know much about RDF beyond the very basics

[06:17:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me still isn't sure using URIs to identify things is entirely sensible

[06:17:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I mean, what URI do I use for my grandmother?

[06:17:03.0000] <mookid>
...

[06:18:00.0000] <mookid>
there's a joke there somwhere

[06:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, a note while I'm thinking about it: If somebody ever does do XML5, it should relax the restriction that comments can't contain "--"

[06:18:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me still thinks XML5 should be a strict subset of XML 1.0 4th edition

[06:18:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
along with all other "backwards compatible with SGML" constraints

[06:19:00.0000] <mookid>
gsnedders|work: it's all to do with how you actually define a Resource

[06:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me is reminded that he meant to open a bug about the phrase "backwards compatible" in the spec intro

[06:20:00.0000] <mookid>
MikeSmith: if I wanted to introduce RDF to my system I'd only have to add another layer of RDF representations ontop of my existing URIs

[06:21:00.0000] <mookid>
and I can do that easily with Accept/Content-Type headers

[06:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: What do you mean by "strict subset"? (All well-formed XML1 documents must parse to the same DOM when using the XML5 algorithm? That sounds more like a superset to me)

[06:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
can a Resource just be a particular stream of data transmitted over TCP/IP?

[06:21:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: I mean in terms of document conformance.

[06:22:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: But yes, the parsing should be a superset, and conforming a subset

[06:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: So all conforming XML5 documents should also be conforming XML1 documents, but not the other way around?

[06:22:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Yeah.

[06:22:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Because DOCTYPE is evil.

[06:22:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Okay, makes sense

[06:23:00.0000] <mookid>
gsnedders|work: why do you say that?

[06:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose my main complaint with XML is not that draconian error handling is bad, but that it's too complex to follow the rules in practice

[06:24:00.0000] <mookid>
MikeSmith: technically, yes - if you were logging TCP/IP traffic you could give each packet a URI

[06:24:01.0000] <mookid>
but the actual data trasmitted is a representation

[06:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. properly-nested tags and quoted attributes are pretty easy, and the pain is in the complex character requirements and the forbidden sequences like "]]>" and "--"

[06:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and in doctypes)

[06:26:00.0000] <mookid>
could you use JSON?

[06:26:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me notes XHTML, Atom, and RSS are not JSON, so for most people using XML the answer is no.\

[06:27:00.0000] <mookid>
I mean use JSON for HTML5

[06:27:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
If you define a JSON serialization of a DOM, sure.

[06:27:02.0000] <mookid>
well isn't it better suited than XML?~

[06:28:00.0000] <mookid>
I thought there's an issue with XML in terms of what you can actually assume about the data from the order/tag heirarchy

[06:29:00.0000] <mookid>
there must be most of that work already done within apps like firebug..?

[06:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should modify something like http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/sexp.html to work with JSON

[06:30:01.0000] <mookid>
:)

[06:30:02.0000] <mookid>
Kris Zyp is/was working on JSON-Schema and json references

[06:31:00.0000] <mookid>
where schema's all linked together and could reference one another /themselves

[06:32:00.0000] <mookid>
I dunno exctly how fruity the DOM is but I would imagine you can break it down quite neatly

[06:37:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Anyone from Mozilla around?

[06:37:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Or anyone with a clue of how to report a bug in Gecko?

[06:37:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=broken-website.html says to go through the Help menu, but I don't have a "Report Broken Web Site" in the nightly I have.

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Just use Bugzilla normally, and file a bug with a test case?

[06:38:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: You aren't allowed to do that nowadays.

[06:38:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oh well, their problem.

[06:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, not allowed to file bugs?

[06:39:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
"IMPORTANT: if the problem is with a broken web page, you need to report it a different way."

[06:39:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
So seeming you're not.

[06:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
That sounds like it's meant for bug reports like "I visited Yahoo Mail and it doesn't work"

[06:41:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me grumbles

[06:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I'd hope you have more detail and a minimised test case and then you could file a proper bug :-)

[06:41:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I'm reporting one of their tests is broken (and so is their behaviour that passes it)

[06:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Then just fill out the bug form and put all the relevant details in it

[06:47:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me finds through one really obscure bit of the spec that the tests are right, and he is wrong.

[10:04:00.0000] <hallvors>
why doesn't the spec allow multi-letter accesskey values?

[14:28:00.0000] <Darxus>
I'm having a surprisingly difficult time finding XHTML 1.0 and HTML 5 test suites.

[14:31:00.0000] <takkaria>
what would an XHTML1 test suite test?

[14:31:01.0000] <jcranmer>
HTML 3.2, obviously

[14:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
I mean, I wasn't aware there were many testable things in XHTML1

[14:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: I assume it normatively includes HTML4, so you could test all of HTML4's conformance requirements

[14:39:01.0000] <takkaria>
I was just trying to find thoser but it looks like w3.org is having problems

[14:44:00.0000] <Darxus>
takkaria: Browser conformance.

[14:53:00.0000] <Darxus>
There seems to be no good statistics on how well browsers support XHTML 1.0, and as that is the last standard to support text/html, and IE doesn't support application/xhtml+xml, and it was released 9 years ago, I think that it qualifies as the most important current standard.  And I think there should be better browser support statistics on current standards.

[14:54:00.0000] <jcranmer>
XHTML is predominantly treated as HTML 4.0-serialized-as-XML

[14:54:01.0000] <jcranmer>
(from my experience)

[14:56:00.0000] <Darxus>
jcranmer: So you would expect browser conformance to be the same between HTML4 and XHTML 1.0?

[15:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Darxus, XHTML as text/html is, as far as the browser is concerned, simply HTML.

[15:01:00.0000] <Darxus>
Lachy: Thank you.

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yt?

[18:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
well this is just silly

[18:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
it turns out that sicking's description of what happens with innerHTML and defer scripts and document.write() in IE is slightly wrong

[18:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's actually going on is that setting innerHTML on a node in the document is causing the pending deferred scripts to be run right there

[18:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
and if there are any deferred scripts that haven't loaded yet... they get dropped completely

[18:36:00.0000] <ojan>
ewww

[18:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah so obviously we can't spec the dropping on the floor bit

[18:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
but it looks like there might be serious compat needs to support the rest of it

[18:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
our options with the dropping on the floor bit are either to execute only <script defer> without src="" there, or to pause there are execute all of them

[18:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/are ex/and ex/

[18:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
in the former case, if there's any d.w()s that are being dropped by IE, it would cause the page to blank again

[18:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
so i guess the latter is better

[22:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: are you around?

[22:10:00.0000] <jwalden>
suppose I have data:<video%20src="http://example.com/ogg-theora-sent-with-application-octet-stream-mime-type.ogv"></video>

[22:11:00.0000] <jwalden>
do I read http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#concept-media-load-resource correctly to say that whether the video displays, assuming the UA is capable of displaying the video if sent with the correct mime type, is undefined?

[22:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jwalden: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#a-type-that-the-user-agent-knows-it-cannot-render

[22:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jwalden: the spec will probably say explicitly that application/octet-stream is not such a type, if i remember the list discussions correctly

[22:37:00.0000] <jwalden>
zcorpan: which list discussion?  not seeing any promising threads in my whatwg folder

[22:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: nevermind (if you see this later)

[22:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jwalden: http://www.w3.org/mid/4A6138EC.5020408⊙me

[22:44:00.0000] <jwalden>
ah, I don't follow public-html

[22:44:01.0000] <jwalden>
and heh, only a few days old too :-)

[00:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, web fonts and canvas

[00:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
should the canvas wait until the font has loaded?

[00:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/175 crashes chrome

[00:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
seems to be getting .font when using the 'smaller' keyword

[01:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: It should probably do the same as drawing not-yet-loaded images, i.e. throw an exception and not freeze, because unpredictable freezing is nasty

[01:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
(at least in my opinion)

[01:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: so a page using web fonts would use setInterval and try/catch when using web fonts?

[01:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe we should have an event when fonts have loaded

[01:44:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and let fillText fall back to another font if it's still loading

[01:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: It would

[01:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which is probably a terrible idea)

[01:45:02.0000] <annevk4>
event based sounds good

[01:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you're doing something non-animated, like drawing a graph, you really need to have some way to wait until the font's loaded before drawing with it

[01:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
but if you're doing something animated, like a game, you don't want to mysteriously freeze while the font is being loaded

[01:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: you could draw the graph with the fallback font first and then redraw with the web font onwebfontsloaded

[01:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
one event for all pending fonts? or one event per font?

[01:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
where should it be fired?

[01:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
it should just delay the load event, imho

[01:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: makes sense

[02:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: though that doesn't help if you're loading in a new font after the 'load' event

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
well if you're doing that, wait for the style sheet's load event

[02:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
or something

[02:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
if we had someone to edit cssom, we could add a new event, i guess

[02:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
css transitions have specced events without someone to edit cssom

[02:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
someone to edit css web fonts would be fine too :-)

[02:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I thought annevk was editing CSSOM

[02:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
is it specced that images in css delays the load event?

[02:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: he's editing cssom-view

[02:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: i thought they didn't these days

[02:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[02:06:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: oh?

[02:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
no one is foolish enough to touch the rest of CSSOM?

[02:06:03.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: go for it :)

[02:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: there's a whole list of specs nobody is foolish enough to touch

[02:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i think it's more a matter that nobody has the time

[02:06:06.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: othermaciej hasn't even got the time to edit the design principles, let alone a spec :-)

[02:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: no thank you sir

[02:07:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I think we need shorter specs, then.

[02:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think I'll have some time for DP tomorrow

[02:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think I can sign up for a real spec

[02:07:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Like, here's a bunch of random words. You MUST NOT try and implement this.

[02:07:05.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: how would that help

[02:07:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I might be interested in hiring someone to write specs for me

[02:07:07.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: I never said it would.

[02:07:08.0000] <Hixie>
oh ok

[02:07:09.0000] <gsnedders|work>
:D

[02:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: let me know if you find anyone

[02:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but it's hard to find people who are capable at such things and not already taken

[02:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'll offer them double!

[02:08:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
oo… choose me! choose me! :P

[02:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
(double the workload, that is)

[02:08:05.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: get a degree first :-P

[02:09:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: But that increases workload :P

[02:09:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(And hence decreases spec-writing time)

[02:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's hard to get a big company to hire people who don't have a college degree

[02:09:03.0000] <zcorpan>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/176 - seems to delay the load event in opera,firefox,chrome

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: speaking of your workload. cross-refs are really starting to be needed, and i'm starting to have an idea for how references might be something i could benefit from (though not with an external .bib)

[02:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
specifically, for references, i'd like something that strips out references that aren't actually mentioned in the prose

[02:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think we changed CSS images to delay the load event a while back, for Firefox compatibility

[02:11:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
You've mentioned that before.

[02:11:02.0000] <zcorpan>
/me doesn't have a degree

[02:11:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: xdoc xrefs I assume you mean?

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: yeah

[02:13:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Well you have two weeks until I find out I don't have a chance at getting into the university course I want to, after which I'll be too sad to work :P

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[02:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
anything i can do to help?

[02:14:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Well, seeming I sat the exams months ago and this is merely a matter of waiting for the results…

[02:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
i meant for the work part :-P

[02:14:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
:P

[02:15:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Bribe my manager? :P

[02:15:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Seriously though, I'll ping you if I think you can in anyway

[02:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
who's your manager

[02:15:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me did mean that sarcastically

[02:33:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
What should line-height: normal return through CSSOM?

[02:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
'normal'

[02:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
is there anything else it _could_ return?

[02:34:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Gecko returns the pixel line-height that normal is

[02:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
ask anne

[02:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm out of date on current css thinking

[02:35:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
annevk4: ping

[02:36:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: I agree with you, though.

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk4>
gsnedders|work, somewhat here

[02:37:01.0000] <annevk4>
oh

[02:38:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
annevk4: line-height:normal should return what as the computed style?

[02:38:01.0000] <annevk4>
hmm, I never quite got around to figuring out getComputedStyle

[02:38:02.0000] <annevk4>
it usually returns the used value

[02:38:03.0000] <annevk4>
not the computed value

[02:38:04.0000] <annevk4>
CSS 2.1 stupidly changed definitions

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk4>
(compared with CSS 2.0)

[02:39:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Opera and Chrome both return "normal"

[02:39:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Firefox returns npx

[02:39:03.0000] <annevk4>
for this specific case I suppose either way goes

[02:39:04.0000] <annevk4>
just has to be defined :/

[02:41:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Should I send mail?

[02:41:01.0000] <annevk4>
no more "this week in html5"?

[02:41:02.0000] <annevk4>
gsnedders|work, nobody is tracking afaik

[02:42:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That's what I thought.

[02:49:00.0000] <Mrmil>
Is it normal that HTML 5 spec makes Opera crash? I've had it five billion times already

[02:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
Mrmil, if you're loading the single page version, yes, it's a known issue

[02:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
the multipage version should work

[02:51:00.0000] <Mrmil>
Lachy: I loaded the multipage version, went into Label section, and crashed :)

[02:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
firefox delays the load event for web fonts

[02:52:01.0000] <Mrmil>
/me hates Windows

[02:53:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: You yourself filed a bug on the multipage version crashing

[03:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, I know

[03:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
I need to investigate that soon

[03:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it seems web fonts already delay the load event in opera and firefox

[03:09:00.0000] <annevk4>
Google Chrome OS, interesting

[03:10:00.0000] <roc>
where have you been for the last month?

[03:10:01.0000] <annevk4>
greenland + iceland

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if annevk4 heard about XHTML2 yet

[03:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, didn't that happen before annevk4 went on holiday?

[03:26:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I doubt it.

[03:27:00.0000] <annevk4>
yeah

[03:27:01.0000] <annevk4>
I twittered 5 > 2

[03:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if annevk4 heard about the giant robot invasion of Florida last week

[05:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should tell Kristof that his mail system disk quota has apparently been exceeded

[05:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, send him a mail about it :-)

[05:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe if it was a very very short email, it would arrive successfully

[05:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
it depends if the system works by refusing to accept any mail after the limit has been exceeded, or if it's so close, it rejects any mail that would send it over

[05:28:01.0000] <mookid>
If anyone's interested the discussion on URIs and HTTP conneg is still going strong: http://mike.mykanjo.co.uk/2009/07/21/whos-right-seb-is-it-u-r-i/

[05:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: The former would seem a pretty silly system, since I could email a DVD to every user on the mail server until it runs out of disk space and dies painfully even if the quotas were carefully managed

[05:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, some mail systems also have limits on the maximum size of an individual mail too

[05:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if mr allsop is going to send the feedback he's been working on to the list soon

[06:27:00.0000] <o2T7>
Hi, I'm having problems to make some select1 item elements toggle a switch in the page. Is it possible, or should I necessarily use triggers?

[06:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
o2T7, HTML5 doesn't have a select1 element. Are you talking about XForms?

[06:42:00.0000] <o2T7>
Lachy: sure, sorry. That context, yes.

[06:45:00.0000] <annevk4>
o2T7, this isn't really the right channel for XForms questions ;)

[06:48:00.0000] <o2T7>
annevk4: I know :( But faithfully I find somewhere somebody experienced with xforms specification.

[06:49:00.0000] <o2T7>
or even with the way that all this stuff work

[06:50:00.0000] <o2T7>
I'm reading a lot, but can't get it done with this detail (changing a pair of trigger by a select1)

[06:52:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me grumbles something about rain

[06:52:01.0000] <annevk4>
o2T7, maybe the www-forms⊙wo can help?

[06:53:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I guess that's not a support list

[06:53:01.0000] <annevk4>
it is used as such now and then I believe

[06:58:00.0000] <o2T7>
okay, I'll try there :)

[07:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, any update on the selectors api test suite?

[07:20:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: unfortunately no :-/

[07:41:00.0000] <Lachy_>
JohnResig, any idea when you will be able to get to it?

[07:41:01.0000] <Lachy_>
Or should I find someone else who can make the necessary changes?

[07:43:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy_: yeah, I'm not sure when I'm going to have time, yet. If someone provides patches I'll just merge them in to the primary version: http://github.com/jeresig/selectortest/tree/master

[07:43:01.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy_: (ideally changes would be handled by forking the tree)

[07:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I might be able to find the time to do some of the changes myself

[07:44:01.0000] <JohnResig>
k - ping me if you have any questions

[07:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
alright, will do.

[07:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, if you were to do it, how much time would you estimate that it would take?

[07:50:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: I'm not sure - I'd have to look through the list of changes needed again - probably not more than a couple hours

[07:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. In that case, I might be able to do it in a day

[07:52:00.0000] <JohnResig>
although, you do have the advantage of understanding the spec better than I do :)

[07:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but I also have to work with your code which I'm not very familiar with

[07:53:01.0000] <JohnResig>
true

[07:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
this was the list of changes needed http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2009AprJun/1030.html

[08:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
hey, given this diff from Erik http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2009JanMar/0788.html , how do I merge those changes into my local copy?

[08:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
I assume there's some command that can do that automatically

[08:32:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: I think this command will do it: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-apply.html (assuming you have a copy of the tree checked out via git)

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't have git

[08:34:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: patch -p1

[08:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, yeah, I just found that patch command via google

[08:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
though I'm not really sure what the -p1 does yet

[08:36:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
It prunes one directory from the path

[08:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, it worked

[09:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.alistapart.com/articles/unwebbable/

[09:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
After reading that, I'm left confused about what Joe is saying.

[09:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps it's because I don't have a firm grasp of the history behind screenplay formatting. But I don't get why an electronic version needs to retain the strict formatting of a traditional print screenplay

[09:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think the real solution would be to devise a way to address the same problems solved by the traditional formatting (e.g. dividing into 1 minute per page sections) using a modern formatting system optimised for the web

[14:32:00.0000] <Darxus>
Is there a schema language capable of specifying everything an HTML5 conformance checker is required to check?  ( http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#conformance-requirements ) ?

[14:36:00.0000] <annevk2>
no

[14:37:00.0000] <Darxus>
Heh.  Do the two existing validators do more than validate against a schema (in one of these insufficient languages)?

[14:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Validator.nu has custom Java code for various things

[14:38:00.0000] <Darxus>
Okay.

[14:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
See e.g. http://hsivonen.iki.fi/thesis/html5-conformance-checker for probably more information than you want to know

[14:38:02.0000] <Darxus>
Awesome, a valid plural of "schema" is "schemata".

[14:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
(maybe slightly outdated, though)

[14:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is the second validator validator.w3.org (in HTML5 mode)? If so, that's the same code as validator.nu

[14:39:01.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: Yeah I found that but haven't read it.

[14:39:02.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: Yes.  Ah, thanks.  I suspected.

[14:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me hasn't read it either, but he's looked at the table of contents

[14:40:00.0000] <Darxus>
I want XML to provide a way to specify the location (and language?) of the schema it is supposed to conform to :/

[14:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The history of HTML section is good, I've read that.

[14:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: DOCTYPEs are that :P

[14:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: If you're using the XML serialisation of HTML 5 (i.e. serving it as application/xhtml+xml, not text/html) you can do whatever you want with the doctype

[14:43:01.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders: I thought the doctype could only specify a DTD?

[14:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: A DTD is a schema.

[14:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Only the text/html serialisation requires <!DOCTYPE html>)

[14:44:00.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders: Ah, so the "DTD" in a DOCTYPE is not specifically the "DTD" schema language?

[14:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: It is

[14:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: My point is you are linking to a type of schema :P

[14:44:03.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders: Ah, yes, but DTD has been called "woefully inadequite".  

[14:44:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(which is a DTD)

[14:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: Indeed.

[14:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: But it's a way of linking to a schema :P

[14:45:02.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders: Yes, but not a sufficiently useful one :)

[14:45:03.0000] <Philip`>
HTML 5 considers the entire concept of schema languages to be woefully inadequate

[14:45:04.0000] <Philip`>
except when the language is English :-)

[14:45:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: There's some way of linking to XSD files, but XSD is horrid.

[14:45:06.0000] <Philip`>
...or Java

An hour ago I thought I was going to write an HTML5 DTD.  Then I read the bit in the spec that says DTD is not sufficient.

[14:46:00.0000] <Darxus>
How about perl?

[14:46:01.0000] <inimino>
Perl is Turing-complete :-)

[14:46:02.0000] <Darxus>
inimino: Yes but that is not a useful answer to my question.

[14:46:03.0000] <gsnedders>
http://syntax.whattf.org/

[14:46:04.0000] <inimino>
it's not?

[14:46:05.0000] <annevk2>
anything Turing-complete is sufficient to write a HTML5 validator

[14:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: It means it'll be able to express the constraints

[14:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: Have we proven this?

[14:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It means it'll be able to express the machine-checkable constraints

[14:47:03.0000] <annevk2>
(well, apart from the silly SHOULD requirement which requires solving the halting problem)

[14:47:04.0000] <Darxus>
annevk2: Thank you.

[14:47:05.0000] <inimino>
a DTD is formally incapable of expressing some of the machine-checkable conformance criteria

[14:47:06.0000] <Philip`>
where machine-checkable is defined as anything that can be expressed in a Turing-complete language

[14:47:07.0000] <inimino>
Perl isn't, so that's your answer

[14:48:00.0000] <Darxus>
Yeah, that SHOULD is freaking awesome.

[14:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
(where the input is just the document, and no extra state about e.g. the author's brain)

[14:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I still want to know how we get a computer to take a deep breath

[14:48:03.0000] <Darxus>
'This is only a "SHOULD" and not a "MUST" requirement because it has been proven to be impossible.'

[14:48:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Put the fans into reverse

[14:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
the biggest benefit of completely custom no-schema code is prolly the kind of error messages you can provide

[14:50:00.0000] <annevk2>
it'd be cool if someone made one :)

[14:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
OCaml!

[14:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
One problem with completely custom no-schema code is that it's useless at answering questions like "what tags am I allowed to insert here, for my editor's auto-complete UI"

[14:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
(unless you write custom code for that question)

[14:52:02.0000] <Darxus>
annevk2: Why do you imply that no-one has made one?

[14:52:03.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: Because no-one has :-)

[14:52:04.0000] <Philip`>
unless they've kept it very very quiet

[14:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
(for HTML5, anyway)

[14:53:01.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: Why does the existing HTML5 validator not count?

[14:53:02.0000] <Darxus>
Also, I don't see why a no-schema validator couldn't answer "what tags am I allowed to insert here?".

[14:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: That has a schema. That's not a no-schema validator.

[14:54:01.0000] <Darxus>
Ahh.

[14:54:02.0000] <annodomini>
Remember, there is a subset of HTML5 that's checkable with a schema.

[14:54:03.0000] <Darxus>
annodomini: Oh?

[14:55:00.0000] <annodomini>
You can probably do something good enough for the "what tags am I allowed to insert"

[14:55:01.0000] <annodomini>
Or, sorry. Not a subset of HTML5, but a subset of the rules in HTML5 are checkable with a schema.

[14:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: When your code is like "function validate_div(node) { ...some function calls to check children are the correct type... }" you can't automatically invert the code to find a list of what types are allowed - all you can do is execute the code

[14:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
so either you need to explicitly write the list of what element types are allowed, or you need to write some kind of schema that can be analysed to compute approximately the right answer

[14:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think that's a rubbish explanation and probably untrue, but never mind

[14:58:01.0000] <Darxus>
Er, schemas don't include a list of what elements may be children / decendants of other elements?  (I noticed the HTML 4.01 didn't, which seemed strange.)

[14:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
They do

[15:12:00.0000] <kristallpirat>

I use html5lib for python

[15:13:00.0000] <kristallpirat>
and want to replace entities, any documentation tips?

[15:16:00.0000] <Darxus>
Is there any reason a schema language could not be written that could specify all the rules required for validation?

[15:17:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
a Turing complete schema language?

[15:18:00.0000] <Darxus>
I did not say that :)

[15:20:00.0000] <Darxus>
When writing a schema language, do you start with the parser or the rules?  :)

[15:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could define a schema language which permits you to write one schema, which is the empty string

[15:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
and its semantics are that it check all the HTML5 conformance requirements

[15:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/check/checks/

[15:45:00.0000] <Darxus>
"I know some of the schemas are not as tight as the corresponding spec prose." - author of the existing validator

[15:45:01.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: An entertainging response.

[15:45:02.0000] <Darxus>
However, again not a useful answer to my question.

[15:46:00.0000] <inimino>
I thought it was quite illustrative

[16:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: It seemed a useful answer, since it was demonstrating that it is indeed possible for a schema language to specify all the rules required for validation

[16:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
Then you just have to modify it a bit and pick some tradeoffs between schema language complexity and schema complexity and flexibility etc

[16:05:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: Your answer is clearly correct.  However, as I said, not useful.

[16:05:01.0000] <inimino>
schema definition formalisms are arbitrary, you can write one that does anything you like

[16:06:00.0000] <inimino>
if you don't like the answer, perhaps you should reconsider the question :-)

question on canvas: why does settransform clear my canvas bitmap?  can i clear the transform matrix without clearing the bitmap

[16:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
caden: It shouldn't do that

[16:59:00.0000] <caden>
thanks Philip

[16:59:01.0000] <caden>
i thought that that was my problem, but i don't really need to reset the transform matrix


2009-07-22
[17:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
caden: Is there some browser in which it does clear the bitmap?

[17:00:01.0000] <caden>
it turned out i didn't put style position relative in the element

[17:00:02.0000] <caden>
i was doing some code from this sample drawing program http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/html5-canvas-painting/ and it was always drawing the line about 200 pixesl too low

[17:02:00.0000] <caden>
i tried using setTransform and the identity matrix to see if there was a transpose setting from all the previous draws i did

[17:02:01.0000] <caden>
but that wasn't it

[17:02:02.0000] <caden>
but it did clear the graph i had drawn on the canvas

[20:19:00.0000] <Darxus>
Ack, the link to explain the "this is a 'should' and not a 'must' because it has proven to be impossible" doesn't explain it!

[20:26:00.0000] <Darxus>
inimino: I agree that Philip`'s answer was a valid answer to my question, and that I did not ask the right question.  However, that does not change the fact that Philip`'s answer was not useful.

[20:31:00.0000] <inimino>
Darxus: it might have been useful to you, had it caused you to reconsider the question

[20:31:01.0000] <inimino>

why doesn't the spec allow multi-letter accesskey values?

[02:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
hallvors: "For future extensibility, I have also required tokens with more than one character to be ignored for now. We can later add identifiers for various purposes, e.g. accesskey="help" to mean that the user agent's default "help" key should be used, whatever that is."

[02:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
(http://www.mail-archive.com/whatwg⊙lwo/msg14673.html)

[03:01:00.0000] <hallvors>
Thanks, Philip`. Rules out using @accesskey for GMail-type "gi" shortcuts, unfortunately. Is that a stronger or weaker use case? Or what about <a accesskey="F1"> - should we go there?

[03:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Might want to send feedback to the list - everyone's probably asleep in here :-)

perhaps I'll try if public-html is usable for less political issues then.. (though it wouldn't surprise me if someone turned it into a political one)

[03:08:02.0000] <hallvors>
/me is a scary chatter, apparently

[03:08:03.0000] <Lachy>
access keys have an impact on accesibility, and so it is very likely to turn into one

[03:09:00.0000] <hallvors>
does that mean I ought to ask on the whatwg list instead? ;)

[03:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, Chaals prefers that we use public-html

Lachy: Because pressing Reply All is simpler

[03:21:00.0000] <hallvors>
Philip`: I can't make sense of the following quote from the E-mail you linked to: "I have allowed the <command> element to be given an access key, which 

[03:21:01.0000] <hallvors>
allows any scriptable behaviour to be given a keyboard shortcut."

[03:21:02.0000] <hallvors>
I don't find that in the spec

[03:22:00.0000] <hallvors>
it looks like the "command" concept is strictly tied to elements (only exposed through element.command properties etc)

[03:23:00.0000] <hallvors>
..and I also don't see how the spec makes it possible to do this: "Once a command is defined, other parts of the interface can refer to the same command"

[03:23:01.0000] <hallvors>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/interactive-elements.html#concept-command

[03:23:02.0000] <hallvors>
I'm probably missing something really basic about the command concept..

[03:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
hallvors: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/interactive-elements.html#the-command ?

[03:27:00.0000] <hallvors>
that helps! but I still don't see any text about @accesskey being allowed for <command>

[03:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: That section says 'the checkbox" maps to the Checkbox' and is missing a quote and probably a word, though I'm too lazy to send mail about this

[03:27:02.0000] <Philip`>

[03:27:03.0000] <hallvors>

s/crashes/crashed/

[03:34:00.0000] <hallvors>
I'm assuming that the way to link <command> to an actual "scripted behaviour" is through normal event listeners (<command onclick=""> or command.addEventListener('click', ..) ) but I still don't see how other elements can "refer to" a defined command. Say, if I do <menu><command id="c" onclick="foo()"></menu> and want a <button> elsewhere to represent that command, how do I link the <button> element to the <command>?

[03:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
hallvors: Why do you want to link a <button> to the <command>?

[03:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems like the idea is that <command>s just get put into context menus or toolbar menus, and you activate them from there

[03:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
though it also seems you can do <button onclick=document.getElementById('c').click()> if you want to activate it remotely

[03:40:00.0000] <hallvors>
I thought that was sort of the point of the spec saying "Once a command is defined, other parts of the interface can refer to the same command".

[03:41:00.0000] <hallvors>
and it would be a nice convenience if doing document.getElementById('c').setAttribute('disabled', 'disabled') would disable all "associated" <button>/<input> elements.

[03:41:01.0000] <hallvors>
for example

[03:42:00.0000] <hallvors>
guess I'm just misunderstanding the "other parts of the interface" sentence

[03:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, I didn't know the spec said that

[03:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
I haven't actually read it

[03:43:01.0000] <hallvors>
it's in the first blurb on http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/interactive-elements.html#concept-command

[03:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
In fact I didn't even know this whole command thing existed, until twenty minutes ago

[03:43:03.0000] <hallvors>
it's a new thingy ;)

[03:43:04.0000] <Philip`>
so I should defer to someone who knows what they're talking about :-)

[03:44:00.0000] <hallvors>
you've been very helpful though :)

[04:09:00.0000] <Darxus>

[04:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
since I don't know how much flexibility you would want the schema language to have, or how much it could be tailored specifically for HTML5

What's more appropriate: <section> as main content area with news as <article>'s, or vice versa?

[05:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Mrmil: I would think vice versa

[05:55:00.0000] <annevk4>
you probably want just <article> in that scenario

[05:55:01.0000] <Mrmil>
But what if the main content area contains: some text, shopping assistant, product catalog and list of categories? Can still that be in an article?

[05:56:00.0000] <adactio>
annevk4: do you mean an <article> with multiple <article>s nested in it?

[05:56:01.0000] <annevk4>
there's no real wrapper element for the main content area

[05:56:02.0000] <Mrmil>
ok

[05:56:03.0000] <annevk4>
some have suggested there should be one though

[05:56:04.0000] <annevk4>
i.e. <main> or <content> or some such

[05:56:05.0000] <adactio>
Well, we have <div>.

Better than a soap firefox

[08:32:04.0000] <Philip`>
It wouldn't melt so fast

/me is referring to http://www.dvdverdict.com/images/reviewpics/priscilla1.jpg

[08:33:01.0000] <annevk4>
karlcow, I feel less and less moved by the ill-informed comments :)

[08:34:00.0000] <karlcow>
hehe

[08:34:01.0000] <karlcow>
annevk4: I guess it means that html5 reached a community a bit farther than w3c and whatwg. Somehow… finally the real world.

[09:01:00.0000] <Darxus>
Somebody named something "grand unified schema" and it's only useful for biological stuff :(

[09:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: thanks. working now

[09:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Neato

Anyone have a clue about running reftests in Fx?

[09:10:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I'm getting stuff that looks like failures and no output. Something seems wrong.

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Now all that's missing is the equivalent of http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/404.html#the-draggable-attribute :-)

[09:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though preferably an equivalent that actually works, instead of having a temporarily broken fragment-links.js)

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: (The theory is that that's useful when pages get renamed and a link to an old page gets 404ed)

[09:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: ok, i can add that too

[09:25:00.0000] <mookid>
Hello internet friends

[09:26:00.0000] <mookid>
Philip`: do you have 5 mins to spare me?

[09:26:01.0000] <mookid>
:>

[09:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
mookid: Probably not, unless it's about something interesting

[09:31:00.0000] <mookid>
potentially

[09:31:01.0000] <mookid>
it's about how browsers treat links and state transitions

[09:32:00.0000] <mookid>
Are state transitions in HTTP simply the URI/Verb combination, or the entire of the message?

[09:33:00.0000] <mookid>
by message I mean HTTP message headers basically

[09:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
mookid: I have no idea

[09:36:00.0000] <mookid>
Does the browser store page history just with the URI and HTTP method?

[09:37:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
It depends on the browser; most store cache headers as well, and some title for the page

[09:38:00.0000] <mookid>
is it feasible they could store the entire request? (minus sensitive headers like Authorization)

[09:38:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
No idea

[09:38:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I don't know what they store myself, I'm just guessing from my experience of the black box

[09:39:00.0000] <mookid>
fair enough - where might I get a bit of feedback on that?

[09:39:01.0000] <mookid>
is there a browser dev channel of some sort?

[09:40:00.0000] <Darxus>
XHTML 1.0 does not allow text directly in a body element, but HTML5 does??

[09:40:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
XHTML 1.0 Transitional does, Strict does not.

[09:40:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
But yes, HTML 5 does.

[09:41:00.0000] <mookid>
\o/

[09:41:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: Being around here at the right time is probably your best bet

[09:41:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Don't ask me when right time is though)

[09:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
mookid: You could look at e.g. Firefox's places.sqlite, which seems to be where it stores the page history information

[09:41:04.0000] <Philip`>
particularly in the table that's like: CREATE TABLE moz_places (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, url LONGVARCHAR, title LONGVARCHAR, rev_host LONGVARCHAR, visit_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0, hidden INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL, typed INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL, favicon_id INTEGER, frecency INTEGER DEFAULT -1 NOT NULL);

[09:41:05.0000] <Philip`>
(frecency? Hmm...)

[09:42:00.0000] <mookid>
:P

[09:42:01.0000] <mookid>
bloody hippies

[09:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
(That's a totally made up word, but apparently someone put it in Wiktionary)

[09:42:03.0000] <mookid>
ok gsnedders|work thanks for the heads up

[09:42:04.0000] <mookid>
I read back over a little bit of the stuff in November

[09:43:00.0000] <mookid>
and I think I got a little hot under the collar because I got accused of being an architecture astronaught or something

[09:43:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: frecency, like netwerk

[09:43:02.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: I am absolutely shocked that HTML5 allows that when XHTML 1.0 strict does not :P  However, I never got around to trying to figure out why XHTML 1.0 Strict didn't.

[09:44:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: And referer

[09:44:01.0000] <Darxus>
Awesome, HTML5 validator catches overlapping table cells, and XHTML 1.0 Strict doesn't:  http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/dxschema/tests/invalidtable.html

[09:44:02.0000] <Darxus>
It's also pretty cool how chrome renders it.

[09:44:03.0000] <Darxus>
And firefox.

[09:45:00.0000] <mookid>
anyway I'm going to try and formulate a more complete case for adding conneg attributes

[09:46:00.0000] <mookid>
not that I expect it to be taken seriously but just so I don't look like I was causing a fuss for no reason :)

[09:48:00.0000] <Darxus>
Yeah I've been futilly agravating the whatwg list for a couple days trying to convince them it could be useful to have a standard way to mention the target HTML specification for the document :/

[09:48:01.0000] <mookid>
to be fair I think there's quite a lot of us asking for stuff

[09:49:00.0000] <mookid>
so hate me

[09:49:01.0000] <mookid>
because I hate you

[09:49:02.0000] <Darxus>
Haha.

[09:49:03.0000] <mookid>
?

[09:49:04.0000] <mookid>
seriously.

[09:49:05.0000] <mookid>
:D

[09:49:06.0000] <Darxus>
And I'm not allowed to be amused?

[09:50:00.0000] <mookid>
was joking

[09:50:01.0000] <mookid>
although we can have an argument about it if you want

[09:50:02.0000] <mookid>
since we're both into that kind of thing

[09:50:03.0000] <Darxus>
Haha.

[09:50:04.0000] <mookid>
?

[09:50:05.0000] <Darxus>
Have you seen my posts?

[09:50:06.0000] <mookid>
no

[09:50:07.0000] <Darxus>
Or are you just basing that belief on what I've said here?

[09:51:00.0000] <Darxus>
Okay.

[09:51:01.0000] <Darxus>
Working on it.

[09:51:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: There have been several hundred emails on that subject already, FWIW

[09:53:00.0000] <Darxus>
I want a way, specified in HTML5, to state which HTML version I expect a document to conform to.

[09:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: It seems your posts started with a solution (adding a language version identifier to documents) and then tried to describe a problem for it, whereas you might have more success with defining a practical problem and then suggesting and comparing possible solutions (of which a language version identifier might be one, with various pros and cons)

[09:54:01.0000] <Darxus>
I would be fine with something like either <meta name="html version" content="5"> or <body data-html-version=5>.

[09:54:02.0000] <mookid>
mmm

[09:54:03.0000] <mookid>
use an HTTP header

[09:54:04.0000] <mookid>
-_-

[09:55:00.0000] <mookid>
or extend the MIME type

[09:55:01.0000] <mookid>
what is the MIME type for html5?

[09:55:02.0000] <mookid>
is it just text/html >?

[09:56:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: I totally agree.  My last case was where someone has thousands of HTML5 conformant files and is gradually converting them to HTML5.1.  And wants to be able to spider validate his entire site, while ensuring that the old files are still valid HTML5, and the updated files are still valid HTML 5.1.

[09:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes, text/html

[09:56:02.0000] <Darxus>
text/html *or* application/xhtml+xml.

[09:56:03.0000] <Darxus>
Or I think application/xml.

[09:56:04.0000] <mookid>
don't use anything other than text/html

[09:56:05.0000] <mookid>
it breaks stuff.

[09:56:06.0000] <Darxus>
You don't get the full awesomeness of the browser using an xml parser unless you serve it as an xml content type.

[09:56:07.0000] <annevk4>
Darxus, the idea is that we do not make incompatible changes unless we really need to

[09:57:00.0000] <annevk4>
Darxus, and if we really need to authors better update their pages too because the feature they're using is harmful in some way

[09:57:01.0000] <Darxus>
mookid: Grr.  Serve text/html to anyone with "MSIE" in their User-Agent, and application/xhtml+xml to everyone else.  With the same document.

[09:57:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: HTML 5 cannot be served as application/xhtml+xml; XHTML 5 can.

[09:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: That just punishes non-IE users, by increasing the chance of them seeing a fatal error instead of your page

[09:57:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: Have fun if you accept any user input with XML formats.

[09:57:05.0000] <mookid>
Darxus: yeah I know that - but be normal and just use text/html -_-

[09:58:00.0000] <annevk4>
Darxus, besides what Philip` said, XML parsers are also less optimized than HTML parsers

[09:58:01.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: I have not yet fully grasped the differences between the xml and html types.

[09:58:02.0000] <Darxus>
annevk4: Less optimized?  They seem really freaking fast to me.

[09:58:03.0000] <mookid>
current html isn't valid XML

[09:58:04.0000] <annevk4>
Darxus, i.e. not all XML parsers have fast paths for known elements to create the appropriate DOM constructs right away

[09:58:05.0000] <Darxus>
They have the advantage of knowing they are getting a perfectly formed document.

[09:58:06.0000] <annevk4>
Darxus, in browsers

[09:58:07.0000] <annevk4>
Darxus, that's not really an advantage

[09:59:00.0000] <annevk4>
Darxus, have you written parsers?

[09:59:01.0000] <annevk4>
/me has

[09:59:02.0000] <mookid>
sex god

[09:59:03.0000] <Darxus>
mookid: I looked into specifying the HTML version in the Content-Type, it looks entirely possible, as: Content-Type: text/html; v=5

[09:59:04.0000] <mookid>
right

[09:59:05.0000] <Darxus>
annevk4: I have not yet written parsers.

[09:59:06.0000] <mookid>
what's wrong with that?

[09:59:07.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: Knowing something is perfectly formed makes no difference.

[09:59:08.0000] <Darxus>
What's wrong with what?

[10:00:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid, Darxus: What do you gain by it?

[10:00:01.0000] <mookid>
nothing I'm just giving him a solution

[10:00:02.0000] <annevk4>
XML also requires more complicated checks on element names and such that require some extra time

[10:00:03.0000] <mookid>
dont' use html anyway use JSON it works better

[10:00:04.0000] <Darxus>
mookid: The thing that's wrong with specifying the html version number in the Content-Type is that I want to specify it in the document, so I don't have to keep seperate records are which files are to which spec.

[10:01:00.0000] <mookid>
you're storing your html in flat file?

[10:01:01.0000] <mookid>
with no metadata?

[10:01:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me finds a test case that says, "This page tests something"

[10:01:03.0000] <Darxus>
mookid: Yes.

[10:01:04.0000] <mookid>
ewww

[10:01:05.0000] <Darxus>
Heh.

[10:01:06.0000] <Philip`>
Storing HTML in files? How antiquated!

[10:02:00.0000] <mookid>
how's 1994 these days?

[10:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
You need to be more enterprisey

[10:02:02.0000] <Darxus>
Maybe I'm wrong about XML vs. HTML, but I thought XML was better.  I'll try to remember to look into it.

[10:02:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
You need to store everything in a database!

[10:02:04.0000] <Darxus>
This is my personal web site, it's almost all static html :)

[10:02:05.0000] <Darxus>
Heh.

[10:02:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
You know, just store everything in a single column table with the datatype of BLOB.

[10:02:07.0000] <mookid>
I said no metadata :/

[10:02:08.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Because databases are cool.

[10:03:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: I know, I'm just being silly about the whole file thing.

[10:03:01.0000] <mookid>
:P

[10:03:02.0000] <Darxus>
So what reason is there to not include a method of specifying the HTML version in the HTML5 spec?

[10:03:03.0000] <mookid>
RDBMS's are totally unnecessary in the majority of cases

[10:03:04.0000] <mookid>
it's just lower barrier to entry

[10:03:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: Seriously though, most FS can store little to no metadata

[10:03:06.0000] <mookid>
apache can do clever thins with metadata though right?

[10:04:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
It stores metadata in seperate config files though

[10:04:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Or serializes it into the filename

[10:04:02.0000] <mookid>
yeah and rules

[10:04:03.0000] <mookid>
well that's flat files for ya

[10:04:04.0000] <mookid>
�-_-

[10:05:00.0000] <mookid>
just store the metadata, work out how your rules are going to work, and tack on the version to the content-type header

[10:06:00.0000] <mookid>
isn't it really inefficient to parse XML instead of just looking at a header?

[10:06:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me is quite tempted to go and get some food

[10:07:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: Parsing MIME types is expensive, though.

[10:07:01.0000] <mookid>
is it?

[10:07:02.0000] <mookid>
o.O

[10:07:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
What metadata do we want?

[10:07:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
If it's something in the prolog, you can just stop parsing XML after that.

[10:08:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: Yes, the format of MIME types is quite complex.

[10:08:01.0000] <mookid>
meh, you standards people suck.

[10:08:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: Why?

[10:08:03.0000] <mookid>
that's a joke

[10:08:04.0000] <mookid>
your brain is much bigger than mine

[10:08:05.0000] <mookid>
relax

[10:08:06.0000] <mookid>
:P

[10:08:07.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me takes a deep breath

[10:08:08.0000] <gsnedders|work>
:P

[10:08:09.0000] <mookid>
;D

[10:09:00.0000] <mookid>
still waiting for the right time to ask that question again

[10:09:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hmm, if I go home now, then I need to work an extra hour and half over for the next two days

[10:09:02.0000] <Darxus>
Even better: http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/dxschema/tests/invalidtable.html

[10:10:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mookid: The conneg one? Ask it on the mailing list if you want a more diverse set of opinions, and want the proposal to go anywhere

[10:10:01.0000] <mookid>
can't you just write a script to auto-respond to emails with 'no its not getting included there's no use case' ?

[10:10:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hmm, I'm not sure whether NLP is up to that :P

[10:10:03.0000] <mookid>
yeah, it's tricky stuff

[10:10:04.0000] <mookid>
-_-

[10:14:00.0000] <annevk4>
mookid, also, conneg is pretty much dead

[10:16:00.0000] <Darxus>
(invalidly) Overlapping cells with 50% alpha background colors: http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/dxschema/tests/invalidtable.html

[10:21:00.0000] <mookid>
annevk4: that's because browsers and HTML don't support it - not because there's anything wrong with it

[10:21:01.0000] <mookid>
it's actually a really good thing for stuff like cache-invalidation mechanisms

[10:23:00.0000] <Darxus>
The HTML5 spec is a bit verbose.

[10:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Verbose, or detailed?

[10:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
It says a lot but I think a lot of what it says is necessary

[10:27:00.0000] <Darxus>
Yeah I don't object.

[10:27:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Developing_HTML5_derivatives is no longer true (where have header-whatwg and header-w3c gone?)

[10:47:00.0000] <Darxus>
"This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once." - HTML5

[10:51:00.0000] <Darxus>
Ack, attribute values are not all required to be quoted?

[10:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
They aren't

[10:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
<input type=checkbox checked> etc

[10:53:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip' is that for both the HTML and XHTML serializations?

[10:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
tantek, no

[10:54:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy, good, that's what I thought.

[10:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
XHTML is just XML and doesn't change any of XML's rules

[10:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
so there shouldn't be anything to worry about there :-)

[10:56:00.0000] <Darxus>
Ah, good.

[10:59:00.0000] <Darxus>
Why wasn't CSS originally implimented in sgml, and why isn't it now conformant to xml similarly to HTML5/XML?

[11:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Because if the syntax was SGML/XML, it would be incredibly painful to write

[11:03:00.0000] <ttepass->
DSSSL!

[11:12:00.0000] <Darxus>
<css> <definition> <target> <element>div</element> <class>container</class> </target> <attribute> <top>0</top> <left>0</left> <width>100%</width> </attribute> </definition> </css>

[11:12:01.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: Point taken.

[11:13:00.0000] <Darxus>
Or I guess <attribute top="0" left="0" width="100%">.

[11:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
<style selector="div.foo" top="0" left="0" width="100%"/>

[11:14:01.0000] <Darxus>
Wow, thanks.  I have much to learn.

[11:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
if you don't mind using a custom non-XML language for selectors

[11:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
There's nothing to learn, I just made that up :-)

[11:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
Don't know how to extend it to handle things like !important

[11:15:03.0000] <Darxus>
I disagree.  It is a much shorter valid xml way of representing the same thiing I typed.

[11:16:00.0000] <Darxus>
And I want to write a schema language :P

[11:17:00.0000] <eighty4>
<target><element>div></element>.....<imporance><level>1000</level></importance>....</target>?

[11:20:00.0000] <ttepass->
Just a thought: A XML-Version of CSS in Philip's style had a great use of CURIES:

[11:20:01.0000] <ttepass->
<style xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG" selector="[svg:path] .... />

[11:34:00.0000] <tantek>
Darxuz - see http://bytes.com/groups/css/99746-why-css-not-xml

[11:37:00.0000] <tantek>
and while looking for that, I found:

[11:37:01.0000] <tantek>
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq

[11:38:00.0000] <tantek>
I'm pretty sure I read this long ago in the past, but I thought folks here might find it insightful from a development of HTML/XHTML standpoint.

even better answer to the "Why is CSS not XML syntax" FAQ:

[11:39:01.0000] <tantek>
"CSS has its own syntax because readability is very important for a language that is used by nearly as many people as HTML itself. It could have been based on SGML, and originally there were indeed proposals for SGML-based syntaxes (see [Lie99]) and there even existed a US military standard ([FOSI]), but there was never any question that CSS syntax is better. (XML didn't exist at the time, but it wouldn't have helped since it is more verbose than SGML and al

I was trying to write a schema language without having ever looked at one.  I was trying to decide one / zeroorone / zeroormore / oneormore, and one / optional / (default) / required, and then looked up relax ng and discovered it uses a mix.

[12:29:00.0000] <Darxus>
Hah, there are constraints on W3C Schema that cannot be expressed in it?

How long does it typically take for a moderator to review a message to the list? My first post hasn't gone through yet. Anxious. :)

[13:30:00.0000] <annevk4>

[13:36:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
yes.

is there a way to save the current canvas bitmap and then retrieve it, like to reset the background of an animation?

[16:27:00.0000] <caden>
getImageData, probably?

[16:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
caden: You could create a new <canvas> (with createElement) and then drawImage the current one into it, then draw it back later

[16:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
or use getImageData/putImageData

[16:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
or use toDataURL/drawImage (except that probably will throw security errors in most browsers if you do it multiple times)

[16:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Copying to a new canvas is probably going to be more efficient than getImageData, if you care about that)

[16:30:00.0000] <caden>
can i make that new canvas invisible then?

[16:31:00.0000] <caden>
right now redrawing the graph between animation frames is the application bottleneck

[16:31:01.0000] <caden>
i am hoping i can just refresh this snapshot instead of redrawing all the axes and lines and whatnot

[16:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes - if you do something like "var c = document.createElement('canvas'); c.width = ...; c.height = ...; c.getContext('2d').drawImage(othercanvas, 0, 0)" then the new canvas never gets rendered since it's not added to the document

[16:35:00.0000] <caden>
i will try it, the get/put did not improve performance

[16:42:00.0000] <caden>
does this look right to ou for restoring the image?  this.snapshotCanvas.getContext('2d').drawImage(this.canvasContext,0,0);

[16:42:01.0000] <caden>
or is this.canvasContext supposed to be a refernce to an element instead of a context

[16:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
caden: The argument to drawImage is the canvas object that you want to copy from

[16:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
rather than a context

[16:45:02.0000] <caden>
ok

[16:45:03.0000] <caden>
thank you!

[16:45:04.0000] <caden>
it looks like it stores the background as transparent, does that sound right?

[16:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Probably - if you're not explicitly drawing over the canvas's background then it'll just be transparent

[16:46:01.0000] <caden>
cool

[16:56:00.0000] <caden>
well, i'm using a very primitive way of profiling, using just getTime() statements, and these indicate that drawImage is much faster than get/put

[16:57:00.0000] <caden>
although subjectively it doesn't seem faster

maybe it is just my sucky machine

Hixie: do elements in HTML5 have "default actions"?

[17:20:00.0000] <shepazu>
ok, I'll try again... anyone, do elements in HTML5 have "default actions"?

[17:20:01.0000] <shepazu>
or is that nonsense?

[17:23:00.0000] <annevk4>
shepazu, they have activation behavior

[17:24:00.0000] <annevk4>
shepazu, e.g.  the activation behavior of <a> is to navigate

[17:25:00.0000] <shepazu>
annevk4: ok... so, is that the terminology of HTML5, HTML4, both...?

[17:26:00.0000] <shepazu>
and if link is activated, what events does it produce?

[17:26:01.0000] <annevk4>
activation behavior is associated with the click event

[17:26:02.0000] <shepazu>
does it produce a click, or only if it was activated by the mouse?

[17:26:03.0000] <shepazu>
/me writes a test

[17:26:04.0000] <annevk4>
always click

[17:27:00.0000] <annevk4>
anyway, the idea was for DOM3Events to define activation behavior and various related thingies, but bjoern never got around to it so now it's defined in HTML5

[17:30:00.0000] <shepazu>
well, I'm actively editing DOM3 Events, so I'll define it there if it needs to be

[17:31:00.0000] <annevk4>
cool

[17:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: I think to support "click" and "DOMActivate" the way other browsers do, for elements that have an activation behavior, clicking needs to dispatch a "click" event whose default action is to dispatch a "DOMActivate" event, whose default action in turn is to perform the activation behavior of the element

[17:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: similarly, any activation not driven by the mouse (such as via keyboard or by calling the click() method) needs to dispatch a synthetic "click" event same as above

[17:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: if DOM3EV defines all this, then HTML5 could limit itself to stating which elements have activation behavior, and what that behavior is for each one

[17:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(I think)

[17:35:00.0000] <annevk4>
yeah, that is pretty much how HTML5 does it

[17:35:01.0000] <annevk4>
I still think we should nuke DOMActivate  though

[17:36:00.0000] <shepazu>
what would change your mind?

[17:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
DOMActivate adds code complexity, and it's not clear if it serves a useful purpose

[17:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
otoh now that we've implemented it, it's not a huge burden to maintain support

[17:37:02.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: do you think it would be useful for D3E to define it? I guess if it did, I reckon I'd more or less take whatever HTML5 says on it

[17:38:00.0000] <shepazu>
it would be useful for e.g. SVG, I think

[17:38:01.0000] <annevk4>
shepazu, a good reason for having it besides click?

[17:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: I think it makes sense to define the notion of activation in D3E, because I think all specs with activation behavior would want to do it the same

[17:40:00.0000] <shepazu>
ok, I'll put that in an upcoming draft, thanks

[17:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk4: does Opera support DOMActivate?

[17:41:00.0000] <annevk4>
seems like we don't

[17:42:00.0000] <annevk4>
I filed the original bug for it in 2005 or so and all duplicates were from third-party testers

[17:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm wondering how likely it is that any Web content depends on it

[17:42:02.0000] <annevk4>
given the details I have it seems highly unlikely

[17:43:00.0000] <annevk4>
apart from some tests here and there

[17:43:01.0000] <shepazu>
could we find out from MAMA?

[17:43:02.0000] <shepazu>
or from Google's research?

[17:44:00.0000] <annevk4>
we can never be really sure, but both Opera and IE not supporting it seems like a good indicator to me

[17:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
despite what Chaals said, I don't see WCAG specifically requiring DOMActivate

[17:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk4: it's possible sites could be using it in non-IE code paths and not caring or knowing that they break in Opera, although there doesn't seem much reason to doing it

[17:47:01.0000] <Darxus>
The head element says it contains "One or more elements of metadata content, of which exactly one is a title element."

[17:48:00.0000] <annevk4>
othermaciej, I guess

[17:48:01.0000] <annevk4>
othermaciej, I'd be interested in that code :)

[17:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Is there any SVG content that depends on DOMActivate?

[17:48:03.0000] <Darxus>
The meta element says it can be contained in the head element.  Nowhere does it says anything about number of times.  This annoys me.  Although I suppose that means >=0.

[17:48:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(whether Web-published or not?)

[17:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
So far it seems like the only hard dependency is XForms, and that doesn't seem like a good enough reason by itself

[17:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
SVG 1.2 Tiny seems really vague about what elements will trigger a DOMActivate or what causes this to happen

[17:50:01.0000] <Darxus>
It'd be fun for gnuplot to have a terminal type of html5canvas.

[17:51:00.0000] <Darxus>
Actually, has anybody written a SVG / postscript / etc. converter to <canvas> yet?

[17:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's implied that any rendered element can have activation behavior, the example given is a <circle>

[17:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Dino wrote a basic SVG-to-<canvas> converter long ago

[17:52:00.0000] <shepazu>
sorry, othermaciej, I was chopping mushrooms

[17:54:00.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: I don't know if any SVG content depends on it... I'm at a loss to find out if it does, other than surveys like MAMA

[17:55:00.0000] <annevk4>
figuring out if stuff breaks in experimental impl is likely a good solution

[17:55:01.0000] <annevk4>
again though, also for SVG we have received no bug reports on DOMActivate (apart from a test)

[17:57:00.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: well, if a circle had a DOMActivate event listener, or maybe a SMIL child element element... but other than that, I don't think any element in SVG should have default "activation behavior" than <a>

[17:57:01.0000] <shepazu>
/me tries to think of what other elements there might be in SVG that have activation behavior...

[17:59:00.0000] <shepazu>
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/elementTable.html

[17:59:01.0000] <shepazu>
maybe <audio> and <video>...

[17:59:02.0000] <annevk4>
elements are activatable based on their event listeners in SVG? ouch

[18:00:00.0000] <annevk4>
oh well, I suppose it does not matter much

[18:02:00.0000] <shepazu>
annevk4: how is it controversial to make an element activateable by putting a "DOMActivate" listener on it? I'm confused...

[18:03:00.0000] <shepazu>
but would the activation behavior of a multimedia element vary on whether the content was already playing or not? what's the activation behavior of HTML multimedia elements?

[18:03:01.0000] <annevk4>
shepazu, it seems activation behavior should come from semantics

[18:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: making an element activatable by putting a "DOMActivate" listener on it would be somewhat weird - an ancestor element with a DOMActivate listener would see the inner element get DOMActivate if and only if the inner element had its own listener

[18:05:00.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: ok

[18:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: since DOMActivate bubbles, that would be somewhat illogical I think

[18:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
also, in general, listeners observe events, but don't observably affect what events get dispatched just by their presence

[18:06:02.0000] <shepazu>
I'm just grasping at straws on what elements in SVG would have inherent activation behavior... links, multimedia elements, maybe SMIL elements that didn't have explicit @begin values?

[18:07:00.0000] <annevk4>
seems like www-svg might be a better place to ask that than #whatwg :)

[18:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you could make the case that every SVG element should be activatable, but it's kind of unclear what forms of non-click activation, if any, would work for something like <circle> or <path>

[18:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and what the activation behavior would be

[18:07:03.0000] <Darxus>
I just had an HTML5 comprehension breakthrough.  The "meta" element is in the "encoding declaration state" when its "http-equiv" attribute has a value of "content-type".

[18:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I could buy the argument that an activation-triggered SMIL animation makes you activatable, although that's a complicated rule

[18:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think SVG <a> elements are clearly activatable

[18:08:02.0000] <shepazu>
yes, <a> is understood

[18:09:00.0000] <shepazu>
it's not actually a concept that SVG has had to deal with much, since there are so few truly activateable elements, I guess

[18:10:00.0000] <shepazu>
whereas HTML has quite a few

[18:10:01.0000] <Darxus>
Contexts in which the "meta" element can be used really should be changed from "If the charset attribute is present, or if the element is in the Encoding declaration state: in a head element." to 'If the charset attribute is present, or if the attribute "http-equiv" is set to "content-type".'

[18:11:00.0000] <shepazu>
annevk4: are you seriously telling me that I shouldn't try to resolve open questions about improving SVG by asking opinions in #whatwg

[18:12:00.0000] <annevk4>
I thought this was a question about how SVG works today

[18:12:01.0000] <annevk4>
because of "would"

[18:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk4: I think it's more a question of how it should work per spec, if D3E centrally defines the concept of activation

[18:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but it would also be useful to determine when actual SVG implementations fire DOMActivate events, and if this seems logical

[18:13:01.0000] <shepazu>
/me looks closer at activation behavior in HTML5, including where it's used

[18:13:02.0000] <annevk4>
shepazu, also, I included a smiley...

[18:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML5 actually defines that any element that is forced to be keyboard focusable by tabIndex is activatable

[18:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(with an activation behavior that does nothing, unless it would otherwise have an activation behavior)

[18:16:02.0000] <shepazu>
yeah, just looking at that

[18:16:03.0000] <shepazu>
ah, ok, thanks, that clarifies it

[18:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and <a>, <label>, <input>, <area>, <command> and <button> may have some built-in activation behavior, depending on circumstances

[18:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oddly, <bb> does not have defined activation behavior

[18:18:01.0000] <shepazu>
in that case, most SVG elements would have similar behavior for those elements, but still no true activation behavior... maybe it would be more accurate to say that the focusable attribute adds activation behavior

[18:19:00.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: maybe an oversight?

[18:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
dunno - I'll send a comment

[18:20:00.0000] <shepazu>
I don't know the <bb> elements... you know of an example that uses it? the spec seems vague

[18:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not implemented or used by anyone yet

[18:22:01.0000] <Darxus>
Suggested changes to the draft go to the implementors list?

[18:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's just... buttonish

[18:23:00.0000] <annevk4>
Darxus, no, to whatwg⊙wo

[18:23:01.0000] <annevk4>
I'm not really sure <bb> makes a lot of sense and the name is confusing

[18:23:02.0000] <Darxus>
annevk4: Just figured that out, thanks.

[18:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's foolish to use such a heavily abbreviated name for an element with such a (relatively) obscure purpose

[18:25:00.0000] <annevk4>
I suggested (on behalf of someone else) <browserbutton>

[19:22:00.0000] <tantekc>
annevk4 - I just took a look at http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/bb.html - and assuming that is close to what the <bb> tag currently means in HTML5, I strongly recommend NOT calling that a <browserbutton>

[19:23:00.0000] <tantekc>
the term "browser button" is already fairly widely used (Google, Technorati, others) as a less jargony replacement for what is otherwise known as a "bookmarklet" or "favelet"

[19:23:01.0000] <tantekc>
http://www.google.com/options/buttons.html

[19:23:02.0000] <tantekc>
http://technorati.com/tools/favelets.html

[19:36:00.0000] <csarven>
<bb> sounds pretty close to <input type="button"> http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#push-button

[19:37:00.0000] <csarven>
At least my understanding of it

[19:57:00.0000] <tantek>
csarven - in that case, if it's not clear how it's substantially different from <input type="button"> I would be for dropping the feature from the spec.

[19:59:00.0000] <tantek>
(dropping <bb> that is)

[19:59:01.0000] <csarven>
:)

[20:06:00.0000] <csarven>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/input.button.html#input.button still exists, so, probably best that <bb>'s definition is cleared up, otherwise dropped if it had the same intention as <input type="button">

[20:08:00.0000] <csarven>
Is there a backlog sort of a document for what (and why) makes it into draft? Not particularly in the mood to track this down in the mailing list =)

[20:10:00.0000] <tantek>
csarven - I don't think I'm ever in the mood to track something down in a mailing list.

[20:12:00.0000] <csarven>
I don't know how Hixie manages his emails. That requires mad skills and sanity.

[20:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
<bb> is supposed to be a special button for built-in UA functionality that it's generally believed should be restricted to user actions

[20:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so it's somewhat different than <input type="button"> - may have a custom rendering and its behavior is likely different than a normal button

[20:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I think an element for that particular slice of functionality is overkill

[20:46:00.0000] <tantekc>
othermaciej - is there a wiki page where we can vote down elements?

[20:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
tantekc: I don't believe there is

[20:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the official way to register your displeasure would be by sending mail to the list

[20:51:00.0000] <tantekc>
I think I'd prefer to unofficially collect more data before making an official statement

[21:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me makes not to remember to tell tantek that another mechanism is to raise an issue at http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=HTML%20WG

[21:54:00.0000] <Darxus>
Body elements are a lot easier to define than those in the header.  I initially assumed the header would be much easier.

[22:07:00.0000] <Darxus>
Er, the page ended.  The list of elements didn't.

[22:07:01.0000] <Darxus>
I am thankful for recursion.

[00:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I have a big favor to ask

[00:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/404.html has wrong charset

[00:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also, multipage pages don't seem to run the broken-link-fixing script, so if e.g. a block moves from one page to another then links to it won't work)

[00:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I (re)disabled the broken-link-fixing script temporarily

[00:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because, genius that I am, the makefile change I added that enabled it also had the effect of generating a sort of endless cvs commit loop

[00:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which by the time I stopped it had robotically committed about 80 updates to the draft

[00:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
to do it proper, I will need for Hixie to add  <body onload="fixBrokenLink()"> to his W3C Overview.html file

[00:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, sounds excellent

[00:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's lucky you were using CVS, rather than a fast modern VCS that would have done millions of commits

[01:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[01:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
thank god for the inefficiency of cvs

[01:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: OK, I set UTF-8 as the default charset for the directory

[02:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, a few days ago I attempted to use lang="" properly, for about the first time ever

[02:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
and now I discover that although my first use was correct, my second use was an accidentally copied <html lang="tr"> onto an English page

[02:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me apologises for polluting the world of metadata

[02:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, nevermind, at least you have found and corrected your mistake, and order has been restored to the web.

[02:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"the Web is an unkind mistress"

[02:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
I also completely forgot to add alt text to some images that really should have them (some plain icons, some icons in links) and the validator didn't remind me at all

[03:13:00.0000] <takkaria>
MikeSmith: it's the XML people who want to make it an unkind mistress, right now it doesn't really bother with the mistressing part AFAICT

[03:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's a fickle mistress, then

[03:18:00.0000] <takkaria>
I can live with that

[03:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thinks something is really broken in his monitor, before realising Opera 10 now has a funky background image on error pages

[03:48:00.0000] <Rik|work>
arg, http://hsivonen.iki.fi/ is down :(

[04:36:00.0000] <takkaria>
hmm

[04:36:01.0000] <takkaria>
HTTP headers with q values were a really stupid idea

[04:37:00.0000] <takkaria>
should just have put things in a comma-separated list in order of preference

[04:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is the idea of "preference" not really stupid?

[04:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
I can't imagine how a browser developer would decide whether they prefer JPEG or PNG, or whether they prefer HTML or XHTML, etc

[04:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
since it depends on the content, and that depends on the server and the author and not on the browser

[04:39:02.0000] <takkaria>
I was thinking about Accept-Language myself

[04:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[04:40:01.0000] <takkaria>
but yeah, asking them to prefer one format over the other is a bit bizarre

[04:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
In that case it makes more sense, because users are likely to have preferences, and they use their browser to convey those preferences to the server

[04:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
(for languages)

[04:41:01.0000] <takkaria>
yeah, but the q-value bit is still nutty

[04:41:02.0000] <annevk4>
on top of that content negotiation does not really work

[04:49:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/185 really does seem suboptimal in WebKit

[05:06:00.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders|work: in the nightly?

[05:08:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
olliej: In Chromium linux nightly at least

[05:08:01.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders|work: meh

[05:09:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
olliej: I can't test Safari here :P

[05:09:01.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders|work: poor excuse

[05:09:02.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders|work: there's epiphany-webkit :P

[05:09:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
olliej: But that's not in Ubuntu's repos :P

[05:09:04.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders|work: which uses real webkit :D

[05:09:05.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders|work: :p

[05:10:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
olliej: Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to think of what does use WebKit+JSC and is in the repos :P

[05:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: http://simon.html5.org/test/html/parsing/innerhtml.html hangs with the html5 parser

[05:21:00.0000] <annevk4>
zcorpan, your progress bar is tag abuse

[05:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders|work: you can test WebKit nightlies on Linux using Arora

[05:21:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
annevk4: It's not zcorpan'S test

[05:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders|work: Qt-based .. it's pretty easy to build

[05:22:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
MikeSmith: But that means I can't just reply upon package management to update it ever day ;P

[05:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders|work: you update it by running "make" and "make install", as God intended

[05:25:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
MikeSmith: I guess I could use a cron to update it

[05:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders|work: http://code.google.com/p/arora/wiki/source#Building_with_Trunk

[05:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: You could switch to Gentoo, and then use www-client/arora

[06:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
has anyone pointed out that DOMFocusIn bubbles while focus doesn't?

[06:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: I believe it has been mentioned several times

[06:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think that makes for a usefully distinct use case

[06:13:00.0000] <annevk4>
there's hardly any use case attached to that though, unless you have event handlers

[06:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
non-bubbling is the sensible behavior for foucs

[06:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
unlike clicks or mouse moves, a child of element X being focused should generally *not* be treated the same as if element X was focused

[06:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(and yes, nested focus is possible and may not even be entirely useless)

[06:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(consider an area that you can keyboard scroll when it has focus, but which contains form controls which can themselves have focus)

[06:15:02.0000] <annevk4>
(or the <video> element)

[06:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the only plausible argument for DOMFocusIn is if content indeed depends on it

[06:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and I think there's no argument whatsoever for standardizing focusin/focusout

[06:17:00.0000] <annevk4>
yeah

[06:17:01.0000] <annevk4>
I'm guessing I'm not going to be happy with the solution; similarly namespace support is still included despite nobody really asking for it

[06:24:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Ubuntu has Arora packages, just not with WebKit trunk

[06:36:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Is there anything apart from @import that takes a URL but not as <uri> in CSS

[06:37:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
?

[06:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk4: I thought we dropped namespaced event support long ago

[06:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk4: is it really still in there?

[06:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wish the D3E editor's draft was easily googlable

[06:43:00.0000] <annevk4>
it is still there http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/DOM-Level-3-Events/html/DOM3-Events.html

[06:44:00.0000] <annevk4>
and for some reason the editor seems to assume my comments are in bad faith :/

[06:44:01.0000] <annevk4>
wtf

[06:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk4: do we support the namespaced stuff in opera?

[06:51:00.0000] <annevk4>
jl made an experimental impl once, I don't think it ever landed

[06:51:01.0000] <annevk4>
you'd have to check with bratell to be sure though

"The single greatest complaint heard from the standards community concerning the development of HTML5 is that it has not allowed for the scientific process.

[07:58:00.0000] <annevk4>
/me wonders what "If your company depends on the Internet and can afford to fund just a small fraction of the work above (minimum $8K grant), then please contact him at msporny⊙dc" is about

[08:06:00.0000] <takkaria>
Manu seems to have missed the point as to why people in the whatwg list can't join the HTMLWG list

sheesh

/me reminds himself that replying to that is not a productive use of his time

a fair bit of that makes some interesting proposals

[08:14:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Mostly ones that have been made before, though

[08:14:02.0000] <takkaria>
but things like "Better, more precise accessibility language for HTML5." do kind of make me want to scream

[08:15:00.0000] <takkaria>
and saying that the scientific process is being disregarded whilst also saying experts don't get to dictate what happend next

[08:15:01.0000] <takkaria>

[08:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
It's ironic that HTML5 has the most open development process compared with any previous HTML spec.

[08:23:01.0000] <takkaria>
no, see, 1000 people on a mailing list isn't open enough

[08:23:02.0000] <takkaria>
we need to open it to the experts. :)

"In a CTC process, as used at the W3C, consensus should be reached before an editor changes a document." - we would never get anything done with that process

[08:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
we'd get more criticism from people complaining about how the spec has stalled if we adopted a process like that

[08:29:00.0000] <takkaria>
he doesn't suggest we move to a CTC model

[08:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
just that we magic up more committers

[08:30:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: Well, we can't publish until we have consensus, and I think in terms of time taken there's no difference between getting consensus on changes first and getting consensus after

[08:35:00.0000] <annevk4>
the HTML5 editor model is not that weird actually

[08:35:01.0000] <annevk4>
the CSS WG and WebApps WG are also using it

[08:35:02.0000] <annevk4>
those groups do make group decisions a bit more often than the HTML WG

[08:35:03.0000] <Lachy>
"it is difficult to tell which parts of the specification are at which level of maturity without deep knowledge of the history of the document" - Now he's just blatently ignoring the status markers we've had for over a year

[08:36:00.0000] <annevk4>
he might be reading the W3C edition

[08:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk4, those groups are also smaller and don't have such large and diverse communities forming around them

[08:37:00.0000] <annevk4>
I'm not sure I'd say that about CSS, but the community there has arguably less of a say

[08:38:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me wonders why HTML 5 and CSS 3 doesn't

[08:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
"The issue is that there are currently no proposals for distributed extensibility in HTML5 " - now that's just a blatant lie. He knows full well that the microdata section is in the spec for that. He may not like it as it is, but lying about it not being there doesn't help

[08:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk4: I guess we should try to get the annotations added to the W3C version also

[08:52:00.0000] <Darxus>
It confused me for a few days that the status markers shown in the demo video weren't in the W3C version, because I wasn't looking at the WHATWG version.

[09:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
demo video?

[10:16:00.0000] <vs-hs>
whatwg?

thelinx: :D

[10:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
vs-hs, what?

[10:17:01.0000] <vs-hs>
Lachy: No idea

[10:47:00.0000] <Darxus>
The spec has not been written primarilfy for validator implimentors.

[10:49:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
The spec hasn't been written primarily for anyone

[10:51:00.0000] <Darxus>
The "Contexts in which this element may be used" and "Content model" have very different wording cosidering that they directly correspond to each other.

[10:52:00.0000] <Darxus>
Maybe change "Contexts in which this element may be used" to "Content models in which this element may be used"

[10:54:00.0000] <Darxus>
I should just write a parser that converts http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/ to schema :P

[11:01:00.0000] <Darxus>
<define name="phrasing_content"></define name="phrasing_content"> is invalid xml?  :(

[11:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
Only start tags have attributes

[11:02:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: It's invalid in SGML and HTML too.

[11:03:00.0000] <Darxus>
Lame.

[11:03:01.0000] <Darxus>
I just prefer it over 

[11:03:02.0000] <Darxus>
<define name="phrasing_conent">

[11:04:00.0000] <Darxus>
</define> <!-- end of phrasing_conent -->

[11:04:01.0000] <takkaria>
most people use indentation. :)

[11:04:02.0000] <Darxus>
Yeah, but this is for a case where the <define> is several pages long, so I'm not really sure which one I'm adding to without something like the above.

[11:05:00.0000] <Darxus>
Well, phrasing_contenet isn't that big, but flow_content is.

[11:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
<phrasing_content>...</phrasing_content>

[11:05:02.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: I'd rather more closely follow relax ng.

[11:06:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: Why not use RelaxNG?

[11:06:01.0000] <Darxus>
Is xml 1.0 sgml conformant?  To make </define name=""> valid xml, would I need to also update the sgml standard?

[11:06:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: And why not http://syntax.whattf.org/?

[11:06:03.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: Because it is not capable of specifying HTML5 to the HTML5 validator conformance requirements.

[11:06:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: XML 1.0 is a subset of SGML.

[11:07:00.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: That sounds like a yes.

[11:07:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: Sure, but do we need another schema language?

[11:07:02.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: If there isn't one that can sufficiently specify HTML5, I think so.

[11:07:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: Is RelaxNG with Schematron not enough?

[11:07:04.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: Yes.

[11:07:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: In what way?

[11:08:00.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: While Henry's thesis index is loading... one example was validating the layout of a table element.

[11:09:00.0000] <Darxus>
HTML5 requires that a table have, for example, no cells overlapping.  No existing schema language can specify that.  Henry implimented the requriement in java.

[11:09:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
*Henri

[11:09:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Schematron should be able to check that though, I think. hsivonen's point is that you can't do it in any schema language, but Schematron isn't; a schema language.

[11:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/;//

[11:10:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me doesn't entirely like this keyboard

[11:11:00.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: So why, when he was using both relax ng, and schematron, did he impliment some rules in java?

[11:11:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: Performance.

[11:11:02.0000] <Darxus>
And... schematron isn't a schema language?

[11:12:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I wouldn't call rule-based validation a schema

[11:12:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
But yes, I guess technically it is

[11:13:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Ah, some of the data types can't be expressed in Relax NG apparently

[11:13:01.0000] <Darxus>
I believe schematron is not capable of sufficiently specifying HTML5.  If I am incorrect, I would love to know.

[11:15:00.0000] <takkaria>
Darxus: you're inventing a schema language so you can write a validator that takes that schema language and uses it?

[11:15:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
According to the intro of hsivonen's thesis, it is possible to check everything apart from some data types using RelaxNG+Schematron

[11:15:02.0000] <Darxus>
Schematron.com's header totally needs to be an svg.

[11:15:03.0000] <Darxus>
takkaria: That's my plan.

[11:16:00.0000] <Darxus>
I make no claims at being qualified to impliment this plan, but it entertains me.

[11:16:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: What do you gain by using a custom schema language to writing it all in code yourself?

[11:16:02.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: The ability to then write schemas for other things in that language.

[11:17:00.0000] <Darxus>
http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/01/diagram_comparing_schema_langu.html  - ven-ish diagram of schema language capabilities.

[11:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hopefully nothing else in the world is as crazy as HTML5 and needing the same kind of schema language features

[11:17:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Darxus: What do you gain by being able to express data type restrictions in a schema?

[11:17:03.0000] <Darxus>
It seems like there should be a schema language that contains all of them plus the ability to validate HTML5.

[11:17:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Atom Syndication Format can't be expressed in any either, AFAIK

[11:17:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Actually, that's untrue.

[11:18:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: It isn't expressed fully by the included RelaxNG schema.

[11:18:01.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders|work: Also, hopefully it would make it easier to update an HTML5 validator for HTML5.1.

[11:18:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: But you can express it fully if you combine that with Schematron

[11:18:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: I assume it doesn't need the ability to e.g. express table constraints, though

[11:18:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: But that still doesn't limit atom:updated, atom:published, etc. to being valid dates

[11:19:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oooo! Tests have finished running!

[11:19:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me goes back to work

[11:20:00.0000] <inimino>
Darxus: what happens if HTML5.1 adds new conformance criteria that are inexpressible in the new language?

[11:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: You need to write more tests, so you can spend more time on IRC waiting for them to finish

[11:20:02.0000] <Darxus>
inimino: Then I extend the new language.

[11:30:00.0000] <Darxus>
A machine readable version of the HTML5 spec would be much more difficult if it were not for recursion.

[12:37:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: is the idea of using Upgrade header for WebSocket based on something web servers can do today? We're adding test infrastructure for WebSocket now, and I wonder if we can make it work inside Apache easily

[12:40:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
ap: I think I heard someone talking about an Apache module for it

[12:42:00.0000] <ap>
gsnedders|work: googling suggests more like "venting about the lack of thereof", http://www.pmsenthilkumar.blogspot.com/2009/07/apaches-html5-websocket-conundrum.html :)

[12:43:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me needs to get around to writing a websocket server

[12:43:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
ap: I mean about actually writing one themselves :)

[12:44:00.0000] <ap>
jwalden: we have an initial version at https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27490 - not integrated with Apache in any way, though

[12:45:00.0000] <jwalden>
ap: I think the initial plan is for me to hack our web server enough to be able to implement the parsing, although it would also be lax and accept HTTP-style constructs that aren't also websocket

[12:45:01.0000] <jwalden>
eventually want something super-strict to throw out ill-formed inputs, tho

[13:18:00.0000] <Darxus>
Hah, HTML5 can't be valid XML because it doesn't allow associating a DTD.  Which is required for valid XML.

[13:21:00.0000] <ttepass->
Darxus, <!DOCTYPE html> is a valid doctype declaration per XML, isn't it?

[13:23:00.0000] <Darxus>
ttepass-: It is a valid doctype, but XML is not valid if it does not specify (and validate with) a DTD.

[13:23:01.0000] <takkaria>
it's still wellformed, though, and you can still validate it. :)

[13:24:00.0000] <ttepass->
Ah: ?Note that it is possible to construct a well-formed document containing a doctypedecl that neither points to an external subset nor contains an internal subset.?

[13:24:01.0000] <Darxus>
"The XML Recommendation says that an XML document is 'valid' if it has an associated document type declaration and if the document complies with the constraints expressed in it."

[13:25:00.0000] <Darxus>
takkaria: Yes you can validate it against another schema but that still, apparently, makes it invalid xml.

[13:25:01.0000] <takkaria>
it doesn't make it invalid

[13:25:02.0000] <Darxus>
Quote from http://perl-xml.sourceforge.net/faq/ section 6.

[13:25:03.0000] <takkaria>
it just means that it's neither valid nor invalid

[13:25:04.0000] <Darxus>
I'm looking for the wording in the XML Recommendation.

[13:26:00.0000] <ttepass->
Darxus, section 2.8:

[13:26:01.0000] <ttepass->
[Definition: An XML document is valid if it has an associated document type declaration and if the document complies with the constraints expressed in it.]

[13:27:00.0000] <Darxus>
"An XML document is valid if it has an associated document type declaration and if the document complies with the constraints expressed in it" - http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/ section 2.8

[13:27:01.0000] <Darxus>
Yeah...

[13:27:02.0000] <Darxus>
I interpret that as meaning that it is invalid without specifying a DTD.

[13:29:00.0000] <takkaria>
I think you're misinterpreting

[13:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
it would be silly to make documents without a DTD invalid, since having a DTD is optional

[13:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there any reason to prefer <html dir=rtl> over/under <style>html { direction: rtl }</style> ?

[13:32:01.0000] <Darxus>
Wow, validator.w3.org won't do just xml?

[13:35:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, style sheets are optional

[13:36:00.0000] <ttepass->
Non-CSS-user agents one would think. Like a search engine which want's to display the first n sentences and needs directionality for display.

[13:37:00.0000] <cying>
dear whatwg

[13:37:01.0000] <cying>
when a video element is appended to the DOM, should it trigger a load event?

[13:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
cying: A load event on what?

[13:39:01.0000] <cying>
gsnedders: on the video element

[13:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
cying: That'll fire once the video is loaded, no?

[13:39:03.0000] <cying>
http://satine.org/research/webkit/tests/video-events.html

[13:40:00.0000] <Rik|work>
cying: how does it behave on firefox ?

[13:40:01.0000] <cying>
Rik|work: ah i should try that

[14:26:00.0000] <Darxus>
Parse::Simple is upsetting me: "Entity 'lt' not defined".

[18:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
other than html5lib parse.py and xmllint, anybody know of command-line tools that can take HTML and output well-formed XHTML/XML from it?

[18:53:00.0000] <heycam>
MikeSmith, "and" has very low precedence

[18:53:01.0000] <heycam>
but operates the same as "&&"

[18:53:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heycam: I see

[18:54:00.0000] <heycam>
it's intended to string whole statements together

[18:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so for my case it doesn't matter, because there are just two parts of the expression

[18:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
-  if ($File->{Opt}->{FB}->{Charset}) { # charset fallback mode

[18:54:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
+  if ($File->{Opt}->{FB}->{Charset} and $File->{DOCTYPE} ne "HTML5") { # charset fallback mode

[18:55:00.0000] <heycam>
yeah shouldn't matter

[18:55:01.0000] <heycam>
though i'd go with && stylistically there

[18:55:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me didn't test that and just hopes that's actually correct perl syntax

[18:55:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
heycam: OK

[18:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy, heycam : guess it's gotten pretty cold down there?

[18:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Tokyo like a steam bath the last couple days

[18:56:02.0000] <heycam>
yeah, though yesterday and today have seen a bit of sun

[18:56:03.0000] <heycam>
(here in melb at least)

[18:56:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
heycam: you missing that 45 degree summer yet?

[18:57:00.0000] <heycam>
hah yep, i could do with a baking

[18:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I hope I can get back to melbourne sometime soon

[18:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and Hobart

[18:57:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and other places

[18:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
we should have some WG f2f in Hobart

[18:59:00.0000] <heycam>
sounds good to me.  sitting outside, summertime in salamanca place...

[18:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[18:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders if BeautifulSoup has a command-line tool bundled

[19:20:00.0000] <Darxus>
MikeSmith: Ohh, what are you doing with that bit of code?

[19:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Darxus: making the HTML5 facet of validator.w3.org not incorrectly check and warn about missing encoding info that's not actually missing

[19:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7135

[19:24:01.0000] <Darxus>
Cool.

[19:26:00.0000] <Darxus>
MikeSmith: That's based on validator.nu, right?  Will you be sending him patches?

[19:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Darxus: the cause is not in the v.nu code, but instead the validator.w3.org perl cgi thing

[19:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
different maintainer

[19:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Darxus: if you have perl chops and interest in helping with the W3C validator, I think your help would be welcom

[19:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
*welcome

[19:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
same goes for v.nu, though that's mostly Java code, with some python wrapper stuff

[19:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: when you have a minute, about that big favor I need..

[19:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i need to have dinner, and i'm still finishing up e-mail backlog from the past few days

[19:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[19:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
no rush

[19:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i'll be online later tonight and ready to go on all cylinders

[19:54:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool

[20:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
all right, finally some solid science

[20:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=mindless-collectives-rational-decision-making

[20:00:02.0000] <Darxus>
MikeSmith: I.. am working on validation.  In a... less sane way.  :)

[20:00:03.0000] <Darxus>
Thanks.

[20:09:00.0000] <tantek>
MikeSmith - note that scientificamerican article studies (and thus concludes) about ant colonies picking from one of a few artificial nests as potential homes.

[20:09:01.0000] <tantek>
not something I would generalize to humans, nor to anything that requires anything more than a simple economic multiple choice question/answer, e.g. design, innovation etc.

[20:10:00.0000] <tantek>
or even art for that matter.

[20:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
tantek: yeah, I was forwarding it in the same spirit in which Bil Corry posted it (on the whatwg list)

[20:11:00.0000] <tantek>
I'd like to see a study on how many people errantly draw overgeneralized conclusions from the title of an article rather than read it for its actual limited contents / claims.

[20:14:00.0000] <tantek>
s/title/headline

[20:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I find it more fun to just assume overgeneralized conclusions and pretend it has some relevance

[20:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
greater entertainment value there

[20:15:00.0000] <tantek>
I wonder if there is a name for the phenomenon of people errantly drawing overgeneralized conclusions from the headline of an article.

[20:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I bet there is.

[20:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wish that I had studied sociology more in university, rather than just making fun of the people who were wasting their time studying it.

[20:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I learned more about whatever field of study it is that most closely relates to interactions of people in distributed discussions.

[20:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
s/I learned/Or learned/

[20:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the last paragraph of the article has a really nice sentence: "You might do better with a strategically limited set of information."

[20:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"strategically limiting your set of information" sounds like a great euphemism for narrow-mindedness and dogmatism

[20:23:01.0000] <tantek>
the key is focus

[20:24:00.0000] <Darxus>
I have, so far, managed to ignore that "new way forward" thing.

[20:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
New Way Forward seems like it would be a great name of the fascist political party I'm trying to get started.

[20:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I was considering the Actually Backward Looking, Reactionary Fear-Mongering Party

[20:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but New Way Forward is shorter

[20:30:00.0000] <tantek>
MikeSmith, re: focus, see also, Paradox of Choice: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory#Paradox_of_choice

[20:31:00.0000] <tantek>
(and re: New Way Forward, I think Sam Ruby's response handled that thread quite well)

[20:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
tantek: yeah, I think in general Sam's handling discussions on the public-html list really well

[20:33:01.0000] <tantek>
and as far as that phenomenon is concerned, lacking a better (or previous) name, I'm going to call it "headline fixation" - borrowing from (and a special case of) target fixation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_fixation

[20:34:00.0000] <Darxus>
Heh.

[20:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
tantek:  especially as far as helping to guide people toward taking specific action to get a resolution

[20:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I like "headline fixation"

[20:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
tantek: so about Paradox of Choice, I guess I should have studied game theory more. instead of, say, differential equations (which I have zero use for now)

[21:28:00.0000] <Darxus>
I think I may have found a bug in XML::Twig :/

[21:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me writes an essay on feature strings being useless

[00:15:00.0000] <Mrmil>
/me cannot find a usage of a regular expression that changes html tags (and attributes but without values) from uppercase to lowercase

[00:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: here now

[00:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: sorry, I was out for a bit too. but now I got to pack up and leave again shortly to head to Yokohama for a while. I'll ping you again after I get on the train

[00:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hopefully I can get a seat

[00:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
neat

[01:10:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: what are the main points you think I should touch on in my presentation on HTML to an XML audience?

[01:10:01.0000] <shepazu>
or anyone, really

[01:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[01:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
depends on the audience, mostly. are these developers, standards-heads, managers..?

[01:14:00.0000] <tantek>
shepazu - there's such a thing as an XML audience? do they stop listening as soon as you make the first grammatical error in your speech? 1/2 ;)

[01:16:00.0000] <shepazu>
tantek: I think they will stop listening to me long before that :)

[01:18:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: I think the audience will largely be from the DocBook/DITA/XSLT DTP sector

[01:18:01.0000] <shepazu>
I've spoken at this conference before, though it had a different name... probably the same crowd

[01:19:00.0000] <shepazu>
there are some developers in the audience, too

[01:19:01.0000] <shepazu>
http://www.aboveandbeyondlearning.com/xmlspeakerpres.html

[01:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
hm wow, i don't know much about that crowd

[01:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess things to hit on:

[01:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
XHTML5 is a pure-XML dialect, so it can work with the whole XML pipeline

[01:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
namespaces, can be used with schema languages, etc

[01:20:03.0000] <shepazu>
right, got that

[01:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
what else, hm

[01:21:01.0000] <shepazu>
I'm going to talk about the misconceptions about XHTML (serving it as text/html, etc)

[01:21:02.0000] <shepazu>
how HTML5 clarifies that

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that might be useful. using the mime types to define what the processing is, rather than the doctypes, etc

[01:22:01.0000] <shepazu>
yes, got that

[01:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen would probably tell you to mention that you can fit text/html parsers onto the front end of an XML pipeline and it's actually compatible

[01:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
so that you can treat text/html as XML for the purposes of XML processing

[01:22:04.0000] <shepazu>
(mind you, this is 1.5 hours, so I can ramble quite a lot

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
and same on the output side

[01:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you have any authors in the crowd, i find the biggest wows come from demoing <input type=date> and <input type=color>

[01:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
ironically

[01:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
(and then <canvas>)

[01:23:04.0000] <shepazu>
are there any print-specific things about HTML5 that might interest them (or even new stuff from CSS)?

[01:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm...

[01:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
can't think of any off-hand

[01:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
<section> might be of interest to the DocBook crowd

[01:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
and the rest of the new sectioning elements might either make them laugh or scare them or, if we're lucky, interest them

[01:24:04.0000] <shepazu>
ah, interesting tip about input types, I'll definitely include that, I think people interested in document flows would be interested in input validation and enforcement

[01:25:00.0000] <shepazu>
yes, good point

[01:25:01.0000] <shepazu>
any good demos/synopsis of the sectioning elements?

[01:26:00.0000] <shepazu>
also, are there any good resources that tell which things are implemented in which browsers?

[01:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://html5gallery.com/ has a number of sites using the new elements that actually look pretty

[01:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
unlike anything i could ever do

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
#html5gallery on twitter if you want to reach out to them

[01:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
er, s/#/@/

[01:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
as for what's implemented where, i gotta admit to not knowing what's shipped, i have enough trouble tracking the trunk builds. but there's a wiki page about that, let me see...

[01:27:03.0000] <shepazu>
tantek: with an HTML5, should I expect that the microphone would correct any grammatical errors before they hear them?

[01:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Implementations_in_Web_browsers

[01:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
dunno how accurate it is

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
but it might help

[01:28:01.0000] <shepazu>
s/HTML5/HTML5 audience/

[01:28:02.0000] <tantek>
shepazu, depends if you speak into the microphone labeled "text/html" or the one labeled "application/xhtml+xml"

[01:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: last year i gave this terrible talk that might give you some ideas http://www.whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/

[01:29:00.0000] <shepazu>
is anyone besides FF/henri implementing the parser stuff? I think that will be of interest to XML people

[01:29:01.0000] <shepazu>
I don't know if my presentation will be videoed, but if so, I'll share it along

[01:30:00.0000] <shepazu>
and of course I'll put the slides up, for other folks who might want to stripmine them for any content

[01:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's a bunch of parser implementations, dunno how many of them have XML backends

[01:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
html5lib has at least a python build, i think there's php and ruby builds too, dunno how up to date

[01:31:01.0000] <shepazu>
I'm specifically thinking of major browsers

[01:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's a c implementation that iirc takkaria is working on

[01:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
of the "major" browsers currently only mozilla is doing anything

[01:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
the others are watching with amused interest, i think :-)

[01:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
one of those "wow, you're brave. let's see how it goes with you before we try _that_ trick."

[01:32:01.0000] <shepazu>
with the idea of text/html parsers plugged into XML pipelines, are there any production-quality systems I can mention?

[01:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
(mozilla had the most to gain from replacing the parser of the major browsers, i think)

[01:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
(except maybe IE)

[01:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
(but IE also has the most to lose, so...)

[01:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: henri's is production-quality as i understand it, at least for Java environments

[01:33:01.0000] <shepazu>
I think that the Moz implementation feedback will be pretty valuable

[01:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what the state of other impls is

[01:33:03.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: and is that available from Validator.nu?

[01:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
i think so, not sure

[01:33:05.0000] <shepazu>
/me looks

[01:35:00.0000] <shepazu>
I think this will definitely be a "tools" crowd

[01:35:01.0000] <shepazu>
you think henri will be around this weekend?

[01:35:02.0000] <shepazu>
henri's a very tooly guy

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno, i've been offline for a few days so i'm not sure where everyone is

[01:36:01.0000] <shepazu>
I should probably throw in statistics about the relative use of HTML and XHTML

[01:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
depends if you want to depress them or not :-P

[01:36:03.0000] <shepazu>
well... they need some tough love :)

[01:37:00.0000] <shepazu>
btw, Hixie, I'm not ignoring your request for better wording of events in DOM3 Events, though I've not done much on that... I will probably get to it around the middle of next month

[01:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[01:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
no rush on that front from my side

[01:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's the news on mutation events?

[01:38:03.0000] <shepazu>
well... here's my opinion on it

[01:39:00.0000] <shepazu>
I think they should be deprecated (and the current draft does that) but I only want to deprecate them in favor of something else that solves the use cases (hopefully better)

[01:39:01.0000] <shepazu>
you probably saw the ideas about a non-event-based API for detecting changes

[01:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[01:40:00.0000] <shepazu>
so, I'm hoping we can get that going before D3E goes to CR

[01:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool, ok

[01:40:02.0000] <shepazu>
so I can point to it, and say, do this instead

[01:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'll probably keep html5 silent about mutation events into last call, then, and argue that i'm just waiting for d3e before addressing that. sounds good.

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
how about user interaction events like clicks and mouseover and keydown and stuff; do we have anyone working on a solid spec for that?

[01:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
shepazu: You should do a graphical demonstration of relative use of HTML of XHTML - take a picture like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wembley_enggermatch.jpg and the players represent application/xhtml+xml and the crowd represents text/html

[01:41:02.0000] <shepazu>
I'm particularly worried about ARIA's use of Mutation Events, since that is the one instance where you need a fast, responsive interface... where they don't have multiple streams of feedback telling them that they did or did not accomplish their task

[01:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
(That matches the numbers from MAMA, I think)

[01:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: send them last call comments, they're in last call now iirc. still got a chance to get them to fix it. :-)

[01:42:01.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: already done, and I've already explained my concerns and possible ways forward with them

[01:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[01:43:00.0000] <shepazu>
I don't think they like the idea now, but they will... 

[01:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:43:02.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: I believe that the UI events are going to be in D3E... they are now, and I have plans to explicate them... why, you think they should be split out?

[01:44:00.0000] <shepazu>
Philip`: heh... that's pretty good

[01:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't mean the events themselves so much as the prose that defines how when the mouse moves past the edge of a CSS block you fire mouseout then mouseenter, them mousemove as it moves, them mousedown as the first button goes down, etc

[01:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
the real nitty gritty

[01:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
i might just be out of date with what d3e says

[01:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
last i checked it just listed the events with vague descriptions of when they fired

[01:45:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: yes, I'd intended on including that, along with diagrams of sequences

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that was a while back

[01:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[01:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[01:45:04.0000] <shepazu>
where can I get the MAMA numbers... I'd like some hard figures

[01:45:05.0000] <Philip`>
shepazu: http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/554/mamaurlset-mimehistogram.htm

[01:45:06.0000] <Philip`>
via http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-http-headers/

[01:46:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: this was my first very rough pass at better prose: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/DOM-Level-3-Events/html/DOM3-Events.html#events-event-click

[01:48:00.0000] <shepazu>
I plan to have expository sections that describe mousedown/mouseup/click/dblclick, mousemove/mouseover/mousemove/mouseout, keydown/keypress/keyup/textInput, etc...

[01:48:01.0000] <shepazu>
with shiny diagrams

[01:48:02.0000] <shepazu>
breakdowns of related event flows

[01:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: looks like a good step in the right direction. not sure i like the "may"s, they seem overly vague (e.g. the one about mousedown and mouseup -- seems like that should be defined more precisely), but i haven't done the research to really tell you what it should say, so i dunno

[01:49:01.0000] <shepazu>
ah, yeah, and I did add mouseenter and mouseleave

[01:49:02.0000] <shepazu>
yeah, still rough, I'll get more precise

[01:50:00.0000] <shepazu>
I've got a good team of folks doing research for me

[01:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[01:50:02.0000] <shepazu>
Jacob, the intern at MS, is really great, too bad he'll be leaving next month :(

[01:51:00.0000] <shepazu>
but Olli, Dan, Travis, and others are all kicking ass

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't want to minimise their work, but don't underestimate the value of personal experience with this stuff :-)

[01:52:00.0000] <shepazu>
oh, I'm also doing my own tests, but... you know, hours in the day

[01:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
been there! :-)

[01:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
Switch to a 25-hour day, and then you'll have more time

[01:53:02.0000] <shepazu>
they also think of things I never would have, and develop methodologies that let me just check the work rather than do it all myself

[01:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, more time per day)

[01:53:04.0000] <shepazu>
Philip`: many thanks for the pointers!

[01:54:00.0000] <shepazu>
Philip`: any thoughts yourself on what would interest you in such a presentation?

[01:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
shepazu: I don't think I've got any useful thoughts - I tend not to find presentations interesting at all :-)

[01:57:00.0000] <shepazu>
heh

[02:01:00.0000] <shepazu>
thanks for the help and pointers, Hixie 

[02:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
np

[02:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
wish i could help more, but i'm not really good with the PR stuff :-/

[02:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
i hate giving talks and demos and stuff like that

[02:02:00.0000] <shepazu>
I now need to create/find good summaries of the sectioning stuff, and steal a demo of <input type=foo>

[02:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
type=date in particular, and type=color if anyone's implemented it yet

[02:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
the others don't get quite so the wow as type=color

[02:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno why

[02:03:00.0000] <shepazu>
I get petrified when giving presentations, which is odd since I'm normally extroverted and outspoken

[02:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've always thought type=range was the coolest addition in the <input types>

[02:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
huh, that's weird. oddly once i'm up there i'm fine, i just hate the before and the after.

[02:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
the preparation, the not knowing if what i will say or have said was even remotely interesting

[02:04:00.0000] <shepazu>
that's how I am when I'm acting (I'm fine once I'm up there), but not presentations

[02:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
huh

[02:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
maybe make the presentations into acts :-)

[02:04:03.0000] <shepazu>
that might be it... plays are scripted, and rehearsed... maybe I just need to be more disciplined about my prep

[02:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
rehearsal for talks help immensely

[02:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
though you feel like quite the tool rehearsing a talk

[02:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
or at least, i do

[02:05:03.0000] <shepazu>
anyway, I'm only ever a bit player on stage, but in presentations, all eyes are on me

[02:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
could be that too

[02:06:00.0000] <shepazu>
yes, I feel like an idiot rehearsing talks... I'm like, "well, I know all this already!"

[02:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
shepazu: Just remember that most people's eyes are on their laptops rather than you, and you won't feel so much pressure

[02:08:01.0000] <shepazu>
Philip`: true :)

[02:09:00.0000] <shepazu>
oh, Hixie, which parts of HTML5 come from XHTML2... is it just some of the sectioning elements?

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
"come from" may be overstating it, but areas where xhtml2 influenced the html5 design include:

[02:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
<section>/<h1>

[02:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
<nav>

[02:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
xforms in general influenced a lot of the webforms 2 additions

[02:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
rdfa influenced microdata a lot

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
<a href=""> being allowed around flow (blocks) was a response of sorts to xhtml2's href=""-everywhere idea

[02:12:00.0000] <shepazu>
what about xforms was reflected in wf2?

[02:12:01.0000] <shepazu>
the data typing...

[02:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
almost all the original wf2 features were basically trying to demonstrate that xforms could be done in text/html

[02:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
so the new controls, the client-side validation

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
some of them didn't make it into html5 proper -- we junked the repetition model, the <select> and <form> autofill

[02:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
various other things

[02:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
in all these cases, xhtml2, xforms, etc, were but some of many other sources of input, which is why i'm being guarded about saying "come from" as such

[02:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't mean to minimise their impact on html5

[02:14:02.0000] <shepazu>
sure, I was just being loose with my wording

[02:16:00.0000] <shepazu>
I think I heard that there was more of a direct integration of some XHTML2 (the core language) stuff into HTML5

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
not really. the most direct integration was <section>/<h> which became <section>/<h1>

[02:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think

[02:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
it was so long ago that i may have forgotten some key aspect of xhtml2 that forms the basis of all of html5 :-)

[02:22:00.0000] <shepazu>
heh

[02:22:01.0000] <shepazu>
well, surely it's the distributed extensibility :)

[02:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
nah, we have both forms of that that xhtml2 had, i think

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
at least we have the namespaces and the annotation extensions (through microdata)

[02:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
xhtml2 may have had some m12n extension mechanism that i didn't understand

[02:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
in which case we don't have that

[02:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
from what shane says there's some key part of that that is important in a way i don't follow

[02:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
HTML5 has lots of distributed extensibility - you can describe a feature in an email or blog post or comment or tweet or anything, anywhere on the internet, and Hixie will see it and if it's good then he'll extend the spec to include it

[02:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I imagined (based on little understanding) the importance was that m12n specified a specific mechanism for specifying a language that's based on XHTML, whereas the HTML5 approach is that you can write your own spec and normatively reference HTML5 (and then get implementers and users to adopt your new spec) and there's no guidance as to how to do that easily or cleanly or safely

[02:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if that's anywhere even vaguely near correct

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
if that is correct, then it sounds like the kind of extensibility mechanism that we want to avoid... but then again, i apparently missed the memo on extensibility being key to world peace or whatever it is that makes everyone so eager to have it these days

[02:29:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
shepazu: fwiw, there's a list here that I was drafting for something else

[02:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://people.w3.org/mike/html5/implementations.txt

[02:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
some of it is not accurate as far as the browser details

[02:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
probably

[02:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean the implementation status part

[02:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would think XML-oriented/doc people would be as much interested in that as anybody else would be

[02:35:00.0000] <shepazu>
MikeSmith: cool, thanks!

[02:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
shepazu: and I got a few different sets of slides -

[02:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.slideshare.net/sideshowbarker/presentations

[02:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
again, fwiw

[02:37:00.0000] <shepazu>
sweet

[02:37:01.0000] <shepazu>
MikeSmith: you know of any good examples of input types?

[02:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
note that for Slideshare stuff, if you scroll down, it gives you the text

[02:37:03.0000] <shepazu>
oh, nice.

[02:37:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
shepazu: Hixie got some demos

[02:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.slideshare.net/sideshowbarker/html5-and-xhtml2 might be relevant for this talk

[02:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
shepazu: note that I have a video clip of Doug Crockford in that presentation, but think it doesn't play there

[02:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's him saying, "I've discovered that most of the world's body of JavaScript programs is crap."

[02:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand JF's claim that accessibility experts were not consulted on accessibility issues in the spec. If the WAI PFWG and all those accessibility advocates who've mailed the list with their feedback don't count, then I'm not sure what would.

[02:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps he's confusing consultation with acceptance-without-debate

[02:46:00.0000] <shepazu>
MikeSmith: I need to get my ass to bed, but if you could scare up a nice demo of the input types and email me, I'd be much obliged

[02:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
shepazu: http://www.whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/

[02:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and there is stuff at html5demos.com

[02:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, or maybe not

[02:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://html5demos.com/

[02:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
(not fo the <input> stuff)

[03:07:00.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: i believe safari 4 supports offline notification

[03:07:01.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: it's kind of necessary for the app cache 

[03:07:02.0000] <olliej>
:D

[03:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
olliej: thanks -- added Safari there

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk4>
oops

[04:08:00.0000] <annevk4>
my initial email was correct :/

[04:08:01.0000] <annevk4>
just elementFromPoint + offsets would do the trick

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk4>
/me wonders if Manu at this point is just spreading FUD or doesn't know better

[05:01:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
"The following HTML elements have varying levels of special parsing rules: address, area, article, aside, base, basefont, bgsound, blockquote, body, br, center, col, colgroup, command, datagrid, dd, details, dialog, dir, div, dl, dt, embed, fieldset, figure, footer, form, frame, frameset, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, head, header, hgroup, hr, iframe, img, input, isindex, li, link, listing, menu, meta, nav, noembed, noframes, noscript, ol, p, param,

[05:01:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
 plaintext, pre, script, section, select, spacer, style, tbody, textarea, tfoot, thead, title, tr, ul, and wbr."

[05:01:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That really does say it all.

[05:44:00.0000] <annevk4>
I wonder if anyone notices the small contradiction in my latest email

[05:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk2: your latest email doesn't make any sense

[05:51:00.0000] <annevk4>
that's too bad

[05:51:01.0000] <annevk4>
I was trying to say something useful

[05:52:00.0000] <annevk4>
zcorpan, having read it again, what do you mean?

[06:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk2: you're saying that ultimately, lots of people have the final say

[06:04:00.0000] <annevk4>
if they're unanimous

[06:04:01.0000] <annevk4>
or close to

[06:04:02.0000] <annevk4>
witness axis from HTML4

[06:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://hey-it.com/download.html

[06:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
--> "Wanna get laid? Fuck IE6!" :-)

[07:00:00.0000] <Mrmil>
Amen.

[07:43:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Why am I so hungry today!?

[07:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, have you eaten anything? That's usually the problem when I ask myself that question.

[07:54:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: I had my normal, large, lunch.

[07:59:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me is tempted to go into town and buy a second large lunch

[08:00:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I guess it must be the lack of fika :P

[08:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
what's fika?

[09:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
why is the author of posts on the WHATWG blog hidden nowadays?

[09:11:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
annevk2: Because we reverted to the default Kubrick theme

[09:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why does the WHATWG blog say <p style="display: none"> <a href="http://beowulf.ulakbim.gov.tr/dokuman/bin.php?p=once-upon-a-time-in-the-west">download full movie once upon a time in the west</a>  ... ?

[09:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
I'm sure that's not in the default theme

[09:11:03.0000] <annevk2>
didn't ben once made a design?

[09:11:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dunno

[09:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, we've been haaked?

[09:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: Yes

[09:12:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Again?

[09:12:03.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: (again)

[09:12:04.0000] <annevk2>
good times

[09:12:05.0000] <annevk2>
i hope we make backups of data

[09:15:00.0000] <svl>
wordpress 2.8.2 fixed a very commonly used vulnerability which allowed such ad injection. Since whatwg is still on 2.8.1, I'd suggest upgrading.

[09:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders (again) how hard can it be to write secure blog software

[09:17:00.0000] <svl>
(And then change all the passwords of everyone who has access, since I believe this particular one worked by stealing that.)

[09:18:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
How can they steal passwords? Upon logging in?

[09:18:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Have you looked at the mess that is WP's codebase?

[09:19:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me votes for moving the blog to Habari :P

[09:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: I haven't

[09:19:02.0000] <inimino>
/me has looked, sadly

[09:19:03.0000] <inimino>
/me suggests using anything that is not WP

[09:19:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me isn't on the PMC of Habari or anything

[09:19:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Use Habari!

[09:19:06.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: That just changes the question to how hard can it be to write blog secure that isn't such a mess that it can't be secured :-)

[09:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[09:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/secure//

[09:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
No

[09:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/secure/software/

[09:20:04.0000] <Philip`>
Close enough

[09:20:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Almost all PHP is a mess though.

[09:20:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
:P

[09:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me looked at the IPB forum software once, after it got hacked, and saw a nice little bit of code where it sanitised an IP address and had at least two blatant bugs

[09:21:01.0000] <svl>
gsnedders|work: comments when displayed in the admin area allowed for xss. So either they stole the cookie at that point (most probable), or they redirected one of the people with access to a phishing site showing a login form.

[09:21:02.0000] <svl>
gsnedders|work: Almost all everything is a mess. :)

[09:21:03.0000] <Philip`>
(It was doing some substitution using an incorrect regexp, and then discarding the result anyway)

[09:22:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
svl: But if they stole the cookie that's useless once it times out

[09:22:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
And I doubt they're that quick

[09:23:00.0000] <svl>
gsnedders|work: I assume it'd be fully automated.

[09:23:01.0000] <svl>
This wasn't targetting whatwg specifically - just any wordpress blog that could be found

[09:23:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
svl: I guess. But how would it then change a theme?

[09:23:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
svl: I know, I've seen this before.

[09:23:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
svl: On WHATWG blog you can't change it in the admin panel as the web server doesn't have write access to the templates

[09:24:00.0000] <svl>
Ah. Then I don't know.

[09:24:01.0000] <svl>
I've only browsed casualyl over the information about this particular strain of attacks.

[09:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Set up Habari on blog2.whatwg.org and import the WP posts and then everybody should be happy to move :-)

[09:26:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: But I can't do that :P

[09:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Why not?

[09:27:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: How can I upload Habari? :P

[09:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Use a WP vulnerability to give yourself admin access to the machine

[09:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
or ask Hixie or whatever

[09:27:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
:D

[09:54:00.0000] <Darxus>
The http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq#ie Microsoft compatability recommendation (application/xml + XSLT) causes all browsers to parse the document as XML, make a copy with content-type text/html, and then parse it as html??

[09:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: Probably something crazy like that

[10:16:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: Thanks.  That is worse than just serving it all as text/html.  (While I'm still insisting on believing that serving as *xml is somehow better.)

[10:16:01.0000] <Darxus>
Well, worse than everything else you might do.

[10:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't understand what the code is actually doing, which seems like a good reason to simply serve HTML as text/html and not have to worry

[10:23:00.0000] <inimino>
that does seem quite a bit worse than just serving it as text/html

[10:23:01.0000] <inimino>
yuck

[10:24:00.0000] <Darxus>
Yeah.

[10:25:00.0000] <Darxus>
I strongly prefer serving MSIE agents text/html and everybody else application/xhtml+xml.

[10:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
thus making the page more fragile and less efficient for all non-IE users :-p

[10:26:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: I don't see how it's less efficient.

[10:26:01.0000] <Darxus>
And I think by "more fragile" you mean that it must always be well formed, I'm quite happy with that.

[10:26:02.0000] <Darxus>
And... I'm actually not giving IE users any advantage at all....

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: Until recently Firefox didn't even do incremental rendering for XHTML (while it did for HTML); I don't know what differences there are nowadays, but the HTML codepath is likely to have been much more heavily optimised

[10:31:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: So what's the reason for the xml variant of html5?

[10:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
Darxus, because there are a lot of people that want to use XHTML, and it does have some advantages over HTML, depending on the use case

[10:34:00.0000] <Darxus>
What advantages?

[10:34:01.0000] <Darxus>
Is this in the spec?

[10:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
particularly if you want to do a lot of mixed namespace stuff, like embed RDFa or XBL or some other language that isn't (or won't) be natively supported in HTML

[10:34:03.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: Being fragile hurts non-IE users because of things like http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/11/draconian

[10:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
it also has a lot of advantages as an authoring format, for use on the back end of a CMS, such as being able to integrate with XML tool chains more easily (though you can do that to some extent with HTML too)

[10:38:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: I am entirely comfortable with that situation.

[10:39:00.0000] <Darxus>
Woohoo!  http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/dxschema/output.txt    This is so unimpressive, but feels like an accomplishment to me.  Doing the most basic element nesting verification.  Haven't defined all elements yet.

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/dxschema/ - "XML parsing failed: syntax error (Line: 1, Character: 0)" - that's not very friendly :-(

[10:52:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: It is not yet intended for public consumption.

[10:52:01.0000] <Darxus>
It's just random notes, without a single bit of the required markup.

[10:53:00.0000] <Darxus>
Also not linked from anywhere.

[10:54:00.0000] <Darxus>
It's awesome that HTML5 says the value of the src attribute of the img element can be an svg.

[10:57:00.0000] <Darxus>
It requires an awful lot of reading to determin if there are any cases where an img is not required to have an alt attribute.

[10:59:00.0000] <Darxus>
Ugh, there is one.  I object.

[10:59:01.0000] <Darxus>
"Images whose contents are not known".  Not only is it okay for the alt to be empty, it may be omitted.

[11:00:00.0000] <Darxus>
"If an img element is being used for purposes other than showing an image, e.g. as part of a service to count page views"  That's pretty ridiculous to say without suggesting any alternatives.

[11:11:00.0000] <Darxus>
I've been waiting for the embed element for years.

[13:31:00.0000] <Darxus>
It is unfortunate that a canvas can't have resolution-independant dimensions.

[13:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
What do you mean by that?

[13:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can say e.g. <canvas width=300> and it'll be the same independent of the internal resolution

[13:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm not suggesting you're wrong, just that I don't understand exactly what you mean, and I don't like not understanding :-) )

[13:44:00.0000] <Darxus>
"Contexts in which this element may be used:

[13:44:01.0000] <Darxus>
Where embedded content is expected."

[13:44:02.0000] <Darxus>
Where is embeded content expected?  I can't find a definition.

[13:45:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: I want <canvas width="100%" height="100%">.

[13:45:01.0000] <Darxus>
However, I recognize that's... probably not going to happen in 5.0.

[13:47:00.0000] <Darxus>
I'm thinking it's expected anywhere phrasing content is, obviously with stated exceptions.

[13:52:00.0000] <Darxus>
03:54PM -!- Irssi: Pasting 498 lines to #whatwg. Press Ctrl-K if you wish to do this or Ctrl-C to cancel.

[13:52:01.0000] <Darxus>
Yay irssi.

[13:52:02.0000] <Darxus>
Boo chrome alpha (but it's okay because it's an alpha).

[13:52:03.0000] <Darxus>
Here we go:  "As a general rule, elements whose content model allows any flow content should have either at least one descendant text node that is not inter-element whitespace, or at least one descendant element node that is embedded content."

[13:55:00.0000] <Darxus>
Embedded content is allowed in both phrasing and flow content.

[13:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: What would the canvas do when you resize the page?

[13:57:01.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: Change size.

[13:57:02.0000] <Darxus>
I understand that it would be more difficult to impliment, which is why I don't expect 

[13:58:00.0000] <Darxus>
it in 5.0.

[13:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you want it to stretch the existing pixels, you could do <canvas width="500" height="500" style="width: 100%; height: 100%">

[13:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
(or whatever the appropriate CSS is)

[13:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
and it'll be equivalent to a 500*n by 500*n image being scaled to 100%

[13:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(where n is typically 1, but might be higher on high-res displays)

[14:00:00.0000] <Darxus>
Yes, but I don't want to do that.

[14:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
woo

[14:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[14:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
people can now file a bug from within the spec itself

[14:00:04.0000] <Darxus>
I can zoom in and out of a playing youtube video in firefox, scaling the content of a canvas should be... doable.

[14:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: What do we do if there's a bug in the code that files bugs?

[14:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
tell me

[14:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, that's much less exciting than the infinite series of automatic bug filing mechanisms I was imagining

[14:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[14:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, Gmail moved a message from Google into the spam folder

[14:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would have thought they'd have exceptions to avoid that kind of thing

[14:27:00.0000] <annevk4>
I once got a recruiter email from Google and it had "(THIS IS NOT SPAM)" or some such in the subject line :)

[14:28:00.0000] <Darxus>
Um.  Are there any HTML5/XML pages other than the one I made?

[14:31:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
annevk4: There was some talk a while back about removing getOverrideStyle and standardizing runtimeStyle. What ever happened to that? Died out?

[14:32:00.0000] <annevk4>
I decided I did not have the time to actually work on the full CSSOM

[14:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/07/microsoft-caves-to-eu-pressure-will-offer-browser-ballot.ars

[14:32:02.0000] <annevk4>
I thought it was much simpler than it actually is

[14:33:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
I see. Yea, and it does have quite a few problems.

[14:34:00.0000] <annevk4>
the CSSOM is vastly underdefined yes :(

It's interesting that both head and body tags may be omitted.

[16:07:00.0000] <deltab>
yes, only <title> and </title> are required by HTML 4

[16:07:01.0000] <Darxus>
Oh, wow, I didn't realize this was the case in 4 as well.

[16:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thought the body element was required in HTML 4 too, although the tags can be omitted

[16:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: html, head, and body have always been omittable tags.

[16:08:01.0000] <Darxus>
Wow.

[16:08:02.0000] <deltab>
tbody too

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
we didn't add any new omittable tags except </rt> and </rp> iirc

[16:09:01.0000] <tantek>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"><title>hello world</title><p>This is a really simple valid HTML 4.01 document</p>

there's some spam hidden at the bottom of http://blog.whatwg.org/quality-assurance-tools-for-html5

[16:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
We know.

[16:17:00.0000] <Darxus>
Can those tags be omitted in xhtml too?

[16:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No

[16:18:01.0000] <Darxus>
Okay, thanks.

[16:18:02.0000] <Darxus>
Was hard to tell from the doc.

[16:29:00.0000] <deltab>
xml doesn't allow any tags to be omitted

[16:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
So I'm not allowed to write <p>Hello</p> in XML, because I've omitted the <i> tags and <b> tags etc? :-)

[16:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But there's an infinite number of possible tags!

[16:31:02.0000] <deltab>
you don't have any b or i elements there, so you don't need their tags

[16:31:03.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose the accurate thing to say is that XML will not create any elements unless you explicitly give their tags

[16:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
deltab: Then that's "any tags for whose elements exist", not "any tags"

[16:32:01.0000] <deltab>
if you have an element, you must have either a start tag and an end tag, or an empty-element tag

[16:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
deltab: Both myself and Philip` are well aware of this.

[16:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
XHTML makes it more fun because you can omit the <tbody>/</tbody> tags

[16:32:04.0000] <deltab>
I should hope so :-) it's for darxus

[16:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And then get something which you can't serialize in HTML!

[16:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which also omits the corresponding element, as a side effect)

[16:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
so the concept of "omit" gets a little bit fuzzy when comparing HTML and XHTML


2009-07-25
[23:55:00.0000] <Darxus>
I don't like the two syntaxes being referred to as HTML5 and XHTML5.  It makes it completely unclear whether I'm talking about the full HTML5 spec, or the html syntax of it.  I prefer HTML5/HTML / HTML5/XML.

[23:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
just call them "XHTML5" and "text/html"

[23:57:00.0000] <Darxus>
No :P

[01:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Call them "a" and "b"

[02:01:00.0000] <ray>
anything but slashes, please

[02:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me gives ray some parentheses

[02:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
these ok?

[02:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
gotta love how the ap press release uses the word "microformat" to describe what they're going to do

[02:27:00.0000] <olliej>
yo gsnedders 

[02:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, where is the AP press release you're referring to?

[02:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pressreleases/pr_072309a.html

[02:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why is "microformat" inappropriate?

[02:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.ap.org/media/images/APnewsregistry.jpg mentions hNews which is http://www.valueaddednews.org/technical/techspec which is seemingly intended as a microformat

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
read the first paragraph of that page

[02:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
"It is not a formal microformat specification. It is intended that this draft specification will enter the microformats process, but in the meantime it should be considered a poshformat."

[02:47:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - yes - that shows a considerable amount of knowledge/sensitivity to the microformats process.

[02:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
the valueaddednews.org page does, indeed

[02:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
the ap press release, not so much

[02:47:03.0000] <tantek>
press releases typically are not particularly good with details

[02:48:00.0000] <tantek>
Mark Ng who worked on the hNews brainstorm is going to be at microformatsDevCamp this weekend btw. http://tr.im/ufCE

[02:50:00.0000] <tantek>
the features in  hNews brainstorm will be considered for hAtom 0.2

[02:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand how they expect to use a microformat to protect anything

[02:51:01.0000] <tantek>
Lachy - I'm not sure about any kind of "protection" in that context either, but I do think if an organization wants to pursue better semantic markup, that's a good thing.

[02:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
unless they also intend to get some government regulation to force software to implement it and impose restrictions somehow

[02:53:00.0000] <tantek>
I think some of this work may also help drive the completion of the licensing microformat that is in development, which allows licensing specific portions of content via links (similar to rel-license).

[02:54:00.0000] <tantek>
As I mentioned to Hixie earlier in this channel (days ago?) it's likely to be fairly straightforward, similar to the licensing predefined vocab, without any of the undesirable combinatorial complexity of the ccREL schema/model.

[02:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.ap.org/media/images/APnewsregistry.jpg - there's apparently also some tracking beacon. Not sure how that could possibly work in practice

[02:56:00.0000] <tantek>
I don't know of any beacon in the hNews brainstorm and I don't understand how it's supposed to work so I'm not going to speculate on that. The beacon mentioned does not seem to have anything to do with semantic markup.

[02:56:01.0000] <tantek>
(so it doesn't seem worth worrying about vis-a-vis evaluating the hNews brainstorm)

[02:57:00.0000] <tantek>
I'm not sure how (from that jpg) '"the sends signals back to the news registry" - e.g. signals using what protocols etc.

[02:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I guess we'll have to wait for more technical details to arise

[02:59:00.0000] <tantek>
well, as I said, due to the apparent orthogonality of the technologies, I'm going to move forward with evaluating hNews on its own semantic markup merits, regardless of any protocol layer changes that related proposals may seek, and leave those to other technical discussions.

[02:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
<img src="http://tracking.ap.org/?article=412385" alt=""> - easy :-)

[03:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, the tracking beacon is somehow supposed to track reuse of the content, so they must be assuming that whatever they include will somehow also be copied along with their content

[03:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
which is a flawed assumption

[03:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
unless they only care about services that syndicate their entire rss/atom feed verbatim

[04:03:00.0000] <shepazu>
it's going to use @ping :)

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder why http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2009Jul/0197.html was sent in a member-only forum given the public nature of the referenced group

[05:22:00.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: tricky

[05:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: Hmm, looking at the German GP free practice times I guess they aren't

[05:23:01.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: i'd like to know the amount of fuel in in hamilton's car

[05:23:02.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: the mp4-24 is vastly improved now

[05:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: I'm guessing nothing. To be top of the times at free practice for two races in a row and not have very good race perf. still…

[05:24:01.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: hamiltons times in germany were screwed by a flat in the first corner

[05:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
heh. Reminds me of Schumacher's final race

[05:24:03.0000] <olliej>
i missed that :-(

[05:24:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(and _that_ was an impressive drive by him)

[05:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I think it was on a restart after SC on about lap 3, him and Fisi came together, giving him a flat

[05:25:01.0000] <olliej>
bugger

[05:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
So, one whole very slow lap round Interlagos, and long pit stop, put him around 70 seconds down from Massa, in the lead

[05:25:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(a lap is around 83 seconds)

[05:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
He came fouth.

[05:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*forth

[05:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(70 seconds down and last)

[05:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: Oh, it was on lap 8

[05:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(of 71)

[05:34:00.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: err

[05:34:01.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: did you just incorrect your spelling?

[05:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
No, both were wrong

[05:34:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*fourth

[05:34:04.0000] <gsnedders>
But forth is at least a word, unlike fouth :P

[05:35:00.0000] <olliej>
heh

[05:35:01.0000] <olliej>
fail :D

[05:36:00.0000] <svl>
Couldn't you as author of the original word just normatively declare it to be equal to "fourth"?

[05:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
In that case I, as the reader of the word, will normatively declare it to be interpreted as "seventh"

[05:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
fouth son of a fouth son?

[05:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes, who turns out to actually be a daughter, causing all sorts of confusion

[05:43:00.0000] <olliej>
clearly we need a committee and working group to define an acceptable definition of fouth

[05:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: a public or private WG?

[05:44:00.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: it needs to be public

[05:44:01.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: so we can get input from the wider web community

[05:49:00.0000] <svl>
Shouldn't we reach out to established experts on all things fouth?

[05:50:00.0000] <olliej>
indeed we should

Ah, we need to get Tom Kuhns involved then.

[08:48:00.0000] <Darxus>
"Note: The Adobe SVG Viewer recommends that you use the EMBED tag when embedding SVG in HTML pages! However, if you want to create valid XHTML, you cannot use <embed> - The <embed> tag is not listed in any HTML specification." - http://www.w3schools.com/svg/svg_inhtml.asp  it would be nice to get HTML5 mentioned in that paragraph.

[08:58:00.0000] <poe>
Darxus: I find that w3schools is quite unreliable in general.

[09:09:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I prefer just going to specs myself these days

[09:09:01.0000] <jcranmer>
MDC is helpful sometimes, though

[09:09:02.0000] <jcranmer>
I forgot that XSLT has some functions that XPath doesn't have

[09:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
HTML5 is acutally a pretty good reference for a lot of stuf

[09:21:00.0000] <annevk4>
if you read spec :)

[11:47:00.0000] <Darxus>
The spec is kind of hard to read if you're not trying to find full browser implimentation details.

[11:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: See alternate style sheets

[11:49:00.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders: I do not understand.  I wasn't actually complaining about the spec, just responding to takkaria / annevk2.

[11:50:00.0000] <Darxus>
Validators happen, browser implimentors clearly need more help :)

[11:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's still true and makes it easier to read

[11:51:00.0000] <Darxus>
What's true?

[11:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: Everything that's not false

[11:52:01.0000] <takkaria>
Darxus: if you're actually coding javascript, though, you need implementation details to make sure your code works right

[11:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
unless you're a constructivist, I suppose

[11:52:03.0000] <takkaria>
Philip`: hm, constructionism

[11:52:04.0000] <takkaria>
d'oh

[11:52:05.0000] <inimino>
Darxus: there is an 'author view' style sheet that hides some parts of the spec

[11:53:00.0000] <Darxus>
inimino: I have not noticed that.

[11:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blinks

[11:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ChrisWilson? In #whatwg? What's the world coming to?

[11:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: What about things that cannot be proven, and hence are neither true nor false?

[11:55:00.0000] <inimino>
things that cannot be proven are neither true nor false?

[11:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think it depends on whether you believe in the law of the excluded middle

[11:55:02.0000] <Darxus>
Nothing can be proven, not even your own existence.

[11:55:03.0000] <inimino>
I don't think so

[11:56:00.0000] <inimino>
lots of things that are either true or false cannot be /proven/

[11:56:01.0000] <Darxus>
I'm lacking motivation to do the validation steps after basic nesting :/

[11:56:02.0000] <inimino>
for example, every historical fact

[11:56:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me was replying mostly to gsnedders

[11:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me only cares about cares about real proof, like in maths, not about anything fuzzy like history :-p

[11:59:00.0000] <Darxus>
I figure valadation works out to:  basic nesting, conditional nesting (including sequence / required elements), and value type enforcement.

[11:59:01.0000] <Darxus>
Sounds pretty simple.  Still.

[11:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
and many people consider it axiomatic that everything is either true or false, in which case the things gsnedders asked about don't exist

[11:59:03.0000] <Darxus>
I hate the word "maths".

[12:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(regardless of whether everything can be proved)

[12:01:00.0000] <inimino>
Philip`: ah, but "things that cannot be proven" is what gsnedders asked about

[12:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
inimino: It is still possible that those things are either true or false

[12:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
inimino: It's just we can't prove it

[12:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
inimino: They are a subset of things, and if all things are either true or false, then the things in the subset are too

[12:02:03.0000] <inimino>
gsnedders: agreed

[12:03:00.0000] <inimino>
Philip`: yes, surely

[12:05:00.0000] <inimino>
(I think most people will agree that "colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is neither true nor false, though)

[12:07:00.0000] <Darxus>
inimino: Did you just make that quote up?

[12:08:00.0000] <inimino>
Darxus: no, it's from Chomsky

[12:08:01.0000] <Darxus>
Good.

[12:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me only cares about proper stuff like maths, so he's not interested in sleeping ideas unless they're expressed in formal logic :-p

[12:08:03.0000] <Darxus>
I still hate the word "maths".

[12:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
What word would you prefer?

[12:11:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: "math".

[12:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: Urgh

[12:13:00.0000] <takkaria>
bloody americans

[12:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But mathematics is plural, so why should the abbreviation be singular?

[12:13:02.0000] <takkaria>
(scare quotes implied)

[12:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me heads off

[12:14:00.0000] <Darxus>
Does the "s" in "mathematics" actually imply plural?

[12:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a mass noun

[12:15:01.0000] <Darxus>
I don't know what a mass noun is.

[12:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's like "kilogram"

[12:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
LOL

[12:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
A mass noun is uncoutable

[12:16:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*uncountable

[12:16:04.0000] <inimino>
it's like "water" or "sand"

[12:16:05.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders: So the "s" doesn't imply plural?

[12:17:00.0000] <inimino>
you don't have waters or sands, (except poetically)

[12:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: correct

[12:17:02.0000] <Darxus>
Sweet.  I am victorious.

[12:18:00.0000] <inimino>
/me notes that the topic goes double if people are going to try to reason about English

[12:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
heh

[12:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
"Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks!

[12:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Even without a sense of logic we can still apply reasoning rules mechanically

[12:34:00.0000] <Darxus>
"Element h1 is not allowed in element body (note: schema is not yet completed)."  Heh.

[13:12:00.0000] <Darxus>
Checking attribute values against a perl regex now works.

[16:19:00.0000] <Darxus>
Woohoo "Element table is not allowed in element h1 (note: schema is not yet completed)."

[16:30:00.0000] <Darxus>
Oh I guess that was already done.


2009-07-26
[17:35:00.0000] <Darxus>
Is there any other markup language that has anything equivalent to an html table's ability to have overlapping cells?

[17:36:00.0000] <Darxus>
..which I should consider while writing a schema language that can specify that a table should not have overlapping cells?

[17:51:00.0000] <Darxus>
Or can you think of a case where anyone would be likely to create a markup language with a structure different from:  All cells are in rows, all rows must be the same width, all columns must be the same height, and there must be no overlapping cells?

[17:51:01.0000] <Darxus>
I realize cells could be contained in columns instead... do you think that will ever happen?

[18:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Darxus: Have you ever used GridBagLayout?

[18:51:00.0000] <Darxus>
Dashiva: No.

[18:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
Darxus: hmm

[18:52:01.0000] <takkaria>
well, someone might write a markup language where you had to lay out the table both in columns and rows separately

[18:52:02.0000] <takkaria>
and if the two don't match up, it's an error

[19:01:00.0000] <Darxus>
Heh.

[19:18:00.0000] <deltab>
Darxus: Microsoft Excel has the ability to merge (span) cells; other spreadsheet formats likely have the same ability

[19:20:00.0000] <deltab>
so OOXML and ODF

[19:20:01.0000] <deltab>
oh, *overlapping*?

[19:20:02.0000] <deltab>
that is, two cells that actually cover the same area?

[19:50:00.0000] <Darxus>
deltab: http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/dxschema/tests/invalidtable.html

[19:51:00.0000] <deltab>
ah, not that I know of

[19:53:00.0000] <Darxus>
deltab: Just looking for stuff I might want to be able to validate.  I think I've decided to not worry about it.

MikeSmith: why .../markup-spec/ and .../markup/? what's the difference?

[21:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I don't know what markup-spec is

[21:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in dev.w3.org?

/me looks

[21:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, between the media thing from philipj earlier and this navigation thing from bz, i'm getting no peace in terms of dealing with the simple stuff today

[21:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
those are like 2 of the most complex algorithms in the spec, and both pieces of feedback are basically "there's this minor edge case that affects everything that you got wrong"

[21:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: you should just do what most other standards editors do, hide your head in the sand and don't admit those cases actually even exist

[21:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
boy would that be nice

[21:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
actually this fragment id thing might not be as bad as i feared

[21:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
(the one i checked in earlier for media selection was a bitch, i'm sure i made mistakes in changing it)

[21:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's the thing -- just like product dev: You make a fix in one place, risks introducing regressions elsewhere

[21:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah. i hate it when people say "oh i'm not asking for any normative changes, i would just like you to change your use of the word "foo" for the word "bar" everywhere"

[21:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
how about... no

[21:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
house of cards

[21:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
man, I really don't know what I did to bring http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup-spec/ into existence. it's not in CVS. must be some apache redirect I set up and forgot about

[21:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[21:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's a different date

[21:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll get it figured out

[21:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
by the way:

[21:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
about comments saying there's no easy way to get a view of maturity levels of different parts of the spec

[21:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's something DanC set up a long time back

[21:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I made some tweaks to it yesterday

[21:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
neat

[21:50:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's generated from the annotations db

[21:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
it uses the live data? sweet

[21:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
we should link to it from somewhere

[21:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[21:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
man i need to update the data on some of these

[21:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
this is good, cos it shows an overview

[21:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
would be nice to make it editable, if you have a spare 2 days :-D

[21:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I may have some time to mess around with it. I'm supposed to be on vacation for the next couple of weeks

[22:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, there really isn't anything interesting in tv shows these days

[22:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wish BBC and C4 were on iTunes in the US

[22:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
BBC America is months behind and has the worst selection

[22:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
would imagine you could get DVDs at least

[22:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
DVDs aren't instant-play, and are region-locked, and aren't out yet for shows that are playing now anyway

[22:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
i want to see today's Have I Got News For You, e.g.

[22:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
or Top Gear

[22:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
or Channel 4 News

[22:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
and why is TNG not on iTunes? And why do the DVDs cost such an absurd fortune?

[22:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me adds Red Dwarf to the list of BBC shows he wishes were on US iTunes

[22:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's so sad that I could probably get a better experience if i used bittorrent

[22:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[22:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, how hard can it possibly be to take my money?

[22:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was tempted to watch the last season of BSG, but $60?! for a DRM'ed download? are you kidding me?

[22:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
and charging $2 for 15 minutes of daily show when i can see it with ads on the comedy central site is ridiculous

[22:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
$0.50, ok

[22:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
$2?!

[22:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey, people pay $3 for ringtones. or pay ridiculous per-message fees for SMS that have no relationship to the actual costs

[22:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't

[22:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in Japan, we deal with the SMS cost thing just by not having SMS

[22:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
the SMS thing is so absurd as to be laughable

[22:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, massive boondoggle

[22:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
and charging more for cropping a track than you paid for the track in the first place?

[22:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, hello?

[22:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
I ALREADY OWN THE MUSIC

[22:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
you don't need to charge me to allow the file to be used in another app

[22:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I had figured that most content providers would have gotten past their greed and ass-backwardness by now and figured out they could be making a lot more money by pricing content reasonably and making it easier for people to get.

[22:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I'm wondering if they will ever actually wise up

[22:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm really shocked that basically nobody in the TV industry has yet wised up to this stuff

[22:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, national boundaries are obsolete

[22:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
why are we still doing things by country

[22:59:00.0000] <hober>
Maybe in 2022 you'll have time to spec Westphalia5

[23:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: the status indicators on http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/toc-status.html are now edit links

[23:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the ADD ones don't work yet; "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'appendChild' of null"

[23:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I assume because the script in the edit-section.html page isn't designed to be called this way

[23:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems to work OK for existing annotations, except that the edit-section.html page doesn't give any visual indication after you click Save

[23:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess it could redirect to the referring page

[23:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, maybe not best to be using it this way

[23:23:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
was just trying the quick-and-dirty approach first

[23:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: do you have the API for status.cgi documented?

[23:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wondering what the possible values for action are

[23:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
other than action=get-all-annotations

[23:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nm

[23:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>

[17:34:00.0000] <webben>

[18:55:00.0000] <Darxus>
I added Hixie's color.html demo to my main page (http://www.chaosreigns.com/), changed the background to white.  When filling the area with rgb(255,255,255,0.5) it is clearly convinced that the page background is light grey, but it's white.

[18:57:00.0000] <Darxus>
Specifying the background color as an attribute of the canvas entity didn't help.

[19:03:00.0000] <Darxus>
Ah, it's a bug in chrome 2.0.172.37, not shared by firefox 3.5.1.

[01:37:00.0000] <gavin_>
Hixie: "disabilities" probably wouldn't be called that if they affected the majority of the population

[01:37:01.0000] <gavin_>
for example, few people would say that not having 4 arms is a disability

[01:38:00.0000] <gavin_>
(not that this actually matters to any of the arguments being made, I just wanted to nitpick)

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
if there was some pandemic that caused everyone to go blind

[01:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
would you say being blind would stop being a disability?

[01:42:01.0000] <gavin_>
people would stop referring to it as such, in practic

[01:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt it

[01:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
especially if the next generation had sight

[01:43:00.0000] <gavin_>
well, sure, that'd muddy the waters a bit :)

[01:44:00.0000] <gavin_>
I agree that strictly speaking, not having four arms would arguably be considered a disability

[01:44:01.0000] <gavin_>
but people in practice treat "things we are not expected to have" differently than "things we are expected to have but don't"

[01:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think that not having four arms is a disability

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think that not having sight is a disability

[01:45:01.0000] <gavin_>
maybe that's a bad example - it's not obviously a good thing

[01:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
(in fact i think that _having_ four arms would be a disability)

[01:45:03.0000] <gavin_>
how about not having eyes on the back of your head? :)

[01:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
that would be a disability, of a kind, sure

[01:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't think that's really relevant

[01:47:02.0000] <gavin_>
I don't either!

[01:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
gavin_, the difference is that humans have adapted to the senses and limbs that we do have. The equipment we use that depends on 4 arms is designed for 2 people (usually), we have mirrors to compensate for the lack of eyes on the back of our heads

[01:49:00.0000] <gavin_>
Lachy: I don't think any of that is relevant to the (trivial) nit I was picking

[01:49:01.0000] <gavin_>
I was just trying to say that I understand John's reasoning behind "affecting a minority" being part of "disability"'s definition

[01:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
gavin_, I'm not sure what the nit was that you're picking. I haven't read my mail yet this morning

[01:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think the pandemic example is a clear counterexample of that

[01:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
and more specifically, the definition of disability doesn't say "minority" anywhere

[01:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
in other news, why are my speakers popping every few hours

[01:50:04.0000] <gavin_>
right, that's different because there is an alternate default state that we are familiar with

[01:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
this is a new class of interference

[02:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
I really don't understand the desire to have a distributed source control system like git to allow anyone to be an editor.  No other specification in W3C's history has been edited like that, and I'm not sure how it would ultimately work.

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk4>
/me decided to not partake in that discussion relatively early on

[02:21:01.0000] <olliej>
Lachy: people like to think that spec development is like software dev

[02:22:00.0000] <olliej>
Lachy: eg. that there are typically multiple "ok" solutions

[02:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I'm not going to post in that thread either. Just trying to understand what they're asking for and why

[02:24:00.0000] <heycam>
i made an attempt to make it easier to produce a "fork" of ian's document http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2009Jul/0147.html but i don't know if anyone took it up

[02:24:01.0000] <gavin_>
olliej: you don't think it's possible for there to be more than one "ok" HTML 5 spec?

[02:24:02.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: no

[02:25:00.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: the idea of spec forking defies the reason for a spec

[02:25:01.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: but the particular problem is that we don't want "ok" we want "good"

[02:25:02.0000] <gavin_>
oh, you mean that you don't think it's possible for two versinos to coexist usefully

[02:25:03.0000] <gavin_>
?

[02:25:04.0000] <heycam>
it might be ok before Rec for more than one to exist

[02:26:00.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: when writing software you can easily come up with multiple solutions to a problem, some of which may be substantially worse than others

[02:26:01.0000] <heycam>
i wouldn't want multiple to exist later, being normative on the same stuff

[02:26:02.0000] <gavin_>
heycam: right, I agree that that would be undesirable

[02:26:03.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: and you have pet features, etc

[02:26:04.0000] <gavin_>
but it's not so clear to me that there's "One True Spec" and that all variations are errors

[02:26:05.0000] <gavin_>
but maybe I'm misinterpreting what olliej means

[02:27:00.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: whereas a spec needs to be well thought out, and it's very difficult to compensate for "design" errors after the fact

[02:27:01.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: people want to be able to write some portion of the spec that they like and then just have it merged into the spec (a la a standard softwre patch)

[02:27:02.0000] <olliej>
gavand that just doesn't make seense for most people

[02:28:00.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: as they don't have sufficient knowledge to make a meaningful direct contribution like that

[02:28:01.0000] <gavin_>
I don't think it's true that hixie is the only person with enough relevant knowledge to be able to author text in HTML 5

[02:29:00.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: he doesn't "just author the spec" 

[02:29:01.0000] <gavin_>
I'm not claiming that he's "just an author" or that writing is all there is to it

[02:29:02.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: what people want with their distributed spec dev is to just write arbitrary changes and have hixie pik it up

[02:29:03.0000] <olliej>
and hixie doesn't do that very much himself even

[02:29:04.0000] <olliej>
we argue about what it hsould be in mailing list

[02:30:00.0000] <gavin_>
er, I hadn't seen anyone suggest that it would be "like open-source, but without review!"

[02:30:01.0000] <heycam>
btw i like recently how it's fashionable to call it "ian's draft" rather than "the spec"

[02:30:02.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: the vast majority of people cannot write spec level text

[02:30:03.0000] <gavin_>
sure, the vast majority of people can't write c++ code either

[02:31:00.0000] <gavin_>
that's why mozilla has a review process!

[02:31:01.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: anything that was in some magicaly distributed repository would likely need to be rewritten by whoever wanted to merge it

[02:31:02.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: *sigh*

[02:31:03.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: writing software is less rigorous than writing the spec in many many regards

[02:31:04.0000] <gavin_>
I think Manu's main goal is to make it easier to suggest different text/ideas

[02:32:00.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: email works fine for that

[02:32:01.0000] <gavin_>
I don't think he's trying to make it so that all of those would be "automatically" merged together just because someone bothered to make them

[02:32:02.0000] <olliej>
gavin_: lots of random repositories scattered around the web seems the opposite of that

[02:32:03.0000] <gavin_>
Manu disagrees

[02:32:04.0000] <gavin_>
and I think he has a point

[02:33:00.0000] <gavin_>
(with the "email works fine for that", part, to be clear)

[02:37:00.0000] <gavin_>
in the abstract, at least - I agree with Maciej's post about the most valuable process-change contributions coming from people who've put effort into actually contributing using the old process

[02:39:00.0000] <gavin_>
I suppose "email isn't good enough for large-scale changes" is mostly a theoretical argument until someone has such changes to suggest

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
what could possibly be large-scale enough that it couldn't fit in e-mail

[02:40:01.0000] <gavin_>
(I don't really know whether Manu does or not)

[02:41:00.0000] <gavin_>
Hixie: well, once you pass a certain threshold, just exchanging diffs becomes troublesome

[02:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's no reason to propose diffs

[02:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
proposing spec text is a terrible way to contribute to spec development, in my experience

[02:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
because unless you're truly familiar with the spec, you'll miss all kinds of things

[02:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
best to propose use cases, requirements

[02:42:01.0000] <gavin_>
well, it's what sam has been suggesting lately

[02:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[02:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
can't say i really agree with him

[02:44:00.0000] <gavin_>
it may be an effective way to settle some of the recurring disputes

[02:44:01.0000] <gavin_>
multiple concrete proposals and a vote

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
we should resolve recurring debates by determining the best technical solution, not via votes, imho

[02:45:01.0000] <gavin_>
I agree

[02:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
We should vote on what we consider the best technical solution

[02:45:03.0000] <gavin_>
I don't expect you to be swayed by a vote

[02:46:00.0000] <gavin_>
but perhaps others will

[02:46:01.0000] <gavin_>
(the dissenters)

[02:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt it

[02:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
but i guess it depends on who you're talking about and what topic you mean

[02:46:04.0000] <gavin_>
a lot of people seem to care a lot about The Process

[02:47:00.0000] <gavin_>
and it gives a lot of strength to votes, doesn't it?

[02:47:01.0000] <annevk4>
after consensus

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
The Process varies depending on whether you're talking about the w3c as written, the w3c as practiced, or the whatwg.

[02:48:01.0000] <gavin_>
I was referring to the W3C's Process

[02:48:02.0000] <gavin_>
I know the whatwg process doesn't give votes much weight :)

[03:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hey the spec comment box is more convenient than irc!

[03:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
sweet, i finally found a way to stop you from mentioning typos on irc :-D

[03:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
:)

[03:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, typo: "i finally" --> "I finally" :-)

[03:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have "text-transform: lowercase" set on any line that only has one sentence

[03:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
If that was the case, you would have said ":-d"

[03:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
my renderer is buggy?

[03:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: maybe you should say somewhere in the spec UI that the IP will be publicly logged

[03:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
done

[04:41:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Wow. WHATWG and public-html have been busy over the weekend.

[05:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, could you add some sort of Advanced button to the spec's inline bug reporting feature that, instead of simply submitting an anonymous bug, forwards the user to bugzilla template with the comment prefilled

[05:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
that would allow the reporter to specify additional details, and have it not be anonymous, while still retaining most of the convenience of inline bug reporting

[05:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
It would also be useful if you could set the subject to something more useful than duplicating the bug summary, like using the section's heading from the spec

[05:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
actually, it should probably just open bugzilla within an iframe (styled with position: fixed;) so the user isn't taken away from the spec entirely

[06:47:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me wonders why he's now listening to songs in French

[06:47:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
It must be that damn Swiss guy!

[06:47:02.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders|work: hello

[06:47:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
eighty4: hi

[06:47:04.0000] <eighty4>
french rap is said to be the best rap

[06:47:05.0000] <eighty4>
so nothing wrong with french songs

[06:47:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
rap--

[06:47:07.0000] <eighty4>
yell yes

[06:48:00.0000] <eighty4>
but if they're good at that they might be good at other music

[06:50:00.0000] <eighty4>
if one wants multiple articles on a page what should one wrap those with?

[06:51:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Each article should be one <article>

[06:52:00.0000] <eighty4>
yes, but if one want's to wrap them with something

[06:52:01.0000] <eighty4>
like <div><article/><article/></div>

[06:52:02.0000] <eighty4>
what should one use instead of <div> in that situatioN?

[06:52:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
eighty4: Just div or body or something I guess

[06:52:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
eighty4: Unless you want it to be an actual section, with a heading, in the document.

[06:53:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders|work: could I PM a link?

[06:53:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Sure

[06:54:00.0000] <eighty4>
seemed that was missusing <article> and <section> imo

[06:54:01.0000] <eighty4>
or is it an ok use of it?

[06:54:02.0000] <eighty4>
oh... I have to run :(

[06:54:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Each post should be an article, and just use a div as a container

[06:55:00.0000] <eighty4>
so no <articles> exist then :)

[06:55:01.0000] <eighty4>
but now I have to run

[06:55:02.0000] <eighty4>
later

[08:53:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: yt?

[09:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Whoops, I replied to a thread and completely forgot that I'd already replied to it a few weeks earlier :-(

[15:08:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: That didn't work.  I did a fillRect on the canvas first, and it still turned grey.  Tested it by starting it as a different color, and it still turned grey.

[15:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
today we're at 1123

[15:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wow, going up quite quickly then?

[15:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently

[15:40:00.0000] <tantek>

[15:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
heh

[15:41:00.0000] <Darxus>
Cool.

[15:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So would the next step in the sequence be 1235 or 11235?

[15:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think the next would be 1124, actually

[16:01:00.0000] <Darxus>
CSS handling between just chrome, firefox 3.5, and opera mobile is amaizingly inconsistent.

[16:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
woo, the ietf finally decided to accept the updated websocket i-d

[16:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess their meeting of no productivity must be over

[16:03:00.0000] <Darxus>
Congratulations.

[16:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
why congratulations?

[16:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's an automated system, they just had it disabled while they were meeting

[16:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
lest anyone actually do anything useful

[16:05:00.0000] <Darxus>
Ah, I see.

[16:27:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: do IETF websocket draft diffs go anywhere, similar to http://twitter.com/WHATWG ?

[16:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
they in fact go to http://twitter.com/WHATWG

[16:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. http://twitter.com/WHATWG/status/2506761249

[16:32:00.0000] <tfh>
Hixie: would me creating an early Perl client/server websocket implementation be any help? I was thinking building a prototype would help flush out any ambiguities/problems in the spec

[16:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[16:32:02.0000] <tfh>
okay :) 

[16:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
what would be especially useful is finding out how websocket works with proxies

[16:36:00.0000] <tfh>
I guess it might be thwarted a bit if proxies insist on buffering responses or similar, hm

Hmm... curious. So it looks like a numeric entity for \r shows up as \r

SetEnv no-gzip 1

or anyone familiar with the Web Databases spec?

[06:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
in the executeSql() method, I can't tell what is supposed to happen when the SQL statemen† contains fewer question marks than there are items in the arguments array.

[06:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
e..g transaction.executeSql("INSERT INTO t(id, label) VALUES (?, ?)", [2, "Two", "foo"], statementCallback, errorCallback);

[07:07:03.0000] <Philip`>

hi

[08:58:00.0000] <palimpsest>
i'm trying to parse a page that has a very, very deep tag tree

[08:59:00.0000] <palimpsest>
the parser.parse(document) call takes at least two minutes and maxes out my CPU

[08:59:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
With what tree builder?

[08:59:02.0000] <palimpsest>
BeautifulSoup

[08:59:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That may well be the problem there.

[08:59:04.0000] <palimpsest>
hm

[09:00:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Try using cElementTree or lxml instead, and see how quick it is to parse

[09:00:01.0000] <palimpsest>
ok

[09:00:02.0000] <palimpsest>
is there a way to limit the depth of the constructed tree?

[09:01:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
No

[09:02:00.0000] <palimpsest>
ok, thanks

[09:06:00.0000] <palimpsest>
any idea what it is about BeautifulSoup that's causing the problem?

[09:06:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
No idea, it's a blind guess. But BeautifulSoup does generally suck.

[09:06:02.0000] <palimpsest>
there's existing code for traversing a BeautifulSoup tree I'd prefer to avoid rewriting

[09:06:03.0000] <palimpsest>
any way to convert between tree types?

[09:07:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Converting won't help, as you'll still have to build the BS one

[09:07:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(And the answer is no anyway)

[09:08:00.0000] <palimpsest>
sigh, k, thanks

[09:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't know why the BS treebuilder would take an unusually long time with deep trees, but hasn't looked at the code enough to know if it's plausible that it's its fault

[09:08:02.0000] <palimpsest>
the other parsers do seem to be much faster

is the page

[09:09:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
heh. predicable. BS sucks.

[09:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
It might just be that the html5lib code that uses BS is broken, rather than being entirely BS's fault

[09:09:02.0000] <palimpsest>
oh, i was having the same problem with BeautifulSoup on it's own

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[09:10:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: I think our BS code is more or less fine, minus bugs caused by working around BS bugs

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: I wrote some of our BS code, so I don't necessarily agree it's fine :-)

[09:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it passed more tests than before I wrote that code

[09:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
which was good enough for me

[09:12:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Wow. That's a lot of nested font elements.

[09:12:01.0000] <palimpsest>
yeah.

[09:13:00.0000] <palimpsest>
i don't really care about them, i just don't want to get stuck parsing the page

[09:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
I like the bit where it goes </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4><P></P><P></P></FONT><!-- End Description --></FONT><FONT size=4><FONT size=5></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

[09:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Of course the real problem is that it doesn't quote its attributes

[09:16:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Yeah, if it did that, we could parse it in no time.

i tried preprocessing it with http://countergram.com/software/pytidylib (which was also not fast, but better) but it didn't help

[15:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, I believe the old algorithm also changed UTF-16 to UTF-8

[15:38:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, that also seems gone

[15:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
don't tell me, tell them

[15:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
I actually did; I wasn't sure whether you were trying to be exhaustive

[15:41:00.0000] <annevk2>
(I wasn't, FWIW, but I did catch that)

[15:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[15:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: yt?

[15:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: is there a way to override the class name of an interface? I have two HTMLCollection interfaces that are different but apparently need to both be HTMLCollection objects.

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what should happen if you override HTMLCollection itself

[15:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
can't the implementation of the interface be different?

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
the interface itself is different

[15:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
and in JS, the interfaces _are_ the implementations

[15:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
since they have prototypes

[15:59:00.0000] <annevk2>
not quite, we can have both static and a live NodeList

[16:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I don't think it makes sense to have the same interface object for interfaces with different methods

[16:01:01.0000] <annevk2>
and if you change namedItem to always return an Object...

[16:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: no disagreement from me there

[16:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(I assume this is about having tags() appear on the "all" HTMLCollection but not other HTMLCollections)

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: yeah but the .item() method on the static one is the same as the .item() method on the live one, which isn't the case with these collections

[16:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yes

[16:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the only sensible way to do it is to make HTMLAllCollection a derived interface, is there a reason that would be a compatibility issue?

[16:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(of course the other alternative is to just leave tags() on all HTMLCollections)

[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
right now i've done both. We have two interfaces, and .tags() is on both.

[16:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
(there are other differences)

[16:07:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, why have .tags() on all HTMLCollections?

[16:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
because most browsers have it on all HTMLCollection objects

[16:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
see the mail i just sent to the list

[16:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: is the return of namedItem the other difference?

[16:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I can imagine it might be a problem for HTMLCollection and HTMLAllCollection to have no inheritence relationship at all

[16:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
and the implementation of .namedItem, yeah

[16:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[16:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
the other collection interfaces have no relationship either

[16:11:05.0000] <Hixie>
there's five of them at this point

[16:11:06.0000] <Hixie>
they're all basically the same with weird minor differences

[16:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know that it is a problem for sure, but if someone wants to prototype-hack HTMLCollection to add or modify a method, it won't work on the unrelated types of collection

[16:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
correct

[16:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see any way around that given that the prototypes would have different .namedItem()s anyway

[16:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so if that works in browsers currently, it could be a compat issue

[16:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
i guess we'll find out

[16:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you could just make namedItem() return Object and not worry about the fact that for some collections it's a more specific type

[16:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
the implementation is still different

[16:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
so the prototype needs to be different

[16:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that's irrelevant to the interface

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
not in JS?

[16:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the prototype doesn't need to be different

[16:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
we can have a single JS wrapper that can wrap multiple underlying C++ classes with different behavior

[16:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
so there's only one namedItem() implementation, and it just happens to act very differently in different contexts?

[16:14:04.0000] <othermaciej>
the JS method just needs to call a C++ virtual method

[16:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
freaky

[16:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm thinking of adding an event to WebSocket that fires when the buffers are filling too fast

[16:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
what should i call it?

[16:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
websocket.onoverflow ?

[16:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
websocket.onthrottle ?

[16:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
websocket.on... ?

[16:26:00.0000] <franksalim>
Hixie, the send buffer? or both buffers? the recv buffer must be taken care of by the underlying network layer, right?

[16:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
send

[16:28:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: what's the semantics of this proposed event? does it fire from within send() that will fail?

[16:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
it fires asynchronously whenever the user agent feels like it (when the UA is in danger of hitting some internal limit)

[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
unless you have a better idea :-)

[16:30:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I still think that there needs to be an indication when send() fails

[16:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
you don't know when send fails

[16:31:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: fails to take the data in its queue. sure you know that

[16:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
"take the data in its queue

[16:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
"?

[16:31:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: here's what TCP guarantees:

[16:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
if you hit a hardware limitation, then you can do whatever you like

[16:31:05.0000] <ap>
Hixie: once you call send(), and it returns success

[16:32:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: it means that either the data will be delivered to the other side

[16:32:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: or no more data will be delivered to the other side over this connection

[16:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
no, it doesn't, except for some definition of "other side" that is not really practically useful to the author.

[16:33:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: huh?

[16:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
what matters is whether the application level on the other side dealt with the data, and the only way you can know that is an acknowledgement.

[16:33:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I thought I explained it in detail in e-mail :(

[16:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
you can't know from TCP whether the server on the other side is still alive or has had some sort of crash or is spilling all its data on the floor or whatever.

[16:34:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: repeating it again, it means that "either the data will be delivered to the other side, or no more data will be delivered to the other side over this connection"

[16:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that's not interesting information

[16:34:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: that may sounds subtle, but it makes all the difference between TCP and UDP

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
i understand the difference between TCP and UDP :-)

[16:35:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: with this guarantee, you can do simple app-level acks

[16:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[16:35:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: without it, you need much more complicated mechanisms for acks

[16:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
we already expose "the connection closed"

[16:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really see what you are proposing

[16:36:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: what I'm saying is that there is absolutely no reason to provide UDP-level reliability when the underlying protocol is TCP

[16:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok... we're not doing that

[16:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
so where's the problem?

[16:37:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: that's actually exactly what the spec provides now (well, except that it still guarantees ordering)

[16:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
how so?

[16:37:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: if you call send() several times, and you get an ACK for the last, you cannot be sure that all the data arrived to the other side

[16:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
you can't drop packets in the middle and keep sending them

[16:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
how not?

[16:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
if that's so, there's an error in the spec

[16:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
what text did i screw up?

[16:38:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: where does the spec say that once packets are dropped, the connection is closed?

[16:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
you're not allowed to drop packets at all.

[16:39:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: oh, do you mean that the current text suggests filling up RAM until it ends?

[16:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
the current spec says that when you call send(), you have to send the bytes.

[16:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't say how exactly

[16:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
they just have to be sent

[16:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
there's no permission to not send

[16:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can add a line saying "if you can't send, you have to close" if you like

[16:40:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: neither sounds like useful behavior

[16:40:02.0000] <franksalim>
so there is no notion of a send failing

[16:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
ap: neither what?

[16:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
franksalim: not currently

[16:40:05.0000] <franksalim>
if you add a throttling event, there would have to still be a way to indicate that subsequent calls to send failed

[16:40:06.0000] <ap>
Hixie: neither filling up the RAM or closing at UA's discretion

[16:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
ap: what would you like the spec to say?

[16:41:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: as indicated in the mailing list, I like Jeremy Orlow's proposal

[16:42:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: an overflow event that is sent at UA's discretions sounds helpful, too

[16:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
you want send() to throw an exception when the TCP layer failed to successfully send the packet to the other side?

[16:42:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: it's just no substitute

[16:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's what he suggested, but as far as i can tell it's impossible to implement, since send() has to be async.

[16:43:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: actually not, that's not what he suggested

[16:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok, so what are you and he proposing, since i misunderstood what he suggested?

[16:44:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: the suggestion is to raise an event when UA no longer wants to buffer the data in its queue (in practice, the buffer will be quite small, to allow for quick adaptation to network conditions)

[16:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
(that's definitely not what he suggested, but ok)

[16:44:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: raqise an exception, sorry

[16:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
so you want send() to throw an exception (but leave the connection open) if the buffer is full?

[16:45:01.0000] <ap>
btw, quoting the suggestion, "Maybe the right behavior is to buffer in user-space (like Maciej explained) up until a limit (left up to the UA) and then anything beyond that results in an exception."

[16:45:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: yes

[16:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
wouldn't that mean send() could arbitrarily and randomly fire exceptions? that seems like a _really_ bad idea

[16:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
and would effectively give you UDP-like behaviour

[16:46:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I don't agree with either statement (neither that it's bad, nor that it's somehow related to UDP-like behavior)

[16:46:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: returning a boolean result would be as good as firing an exception in my eyes, btw

[16:47:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me doesn't like getAsBinary and getAsBase64

[16:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's bad for the same reason that we are avoiding firing an exception if you call send() on a closed WebSocket

[16:47:02.0000] <ap>
ok, let it be a boolean return value. there just needs to be a clear indication that the data passed to send() is dropped on the floor

[16:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
and it's UDP-like because it means that if you are calling send() on a timer at roughly the rate that you can send, then a random subset of the data will be sent, and the rest will be dropped on the floor.

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
which, as you said earlier, is really bad

[16:48:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: to determine the rate that you can send, one needs guidance

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure, so we have the overflow event, which you can use to back off

[16:49:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: back off by how much?

[16:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
(should probably be "willsoonoverflow" or something)

[16:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
who knows

[16:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
a boolean won't tell you either

[16:49:05.0000] <franksalim>
what happens when it actually overflows?

[16:49:06.0000] <ap>
Hixie: there are well established flow control protocols that work with "the boolean"

[16:49:07.0000] <franksalim>
exception? binary value?

[16:49:08.0000] <Hixie>
franksalim: i propose to make the connection close

[16:50:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: like, every streaming protocol that works over TCP can adapt when send() fails

[16:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
ap: yeah, but they're all designed for experts

[16:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
ap: nobody except the experts are going to be checking for a return value from send(), realistically speaking

[16:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
ap: (they're also not going to be checking for an event)

[16:51:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: with 128K or so buffered in the UA, non-experts will still be able to ignore the complexities, and control their toy trains

[16:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm happy to make the event provide more information

[16:51:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: you're now basically asking experts to come up with new flow control protocols, and non-experts will still not get decent streaming behavior

[16:52:00.0000] <annevk2>
what's the problem with the UA buffering all calls to send() somehow?

[16:52:01.0000] <franksalim>
annevk2, i think all of these proposed behaviors involve doing some amount of buffering

[16:52:02.0000] <ap>
annevk2: the data will never get to the other side if it's sent faster than the network can transmit it

[16:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
ap: i would be ok with returning a number from send() which is how much more data can be buffered, and then failing the connection when you go over the limit

[16:52:04.0000] <franksalim>
but they differ in what to do when a buffer fills

[16:53:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: that sounds good to me, but it is not implementable

[16:53:01.0000] <franksalim>
why fail the connection when you could indicate failure of that particular call to send?

[16:53:02.0000] <annevk2>
ap, the UA can control how fast it is being sent

[16:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
ap: which is similar to what you're suggesting, except that going over (returning false) is fatal

[16:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
ap: why not?

[16:53:05.0000] <ap>
annevk2: by blocking send() until the queue is free? we agreed to never block

[16:53:06.0000] <Hixie>
franksalim: because people are going to ignore this data, and we don't want to make this UDP-like

[16:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
ap, it can queue up in the local RAM

[16:54:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: hmm, maybe it can be implemented, let me think

[16:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: if you're calling send() faster than the network can handle, you'll eventually run out of RAM

[16:54:03.0000] <annevk2>
ap, and when there's OOM it's just like any other platform implementation

[16:54:04.0000] <franksalim>
there are many ways for a javascript application to eat arbitrarily large amounts of RAM if the author is careless or malicious

[16:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm rather with anne on this to be honest

[16:55:01.0000] <annevk2>
with implementation I meant limitation, sorry

[16:57:00.0000] <ap>
annevk2: e.g. if you're sending a video stream from a capture device, there is no good in filling up RAM until OOM

[16:57:01.0000] <ap>
annevk2: you want to be notified quickly, and to downscale your video

[16:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
we don't support sending a video stream

[16:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
if that's the use case, we can fix this in v2

[16:58:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: why don't we?

[16:58:02.0000] <annevk2>
I was just about to say that for specific types of data (e.g. files from the local disk) we should let send() accept dedicated types (e.g. FileData) and let the UA handle the specifics

[16:58:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: what about an audio stream?

[16:58:04.0000] <annevk2>
it just handles text

[16:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
ap: because we don't have any of the building blocks for that yet

[16:59:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: what about data for/from SETI@home?

[16:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
ap: we don't have binary data, we don't have stream interfaces, we don't have audio or video hardware access

[16:59:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: or any other programmatically generated data stream?

[16:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
ap: SETI@home is rate-limited by the server


2009-07-29
[17:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: for file upload i'm waiting for arun's draft

[17:01:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: the spec says that WebSocket is to app-level protocols what TCP is to internet protocols

[17:01:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: if you're targeting TTY instead of TCP, please say so :)

[17:02:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: so yes, send() can of course return how much space there's in UA queue at the moment (I was thinking about kernel queue, and this data is usually unavailable)

[17:02:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: it feels quite weird to report implementation details in this way though

[17:03:00.0000] <annevk2>
it should probably be a percentage or something as otherwise you need to figure out UTF-16 vs UTF-8 etc.

[17:03:01.0000] <annevk2>
if anything at all, that is

[17:05:00.0000] <ap>
the important thing is to be able to estimate the available bandwidth, and keep the UA queue close to empty after that

[17:05:01.0000] <ap>
or take 50% of available bandwidth, for example

[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok so i got run of onoverflow, and instead just made send() return a number, which is either 0 (connection closed), 1 (buffering not supported), a number indicating the number of bytes that can be buffered, or 4294967295 if the buffering is essentially unlimited.

[17:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
and overflowing the buffer closes the connection.

[17:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
got rid of, rather

[17:08:00.0000] <franksalim>
i'm catching up on the mailing list thread. has the alternative been discussed in which notification occurs when writes are successful? this would allow application code to make use of an arbitrarily large buffer but be aware of the rate at which the buffer is being drained

[17:08:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: what is the client to do when 1 is returned?

[17:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
ap: pray it doesn't hit the network rate limit

[17:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
ap: i just needed a number that wasn't 0, since 0 means "failed"

[17:09:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: ok

[17:09:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I think that's workable, let's see what people have to say about elegance

[17:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's the web, i gave up trying to win any awards for legance long ago :-)

[17:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
but yeah

[17:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
for elegance, even

[17:10:03.0000] <ap>
franksalim: could you explain this in more detail? what's a successful write?

[17:10:04.0000] <franksalim>
ap, successfully dequeued by the UA

[17:10:05.0000] <franksalim>
ap, not necessarily acked

[17:11:00.0000] <ap>
franksalim: I see. I don't think it's been suggested

[17:11:01.0000] <franksalim>
this would make the information available to keep buffers close to empty for "smart" developers, but not close connections forcefully at arbitrary limits

[17:12:00.0000] <roc>
what was wrong with my idea of allowing apps to query the amount of buffered data?

[17:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: that's basically what we have now, though in reverse

[17:12:02.0000] <franksalim>
most (all?) other js APIs can use arbitrarily large amounts of memory

[17:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we should also have an attribute for the actual amount pending?

[17:13:01.0000] <franksalim>
Hixie, roc: except what we have now implies that there has to be a max, right?

[17:13:02.0000] <ap>
franksalim: I think that a highwater mark notification would still be needed to rate limit

[17:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
franksalim: no, the UA is allowed to return 4294967295 if the buffering is essentially unlimited

[17:13:04.0000] <franksalim>
Hixie, but then you don't know how much of the buffer you have used

[17:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
franksalim: correct

[17:14:00.0000] <roc>
I think it's a lot more useful to know how much data is queued than how much space is left in the buffer

[17:14:01.0000] <franksalim>
i think it is desirable to have an unlimited buffer size with the ability to know how large a buffer you are using

[17:14:02.0000] <franksalim>
roc, i agree

[17:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
hmm... maybe i should have it return the amount queued, then? or make it return a boolean and have a separate amount-queued attribute?

[17:14:04.0000] <ap>
franksalim: "other js APIs can use arbitrarily large amounts of memory" - the issue here is not with OOM, but with letting the app achieve its mission. other JS APIs don't usually cause infinite memory growth when doing something useful

[17:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: what should i call such an attribute?

[17:15:01.0000] <franksalim>
ap, yes. but setting a max buffer size is not necessary. the important data is how far backed up you are, not how much space you have left

[17:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
websocket.queueLength?

[17:15:03.0000] <roc>
bufferedAmount?

[17:15:04.0000] <ap>
franksalim: agreed

[17:18:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: with the boolean returned, will it be for success/failure?

[17:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
it'll return false if the connection is closed (e.g. because of buffer overflow) and true otherwise

[17:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: once the connection is closed, should bufferedAmount be reset to zero, or should it continue counting the number of bytes that aren't getting sent?

[17:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
this attributes makes a lot of sense, it lets you just check to see if it's non-zero, and just not send data while that is true

[17:25:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: it will still take a good amount of "isSafari" and "isFirefox" checks for someone to send a 128K blob of data

[17:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[17:26:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: maybe I'm just not seeing how it can be done. what would you suggest?

[17:27:00.0000] <ap>
for a browser that can buffer such amount, the best way is to send in one chunk

[17:27:01.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I'd say bufferedAmount should keep increasing, if you keep allowing send()s

[17:27:02.0000] <ap>
for one that cannot - how large can bufferedAmount become before the app should freak out?

[17:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: k, done that

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
ap: if you're sending a 128KB frame, then it's one send() call.

[17:28:02.0000] <roc>
ap: I think this is just like any other memory issue

[17:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
ap: so there's nothing to check

[17:29:01.0000] <ap>
roc: if I understand what you're saying right, the model is that buffer will be unlimited (or huge) for this API to work

[17:29:02.0000] <roc>
right

[17:29:03.0000] <roc>
which is like all the other buffers Web apps deal with today

[17:29:04.0000] <ap>
roc: makes sense

[17:30:00.0000] <roc>
I think in practice if you carve your data into 1MB chunks you should be in good shape for any scenario

[17:30:01.0000] <ap>
other than dial-up :)

[17:30:02.0000] <roc>
then you're just doomed :-)

annevk4: so he had to fork Hixie's original spec and make his own

[02:17:00.0000] <annevk4>

[02:17:01.0000] <annevk4>
zcorpan, nobody cares

fortunately both objections placed so far are against process and I don't think they carry any weight

[02:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and now the process of updating it is being turned into a political fight

[02:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>

[02:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>

[02:25:02.0000] <zcorpan>
<![INCLUDE[ ]]>, <![CDATA[ ]]>

[02:26:00.0000] <annevk4>
well, <![CDATA[ ]]> is still there somewhat

Why would html5lib.HTMLParser().parseFragment(StringIO("<p>foo")) return None

[06:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, do you have, or could you obtain, any data comparing how common it is for authors to include = within unquoted attribute values, compared with those that write attributes like alt= with no value?

[06:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm trying to show why Hixie choice is wrong here http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0817.html

[06:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What's the reason a= and a=b=c can't both be valid? I can't remember. Is it stuff like a=b c?

[06:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, Hixie claims it's because of situations like <img alt= class=photo> where "class=photo" would be interpreted as the value of the alt attribute

[06:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If the space between them was left out, you mean?

[06:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
no, with the space

[06:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps the better solution is to make whitespace before unqutoed attribute values invalid

[06:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh. So there's probably content that depends on a= b being parsed as a="b" then

[06:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
so <img class= photo> would be invalid, but <img class= "photo" could still be valid

[06:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: How would those two cases be distinguished? <img alt = class=photo> seems like it could be either, and would require human interpretation

[06:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: But anyway I don't have data like that, and don't think I can easily obtain it, since it probably involves hacking the tokeniser

[06:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, you could use a rough technique by looking for obvious cases like the href attribute where = in values is common <a href= ?foo-bar>, and also look for [^=]+=\s+([A-Za-z]+)= where $1 matches known attribute names

[06:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/foo-bar/foo=bar/

[06:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
actually, just the regex would be more like [A-Za-z]+=\s+([A-Za-z]+)=

[06:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
or [A-Za-z]+\s?=\s+([A-Za-z]+)=

[06:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Can you fix html5lib so test cases can run with more recent SimpleJSON which throws on "output":["ParseError", ["Character", "\uD869"], "ParseError", ["Character", "\uDED6"]]}?

[07:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Hmm, that sounds kind of vague :-p

[07:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you have a single specific Java-compatible regexp, I can run it and give a list of the matching lines or of matching substrings

[07:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
and then I wouldn't have to actively think about it, which would be good

[07:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Why me? :-(

[07:16:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Also: How could it be fixed?

[07:16:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll have to find out what a java compatible regex is, and how it differs from the one I gave you

[07:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Because your around, and might have an idea of how to fix it.

[07:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It's basically a Perl-compatible regexp

[07:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
is the one I gave you perl compatible?

[07:17:03.0000] <Philip`>
so the one you said should be fine

[07:17:04.0000] <Lachy>
except for the mistake in it

[07:17:05.0000] <Philip`>
but you'd need to include the list of common attribute values if that's what you want

[07:17:06.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, names

[07:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
corrected version: [A-Za-z]+\s*=\s+([A-Za-z]+)=

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Hmm, what test case can cause the expected output to have unpaired surrogate codepoints?

[07:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
do you mean like: [A-Za-z]+\s*=\s+(class|href|src|...)=

[07:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Yes

[07:19:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[07:19:04.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: if you want to restrict it to that

[07:19:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: A tokenizer one with input like that

[07:19:06.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: (Also you might want to prefix with (?i) to make it case-insensitive)

[07:19:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: From your script, I think

[07:19:08.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Yes, but I'm too lazy to look it up myself :-p

[07:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll think about it more and get back to you

[07:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me ought to set up a web service so people can run their own regexps over the page data

[07:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but that sounds like too much effort now)

[07:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
how much processing time does it take to run a typical regex over the data?

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Um... A while

[07:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
like a few hours?

[07:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
(so a web service would have to be restricted to a subset of the data most of the time)

[07:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
More like a few minutes

[07:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
(for the 425K pages)

[07:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
where "few" might be "ten" or something but I can't really remember now

[07:30:05.0000] <gsnedders>
yay! An IndexError from html5lib. What I always wanted.

[07:30:06.0000] <Philip`>
and also it depends on the complexity of the regexp

[07:30:07.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Still, it would be a DOS risk

[07:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me would abuse the system by trying to run hundreds of simultaneous queries for the same thing :-)

[07:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's fast enough that I haven't bothered writing the code to parallelise it, in any case

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's also the issue that the university wouldn't be particularly happy about running web servers on their machines, for security

[07:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
fragment parsing isn't well tested in html5lib seemingly

[07:37:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, yeah, it wasn't well implemented either iirc

[07:37:01.0000] <annevk>
at least not initially

[07:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has so far hit one exception and one infinite loop

[07:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, wait.

[07:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
This infinite loop isn't an html5lib bug. We follow the spec. The spec has an infinite loop.

[07:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess this is where we're allowed implementation specific limitations, due to hardware constraints.

[07:45:01.0000] <annevk>
the spec has an infinite loop?

[07:45:02.0000] <annevk>
and validator.nu does not?

[07:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: validator.nu doesn't implement innerHTML, does it?

[07:51:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought it did

[07:59:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, that's loop indeed

[07:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Any self-respecting Turing-complete machine should be happy to run infinite loops without exceeding hardware constraints

[08:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
True, but they never complete executing, which annoys me.

[08:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
The desire to not wait infinitely long for a web page to render is a user constraint, not a hardware constraint

[08:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
and we should consider other solutions to that problem, such as making users immortal

[08:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Do you know of anyone who will implement that?

[08:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: No, but I can think of a number of ways to test it

[08:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Can anyone see a better fix for the middle change in http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/source/detail?r=21ce65db1e551ef8e7c4e91db0295caab08a4f62#

[08:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: for e in reversed(self.tree.openElements): if e.name == 'table': return e; (newline) return self.tree.openElements[0]

[08:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
perhaps?

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
(except not using reversed if we want Python 2.3 compatibility)

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
The code you checked in looks disgusting :-p

[08:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>

&image; is special, though

If the character reference is being consumed as part of an attribute, and the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON (;), and the next character is in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE, U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z, or U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z, then, for historical reasons, all the characters that were matched after the U+0026 AMPERSAND (&) must be unconsumed, 

[08:48:01.0000] <Philip`>

othermaciej, We've had conference room names for less than 24 hours and you already know that they're good?

[09:23:00.0000] <mengelhardt>
Hello

[10:25:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: I remember you data-mined a big corpus of pages to figure out common class/id names.  Has anyone done similar for frequency of font names used in css?

[10:26:00.0000] <jacobolus>
or are there big page sets already gathered (and freely available somewhere?) to do such an analysis on?

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: There's http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama/ but I'm not sure that's got font names

[10:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
That uses pages downloaded from the freely available list from dmoz.org

[10:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.dotnetdotcom.org/ has a big pile of HTML pages (no CSS) freely available

[10:29:02.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: thanks, that's a cool resource.  no listed fonts though

[10:30:00.0000] <jacobolus>
(the opera one)

[10:30:01.0000] <tantek>
are there actually authors that try to validate (unprocessed source) PHP files as HTML?

[10:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: I can easily run regexps over dotnetdotcom's ~425K HTML pages, so if there's a regexp that would (approximately) extract font names (from inline CSS) then I could do that

[10:32:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: okay, just a minute

[10:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
"font\s*:" and "font-family\s?:" would probably catch a lot them

[10:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
(?i)font(?:-family)?\s*:([^;"}]+) gives some stuff you could extract individual names from

[10:38:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: will your regexps just return all captures?

[10:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: For each line that matches the regexp, it can either print the line or print the first matching substring or print any captured group

[10:40:00.0000] <jacobolus>
just one of the captured groups?

[10:40:01.0000] <jacobolus>
oh, I guess if it can print the lines out, it would be possible to grab that and run further regexps on it

[10:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[10:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Most of the lines have lots of HTML junk in them

[10:46:00.0000] <jacobolus>
yeah

[10:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: http://philip.html5.org/data/fonts-in-inline-css-raw.txt.gz (~7MB) has the strings that match the regexp I gave earlier

[10:47:00.0000] <jacobolus>
font(?:\-family)?\s*\:.*\s*((?:(?:'[a-zA-Z ]*')|(?:"[a-zA-Z ]*")|[a-zA-Z]*)(?=\s*[,}])[^}]*)}

[10:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I can do it differently if you're willing to wait ten minutes for it to regenerate)

[10:47:02.0000] <jacobolus>
I think that should be right

[10:47:03.0000] <jacobolus>
I should do some testing

[10:47:04.0000] <Philip`>
(Use a command like 'gzip -cd fonts-in-inline-css-raw.txt.gz|sort -u|cut -f2|sort|uniq -c|sort -n' to count number of pages each string occurs on, etc)

[10:49:00.0000] <jacobolus>
actually

[10:49:01.0000] <jacobolus>
font(?:\-family)?\s*\:.*\s*((?:(?:'[a-zA-Z ]*')|(?:"[a-zA-Z ]*")|[a-zA-Z]*)(?=\s*[,;}])[^;}]*)[};]

[10:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: That seems like it's probably close to a subset of what my regexp was matching, so hopefully you could just run that on my existing output :-)

[10:50:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: probably a subset, yes :)

[10:50:01.0000] <jacobolus>
this just grabs all the fonts in a "stack"

[10:50:02.0000] <jacobolus>
as one capture

[10:50:03.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: That one wouldn't match style="font-family: wingdings"

[10:50:04.0000] <Philip`>
I think

[10:50:05.0000] <jacobolus>
oh, true

[10:50:06.0000] <jacobolus>
because it doesn't end in ,, ;, or }

[10:51:00.0000] <jacobolus>
:/

[10:53:00.0000] <Darxus>
I suppose I should complain about the inability to set an li style to "+" or "-" to the css folks, not the html folks?

[10:55:00.0000] <Darxus>
Sorry, nevermind:  12:56PM < mamont> Darxus: li:before { content: "+"; }

[10:55:01.0000] <jacobolus>
Darxus: you can just use a custom image or so, no?

[10:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: "To obtain other glyphs, authors should use the 'content' property of the ::marker pseudo-element." — CSS3 Lists

[10:56:01.0000] <jacobolus>
if you do li:before won't that change the alignment

[10:56:02.0000] <Darxus>
jacobolus: I can, but I don't consider the inability... to do the above acceptable.  

[10:56:03.0000] <Darxus>
jacobolus: Haven't tried it yet.  My guess is the "before" part isn't necessary.

[10:56:04.0000] <jacobolus>
gsnedders: do browsers implement that?

[10:56:05.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: No.

[10:56:06.0000] <jacobolus>
:)

[10:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: But the fact that CSS3 says something about it means there's little point in writing to www-style :)

[10:57:01.0000] <jacobolus>
heh

[10:57:02.0000] <Darxus>
It's actually in CSS3.

[10:57:03.0000] <jacobolus>
IOW go complain in #webkit, on irc.mozilla.org, etc...

[10:58:00.0000] <jacobolus>
not that they'll have any sympathy

[11:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me comes across Dashiva in BTS

[11:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: You can get a seemingly reasonably not-too-inaccurate list by doing something like

[11:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
gzip -cd fonts-in-inline-css-raw.txt.gz|sort -u|cut -f2|sort|perl -lne's/.*?://;print $1 while /('\''[^'\'']+'\''|"[^"]+"|[^\s,]+)/g'|sort|uniq -c|sort -n

[11:05:00.0000] <Darxus>
So that content trick seems to be not what I want.  It's not changing the bullet, and so it's not doing the alignment I care about.

[11:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
and then ignoring the ones like "11px" which obviously aren't fonts

[11:05:02.0000] <Darxus>
Can't imagine how CSS has gone so long without allowing you to specify an arbitrary character as the bullet style.

[11:05:03.0000] <Philip`>
Might need to tweak the results so they're more meaningful e.g. counting number of pages each value appears on

[11:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: Images.

[11:05:05.0000] <Darxus>
gsnedders: Not acceptable.

[11:06:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: I was writing a python script to spit out all the font stacks :)

[11:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: "<p>+ Line one.<br>+ Line two.</p>"

[11:06:02.0000] <Darxus>
I'll do a table.  I think it actually sort of qualifies as tabular data.

[11:06:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Darxus: Well, obviously, seeming is has gone for so long it is acceptable

[11:06:04.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: I prefer bash+perl :-)

[11:06:05.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: I want to alternate between + and -, the characters are different widths, so what I'm looking for is proper alignment.

[11:07:00.0000] <Darxus>
(Positive and negative attributes of the thing in the list heading.)

[11:07:01.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: I dunno whether you've done much python ever, but this is fun stuff: http://www.dabeaz.com/generators

[11:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: "<p><span style=position:absolute>+</span>&nbsp; Line one.<br><span style=position:absolute>-</span>&nbsp; Line two.</p>"

[11:07:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: But Python is slow!

[11:08:00.0000] <Darxus>
Nice, it looks like since yesterday whatwg overthrew w3 as the first google hit for html5.

[11:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
We're back at number one!

[11:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Are scripts running upon being added to the DOM?

[11:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/188 should run per HTML 5, but doesn't in IE, Fx, Chromium, and only does in Opera

[11:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Snooping in canvas bugs, are you?

[11:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: no

/me needs a break having been working for almost eight hours

[11:46:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Time to go home, I think

[12:02:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/29/misunderstanding-markup-xhtml-2-comic-strip/ is nice

[12:03:00.0000] <annevk>
except of course that XHTML as text/html is fiction :p

[12:19:00.0000] <tantek>
annevk - XHTML as text/html is not fiction - validates just fine with the W3C validator :)

[12:20:00.0000] <annevk>
that validator is also a piece of fiction :p

[12:21:00.0000] <annevk>
having said that, I don't really care that much what people do with their markup

[12:22:00.0000] <tantek>
annekv - you have a curious usage of the word "fiction" ;) http://validator.w3.org

[12:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
XHTML as text/html isn't fiction, it happens all the time

[12:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
the rules for how to process XHTML go out of the window when you use text/html though

[12:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
and with XHTML5, you can't have XHTML5 as text/html

[12:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
this Installed Apps thread had better be good

[12:32:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: :\

[12:41:00.0000] <annevk>
tantek, I'll give you that :)

[12:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders_: why is it desireable for the parser to go out of its way to avoid multiple <body>s?

[12:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders_: i'm not going to change the spec on that, at least not unless a good reason to do so is presented.

[12:59:00.0000] <Darxus>
What is the correct way to display a triple line break between paragraphs, to show greater separation?

[12:59:01.0000] <Darxus>
Er, correct markup.

[13:00:00.0000] <annevk>
<style> p { margin:2em 0 } </style>

[13:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
Darxus: <p>...</p><hr><p>...</p>

[13:00:02.0000] <Darxus>
Hixie: I like that one better, thanks.

[13:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
HTML5 then styles <hr> as  hr { border: none; margin: 2em; } or something

[13:02:00.0000] <Darxus>
It took me a long time to give in to p's with end tags (used br's instead), but now I'm fond of them.

[13:04:00.0000] <Darxus>
You guys may enjoy reading up on Lojban, a synthetic human language designed to reduce language related limits on thought.  No ambiguity.  

[13:05:00.0000] <Darxus>
(And it's entirely HTML5's fault I ended up finding it - wondering how best to apply the HTML refinement process to human language.)

[13:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Darxus: There's always ambiguity, you just move it one step up in the hierarchy

[13:17:00.0000] <tfh>
ds++

[13:33:00.0000] <Darxus>
Dashiva: Where is there ambiguity in Lojban?

[13:45:00.0000] <Darxus>
CSS3 for lists is awfully extensive for not being able to specify a freaking character to use as the bullet:  http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-lists/

[13:46:00.0000] <tantek>
Darxus, you may be looking for generated content.

[13:46:01.0000] <Darxus>
tantek: Somebody pointed me at that earlier, the problem is that it doesn't handle the alignment as a bullet.

[13:47:00.0000] <Darxus>
Oh, hah, I didn't realize that CSS3 (at least for lists) is also Hixies fault.

[13:47:01.0000] <Darxus>
Hixie: Fix it.

[13:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
i took a break from css to work on html5

[13:47:03.0000] <Darxus>
Ah.

[13:47:04.0000] <tantek>
I think I took the same break to work on microformats.

[13:47:05.0000] <Darxus>
Hixie: I would like to be able to specify any character to use as a bullet in a list.

[13:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
::marker { content: '' }

[13:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
iirc

[13:48:02.0000] <Darxus>
Particulary + / -, to list positive and negative aspects of something.

[13:48:03.0000] <tantek>
Darxus, I believe you may need to use generated content, and float:left, and text-align:right

[13:48:04.0000] <tantek>
oh and perhaps some negative margin-left

[13:48:05.0000] <tantek>
but you may find better luck to such questions in #css

[13:48:06.0000] <Darxus>
tantek: Tables work easy :P

[13:49:00.0000] <Darxus>
tantek: Talked to #css about it first.

[13:50:00.0000] <tantek>
Darxus, Hixie is right - see ::marker http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-lists/#markers

[13:55:00.0000] <Darxus>
tantek: Working on it, thanks.  Any idea if any browsers have implimented it?

[14:01:00.0000] <Darxus>
Yeah I copied the example in the spec and it doesn't work in chrome or firefox 3.  

[14:01:01.0000] <Darxus>
Hixie: But thanks for including it.

[14:01:02.0000] <tantek>
you may want to check their open source repositories for evidence of ::marker support

[14:02:00.0000] <tantek>
perhaps ask in the #webkit channel

[14:03:00.0000] <tantek>
and in #firefox

[14:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me finds http://www.pemberton.nl/vandf/2009/07/xhtml2-not-dead.html

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wouldn't expect anyone to support the lists stuff yet

[14:27:00.0000] <annevk2>
iirc nobody went further than a bunch of the new keywords

[15:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me wonders if Thomas meant getting the name wrong with bad quoting or the top posting :p

[15:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders who Philip is

[15:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe some weird mixup between Patrick and PHP?

[16:09:00.0000] <tantek>
in lieu of an email writeup in lieu of a wiki writeup (probably to follow at some point) :

[16:09:01.0000] <tantek>
While the HTML 4.01 definition of CITE

[16:09:02.0000] <tantek>
http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#edef-CITE

[16:09:03.0000] <tantek>
"Contains a citation or a reference to other sources"

[16:09:04.0000] <tantek>
may be too vague, 

[16:09:05.0000] <tantek>
the current HTML5 draft definition:

[16:09:06.0000] <tantek>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-cite-element

[16:09:07.0000] <tantek>
"The cite element represents the title of a work..."

[16:09:08.0000] <tantek>
"A person's name is not the title of a work ..."

[16:09:09.0000] <tantek>
is a bit too narrow.

[16:10:00.0000] <tantek>
The cite element is for *any* kind of source, whether that source is:

[16:10:01.0000] <tantek>
* the title of a printed work, or 

[16:10:02.0000] <tantek>
* a URL to an online work (should be represented by a nested hyperlink), 

[16:10:03.0000] <tantek>
* or even the name of a person who said something, perhaps outloud in person or in an online chat such as IRC.

[16:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
why people?

[16:10:05.0000] <tantek>
Note that I am not advocating allowing marking up the name of an author of a work with cite, but rather, when the source/work is simply speech from an author that is not otherwise part of a work, then it is appropriate to markup the author (and their name or online nickname) as a cite.

[16:10:06.0000] <Hixie>
using <cite> for names is silly

[16:10:07.0000] <Hixie>
it's typographically wrong

[16:10:08.0000] <Hixie>
it's applying semantics where none are needed

[16:10:09.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, do you have a reference for why/how it is *typographically* wrong?

[16:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure, hold on

[16:11:01.0000] <tantek>
The precise semantic is that the *person* themsevles is the "other source".

[16:11:02.0000] <tantek>
when quoting from otherwise untitled/ungrouped speech from that person

[16:12:00.0000] <tantek>
thus the person themselves is the "other source" (per HTML 4.01 definition)

[16:12:01.0000] <tantek>
hence the usage of cite to refer to a speaker in such examples is semantically correct

[16:13:00.0000] <tantek>
(oops sorry about the nearly dup text there)

[16:15:00.0000] <tantek>
and also note that I am not advocating for general use of <cite> for names.

[16:18:00.0000] <tantek>
but rather for a very specific use for a person's name (or nickname if appropriate, e.g. for quoting from IRC) saying something which is quoted.

[16:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
my reference for the typography of names is going to be the chicacgo manual of style. I can't find anything in there that justifies using the same element for a title of a work and a name of a person, ever.

[16:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
<cite> is not for citations at all in html5

[16:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's just for titles of works

[16:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
because that's more useful in practice as far as i can tell

[16:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me thought the answer to http://twitter.com/johnfoliot/statuses/2918355573 has been long known

[16:43:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me wonders what this new wave of fake-ignorance is about

[16:44:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, in practice <cite> is also useful for names of speakers as noted above. E.g. http://rbach.priv.at/Microformats/IRC/2009-05-01

[16:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: how is it useful there?

[16:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: just use <dt> and <dialog> for a chat log.

[16:45:02.0000] <tantek>
the same as knowing what the "source" is for any quottation

[16:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
knowing what the "source" is for any quotation is not useful, as far as i can tell

[16:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
sounds useful

[16:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
but is not actually useful

[16:46:00.0000] <tantek>
it is useful, in that it provides a mechanism by which it may be possible to determine the validity of the quote

[16:46:01.0000] <tantek>
often by looking up the source

[16:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
you don't need an element for that

[16:46:03.0000] <tantek>
the same usefulness for citing any source

[16:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
what's the use for the element that can't be done without any element?

[16:46:05.0000] <tantek>
what is the harm in permitting an existing semantic usage to continue?

[16:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's _exactly_ what the spec is doing

[16:47:01.0000] <tantek>
I believe there is more weight on the side of keeping an existing practical usage, than dropping it. It doesn't appear to be doing any harm.

[16:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
the existing semantic usage is people use it for titles

[16:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
not citations

[16:47:04.0000] <tantek>
No the current draft spec is keeping one usage and dropping another.

[16:49:00.0000] <tantek>
people are using <cite> to refer to "other sources" per HTML 4.01.  *one* of those other sources is the title of a work, another is a URL to a work, yet another is the name of a speaker of a quote. all of which are sources.

[16:50:00.0000] <tantek>
I understand the utility in refining the definition as given in HTML 4.01. However it seems to do more harm than good to ignore one of those existing uses, and disallow another, rather than explicitly allow all three existing uses.

[16:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
the vast majority of people who are using <cite> for any purpose other than "italics" are using <cite> to mean "title of work", not "cited name"

[16:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
and there is no good use for using it to mark up cited names that needs an element

[16:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
using it for names has one harm, it encourages people to use incorrect typography for names

[16:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
just look at anne's blog

[16:51:03.0000] <tantek>
Is Anne using it incorrectly?

[16:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
he's using it as you suggest

[16:52:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, it's not clear that "no good use for it" argument makes any sense, as any use case for the "title of a work" can also be made for the name of a speaker 

[16:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
the only use case for title of work is "makes it italics", which doesn't apply to "name of a speaker"

[16:53:01.0000] <tantek>
I disagree - another use of the title of a work, and name of a speaker, is to look up said title/name and provide more information

[16:53:02.0000] <tantek>
about the source

[16:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
you don't need an element to do that

[16:54:00.0000] <tantek>
you do - in order to indicate what is the title or name of the speaker, as opposed to nearby text

[16:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
So if I say "Tantek said that you needed that", you wouldn't know that "Tantek" was a name, because I didn't mark it up?

[16:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
either i'm dramatically misunderstanding you, or someone gave you semantic web drugs this morning

[16:55:01.0000] <tantek>
entity discovery/resolution is buggy/unreliable, even in just one language, nevermind internationally.

[16:55:02.0000] <annevk2>
I stopped using <cite> that way btw

[16:55:03.0000] <tantek>
with the exception of very well defined text grammar

[16:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
people have no trouble understanding what is a name and what isn't

[16:55:05.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - depends on the language

[16:55:06.0000] <Hixie>
no, it really doesn't

[16:56:00.0000] <tantek>
and what about names that are not title-cased?

[16:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
like when i say that tantek said something?

[16:56:02.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - right

[16:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
you have no problem seeing the name there either

[16:56:04.0000] <tantek>
assuming you have a NLP that processes the sentence at all

[16:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
if you really, really, truly and honestly really desperately need some sort o machine-readable way to know that something is a name... use hCard

[16:56:06.0000] <tantek>
is the name "that tantek" or "tantek"

[16:58:00.0000] <tantek>
it gets more complicated in languages such as German where all nouns are capitalized

[16:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
please show me one example of that confusion actually happening, where <cite> would actually have helped.

[16:58:02.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - agreed that hCard helps to markup the name of a person and recognize it as such, especially if it has several name components (given, family, suffix etc.)

[16:59:00.0000] <tantek>
what <cite> does above and beyond that, is to indicate that that person is a *source*

[16:59:01.0000] <tantek>
which can then be connected to a quotation q through its cite attribute

[16:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
in html5, <cite> doesn't indicate that the thing is a source

[16:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
ok come now, nobody ever uses cite=""

[16:59:04.0000] <annevk2>
the main problem with using <cite> for this is, as I learned after I used it for a while, is that it is typographically incorrect, at least in English, to italicize the name

[16:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
i've seriously considered dropping cite="" altogether


2009-07-30
[17:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
precisely to stop this kind of argument :-)

[17:00:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, I use that!

[17:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
no, you don't. As an author you do, but not as a user.

[17:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
and as an author i bet it's never done you one iota of good.

[17:00:04.0000] <tantek>
e.g. <cite id="qs01">tantek</cite> said <q cite="#qs01">which can be connected to a quotation q through its cite attribute</q>

[17:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: you don't need any markup whatsoever for that. Just write tantek said "which can be connected to a quotation q through its cite attribute

[17:00:06.0000] <Hixie>
"

[17:00:07.0000] <ttepasse>
annevk2, how is that a problem? In a non-CSS-world - but where ist such a thing?

[17:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, I have some script that displays it to the user

[17:01:01.0000] <annevk2>
ttepasse, cite { font-style:normal } would not be good if it was actually the title of a work

[17:01:02.0000] <ttepasse>
cite.name?

[17:01:03.0000] <annevk2>
ttepasse, too much effort?

[17:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: and i'm sure it made you feel great to know that you're doing the semantically right thing, huh

[17:02:01.0000] <annevk2>
(this is also the problem I have with the role= rather than element advocates; it's just too much typing most of the time to bother)

[17:03:00.0000] <ttepasse>
/me is a big fan of tab-completion for those things.

[17:03:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, yeah and if you kill the feature I'll set up my own rogue cite4all group and make a lot of noise!

[17:04:00.0000] <annevk2>
ttepasse, my text editor is akin to notepad / <textarea>

[17:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
so, anyone want to volunteer to write a script that scans the spec to generate these tables? :-) http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#index

[17:21:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, your point about "don't need any markup ... for that" again depends on NLP/entity-recognition, which as noted, is non-trivial in one language, let alone internationally.

[17:21:01.0000] <tantek>
Regarding the harm "incorrect typography for names" - I will accept that issue and get back to you with appropriate default style sheet rules.

[17:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
humans are good at NLP

[17:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
very good

[17:22:00.0000] <tantek>
Regarding "show me one example of that confusion actually happening, where <cite> would actually have helped." I will research and provide more examples.

[17:23:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, semantic markup is for UAs to present better user interfaces though right? If all we needed was to present things for humans, plain text with appropriate whitespace would be sufficient for many/most use cases.

[17:24:00.0000] <rubys>
Hixie: my experience is otherwise.

[17:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: i'm not convinced there's any need for better UI for users to work out who is saying what, to be honest.

[17:24:02.0000] <tantek>
Anyway - your request for more examples is certainly very reasonable.

[17:24:03.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, as a sample UI, being able to right-click on a source and get info on it/them.

[17:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
who does that? that's a dream of Semantic Web people that in my experience "normal" users don't share

[17:25:01.0000] <tantek>
Indeed in Mozilla (and perhaps Opera?) I believe it was/is possible to right click on a q/blockquote and get the cite attribute(d) source.

[17:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: literacy rates might be better in europe :-)

[17:26:00.0000] <tantek>
from there, when that cite attribute links (through a frag id as shown in the example above) to a <cite> element, then that can provide further information

[17:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
i encourage you to consider what real problem users are facing would be addressed by this, rather than what theoretical problems might be addressed by this

[17:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've never, ever, ever heard a user say "i wish i could figure out who wrote that quote... maybe if i right-click on it it will highlight the name of the author for me"

[17:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have heard them say things like "i wish i could read my web mail while on a plane without network connectivity"

[17:28:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, one real world usage is Wikipedia, where quotes/assertions are cited, and hyperlinks are used to create a UI from quote/assertion to source etc.

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's wrong with what they do now?

[17:29:00.0000] <tantek>
nothing, in the same way that <br><br> was sufficient to indicate paragraphs. but now just as we have the <p> element for semantically marking up paragraphs so that we can avoid "hacking" a presentational paragraph, it makes sense to *keep* the cite attribute / cite element to semantically markup citations and sources

[17:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
<p> gives true styling benefits

[17:30:01.0000] <tantek>
and "heard them say" is not the best way of interpreting user needs. watching/analyzing user behaviors (e.g. in content publishing) is often better than simply listening to what they say they think they need.

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
if your proposed variant of <cite> solves real problems, this would change my reaction, but currently i'm not aware of any real problems that would be solved by making <cite> cover citing names of people

[17:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: totally agreed re: user needs

[17:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: i've never seen a usability study where anything like citations on quoted has come up

[17:31:03.0000] <tantek>
hence I mentioned content publishing behavior

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
(and i've seen a lot of them, i'm on google's usability lab access list so that i can keep an eye on this very kind of thing)

[17:32:01.0000] <tantek>
user studies may be sufficient, but are not necessarily necessary to make such a case

[17:38:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, while I'm not sure I can necessarily meet your threshold for what you call a "real" problem, I'm fairly certain I can provide real world use cases with examples, and I'll at least do that.

[17:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool, that would certainly help

[17:40:00.0000] <tantek>
I think with sufficient real world use cases (with examples), at some point the advantage of keeping functionality which is allowed by (the admittedly ambiguously broad) wording of the existing HTML 4.01 spec is greater than the minor advantage of simplification/reduction that you gain by removing/dropping that functionality.

[17:40:01.0000] <tantek>
I understand that is a judgment call, and that reasonable people can come to different conclusions based on similar facts on such a point.

[17:40:02.0000] <tantek>
I hope by providing more data I can narrow any such gaps in conclusions at least a bit.

[17:43:00.0000] <tantek>
And for that matter, let me just say that I do commend your general effort at simplification/reduction, lest that is not clear by the arguments I've made above.

[17:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
fwiw, what html4 says has no bearing on what html5 says -- i only base the spec on legacy content and legacy UAs, not legacy specs.

[17:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
and don't worry, i don't take any offence at all from our discussions, i know your heart is in the same place as mine :-)

[17:45:00.0000] <tantek>
understood. I'm looking at the legacy content part of that, which, often reflects what html4.01 says, especially as interpreted by the broader web design / semantic HTML community.

[17:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
the broader web design / semantic HTML community is sadly a tiny minority of the wider web :-(

[17:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
from what i've seen, <cite> is almost always used to mean "italics"

[17:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm willing to ignore that on the basis that that was never a valid use

[17:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
never even remotely a valid use

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that some people mark up names using <cite>, as well as marking up titles, and some people (me, circa 2004) go out of their way to only mark up citations with <cite>

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
so there is definitely use to back up all of these options

[17:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
this leaves the question of what is the most useful use we can put the element to

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
and my conclusion so far is that the most useful use for <cite> is as an element to allow typographic control over titles, since those are often made italics

[17:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
and generally, names and titles aren't typeset the same way, so i am reluctant to make the element apply to both

[17:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
especially since we have so many ways of marking up names already (e.g. hCard, microdata vCard, RDFa vCard, etc)

[17:49:00.0000] <nathanhammond_>
/me patiently waits for the conversation about cite to come to a conclusion (2 hours now)

[17:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's been much longer than 2 hours :-)

[17:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
we were talking abotu this in like 2005 already

[17:50:02.0000] <nathanhammond_>
okay, so just two hours today. :)

[17:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[17:51:00.0000] <nathanhammond_>
at some point I've got a few comments and questions about some of the history management stuff in the spec

[17:52:00.0000] <nathanhammond_>
better to document it all and send it your way? or just converse here?

[17:53:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - indeed: http://tantek.com/presentations/2005/09/elements-of-xhtml/#slide32

[17:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
nathanhammond_: i'm going offline in 2 minutes, but i'll be back in a few hours. If it's comments on problems in the spec, best to send the feedback to the list.

[17:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
nathanhammond_: if it's just questions about how it works, I can reply when I get back, and IRC is fine. Also, feel free to interrupt ongoing conversations if there is one in progress when you come here. :-)

[17:56:00.0000] <nathanhammond_>
arrr, it be related to problems

[17:56:01.0000] <nathanhammond_>
so it'll go to the list

[17:56:02.0000] <nathanhammond_>
but I'll probably document my concerns on a blog so that I can just hit the highlights on the list

[17:56:03.0000] <nathanhammond_>
and link for the full conversation

[17:57:00.0000] <nathanhammond_>
thank you sir.

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
please send anything you want me to read to the list, so i can reply to it easily

[17:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's hard to reply to blogs in pine :-)

[17:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok gotta go

[17:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[17:58:04.0000] <nathanhammond_>
true

[18:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think the "installed apps" thread has not yet led to either a good statement of use cases, or a mechanism that actually has reasonable security characteristics

[18:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: but it might be "good" in the sense that there is likely no spec action required

[18:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk:  I wonder how the XHTML2 folks plan to continue outside the W3C given the W3C's trademark on "XHTML" and standard document copyright 

[18:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I guess they'll have to rename it and rewrite the spec from scratch...

[20:45:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
Hixie: you've got your email

[20:46:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
I'll stick around here in case I can help clarify some of what I said.

[00:24:00.0000] <jm2k>
 If you start a Web Worker on a page but then navigate to another page or domain (in same tab), does the web worker continue to compute?

[00:30:00.0000] <jm2k>
eh, no one here :(

[00:37:00.0000] <inimino>
jm2k: no, see http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/#the-worker%27s-lifetime

[04:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: how does the spec handle document.documentElement.onclick=function(){alert(1)};document.documentElement.onclick=null

[04:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: the second assignment should cause the first event listener to be removed

[05:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: but in the spec i only see that a new event listener is to be registered

[05:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: about http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=624

[05:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
from looking through the v.nu code briefly, I think maybe that error message is not generated by v.nu code, but instead by URI-checking code in third-party library code

[05:25:01.0000] <annevk>
validator.nu should have a URL implementation :)

[05:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah i guess v.nu needs to know the URL encoding thing

[05:26:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I guess all URLs have a valid URL representation

[05:26:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
it may be that Henri's build patches some of the library code already, I don't know

[05:27:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
As you can just use a URI

[05:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: i guess the simplest path is to update the microsyntaxes wiki page

[05:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: yeah

[05:30:01.0000] <zcorpan>
done

[05:40:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me discovers zcorpan is better at spelling than him

[05:40:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(in English, this is)

[05:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: given that the error message has the term "whitespace", I'm wondering if the microsyntax page wording might better be, "Whitespace (spaces) should be escaped as %20." 

[05:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or something

[05:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: it's a wiki :)

[05:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: well, I was asking for your opinion about whether you think it'd be more clear, or less clear?

[05:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: maybe make it more general and give a specific example... Special characters should be URL-escaped, e.g. %20 for whitespace

[05:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[06:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe we could ask dude what he thinks would have been a helpful error message for his case

[06:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
they guy who tweeted about it, I mean

[06:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
*the

[06:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
also see http://www.tomleadbetter.co.uk/blog/entry/html5/

[06:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the _URL-escaped_ part could be a hyperlink

[06:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, I think in general the way to get better error messages from v.nu is not to mess too much with the code (e.g., jing), but to supplement with refinements to the microsyntax stuff and other stuff in the wiki, and to put more into the code for the assertions-checking phase

what the hell

[06:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can7t tell what the debate is

[06:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
where's the question?

[06:42:01.0000] <Philip`>

re: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090701#l-557

[06:43:00.0000] <annevk>
the form submission formats

[06:44:00.0000] <annevk>
application/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data

[06:44:01.0000] <annevk>
(it was brought up in the HTTP WG meeting)

[06:50:00.0000] <annevk>
application/x-www-form-urlencoded seems to be nowhere defined

[06:50:01.0000] <annevk>
the other is http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388

[06:55:00.0000] <annevk>
oh duh, HTML5 references rfc2388

[06:55:01.0000] <annevk>
but application/x-www-form-urlencoded would still need to be defined

[07:12:00.0000] <annevk>
sebmarkbage, interesting idea

[07:15:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
annevk: yea. Downloading might be specified too. So that no browser downloads the whole archive several times. It should be loaded once for atleast the life time of the document.

[07:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me fails to find the idea in the logs

[07:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, sebmarkbage = Sebastian Markbåge?

[07:18:01.0000] <sebmarkbage>
yes

[07:18:02.0000] <annevk>
life time might be tricky to define

[07:18:03.0000] <gsnedders>
sebmarkbage: I think HTTP pipelining over comes the majority of issues

[07:19:00.0000] <annevk>
and you probably want a custom protocol to make it work so you can have fragment identifiers for referenced resources as well

[07:19:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, yeah

[07:19:02.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, though you'd need a new version of that that isn't broken by server implementations :/

[07:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: We do use it sometimes, though, albeit with apparently crazy heuristics to decide whether to enable it

[07:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: What servers actually break with it, nowadays?

[07:21:01.0000] <annevk>
i know

[07:21:02.0000] <annevk>
i don't know

[07:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Apparently broken with IIS4 and 5

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think I remember people saying proxies were a problem for pipelining, more than servers

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.browsers.ms-windows/msg/6766229fd0b610ca?hl=en

[07:27:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
yea, it's troublesome for high performance servers too.

[07:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
which means you can't just ask the server whether it's non-buggy

[07:27:02.0000] <sebmarkbage>
But there's an additional gain by packaging it all together - You can gzip the content as a single unit.

[09:24:00.0000] <webben>
annevk or annevk2: re http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0872.html and "if we add APIs to <canvas> that make it do the same as SVG"

[09:24:01.0000] <webben>
it seems that some canvas UI developers don't regard being able to manipulate an accessibility API directly as anything like the same as having to build a DOM

[09:25:00.0000] <webben>
The guys behind Cappuchino took a close look at ARIA, and largely rejected it on the basis that it requires DOM manipulation.

[09:25:01.0000] <annevk>
right

[09:26:00.0000] <webben>
If there's a role for bolt-ons of this sort, it's likely to back widget systems like Cappuchino.

[09:26:01.0000] <annevk>
turning <canvas> into a DOM-based model would not make them happy

[09:26:02.0000] <webben>
I thought Rich was talking about an accessibility API model rather than a DOM model.

[09:26:03.0000] <webben>
which seems to match what the Cappuchino guys were asking for

[09:27:00.0000] <webben>
http://rossboucher.com/2009/03/01/limitations-of-the-wai-aria/

[09:27:01.0000] <webben>
is the post I'm thinking of.

[09:27:02.0000] <annevk>
thanks

[09:27:03.0000] <annevk>
Rich was talking about an object model as well as an accessibility API as far as I can tell

[09:27:04.0000] <webben>
okay

[09:28:00.0000] <annevk>
but yeah, maybe we do need an API

[09:28:01.0000] <webben>
I'm not sure of the practical differences between a DOM and accessibility API manipulation (I've not done any desktop GUI programming).

[09:28:02.0000] <annevk>
I just don't think we should rush into it

[09:28:03.0000] <annevk>
I don't want another ARIA

[09:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Darxus: Irony, idioms, implications, etc remain in any language

[09:30:01.0000] <annevk>
webben, btw, "As far as Cappuccino implementation is concerned, there is enough in ARIA that we can significantly enhance the accessibility of Cappuccino, if not 100%."

[09:30:02.0000] <webben>
annevk: I think that reflects the fact that Cappuchino isn't entirely Canvas.

[09:31:00.0000] <webben>
there's a lot of divitis and spanitis "controls" in there too.

[09:31:01.0000] <webben>
so there's already DOM hooks for some things

[09:31:02.0000] <annevk>
as I said in my latest email, entirely <canvas> is not what <canvas> is meant for

[09:31:03.0000] <webben>
Sure.

[09:31:04.0000] <annevk>
it's an indication of other deeper flaws that need fixing

[09:32:00.0000] <annevk>
and his example of SVG is bogus afaict, since SVG does have a DOM

[09:32:01.0000] <annevk>
so that leaves Bespin

[09:32:02.0000] <webben>
yep

[09:32:03.0000] <webben>
i doubt Bespin will be the last tho.

[09:34:00.0000] <annevk>
I'll counter with premature optimization

[09:36:00.0000] <annevk>
webben, you have a point though and I hope you keeping dropping by to make them ;) (don't want to be entirely dismissive)

[09:45:00.0000] <webben>
annevk: will do :)

annevk: So what? It's going to die as soon as the sale goes through anyhow.

[09:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, not to worry, if it gets sold, TPB will be dead in a month anyway

[09:56:00.0000] <annevk>
it's the principle

[09:56:01.0000] <annevk>
also, the main guy in charge of the sale apparently quit and there's some rumor over lack of sufficient money

[09:56:02.0000] <annevk>
in any case, I don't like it that this is possible at all

[09:56:03.0000] <annevk>
I don't mind the consequences so much

[09:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, from what I've read about it, your legal system has been abused by BREIN

[09:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: Element.children is in the IDL in web dom core at least

[10:03:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, ^^

[10:03:01.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, BRAIN sucks donkey balls

[10:03:02.0000] <annevk>
really

[10:03:03.0000] <annevk>
BREIN*

[10:18:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if Leif realizes that </ no longer needs to be escaped because we removed SGML cruft, not because we kept it around...

[10:20:00.0000] <annevk>
then again, he compares JavaScript and PHP as if they are the same and does not see the logic in treating one as a first-class Web citizen and the other as yet another server-side templating language...

[10:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I have problems taking the proposal seriously myself

[10:34:00.0000] <Darxus>
Dashiva: Yes but Lajlan has stuff to indicate what is an irony, idiom, etc..

[10:35:00.0000] <Darxus>
Lojban, sorry.  I keep getting it confused with the spelling of its predecessor.

[10:36:00.0000] <Darxus>
"pe'a" "marks a construct as figurative (non-literal/metaphorical) speech/text

[10:36:01.0000] <Darxus>
"

[10:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray for "begs the question" vs "raises the question"

[10:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
particularly when someone actually uses the former correctly (as far as I can tell), and then gets told off for doing so

[10:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Darxus: That's same level

[10:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But you can still use real irony, without the marker

[11:02:00.0000] <annevk>
oh crap

[11:02:01.0000] <annevk>
dates discussion

[12:51:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
hmm… -0.01% idle CPU time.

[12:58:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
annevk: About packages. It may be better to supply it as an alternative download for compatibility. <img src="file.jpg" psrc="archive.tgz#file.jpg" /> { background-image: url(file.jpg); background-image: purl(archive.tgz#file.jpg); } I don't think it needs it's own protocol/scheme.

[13:04:00.0000] <annevk>
well, dunno if they're really needed (see HTTP pipelining which would be much neater) and that syntax does not solve the issue I raised

[13:11:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
annevk: HTTP pipelining needs major fixes to make that viable. Timeout issues for servers, broken servers, broken proxies... And you don't get the added benefit of compressing the traffic as a unit.

[13:12:00.0000] <annevk>
is that a major benefit?

[13:12:01.0000] <sebmarkbage>
What issue did you raise? Fragment identifiers? The multipart, tar, etc. already has identifiers.

[13:12:02.0000] <annevk>
yes, fragment identifiers

[13:14:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
On text data, at least, it's a major benefit to compress multiple small parts as a single unit. Hence .tar.gz and not .gz.tar

[13:19:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
annevk: As I see it, there's nothing in the URI specs that would prevent one from using the fragment to identify a part of a multipart document. Of course it needs to be speced. But there's no need to define an additional protocol or URI scheme.

[13:24:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
rfc2854 for text/html, rfc5147 for text/plain, rfcXXXX for multipart/mixed

[13:42:00.0000] <annevk>
sebmarkbage, the issue is how I'd use a fragment identifier for the document then

[13:48:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
annevk: Well that would depend on the format chosen. application/tar obviously has filenames. multipart/form-data has a name attribute in Content-Disposition. multipart/related has Content-ID...

[13:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Are you able to SSH to Dreamhost? (I get "ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host" whenever I try on hobgoblin)

[13:57:00.0000] <annevk>
me too

[13:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Okay

[14:00:00.0000] <annevk>
sebmarkbage, then it doesn't work

[14:01:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, not sure why it doesn't work

[14:02:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, if it still doesn't tomorrow I'll ask DreamHost

[14:02:01.0000] <annevk>
(unless you're in a hurry then I can do it in a few minutes)

[14:02:02.0000] <sebmarkbage>
annevk, if one format is chosen as a standard for something like psrc, I don't see why. All the parts are already there. All you'd have to do is specify how the fragment part is suppose to be handled for mime type: multipart/x

[14:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: No hurry :-)

[14:07:00.0000] <annevk>
sebmarkbage, say for an SVG file I need to use a fragment identifier to get a particular effect; as in /example.svg#view... (forgot the syntax); how do I express that if example.svg is packaged?

[14:12:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
annevk, rfc3986 (generic uri) allows for the possibility of multiple #, so: /archive.tgz#example.svg#view...

[14:13:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
if the particular format chosen allows for # in the identifier, I guess it'd be encoded

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2009JulSep/0397.html (Yngve on tab-level cookies)

[20:38:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
not to interrupt anybody's stellar evening, just wanting to stir up conversation with regards to an email I sent to the list: http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-July/021578.html

[21:13:00.0000] <bchoate>
will the html5 specification include requirements about the content generated for the 'contenteditable' attribute? i'd love to see an acid test for that one...

[21:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
bchoate: what kind of requirements?

[21:20:00.0000] <bchoate>
MikeSmith: that browsers produce valid html5 markup for instance

[21:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
bchoate: 

[21:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
bchoate: ah

[21:21:00.0000] <bchoate>
and preferably not include garbage like class="Apple-style-span" or class="Mso-Normal", etc.

[21:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
interesting case.. I don't think it's currently a requirement that they produce valid html

[21:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
one man's garbage is another man's feature

[21:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nathanhammond: seems like some of those are questions that Hixie needs to answer himself. And he seems particularly snowed under lately, so I'd guess you might have to wait for a bit before you get a reply from him.

[21:23:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
MikeSmith: I was getting that impression

[21:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nathanhammond: I'd suspect it's possible that Hixie may not have even made time yet to read that message.

[21:23:02.0000] <nathanhammond>
/me nods

[21:24:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
I was guessing that may be the case.

[21:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nathanhammond: but regardless, I'd recommend continuing to ask here

[21:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and all that

[21:25:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
indeed, and I was curious if anybody else had comments

[21:25:01.0000] <nathanhammond>
but as is probably the case most of the time people are very interested in one subsection of the spec

[21:26:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
(just like me)

[21:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[21:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sometimes it seems to me like the blind men and the elephant

[21:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nathanhammond: especially in context of some of the "HTML5 is a mess" comments

[21:28:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
and you just hope that all of the blind men get a chance to explain what their experience is

[21:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
what most people mean when they say that kind of stuff is, "This one particular part of the spec, which is the main/only part that I care about personally, is a mess."

[21:28:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
nathanhammond: yeah

[21:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nathanhammond: so are you the owner for the history feature in Chrome? the UI and all?

[21:57:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
MikeSmith: I am not, I mostly stick to client-side code

[21:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[21:58:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
I wrote JSSM and am working on a HTML 5 History shim

[22:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nathanhammond: I've never tried JSSM, but will take a look

[22:04:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
don't!

[22:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
?

[22:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
my main history-management mechanism is to keep a bunch of tabs open

[22:04:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would really like to have something better and easier/natural to use

[22:04:04.0000] <nathanhammond>
hah, this is for websites

[22:04:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[22:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
my beef with most History features is that they just get in my way

[22:05:01.0000] <nathanhammond>
I agree, I do the tab thing

[22:05:02.0000] <nathanhammond>
with session saving on close

[22:05:03.0000] <nathanhammond>
(in the event that Flash pegs the cpu)

[22:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me reads more about JSSM and also http://nathanhammond.com/google-chrome-and-history-management

[22:08:01.0000] <nathanhammond>
out of date now

[22:08:02.0000] <nathanhammond>
*grin*

[22:09:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
but I still haven't been able to track down that issue.

[22:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
no resolution on the bug?

[22:12:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
the last time I tried to track it down I still could not successfully isolate it

[22:12:01.0000] <nathanhammond>
I hear rumor that the issue has disappeared in current versions of Chrome

[22:13:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
but without the unit tests that I've been writing for the updated version it really hasn't been a mature project

[22:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
nathanhammond: i'm about 10 days behind on the list

[22:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
bchoate: the spec says that the UA must generate valid content

[22:30:00.0000] <bchoate>
Hixie: oh that's good to hear -- where does it say that? i'm looking at http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html but maybe that isn't the latest draft?

[22:30:01.0000] <nathanhammond>
Hixie: I'll be patient. *grin*

[22:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
bchoate: for example, under "break block": "The exact behavior is UA-dependent, but user agents must not, in response to a request to break a paragraph, generate a DOM that is less conformant than the DOM prior to the request."

[22:33:00.0000] <bchoate>
Hixie: ok i see - thanks

[01:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: why is xmp equivalent to code rather than pre?

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: is that wrong?

[01:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: i thought it was an inline element, no?

[01:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't look too closely

[01:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
so i may well have gotten it wrong

[02:13:00.0000] <takkaria>
hmm, how many windows-1252 documents are mislabelled as iso-* encodings?  I'm betting it's more than .2%

[02:18:00.0000] <annevk2>
who made that claim?

[02:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk2, Larry did when he made a sarcastic comment saying "The advice for the few "public browser" implementors who feel compelled to also deal with the increasing their compatibility with existing web sites from 67% to 67.2% of existing content by supporting odd, broken character transformations."

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me sighs

[02:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip` can probably get you a list of iso-8859-1 pages that use the win1252 characters easily enough

[02:21:02.0000] <annevk2>
maybe all Adobe employees have mandatory "how to act like a troll" training

[02:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me notices it's less than 8 hours until his meeting, and decides to not go to his meeting

[02:22:01.0000] <annevk2>
I'm not really interested in proving him wrong

[02:22:02.0000] <annevk2>
Done that a lot before and he just continues to apply his rethoric to something completely different ignoring what you said

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently i'm working on a fork of html5

[02:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
larry masinter never did reply to my e-mail asking him what he meant by that

[02:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
I don't trivially have that data (e.g. http://philip.html5.org/data/charsets.html says 100% of iso-8859-1 pages were considered valid by the decoder, probably because it doesn't forbid win-1252 characters)

[02:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
speaking of people who don't reply to e-mail...

[02:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
and would probably have to write more Java code to extract that data

[02:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I don't care enough

[02:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i just meant search for [\x80-\x9f]

[02:24:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I'd have to write code to search for that

[02:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
grep won't do it?

[02:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
grep won't restrict it to iso-8859-1-declared pages

[02:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what "his meeting" is

[02:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'd search for it myself, but unfortunately my corpus is post-conversion-to-utf-8

[02:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
takkaria: I was going to comment on that, but I lost heart before I finished my email reply

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: are we going to have a survey on who is attending the meeting in november?

[02:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What should typeof HTMLElement give?

[02:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
the alternative helding it at Google proposal is not going through btw?

[02:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I assume Larry simply used the term fork incorrectly to refer to your's and Manu's specs as competing alternatives, rather than Manu's as simply being a supplimentary section to be considered for inclusion.

[02:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
isn't Manu's spec in fact a full-text alternative?

[02:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: There are both forms

[02:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
should be easy to recast as a standalone spec, then, if the author were so inclined

[02:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, AIUI, when he generates it, he takes the trunk at the time and inserts his new section into it, and then publishes both as a standalone and incorporated version

[02:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I do note though that he didn't remove the microdata section, at least not yet

[02:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yeah, I set up the survey already

[02:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, what survey?

[02:32:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll get the URL

[02:32:03.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I guess Hixie meant the TPAC survey

[02:32:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: yeah

[02:32:05.0000] <othermaciej>
which makes me wonder even more why Sam felt compelled to mix microdata into my suggestion about RDFa

[02:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I hope it's not too late to register for TPAC, as I have been too lazy to do so

[02:33:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: xmp a block element

[02:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: huh go figure

[02:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: i'll fix it, thanks

[02:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, I don't believe it is

[02:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Otherwise, no-one at Opera will be attended, as we're all waiting on Chaals to make up his mind about who to send

[02:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: done

[02:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
when does the price go up?

[02:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's $250 each right now right?

[02:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
for the week?

[02:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
really? That's a lot.  Didn't it used to be $50?  Did it go up once already, or have I just remembered incorrectly?

[02:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: $50 per day

[02:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok.

[02:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Did someone here not link to something by Steven Pemberton yesterday?

[02:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
s/yesterday/two days ago/

[02:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.pemberton.nl/vandf/2009/07/xhtml2-not-dead.html

[02:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Many people did not link to it

[02:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Many did not, but annevk did

[02:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"Ian Hickson sings the praise of those modules elsewhere."

[02:56:00.0000] <tkent_>
Why the return type of HTMLInputElement::list() is HTMLElement instead of HTMLDataListElement?

[02:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: it's not too late. I'll try to get the green light on announcing the registration survey by beginning of next week

[02:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: please cajole hyatt into going, if you can

[02:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: it's less convenient for hyatt than for me, but I'll ask if he's interested

[02:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and would be great to meet other webkit folks f2f

[02:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Apple people based in Cupertino would be more likely to be available

[02:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, understood

[02:58:01.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan, I thought that was funny too; the post he points to is 7y old or so :)

[02:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Was Dean Jackson not the only Apple guy last year?

[02:58:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dave Singer was there too

[02:58:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I seem to remember at least

[02:58:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't remember meeting him…

[02:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
if othermaciej can get hyatt to go, i'll be impressed

[02:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
tkent_: ping Hixie about that

[02:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hyatt hates standards meetings

[02:59:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me on the whole doubts he'll be going

[02:59:04.0000] <tkent_>
Hixie, how about that?

[03:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if it's worth pointing out that the 'decentralised' identifier problem can't be solved with DNS, because DNS relies on centralised authorities, and all you're doing is pushing the centralisation away by a few levels of abstraction

[03:01:01.0000] <heycam>
gsnedders, "object"

[03:01:02.0000] <heycam>
(for typeof HTMLElement)

[03:01:03.0000] <gsnedders>
heycam: k, thx

[03:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
tkent: i think at some point <select> was allowed as a target also

[03:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am mainly interested in going for the chance to meet people in person that I might not have met at all, or don't get to talk to regularly

[03:02:02.0000] <othermaciej>
not really expecting valuable technical breakthroughs

[03:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: in practice, dns is decentralised enough

[03:03:00.0000] <tkent>
Hixie: ok, I understand.  Thanks.

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, while you're reporting things like HTMLUnknownElement maybe you should investigate XMLDocument and such too

[03:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: I'm really working on other stuff now though

[03:04:02.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, never mind then

[03:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
hey i don't suppose any of you feel like writing the scripts that would autogenerate the index tables would you?

[03:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
i recently figured out what the columns should be 

[03:05:00.0000] <annevk2>
it looked pretty complex

[03:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
we've never had HTMLUnknownElement

[03:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if Yahoo Mail Beta fails for us, or does something different

[03:05:03.0000] <gsnedders>
A generic index of all dfns I have a plan for

[03:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: You get WebKit specific JS

[03:05:05.0000] <gsnedders>
(Likewise IE gets its own too)

[03:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does Opera get the same as Firefox?

[03:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
HTMLUnknownElement seems like a really goofy idea, but I guess it's far from the dumbest thing in the web platform

[03:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: The "enough" is just a consequence of various factors (like the ease of registering non-conflicting names, and robustness to failures, etc), rather than there being a fundamental binary difference to e.g. a centralised wiki page, so there might be lots of other options that are somewhere in the middle

[03:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: I haven't checked exactly, but from the brief look I took it seems so

[03:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if you send an e-mail saying we shouldn't have it, that's pretty much all it would take to convince me to go back to using HTMLElement

[03:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: preaching to the choir :-)

[03:07:03.0000] <Philip`>
so I think it's a bit misleading to think of decentralised vs centralised, because it's all just different degrees of where the centralisation occurs

[03:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(it seems bogus because it can stop working if an element stops being "unknown", and also because many actual recognizedelements are just vanilla HTMLElement, so it seems weird to cater more to unrecognized ones)

[03:08:01.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, why did we not want the WebKit codepath?

[03:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
no argument from me there

[03:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
As long as websites break if we remove it (esp. high profile ones like Y! Mail beta), it's unlikely we'll remove it

[03:08:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Good, that must mean I'm not totally crazy (at least relative to this environment) :-)

[03:08:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: send mail :-)

[03:08:06.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: I tried UA sniffing, and it never finished loading

[03:08:07.0000] <gsnedders>
*spoofing

[03:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2009JulSep/0125.html touche othermaciej!

[03:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll consider it tomorrow and maybe send mail

[03:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Make the browser detect if the user works for Yahoo, and if so then do the sane thing that breaks Yahoo Mail, so they notice and fix the problem, without it affecting many real users

[03:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[03:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's a good thing to use as an example for how to use microdata

[03:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: yeah I wasn't sure if I should send that, but I have forgiven myself this minor sin

[03:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: http://quotes.burntelectrons.org/4288

[03:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: semantic markup for photos of a model train collection?

[03:11:02.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, markup for your StarGate DVD collection?

[03:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
or has that example been overused?

[03:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
let me rephrase my question

[03:11:05.0000] <Philip`>
It seems better to have examples that would be slightly more relevant for normal people

[03:11:06.0000] <Hixie>
what's a good thing to use as an example for how to use microdata *that someone would actually care about and do something with*

[03:11:07.0000] <gsnedders>
/me ignores othermaciej for his rudeness in that email

[03:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
rather than your typical semantic web examples of "mark everything up and maybe it'll be useful one day"

[03:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Do we actually have examples like that in HTML 5? :\

[03:12:02.0000] <takkaria>
are there any such examples?

[03:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: it wasn't chronic!

[03:12:04.0000] <gsnedders>
How dull.

[03:12:05.0000] <othermaciej>
(can't say as to insufferable)

[03:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Something from the list of use cases that motivated the inclusion of microdata in the spec

[03:13:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, markup for a TV guide?

[03:13:02.0000] <mookid>
ahah ..?

[03:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: what kind of "do something with" - are you interested in examples with prior agreement between producer and consumer, or does it have to be data that unknown unrelated consumers may want?

[03:13:04.0000] <othermaciej>
one example for the prior case would be bugzilla

[03:13:05.0000] <annevk2>
nm that suggestion

[03:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
the main use cases were all vcard and vevent related, but i want something where you make up your own vocab, for this example

[03:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
bugzilla HTML markup changes between different versions, so a script can't reliably screen-scrape

[03:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i guess either is fine

[03:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
ooh, bugzilla's a good one

[03:14:04.0000] <othermaciej>
the XML version is more reliable but completely separate

[03:14:05.0000] <mookid>
=)

[03:14:06.0000] <othermaciej>
microdata would let you parse the HTML and reliably extract data in the face of markup changes

[03:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Microdata would make the extracted data extremely fragile because it would keep breaking whenever someone changed the markup and forgot to check the microdata was identical in all cases

[03:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: But why not use the XML interface?

[03:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
though in general consumers will intend to work with bugzilla specifically and don't need a generic central "bug database" vocabulary

[03:15:03.0000] <mookid>
or you could negotiate content and use a more appropriate format than HTML for data interchange? :D

[03:15:04.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: less risk of inconsistency if there's only one interface

[03:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: Indeed. But there are already two interfaces.

[03:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
mookid: if using a separate non-HTML formatted value is an appropriate solution, then clearly microdata (or RDFa) won't help

[03:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: well, two responses on that

[03:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(1) but would you design it like that from scratch? we shouldn't assume bugzilla is the only bugzilla-like piece of software ever to be made

[03:17:02.0000] <mookid>
do you have to have a head node in an html document for it to be valid?

[03:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: Yes, and title within it.

[03:18:01.0000] <mookid>
is there a reason for that?

[03:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(2) we're intending to customize bugzilla a fair bit for WebKit, and reliable semantic markup in the HTML would be easier to keep in sync with changes than a whole separate XML version

[03:18:03.0000] <Philip`>
mookid: (The head *tags* are optional, though the element is required)

[03:18:04.0000] <mookid>
what's the logic behind that descision?

[03:18:05.0000] <takkaria>
page titles are an essential part of a page

[03:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: (1) No; (2) But it seems likely that things already rely upon Bugzilla's XML interface ;(

[03:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
* :(

[03:19:02.0000] <mookid>
how are they essential? :/

[03:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: search results would be another good example, if search engines wanted to enable screen scraping instead of being kind of hostile to it

[03:19:04.0000] <mookid>
<head><title></title></head> - valid?

[03:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
you forgot a doctype

[03:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: the bug example is fine

[03:20:02.0000] <mookid>
-_-

[03:20:03.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: No, you need a DOCTYPE and a body element

[03:20:04.0000] <takkaria>
mookid: <!DOCTYPE html><title</title> I believe is the shortest valid bit of HTML

[03:20:05.0000] <mookid>
yeah yeah I just mean the head element

[03:20:06.0000] <othermaciej>
any example I can think of is vulnerable to the criticism that you could just provide a completely separate data interface

[03:20:07.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yeah, well, there's a reason i'm not a fan of this whole technology concept

[03:20:08.0000] <mookid>
why do you require the title though - I don't understand why you would insist on that

[03:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
however, in the case of bugzilla, having the machine-readable data combined with the human-readable presentation seems intuitively appealing

[03:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
to me anyway

[03:21:02.0000] <annevk2>
mookid: whatwg⊙wo or public-html-comments⊙wo

[03:21:03.0000] <mookid>
:/

[03:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: I think you might want more >s in there

[03:22:01.0000] <mookid>
I don't want to change anything I just want to understand the rationale

[03:22:02.0000] <annevk2>
fair enough, I don't really have any :)

[03:22:03.0000] <takkaria>
Philip`: yeah, a couple more won't hurt

[03:22:04.0000] <mookid>
:)

[03:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I imagine the rationale would be that many systems present HTML documents by title, thus lacking one would be considered an error

[03:23:01.0000] <mookid>
doesn't enforcing a title/head element kind of damage HTML as a decent 'fragment' format?

[03:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(examples of places where the title shows up: browser titlebar, browser history, browser bookmarks, search engine search results)

[03:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
if you just want a fragment you do not need a full document (or title)

[03:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
an HTML fragment doesn't need to be a conforming HTML document

[03:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Browser tabs too)

[03:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
although I'm not sure there is a conformance class for it

[03:24:04.0000] <mookid>
if(!title) title = 'Zomg the end of the world!1!1';

[03:25:00.0000] <mookid>
you're welcome.

[03:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
presumably the fragment context would have to define what kinds of fragments are allowed, and the processing model

[03:25:02.0000] <mookid>
annevk2: that's not true if I want my fragments to be crawlable and valid html

[03:27:00.0000] <mookid>
think that's a fair requirement, no?

[03:27:01.0000] <annevk2>
I need some more context for your use case

[03:29:00.0000] <mookid>
website that uses html fragments/Ajax also wants individual fragments to be crawlable and valid markup

[03:29:01.0000] <mookid>
for SEO etc.

[03:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what happened to onbeforeunload?

[03:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me is auditing the list of event-handler attributes that v.nu knows about against the list in the spec

[03:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
btw Lachy the blog is still suffering from the effects of a hacker

[03:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: it's in, isn't it?

[03:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: it's not in the list in the Global Attributes section

[03:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't think

[03:34:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me doublechecks

[03:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's not a global attribute

[03:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[03:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's only on <body> (and <frameset>, though since that element is obsolete, that doesn't matter much)

[03:35:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[03:35:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[03:35:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me hits himself with clue stick

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
um, if i try to preview a blog post on blog.whatwg.org i get asked for a Magic password?

[03:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I don't get asked for a password

[03:39:01.0000] <annevk2>
mookid, titles are important for SEO

[03:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: "To view this page, you must log in to area âMagicâ on blog.whatwg.org:80."

[03:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's for http://blog.whatwg.org/?p=924&preview=true

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
it worked when i reloaded

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
wtf

[03:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
works for me

[03:41:03.0000] <annevk2>
interesting, WordPress does not lowercase href attributes

[03:41:04.0000] <othermaciej>
darn, I got goaded into writing an anti-namespace jeremiad

[03:41:05.0000] <Lachy>
Is there anything else to appears to be a result of a hacker?

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
I almost started flaming back at Larry, but I'll instead pull a Larry and not reply

[03:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: do you see the spam on the front page?

[03:42:02.0000] <annevk2>
trying to correct all his misconceptions about how the Web works is not worth it

[03:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: or you could pull a Larry by sarcastically misrepresenting his point, and then accusing him of using a strawman argument

[03:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: oh, looks like you fixed it

[03:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
you guys are killing me

[03:43:03.0000] <Lachy>
no

[03:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me schedules 2pm-3pm tomorrow for responding to e-mails from people reading the chat log and complaining to me for not telling you off for being rude about people who are being rude

[03:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: usually takes the log trawlers more than 24 hours to embark on their fishing expeditions

[03:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, were you looking at a cached copy of the page?

[03:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yeah, maybe

[03:44:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
clearly i don't know how to use web browsers

[03:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
whoah, MLW is now trolling in near real-time

[03:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
soon i'll be ready to work for w3c

[03:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
i am happy to say that i haven't looked at MLW in at least 6 months now, possibly more

[03:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, yeah, I have a strong suspicion that MLW is someone who is in this channel

[03:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
I just haven't figured out who

[03:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I hadn't looked in a while until you mentioned having to deal with people reading the chat log

[03:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
I was subscribed to that blog for a while, but it got really boring

[03:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the sarcastic posts can be amusing but lately it seems he's descended to just stringing together swear words

[03:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
MLW has also claimed to affiliated with the W3C in some way http://twitter.com/MrLastWeek/status/2530468490

[03:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
though, admittedly, the message is vague and it isn't clear what "activities of an official W3C nature" may be.

[03:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think we just gave him more attention than he deserves

[03:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
mea culpa

[03:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, blogged about microdata on the whatwg blog

[03:58:00.0000] <mookid>
link!

[03:58:01.0000] <mookid>
make sure it's got a .html on the end of it please

[03:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
mookid, why?

[03:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://blog.whatwg.org/microdata1

[04:00:00.0000] <mookid>
just being an idiot, ignore me

[04:00:01.0000] <mookid>
:)

[04:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I think your examples would be less misleading if they used a real domain, instead of something unnaturally short like example.org, e.g. it's going to be more like <body item="org.mozilla.bugzilla.bug">

[04:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it could just as easily be org.mozilla.bug

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
it would actually just be org.bugzilla.bug

[04:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is only one character longer

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
i considered using ch.hixie.bug, since that's what i would use

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
(and that's even shorter!)

[04:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. bed time. nn.

[04:05:01.0000] <annevk2>
I saw a 4 character domain the other day, something like a.gh or some such

[04:05:02.0000] <gavin_>
http://e.dk/

[04:05:03.0000] <annevk2>
/me thought the minimum was 4

[04:05:04.0000] <annevk2>
5, doh

[04:06:00.0000] <annevk2>
Lachy, so we fixed the spam problem on the blog we found the other day?

[04:06:01.0000] <annevk2>
Lachy, also, can we upload a new skin that at least enables people to see the name of the person who posted?

[04:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
annevk2, yeah. Some hacker had somehow modified the templates. That's now been removed and prevented

[04:06:03.0000] <annevk2>
Lachy, it would be even better if turned on the skin Ben made

[04:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
which skin did Ben make?

[04:07:01.0000] <annevk2>
a nice green one

[04:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
Has it been uploaded to blog.whatwg.org?

[04:07:03.0000] <annevk2>
I don't think so

[04:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
or is it available from somewhere?

[04:08:00.0000] <annevk2>
actually, it was not a skin, it was a design done in HTML/CSS

[04:08:01.0000] <annevk2>
but it would be easy to make the blog use it I think, maybe email him?

[04:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://a.gd/

[04:08:03.0000] <Lachy>
well, if someone converts it to a WP template, I can install it easily

[04:08:04.0000] <annevk2>
MikeSmith, cheerio

[04:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
what's his email?

[04:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
➡.ws is only four characters too

[04:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
not in ASCII

[04:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
Who cares about ASCII?

[04:10:02.0000] <annevk2>
HTTP

[04:11:00.0000] <mookid>
who cares about HTTP?

[04:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
Who cares that HTTP cares about ASCII?

[04:11:02.0000] <Lachy>
doesn't HTTP use ISO-8859-1?

[04:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
(I don't care that it's a superset of ASCII)

[04:12:01.0000] <annevk2>
(I don't care about your question)

[04:12:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't care.

[04:12:03.0000] <annevk2>
great :)

[04:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, another lawsuit against TPB http://torrentfreak.com/italian-riaa-suesthe-pirate-bay-for-1-million-euros-090731/

[04:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
I guess the MAFIAA are just going to keep suing them in every country they can

[04:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
what better things have they go to do with themselves, really?

[04:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, they could spend their time and money on developing better and more sustainable business models

[04:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Suing people for a million dollars seems like a good business model

[04:22:01.0000] <takkaria>
what, rather than operating under the assumption that one day the Internet will be un-invented?

[04:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
not when they know the defendants won't pay

[04:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me emailed Ben

[04:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, very few things have been uninvented

[04:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess lots of things invented in ancient Egypt and ancient Greece etc have been uninvented

[04:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
if you consider uninvented to mean technology that we have lost all knowledge of through history

[04:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes - inventing is the gaining of knowledge of how to do something, and uninventing is the losing of that knowledge

[04:28:00.0000] <takkaria>
Lachy: I think my preferred approach for them would be just to keep on doing what they're doing except keep the money they're paying lawyers for themselves

[04:29:00.0000] <takkaria>
that way they'll retire earlier and eventually new people will start managing the music companies who have a clue

[04:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why everyone focuses on TPB when there's dozens of other large torrent sites

[04:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, mininova and isohunt have started talking to the movie industry I believe to start self-censoring

[04:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't remember it taking long for TPB to gain prominence when Suprnova was shut down

[04:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
TPB will probably die in a month anyway, and openbittorrent.org and publicbt.org will take over as the word's main trackers, and torrent files will start being distributed through other means, raising the bar for the MAFIAA again

[04:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
so I suppose I'm assuming someone else will take over in the near future

[04:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Trackers aren't really interesting - the important thing is a decent-quality searchable index of torrents, which is an orthogonal problem

[04:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
it wouldn't surprise me if someone set up a torrent site that is run using technoloy like Freenet, so that they don't host the material themselves and anyone is free to anonymously add torrents to the network

[04:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
How do you ensure quality in that situation?

[04:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
that would be a challenge

[04:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Indeed

[04:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
but even TPB didn't do much to ensure quality, since they never removed torrents

[04:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
As far as I'm aware they managed to avoid being overwhelmed by mislabelled torrents and virus-infected programs

[04:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It's particularly a problem when people are being paid to intentionally disrupt the system and reduce its value to users)

[04:40:00.0000] <takkaria>
I think the most likely end result is most people using a wider spread of trackers

[04:41:00.0000] <takkaria>
and tools may emerge to make that really much easier

[04:41:01.0000] <takkaria>
e.g. trackers supporting OpenSearch and a site/app searching a lot of trackers for you

[04:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
could become built-in to torrent apps themselves

[04:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why would the people running trackers want to cooperate with the people who are running aggregators/search engines and taking all the ad revenue away from the trackers?

[04:46:00.0000] <takkaria>
non-profit trackers?

[04:46:01.0000] <takkaria>
 / other private trackers

[04:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, trackers like openbittorrent.org and publicbt.org aren't ad supported. But are you referring to sites that actually host the torrents?

[04:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
it would be nice to have a service dedicated to hosting the torrents files, and only providing an API for indexing sites

[04:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
that would make the search sites largely immune from lawsuits since, like Google and other search engines, they don't host or have any control over the torrents themselves

[05:01:00.0000] <mookid>
look what I found!

[05:01:01.0000] <mookid>
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/paper/view/814/oracle-814.pdf (not a pdf!)

[05:02:00.0000] <mookid>
I guess they didn't get the "URI's have special endings because that's what the most cleverest(tm) developers do" memo

[05:03:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe they got the memo that stated that URIs are opaque strings

[05:04:00.0000] <mookid>
huhuhu :)

[05:04:01.0000] <mookid>
couldn't agree more.

[05:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if IE copes

[05:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(As don't IE still do sniffing based upon extension?)

[05:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.theage.com.au/technology/biz-tech/shock-threat-to-shut-skype-20090731-e3qe.html

[05:07:01.0000] <mookid>
[13:37] <Philip`> If you encode the desired content-type in the URI, it's not possible for a general-purpose HTTP-processing device to understand what's the resource identifier and what's the content-type selector, because there's no standard for encoding that stuff in URIs

[05:08:00.0000] <mookid>
[13:38] <Hixie> Philip`: such a standard or convention could be easily established

[05:08:01.0000] <mookid>
:)

[05:08:02.0000] <mookid>
annevk2 ^

[05:08:03.0000] <takkaria>
Opera does some sniffing by file extension...

[05:09:00.0000] <mookid>
where is the spec that suggests that is a good idea?

[05:09:01.0000] <takkaria>
I imagine it's stuffed up someone's arse

[05:09:02.0000] <mookid>
if it's not in a spec that sounds like a very BAD idea

[05:09:03.0000] <takkaria>
it's a bad idea

[05:10:00.0000] <takkaria>
mostly because sniffing based on the first few  bytes is a far more effective streategy

[05:10:01.0000] <mookid>
or Content-Type header? -_-

[05:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: Content-Type sniffing in general is a bad idea, but needed for web compat., and until recently there was nowhere near any consensus on how to do it

[05:10:03.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: actually, sniffing is more effective

[05:10:04.0000] <annevk2>
in hindsight, content-type and content negotation were pretty bad ideas

[05:10:05.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: I never questioned that :P

[05:11:00.0000] <mookid>
this is the exact reason that HTTP has headers for.

[05:11:01.0000] <takkaria>
yeah, that was a mental typo.  s/gsnedders/mookid/

[05:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It's pure mental, like

[05:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes that joke will probably be lost on everyone outside of the UK

[05:12:00.0000] <takkaria>
and indeed, me

[05:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/the UK/Scotland/ then maybe

[05:12:02.0000] <mookid>
annevk2: you keep saying that about content negotiation

[05:12:03.0000] <mookid>
there is nothing to support that assertion whatsoever

[05:12:04.0000] <mookid>
other than the *pathetic* support for it in browsers/html which tend to dictate how web mechanisms are leveraged in practice

[05:13:00.0000] <mookid>
if you don't have html or browsers in your web architecture there is no problem with conneg at all

[05:13:01.0000] <takkaria>
there's also very little web. :)

[05:13:02.0000] <mookid>
...

[05:13:03.0000] <mookid>
HTTP is the web

[05:13:04.0000] <mookid>
URIs

[05:14:00.0000] <mookid>
html/browsers are a necessary evil

[05:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: Quite frankly, we've been over this several times here already. We've given plenty reasons to support that assertion, though they seemingly have fallen on deaf ears. You aren't going to get a different response by rehashing the same arguments. If you want to get a greater diversity of responses, email whatwg⊙wo/public-html-comments⊙wo

[05:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
I'm not really sure how to put my argument

[05:15:01.0000] <mookid>
annevk2: maybe you don't have one then? :p

[05:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: Well, I'm sure if you ask timbl he'll tell you originally HTTP _was_ HTML and URLs, and that everything else was added on later.

[05:15:03.0000] <annevk2>
I think what I believe is that if an idea does not get a good implementation over a decade it is simply not worth it and should be dropped (and is a bad idea in hindsight)

[05:16:00.0000] <mookid>
what tbl thinks is irrelevant realy

[05:16:01.0000] <mookid>
the web is HTTP/URIs

[05:16:02.0000] <mookid>
Services on HTTP and RIA's are the web

[05:18:00.0000] <mookid>
browsers and html are important to the web on a practical level but they don't actually have anything to do with the underlying architecture

[05:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You still awake?

[05:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders was just talking about the original idea of the Web

[05:19:01.0000] <mookid>
so what the original implementation of HTTP was pretty poorly concieved anyway

[05:19:02.0000] <annevk2>
and the Web and the fundamental architecture of it are separate concepts in my mind

[05:19:03.0000] <mookid>
the fundemental driver of success is the architecture

[05:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: It's a legacy you won't escape from, though, the poorly concieved original

[05:20:01.0000] <mookid>
not if we have standards bodies populated by individuals with the predisposition to continue this insanty, no.

[05:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
so do something about it

[05:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: Well you seem quite uninterested to actually do anything about it, and prefer to just complain on IRC.

[05:21:02.0000] <annevk2>
talking here won't really further your cause

[05:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
well, I suppose it might, but given the length of this conversation I'm pretty sure nobody is reading

[05:22:01.0000] <mookid>

Poor governance basically http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_failure

[05:22:05.0000] <annevk2>
also, I have the feeling that each time I chat with you you're saying the same things...

[05:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
(and I'm repeating myself too)

[05:23:01.0000] <mookid>
right - that's mainly because you repeat stuff that doesn't make sense

[05:23:02.0000] <mookid>
like

[05:23:03.0000] <mookid>
"conneg is broken"

[05:23:04.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: We've given plenty of reasons, too, but you've ignored them all.

[05:24:00.0000] <mookid>
mainly because you're rationale is based entirely on insufficiencies on markup/browser insufficiencies

[05:24:01.0000] <mookid>
and nothing to do with the actually Web

[05:24:02.0000] <mookid>
actual^

[05:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
ah-ha! "If the multiple attribute is absent, whenever an option element in the select element's list of options has its selectedness set to true, and whenever an option element with its selectedness set to true is added to the select element's list of options, the user agent must set the selectedness of all the other option element in its list of options to false."

[05:24:04.0000] <annevk2>
ok, i'll just ignore you now until you have something constructive

[05:24:05.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: We've given plenty of other reasons too.

[05:24:06.0000] <mookid>
you haven't actually mate I wouldn't waste my time if you had

[05:26:00.0000] <mookid>
if you point me to the part of the spec where Conneg is flawed, fair enough

[05:26:01.0000] <mookid>
otherwise you're just holding someone's head under the water and having a go at them for not being able to swim properly

[05:27:00.0000] <annevk2>
everyone can write a spec that is technically sound

[05:27:01.0000] <annevk2>
that does not mean it's good

[05:27:02.0000] <mookid>
ok so maybe next time the HTTP guys should do it with phonetically spelled words and nice pictures?

[05:28:00.0000] <mookid>
and special gold star stickers if you manage to actually read the damn spec properly

[05:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess the employees of W3C who wrote HTML 4.0 are equally incompetent in your view?

[05:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
If the W3C has been so incompetent for the past twelve years, what makes you think it will change?

[05:29:02.0000] <mookid>
I think they have way more excuses than you lot do.

[05:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mookid: I think your continual repetition of the same positions is not constructive and borders on trolling

[05:30:01.0000] <mookid>
terrific

[05:30:02.0000] <mookid>
ironically unconstructive comment

[05:30:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I will admit to having fed the troll before, but it's kind of getting old

[05:30:04.0000] <mookid>
thanks for sharing

[05:30:05.0000] <gsnedders>
What excuses do they have that we don't? Regardless, you're just giving the same arguments over and over again, and ignoring ours totally. If you want to try and get anywhere at all, mail the list. Bitching in IRC will make _absolutely no difference whatsoever_.

[05:31:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm giving the same arguments because ever 'response' I get contains invalid and irrelevant points that don't address what I actually said

[05:32:00.0000] <mookid>
I'll say this again - there is *nothing* wrong with HTTP conneg, and a lot wrong with browsers/html

[05:32:01.0000] <mookid>
if I avoid both of those I can leverage HTTP conneg fine

[05:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mookid: if you want to summarize your position in email (either whatwg⊙wo or public-html⊙wo, your choice), that would be useful

[05:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think repeating the same points over and over on IRC, and getting more or less the same responses, is not very useful

[05:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or you can file a bug at <http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/> in the HTML5 spec proposal component, with your concrete proposal

[05:35:00.0000] <mookid>
well I'm pretty sure there's some fundamental problems in my communication and/or your comprehension which are unlikely the magically dissapear in a 'conclusion'

[05:35:01.0000] <annevk2>
mookid, have you considered that you might not get our arguments?

[05:36:00.0000] <mookid>
well I'm pretty well versed in HTTP and working with it on a day to day basis

[05:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
mookid: I agree there is likely a communication and/or comprehension problem

[05:36:02.0000] <mookid>
so I have a good chance of 'getting' what you're saying

[05:36:03.0000] <annevk2>
the problems I'm pointing out have not so much to do with HTTP technicalities

[05:36:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I also think repeating the same things more times is not going to foster better communication

[05:36:05.0000] <annevk2>
not at all, I think

[05:37:00.0000] <mookid>
othermaciej: not if the people I'm talking to are interested in winning an argument rather than constructive discussion

[05:38:00.0000] <mookid>
annevk2: what are these problems then?

[05:38:01.0000] <mookid>
where do they come from.. browsers/html ? :P

[05:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
mookid: There are others here who are well versed in HTTP and work with it every day

[05:38:03.0000] <mookid>
sure, they have different design philosophies

[05:39:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm just telling you that I can't use HTTP conneg

[05:39:01.0000] <mookid>
it's there to be used and I can't practically use it because there's no browser/html mechanisms for it

[05:40:00.0000] <mookid>
both approaches (URI vs protocol) conneg would work fine along side each other

[05:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think you've made your position on the matter abundantly clear

[05:40:02.0000] <mookid>
do you mind?

[05:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
yes, I do

[05:40:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, characterising it as people who are interested in winning an argument rather than constructive discussion is _not_ going to help.

[05:40:05.0000] <othermaciej>
because you've been going on about it every day for weeks

[05:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and every day you repeat yourself

[05:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and this isn't #groundhogday

[05:41:02.0000] <mookid>
yeah that gandhi guy sure was irritating

[05:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so bring some new information or take it elsewhere

[05:41:04.0000] <mookid>
I beg your pardon?

[05:47:00.0000] <mookid>
'what about xyz?' - 'yeah well nevermind about xyz because I can juggle with fruit' - '......... what about xyz?'

[05:47:01.0000] <mookid>
'hey stop repeating yourself!'

[05:49:00.0000] <mookid>
a simple "its too much like hard work" would be fine if that's the reality of the situation

you don't understand why I brought that up or the content of the page?

right, that's what the article says, but why is it relevant? :)

it would be nice to think it isn't relevant at all

'Regulatory capture - The co-opting of regulatory agencies by members of or the entire regulated industry. Rent seeking and rational ignorance are two of the mechanisms which allow this to happen.'

[07:55:00.0000] <takkaria>
mookid: ok, I'm obviously not smart enough to see whatever you're inferring here

[07:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe he's calling us ignorant

[07:56:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm not really inferring anything to be honest, it  just is what it is

[07:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
So you're saying that a page exists on Wikipedia and describes something, and that's it?

[07:59:00.0000] <mookid>
more the concept of the content on that page phil.. :P

[08:00:00.0000] <mookid>
I don't really have a solid opinion one way or another because I don't actually know the details of how you guys operate

[08:01:00.0000] <mookid>

what mime type should I use to serve javascript?

[08:42:00.0000] <annevk>
doesn't matter

[08:42:01.0000] <jacobolus>
well, if I have to pick something...

[08:42:02.0000] <annevk>
you could not include a mime type

[08:42:03.0000] <jacobolus>
haha

[08:42:04.0000] <annevk>
IETF prefers applicatoin/ecmascript or application/javascript; HTML5 prefers text/javascript

[08:43:00.0000] <jacobolus>
text/javascript it is :)

[08:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
apache defaults to application/x-javascript i think

[08:43:02.0000] <jacobolus>
zcorpan: actually, application/javascript

[08:43:03.0000] <jacobolus>
at least on my mac

[08:43:04.0000] <zcorpan>
oh they changed

[08:44:00.0000] <jacobolus>
zcorpan: they also have an entry for "text/javascript" with no extension

[08:44:01.0000] <jacobolus>
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types

[08:44:02.0000] <zcorpan>
is that the latest mime.types for apache?

[08:44:03.0000] <jacobolus>
zcorpan: for some reason the python mimetypes module overrides javascript to do application/x-javascript

[08:44:04.0000] <jacobolus>
zcorpan: I assume it's the latest

[08:44:05.0000] <jacobolus>
it's in their svn

isn't HTTP just the wrong protocol if you need stateful client/server interaction?

[08:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
mookid: I thought you were in favour of adding features to the language just because somebody thinks they're useful and the language designers shouldn't get in their way, so you ought to be happy that they're working on cookies which lots of people find useful

no I'm in favour of adding features which provide mechanisms to leverage components of the underlying architecture of the web

[08:55:00.0000] <mookid>
no augment bullshit ontop of it like cookies

[08:55:01.0000] <mookid>
which exist because people try to do stupid things with HTTP

[08:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
They exist because people try to solve practical problems using HTTP

[08:56:00.0000] <mookid>
stateful interaction is mostly bad design

[08:57:00.0000] <mookid>
particularly on HTTP

[08:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
Or HTTP is badly designed for stateful interaction :-)

[08:58:00.0000] <mookid>
stateful interaction is a horrific way to build an anarchic scalable distributed system the size of the web

[09:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Most people aren't building the web, they're just building a single centralised web site with no need for scalability and it works fine for them

[09:04:00.0000] <mookid>
I'm talking about the why HTTP was designed the way it was

[09:04:01.0000] <mookid>
and why it was successful

[09:04:02.0000] <mookid>
that platform is 'the web'

[09:05:00.0000] <mookid>
I don't really see the problem with people creating systems that operate the same way the web does

[09:06:00.0000] <mookid>
not really hard to see why that might be a good idea in the long run as your domain evolves

[09:06:01.0000] <mookid>
the solution isn't cookies it's education and tooling

[09:07:00.0000] <cgriego>
I think reusing the legend element, given the issues, is a contradiction of the goal of backwards compatability.

[09:12:00.0000] <annevk>
cgriego, but that's not the only goal we have

[09:12:01.0000] <annevk>
cgriego, so it's not a simple as that ;)

[09:12:02.0000] <jacobolus>
huh. apache's list has the 'wav' extension twice, for audio/wav and audio/x-wav

[09:13:00.0000] <jacobolus>
I wonder how they decide precedence.  That's probably a bug

[09:13:01.0000] <jacobolus>
 /typo

[09:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jacobolus: judging by past experiences, if you file a bug now, they might get around to fixing it 5 years from now

[09:15:01.0000] <jacobolus>
heh

[09:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and you will get a lot of entertaining comments posted to the bug during that time, from a wide variety of genuine jackasses

[09:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
great entertainment value

[09:18:00.0000] <jacobolus>
python's mimetypes module overrides rdf and wsdl to be application/xml instead of application/rdf+xml & application/wsdl+xml

[09:18:01.0000] <jacobolus>
is there a good reason to send application/xml instead of the others?

[09:19:00.0000] <cgriego>
annevk: I think legend would be an excellent element to use with figure and details, except every major browser has issues with it, and not because they did anything wrong. HTML 4 defines legend, as a form element, to be a replaced element. Undoing that is a radical change in definition.

[09:26:00.0000] <annevk>
I don't think HTML4 defined it as such

[09:26:01.0000] <adactio>
cgriego: I agree. I tried to some DOM Scripting with <details> and it proved to be impossible because of the way that browsers interpret the presence of the <legend> element (Safari throws it away, Firefox generates a <fieldset>).

[09:26:02.0000] <adactio>
The problem is ...what's the alternative?

[09:27:00.0000] <annevk>
(in theory it should be treated as an unknown element outside of <fieldset>)

[09:27:01.0000] <annevk>
to elaborate a little bit, one of the other goals we have is keeping the language simple

[09:27:02.0000] <annevk>
and as browsers fix their bugs <legend> will become useful

[09:28:00.0000] <annevk>
it might take a little longer, but not having to introduce a new element seems worth it

[09:28:01.0000] <adactio>
annevk: I agree and I think that Safari and Firefox will probably fix this pretty quickly but IE (again) is going to really slow things down.

[09:29:00.0000] <adactio>
I've read through the arguments for and against <legend>: http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-February/014038.html

[09:29:01.0000] <adactio>
And I agree, in principle, that it's far more preferable to "recycle" an existing element than to create a new one.

[09:30:00.0000] <adactio>
But I'd really like to be able to use the new HTML5 elements and as long as some of them use <legend>, they're effectively out of bounds. :-(

[09:32:00.0000] <adactio>
Remy has a more detailed breakdown of the issues: http://html5doctor.com/legend-not-such-a-legend-anymore/

[09:32:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, it's dilemma

[09:32:02.0000] <taf2>
can a Worker be used to run canvas operations?

[09:32:03.0000] <annevk>
I guess so far we decided not to cater to the early adopter crowd :)

[09:32:04.0000] <takkaria>
taf2: sure

[09:33:00.0000] <annevk>
taf2, it can only process ImageData objects

[09:33:01.0000] <annevk>
takkaria, not really, there's no DOM in a Worker

[09:34:00.0000] <taf2>
annevk: but that is okay i think... for me... if i get the image data pass to a worker and mainipulate the data postMessage back to the main thread and putImageData...

[09:34:01.0000] <adactio>
annevk: Yeah, and that's fair enough. It's just a shame that so much doesn't need catering to (e.g. <section>, <article>, <header>); we can just go ahead and use them without waiting for browsers. On the face of it, <details> and <figure> should fall into the same category ...but that damned <legend> throws a spanner in the works.

[09:34:02.0000] <takkaria>
annevk: I meant you can do ImageData stuff, but you were more precise. :)

[09:35:00.0000] <annevk>
<div class="legend"> :/

[09:46:00.0000] <adactio>
annevk: yeah, that's what I'm doing for now with the new structural elements anyway (using class names rather than elements, as an interim step) so I can do that for anything requiring a <legend> too.

[09:47:00.0000] <cgriego>
Has anyone looked to see if similar issues arise with the caption element?

[09:48:00.0000] <annevk>
yes, it does not work because of <table> parsing

[09:48:01.0000] <adactio>
cgriego: I believe <caption> has its own issues because it is expected inside a table.

[10:03:00.0000] <cgriego>
How about <label>?

[10:04:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe you should read the email adactio pointed to

[10:05:00.0000] <cgriego>
good point

[12:18:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
As a conversation starter: http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-July/021578.html ... anybody have any thoughts regarding what I propose?

[12:23:00.0000] <annevk>
the order is already defined

[12:25:00.0000] <annevk>
not sure what to think of the rest

[12:25:01.0000] <annevk>
does that help? :)

[12:26:00.0000] <annevk>
(the order is defined because in step 5 popstate is dispatched (if needed) and in step 6 hashchange is dispatched (if needed)

[12:26:01.0000] <annevk>
)

[13:52:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
annevk: good to know about the ordering, and better that it matches what I'd hoped

[13:54:00.0000] <nathanhammond>
however, with the discussion I've read, it looks like popstate is only fired on history traversal, not on input (reasonable)
