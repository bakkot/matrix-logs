[17:31:00.0000] <tfh>
anyone know if "origin" values, which make an appearance in the Web Sockets draft, are fully defined by http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-abarth-origin-02, or elsewhere?

[17:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah that's where they're supposed to be defined

[17:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
tfh: if there's a problem either with websockets or abarth's origin draft, here's a good place to ask about it before mailing the lists

[18:28:00.0000] <tfh>
Hixie: thanks

[19:49:00.0000] <Darxus>
How do you feel about me doing two column page layouts using the table element, where each column is a language?  With a thead containing <img src="languageflag.svg" alt="language" title="language" /> ?

[19:49:01.0000] <Darxus>
Is that sufficiently tabular?

[19:50:00.0000] <Darxus>
To qualify as HTML5 conformant?

[19:54:00.0000] <Darxus>
Seems like it would probably be easier to read with a screen reader than a bunch of <div style="float: left;">'s.

[20:54:00.0000] <jwalden>
wait, I'm older than annevk?  what the heck, why did I think otherwise?  :-\

[21:01:00.0000] <Darxus>
  /clear

[21:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i've really no idea what's going on in the htmlwg these days

[21:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
i feel like i missed something about 2 weeks ago and i've been confused ever since

[22:01:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - I believe that was around the time I joined as an invited expert, or maybe that was only a week ago. Probably just a coincidence.

[22:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[22:11:00.0000] <tantek>
apologies for any disturbances I may have inadvertently caused.

[22:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
things I learned today: Sam has no tolerance for procedural games

[22:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
tantek has a caused a disturbance in the Force

[22:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think to balance it out will require some human sacrifice

[22:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: do you personally think your document is ready to be published as WD by the way?

[22:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: no, I don't. I suppose I should send a message to the list to make that clear.

[22:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: probably! Sam did ask

[22:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[22:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm really curious if Manu is actually planning to propose DOM changes as part of his HTML5+RDF thing

[22:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that would certainly raise the stakes

[23:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, definitely would

[23:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: so I just sent a reply to the list, cc'ed you and Sam

[23:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I doesn't seem to have shown up on the list yet, afaict

[23:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I saw it (maybe from the Cc)

[23:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[23:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I still don't like the basic multiple drafts idea, but Sam seems to be administering it in a fairly ad-hoc fashion

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk>
thanks gsnedders, ezyang :)

[02:11:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
what happened to the width attribute on <col>?

[02:11:01.0000] <annevk>
CSS

[02:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#attr-col-width

[02:13:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me cires at one-page links ;_;

[02:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can just add multipage/ into the URL :-)

[02:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
it'll autoredirect you to the right place

[02:14:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh, that's nice of it :)

[02:15:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
so is style="width: N%;" the same?

[02:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
style="" is allowed in HTML5, but generally i would recommend using an external style sheet

[02:18:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
I'm questioning whether that CSS will give me the same output

[02:18:01.0000] <annevk>
did you try?

[02:18:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
no :)

[02:20:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
could someone remind me what the current standing is with regard to closing empty elements with the trailing slash?

[02:21:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
(i.e., e.g. <img />)

[02:21:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
GPHemsley: I think the only difference would be cascade order

[02:22:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
?

[02:22:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
(between using the width="" attribute and either inline style or a stylesheet rule)

[02:22:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
ah

[02:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for void elements, it's allowed but not required to use the trailing slash syntax

[02:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you can't use that syntax for elements that aren't labeled as "void elements" though, even if they happen to be empty

[02:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so <div /> for example is not kosher, in the text/html serialization

[02:23:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
am I gonna get complaints about NET-enabled start tags, though?

[02:23:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
or whatever that dumb error is

[02:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not in HTML5

[02:24:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
ok

[02:24:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
so logic prevails for a change :)

[02:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me points at the topic

[02:25:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
hah

[02:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the original illogic was allowing sending of XHTML with text/thml MIME type

[02:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or alternately you could say it was illogical to keep specifying HTML as an SGML application

[02:28:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
but I can keep text/html and <void />, right?

[02:28:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
in HTML5

[02:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yes

[02:30:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
OK, then I'm happy :)

[02:30:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
<3 Hixie for fixing the web

[02:30:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think Hixie is terribly proud of this particular detail in the spec :-)

[02:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i hate the /> crap :-)

[02:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wish people wouldn't ever use /> in text/html :-)

[02:31:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh... but that's because you follow the topic ;)

[02:31:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
I think it makes much more sense to note the beginning and end of every tag

[02:31:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
then nothing can run away

[02:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
unfortunately, unlike what some people on public-html seem to think, i don't get my way when i'm wrong :-(

[02:32:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
heh

[02:33:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
for the record, it does appear that the col width and CSS width are the same, thankfully :)

[02:38:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
well... the index is rather useless ATM...

[02:40:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
good to see &apos; defined, too :)

[02:41:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
hmm... comments still aren't allowed to have -- ?

[02:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
GPHemsley: right. it has weird behavior in old browsers that implement sgml-style comments, and also you wouldn't be able to convert it to xml

[02:43:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
ah, OK

[02:43:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: grattis

[02:44:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me wonders why the numbered lists don't use different numbering systems, to avoid phrases like "step 2 in these inner steps"

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: these days i name the steps

[02:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: any remaining cases of "jump to step 2" or stuff like that is just old text i haven't updated recently

[02:49:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#determining-the-character-encoding

[02:55:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: Also, any word on this? http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7150

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
when i get to it, i'll comment on the bug :-)

[02:57:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
heh, OK :P

[03:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
GPHemsley: hixie has said in email before that examples intentionally vary as to not give a perception that one coding style is discouraged or anything

[03:08:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh, really?

[03:08:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
that's too bad...

[03:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
some examples use unquoted attributes, some omit tags, etc

[03:09:01.0000] <zcorpan>
why is it too bad?

[03:10:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
because I prefer consistency and unambiguity (e.g. lowercase elements and quoted attributes)

[03:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
other people may prefer typing less markup that isn't needed

[03:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
uppercase elements and unquoted attributes aren't ambiguous

[03:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
and consistency gives the perception that other coding styles are discouraged

[03:14:01.0000] <zcorpan>
or holding down the shift button for all three keystrokes in "<P>"

[03:14:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: well, that would be my intention ;)

[03:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
um, i meant "</P>"

[03:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
well, if we're going to be consistent, i vote for uppercase element names, no />s ever, no quotes around attributes unless absolutely necessary, and all omittable tags always omitted

[03:15:02.0000] <zcorpan>
on swedish keyboard layout you have to hold shift for the slash and >

[03:15:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
ah

[03:15:04.0000] <krijnh>
Holding down shift for </P> creates a PI! We need PIs in HTML5!

[03:15:05.0000] <krijnh>
OMG, why aren't PIs allowed, grmbl grmbl

[03:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
what would a PI be allowed for

[03:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
php!

[03:16:02.0000] <krijnh>
For PHP, I want to validate my PHP as HTML!

[03:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
wouldn't PHP use... PHP, rather than HTML?

[03:16:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hey, I'm just talking about my personal opinion here.

[03:16:05.0000] <krijnh>
You guys are taking away my ability to validate my PHP, you suck!

[03:16:06.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: right, but where the spec allows multiple things, the spec doesn't have an opinion :-)

[03:16:07.0000] <krijnh>
Okay, enough for today :)

[03:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think Turing took that ability away

[03:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
but anyway

[03:17:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: Right. I get that. I'm content to drop the issue. :)

[03:17:03.0000] <krijnh>
Heh

[03:17:04.0000] <krijnh>
(Do people mailing this stuff to the list know they are wasting so much of other peoples time?)

[03:18:00.0000] <takkaria>
no

[03:18:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
As long as the spec lets me do it my way, I'm good.

[03:18:02.0000] <takkaria>
because leif wants to validate his HTML as PHP. :)

[03:18:03.0000] <krijnh>
(When I'm reading this stuff on my phone I'm really not that happy with being subscribed to the list :()

[03:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
krijnh: i'm sure they're trying to do the right thing

[03:18:05.0000] <takkaria>
er, his PHP as HTML

[03:18:06.0000] <GPHemsley>
And, in case it's not already obvious, I don't read the mailing list. :)

[03:18:07.0000] <Hixie>
can't say i blame you

[03:18:08.0000] <GPHemsley>
heh

[03:19:00.0000] <krijnh>
I wish I wasn't as addicted to it :)

[03:19:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me would like a filter that marks all non-technical emails as read

[03:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i have developed such a filter in my brain, but it takes more time than i'd like

[03:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and sometimes it doesn't work and i read silly emails anyway

[03:20:02.0000] <krijnh>
At least you get payed for it :)

[03:21:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
BTW, I got flack from people on the Wordpress forum for attempting to nest <em> tags, as allowed by HTML5.

[03:22:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Wordpress didn't like that, and decided to close the first <em> tag before the second one

[03:22:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
And it bugs me when people (well, machines) mess with my HTML without my permission

[03:26:00.0000] <krijnh>
http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/07/31/html-4-considered-harmful/ oh noes!

[03:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think cleaning up the templates every few days is a great way to go

[03:30:02.0000] <krijnh>
Philip`: that's Microdata :)

[03:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
i thought lachy had fixed it

[03:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
He had

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
but presumably nobody has fixed the actual vulnerability yet

[03:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[03:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
i thought that's what he'd fixed

[03:31:03.0000] <Philip`>
or the server's more deeply infected, or something

[03:31:04.0000] <Philip`>
Evidently it's not fixed :-)

[03:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
clearly

[03:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's lucky that these people never want to actually cause any direct harm and e.g. delete all the site's content, they just want to spam search engines

[03:39:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, Swedish?

[03:39:01.0000] <annevk>
Google says yes; bedankt :)

[03:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i have backups of the database, but yes

[03:39:03.0000] <krijnh>
23 pas, jonkie

[03:40:00.0000] <annevk>
mag nog steeds ongestraft flamen :p

[03:40:01.0000] <krijnh>
Ja, dat je daar mee weg komt, wow :)

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought lachy was going to set the perms so nothing was writable or something

[03:45:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
what's the deal with the accesskey attribute?

[03:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there a deal?

[03:48:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/ says it's absent

[03:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
then that document is wrong :-)

[03:48:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
that's what I thought

[03:49:00.0000] <krijnh>
Somebody should submit a new document, so we can have a poll about it

[03:50:00.0000] <krijnh>
Okay, I will write some text.

[03:50:01.0000] <annevk>
GPHemsley, refresh

[03:50:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
annevk: :)

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk>
would "Gordon Hemsley" be ok for the acknowledgments section?

[03:51:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
I prefer Gordon P. Hemsley

[03:51:02.0000] <annevk>
k

[03:52:00.0000] <annevk>
refresh

[03:52:01.0000] <krijnh>
I formally object to this refreshing stuff!

[03:52:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
^_^

[03:54:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
annevk: Happy Birthday, BTW. :)

[04:01:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, btw, when you changed property to itemprop you did not change the order of global attributes so they're no longer a-z now

[04:01:01.0000] <annevk>
GPHemsley, ta

[04:04:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Hixie: Lachy did set the perms like that…

[04:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: file a bug using the new box :-)

[04:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Did Lachy set the permissions in such a way that the attacker can't simply switch them back?

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me hopes the attacker only has complete access to the machine under the web server's username

[04:09:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, where should I file bugs to suggest that the form is cleared after a bug has been filed?

[04:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
to file that bug, after you file a bug, click on the field and press Ctrl+A

[04:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
Cmd+A on mac

[04:09:03.0000] <gsnedders_>
:P

[04:10:00.0000] <annevk>
mwaha

[04:10:01.0000] <annevk>
also, it does not seem to accurately track what I'm looking at

[04:10:02.0000] <Philip`>
Clearing it would prevent accidentally double-clicking on the submit button

[04:10:03.0000] <annevk>
I first have to click the screen or something...

[04:12:00.0000] <krijnh>
annevk: html4-difference still mentions the eventsource element

[04:12:01.0000] <krijnh>
differences even

[04:13:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Hixie: Useful answer re the spam in #wordpress: talk to your host

[04:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders_: my host is lachy :-)

[04:13:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
:P

[04:13:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
Yeah, those Wordpress people are always very helpful

[04:14:00.0000] <krijnh>
annevk: also key words is one word, I think

[04:15:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
krijnh: I agree, but they're using it consistently as two

[04:15:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
in the main spec, too

[04:15:02.0000] <krijnh>
HTML 5 itself uses "2.4.3 Keywords and enumerated attributes"

[04:15:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
...except there

[04:17:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Hixie: Now apparently Apache is at fault

[04:18:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me sighs

[04:19:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me sighs

[04:19:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
Is the official HTML5 validator w3.org's or validator.nu's?

[04:19:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me pats gsnedders_ on the back

[04:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
there is no official HTML5 validator

[04:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
and hopefully there will never be one

[04:19:05.0000] <krijnh>
annevk: <img border> and <script language> are not allowed, according to html5.validator.nu

[04:20:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: recommended, perhaps?

[04:20:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Hixie: Could I possibly get SSH access to the blog at least?

[04:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders_: hm?

[04:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders_: it's under lachy's account

[04:20:04.0000] <gsnedders_>
Hixie: Ah

[04:20:05.0000] <annevk>
krijnh, bug in validator.nu

[04:20:06.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: Or, last resort, your preference? :)

[04:20:07.0000] <gsnedders_>
Hixie: So the answer is ask Lachy? :P

[04:20:08.0000] <annevk>
krijnh, fixed the other nits

[04:20:09.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders_: yes

[04:20:10.0000] <krijnh>
annevk: ah, okay

[04:20:11.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: ping

[04:20:12.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: valkidator.whatwg.org

[04:20:13.0000] <gsnedders_>
Where has Lachy been anyway?

[04:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

but i'm going to bed

Hixie: have you seen http://projectcerbera.com/do#html ?

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk>
krijnh, net als Hixie voeg ik een naam toe voor elke wijziging die ik maak dankzij feedback van die persoon

[04:29:00.0000] <krijnh>
Ow okay

[04:29:01.0000] <annevk>
hoeft er ook niemand te bepalen wat belangrijk is of niet

[04:29:02.0000] <krijnh>
True

[04:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
is there a way in CSS to make the list number markers in <ol> lists right-aligned instead of left-aligned?

[04:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
flip the rtl setting, and then flip it back again for its il children?

[04:33:01.0000] <takkaria>
*li

[04:33:02.0000] <takkaria>
though maybe they're ill too, I really have no idea

[04:34:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, I think I totally misunderstood you there

[04:34:01.0000] <takkaria>
nevermind

[04:39:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me shudders at the thought of that, knowing some browsers don't cope with it well

[04:40:00.0000] <jmb>
I guess you could do something with ol li::marker { text-align: right; }, assuming anything actually implements that :)

[04:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
takkaria, jmb : thanks

[04:41:01.0000] <krijnh>
li { direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left; }

[04:41:02.0000] <krijnh>
Works great :)

[04:41:03.0000] <krijnh>
Even without the unicode-bidi: embed;

[04:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, send me a public key

[04:45:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: What's your email?

[04:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
surely it's in your address book?

[04:45:02.0000] <krijnh>
Don't you guys work at the same company?

[04:45:03.0000] <Lachy>
lachlan.hunt⊙lia

[04:45:04.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: Probably

[04:46:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
krijnh: Shhh

[04:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, after I've added it, log in using: ssh lhunt⊙bwo

[04:46:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me can claim to be Lachy!

[04:47:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: sending

[04:47:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: sent

[04:50:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, I forwarded you some information on a better skin

[04:50:01.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, let me know if I can help

[04:50:02.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, getting rid of the default would be great

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, I think we should make some changes to the template pages as well; I can do that too if I get access

[04:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, done.

[04:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, send a public key

[04:54:00.0000] <annevk>
I've no idea where I stored my public key...

[04:55:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe this is best done later

[04:55:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
~/.ssh?

[04:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
just send a copy of your authorized_keys file that you have on dreamhost

[04:55:03.0000] <annevk>
I should clean up a little

[04:55:04.0000] <Lachy>
or you should be able to extract your public key from your private key file, if you know the right command

[04:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think it's the openssl rsa or rsautl command

[04:56:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Why on earth is there a fly flying around here when windows are so wide open?

[04:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, having the windows open would explain how it came in

[04:58:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Indeed, but it's doing amazingly well at failing to leave

[04:58:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me hears a thud behind him and sees a corpse drop

[04:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, did the fly win or lose?

[04:59:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Well, I guess it would say it lost, if it were alive to say so

[05:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, what did you want access to the blog for anyway?

[05:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
I really don't understand how the hacker got into the templates again.  I definitely changed the file permissions for the template to be -r--r--r--

[05:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
but now they're -rw-r--r--

[05:12:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: Try and see if I can work out how they did again

[05:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, ok. I'll just restore a copy of our original templates, which had a few modificiations like showing the author and stuff

[05:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
what the hell? When I try to delete the hacked template directory, I get permission denied errors, despite me being the owner of the files and having write permission set

[05:20:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: where?

[05:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, nevermind. The directory itself didn't have write permission set

[05:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
I thought I'd looked at that ealier and it did.

[05:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
I have now restored the original, slightly modified, template and set the permissions to -r--r--r-- and dr-xr-xr-x for everything in there

[05:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
and I have created a complete backup copy in the themes directory

[05:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if it's possible for the permissions to be changed by some code in PHP, and whether wordpress does that for any reason

[05:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
if it does, that could be how we got hacked again

[06:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
actually, it looks like I do have access to the logs in ~/logs/

[06:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
didn't realise that was there

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>

[08:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
Glad to see the PeopleSoft people aren't passing up an opportunity to make me aware of their software

[08:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, yeah, PeopleSoft's stuff is awesome

[08:53:00.0000] <takkaria>
manchester uni's instance of their student software has "In the interests of performance and efficiency, this website supports the Western European Character Set (ISO 8859/1)" written by the login box

[08:54:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
takkaria: But I want to pay in €!

[08:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
I bet you wouldn't dare entering any non-ASCII characters, though

[08:55:00.0000] <jcranmer>
no, everyone should pay in ¤!

[08:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, UTF-8 is such a performance hog

[08:56:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Hmm, we should use U+FFFF for our own WHAT currency

[08:56:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Use U+FFFD instead, easier to "fix" payments then

[08:58:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Dashiva: But where's the fun in using a character you can send over XML?

[09:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Fun is sacrificed for profit

[09:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
I want no part in any regime that sacrifices fun

[09:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You can buy fun with the profits

[09:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
What's the exchange rate between money and happiness?

[09:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Depends on the currency

[09:04:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(of the happiness)

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do it in Standard Happiness Units, and then I can easily convert it to any other scale

[09:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, if the person accepts happiness in Ham Sandwich Equivalents, the exchange rate is quite favorable

[12:17:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
If you have an object in ECMAScript and iterate over it with for … in, what happens if you add stuff to the object?

[12:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You mean introduce a new property inside the loop?

[12:17:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
Yeah

[12:18:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Does it iterate over a copy, or does it iterate over the variable, and hence loop infinitely?

[12:18:01.0000] <takkaria>
most languages say that behaviour is undefined for that case I believe

[12:19:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
According to ECMAScript 5 it copies

[12:19:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, it's up to the implementation

[12:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
ES3 says that deleted properties must not be visited, and added properties may be visited.

[12:21:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
"If new properties are added to the object being enumerated during enumeration, the newly added properties are guaranteed not to be visited in the active enumeration. "

[12:21:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
(ES5)

[12:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What if you add a property to the object's prototype?

[12:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And what if you change the prototype chain during enumeration?

[12:23:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
That has no effect

[12:23:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
You effectively copy the object at the start of evaluating the loop

[12:24:00.0000] <inimino>
AIUI the set of properties to be visited is fixed at the start and only deletions will affect it

[12:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So if you change the prototype, you'll end up visiting several properties that don't actually exist?

[12:27:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Hmm, I'm not sure

[12:27:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me isn't an ES guy, damnit

[12:27:02.0000] <inimino>
I'm not sure about that

[12:27:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Anyone have a link to the latest ES5 draft?

[12:28:00.0000] <inimino>
mutating the prototype would work the same as mutating the object

[12:28:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Dashiva: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/drafts/tc39-2009-025.pdf

[12:28:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
Dashiva: Page 85/86, section 12.6.4

[12:28:03.0000] <gsnedders_>
Dashiva: Search for "for-in"

[12:28:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Not mutating the prototype, but replacing the prototype object entirely by mutating the [[Prototype]]

[12:29:00.0000] <inimino>
Dashiva: that's not even allowed for in ES3

[12:29:01.0000] <inimino>
(and I don't think that changed in ES5 though I might be wrong)

[12:29:02.0000] <Dashiva>
But it's implicitly allowed in ES5

[12:29:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Not in the language itself, but it nods to implementations allowing it in extensions

[12:30:00.0000] <inimino>
oh, right, the catchall extension thing

[12:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Wow, nice change in the wording. :)

[12:33:00.0000] <ttepasse>
Uhm. Why are there ? as bullet points in the ES5 document?

[12:33:01.0000] <Dashiva>
ES3 says "the newly added properties are not guaranteed to be visited" and ES5 is "the newly added properties are guaranteed not to be visited"

[12:33:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Just moved the not :)

[12:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
ttepasse: Where? I see bullets here

[12:37:00.0000] <ttepasse>
Every list: http://tepasse.org/tmp/i-heart-es5

[12:39:00.0000] <inimino>
heh

[12:40:00.0000] <inimino>
it looks fine in evince, probably some kind of font issue

[12:40:01.0000] <ttepasse>
A font issue in a pdf?

[12:41:00.0000] <inimino>
sure, PDFs can use fonts without embedding them

[12:41:01.0000] <inimino>
then if the renderer picks the wrong font, you get something like that

[12:42:00.0000] <inimino>
it's a shame that ES isn't specified in a first-class Web format

[12:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's better this way than the wiki mess that preceded it :P

[12:43:00.0000] <inimino>
the wiki was a mess sure

[12:44:00.0000] <inimino>
but mostly because the process is opaque and most of the relevant information was hidden at any given time

[12:44:01.0000] <inimino>
like "oh yeah, that stuff on the wiki is totally obsolete, but we can't show the current status of anything because our process is broken"

[12:54:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Oh yay. Nothing matches the spec at all for script@type

[12:57:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Dashiva: You still have BTS access?

[16:44:00.0000] <Darxus>
A noscript element is allowed to be a child of a body element, right?

[16:45:00.0000] <Darxus>
It's phrasing content, which is flow content, and a body contains flow content?

[16:45:01.0000] <Darxus>
If this is correct, the validator has a bug:  http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http://www.chaosreigns.com/test/noscript.html

[16:50:00.0000] <Darxus>
If I'm *not* correct, then my validator has a bug.


2009-08-02
[18:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Yes I do

[18:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Darxus: It shows the wrong error text, but the document is erroneous still

[18:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"The noscript element must not be used in XML documents."

[18:47:00.0000] <Darxus>
Dashiva: Huh.  Is there an alternative for XML?

[18:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The usual methods. Make the document as it should be without script, then use script to change it after loading

[18:49:00.0000] <Darxus>
Ahh, thanks.

[19:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe someone (not me) should clarify that "obsolete" in HTML5 still requires implementation support

[19:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yt?

[19:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: yep

[19:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: I thought that was really clear - I'm trying to help explain it to John and Shelley now

[19:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i was looking at the summary="" feedback you sent a while back, saying that we should tell authors not to use summary="" in the <table> section

[20:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
the reason i hadn't mentioned summary="" there (except for implementation-specific text) is that there doesn't seem to be a need to tell authors to not do anything, because authors by and large have never heard of it

[20:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think my main feedback was to describe what it does and explain why using it is a problem

[20:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: looking at the current spec, it looks like the obsolete features section describes what it does, and says authors should not use it

[20:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i was going to add text saying what the problems were into the obsolete features section

[20:01:03.0000] <Dashiva>
othermaciej: It's clear to me, in light of the "support existing content" idea. But if you view language obsoletion independent of use, maybe it's confusing.

[20:01:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: but it doesn't explain why, which might seem mysterious

[20:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
on a completely different front, do you have an opinion on whether the event loop should pump while the UA is blocked on a <script> element waiting for style sheets to load?

[20:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i.e. should setTimeout()s fire, user interaction events fire, etc)

[20:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i guess it should be like blocking on <script>, which doesn't pump the event loop)

[20:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
(at least per spec it doesn't currently)

[20:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it should be like blocking on <script>, yes

[20:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think giving the reasoning in the obsolete elements section would be sufficient to address my concern, particularly if the <table> element section has a clear cross-reference

[20:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
it has a cross-reference from the one mention of summary="" in the implementation requirement

[20:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
in that you can click on the word "summary"

[20:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that seems fine

[20:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(to me)

[20:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[20:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/mid/8618F212-C191-4CCC-9F27-6BF7829622FE⊙wo is a surprisingly interesting e-mail from Tim if you care about the "resource" vs "resource representation" nonsense

[21:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that is kind of interesting

[21:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
using fragments to refer to non-document entities would have indeed made more sense

[21:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
using a whole new scheme would have been better, imho

[21:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hmm...

[21:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Shelley seems to talk about a model where features are marked as deprecated, usage drops, deprecated becomes obsolete, and finally support is dropped

[21:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
As I recall, that model works fine when there is no (unmaintained) legacy content, not so well when legacy rears its ugly head.

[21:58:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder if there is a significant body of legacy @summary use

[22:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does WCAG 2 explicitly mention the summary="" attribute anywhere?

[22:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I couldn't find the reference

[22:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I see, it's in a separate Note

[22:43:00.0000] <gavin_>
/me finds handicap parking slots to be limiting to those not physically impaired

[22:43:01.0000] <gavin_>
means they need to park farther from the entrance

[22:44:00.0000] <gavin_>
society has generally agreed that the tradeoff there (ease of access to those with disabilities) was worth it, though

[22:44:01.0000] <gavin_>
and that concludes today's Irrelevant Analogy Nitpick

[01:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i would suggest File

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
though i guess that excludes streams

[01:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yeah, File is simpler and unambiguous

[02:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I guess it does mean serialized content and not a stream

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk>
so RDF fucked up both XML and HTTP?

[02:15:01.0000] <annevk>
fun

[02:16:00.0000] <annevk>
(though HTTP only in the theoretical sense so I suppose that doesn't really matter)

[02:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
collateral damage

[02:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and civilian casualties

[02:36:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, you around?

[03:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
gotta love how john completely ignored the points i made about the pfwg ignoring me, and then said i should talk to the pfwg.

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, I thought that was weird

[03:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, yes

[03:18:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, it seems like Sam Ruby is getting increasingly impatient with those on the list that are either repeating themselves or making apparent logically flawed statements (and he's pointing them out).

[03:18:01.0000] <tantek>
apparently

[03:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm thinking that since the arguments from the pro-summary attribute advocates largely stem from the advice in WCAG2 Techniques and the apparent contradiction, we should instead be pushing for the PFWG to amend WCAG2 with better solutions

[03:25:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, should I have you the public key on my local machine?

[03:26:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: What better solution that is conforming  in HTML 4.01?

[03:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
several of the ones in html5 are conforming in html4

[03:26:02.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, I haven't worked a lot with this before; in fact, only for the W3C

[03:27:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, btw, it seems you did not restore the original template with the author names visible

[03:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, I need to put a copy of your ssh-rsa key into the authorized_keys file on the server

[03:29:00.0000] <annevk>
is to your @opera.com address ok?

[03:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
sure, either address is fine

[03:31:00.0000] <annevk>
and then I can login through ssh?

[03:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, yes

[03:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
using: ssh lhunt⊙bwo

[03:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, some of the alternative solutions listed in HTML5 are also conforming HTML4

[03:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just said that :-P

[03:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, oh. I didn't read your message

[03:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey go figure, webkit only pauses to wait for styles for _external_ scripts

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
gecko doesn't seem to discriminate

[03:35:00.0000] <annevk>
so worky?

[03:35:01.0000] <annevk>
it asks me for a password...

[03:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, I haven't added it yet

[03:35:03.0000] <Lachy>
give me a minute, I only just received your mail

[03:36:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, what happened to the weekly updates from markp?

[03:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
no idea, ask markp

[03:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, now try

[03:37:01.0000] <annevk>
I'm in

[03:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, btw, it was an rsa key you sent, so the file should have been called id_rsa not id_dsa, but it doesn't matter too much

[03:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
It should have been called id_rsa.pub, I hope

[03:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, yes

[03:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
since you're really not meant to email your private key to people :-p

[03:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
he emailed the id_dsa.pub file

[03:41:00.0000] <annevk>
now it asks for the password again

[03:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
what?

[03:41:02.0000] <annevk>
hmm, only when I use sshfs

[03:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
it shouldn't. If you have the private key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa or ~/.ssh/identity it should work

[03:43:00.0000] <annevk>
nope

[03:45:00.0000] <annevk>
I'll use some other means to do things

[03:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, are you going to replace the stylesheet with that one from Ben?

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm currently duplicating the default theme

[03:53:01.0000] <annevk>
it's take ages to make a cp of a folder on that server

[03:54:00.0000] <annevk>
then I'll put the style sheet in the "new theme" and maybe make some other adjustments

[03:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, if you want authors to show up on the index page as well, uncomment the appropriate line in index.php

[03:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
actually, copy the line from single.php, as it also adds a link to the authors URL

[03:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
heh, nice theme name: org.whatwg.awesome :-)

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think someone needs to make the font half the size it currently is

[04:09:00.0000] <annevk>
it was actually smaller but I wanted it larger

[04:09:01.0000] <annevk>
I'll make it a bit smaller then

[04:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems sensible to make it comparable to text sizes on all other sites, and then if somebody personally prefers large fonts they can configure their browser to increase them all

[04:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, just make it the default font-size

[04:11:00.0000] <annevk>
done

[04:11:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, sensible is boring

[04:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
It looks alright now if I zoom out to 90%

[04:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, no, copying the mistakes of other sites is not a good idea

[04:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: we lost that fight, deal with it

[04:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
font-size:medium means 16px

[04:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
font-size: small is somewhat acceptable, though I think medium is best

[04:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, a recent nightly minefield update appears to have killed my entire history and bookmarks

[04:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: if you were a Minefield user, that should make you mad. But since there's no such thing as Minefield users, only Minefield testers, you should be happy!

[04:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
exclamation point

[04:22:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: See, if you used Opera…

[04:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, I use both

[04:22:04.0000] <Lachy>
I even have opera set as my default, but there are still some things that Minefield is better for

[04:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
yay, it looks like it's just Minefield failing to load them. Using FIrefox 3.5.1 with the same profile restores everything :-)

[04:25:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me tries to resist the temptation to say: "BREAKING: Opera employee has Opera set as default browser"

[04:25:02.0000] <annevk>
Chromium seems to cache HTML for a long time for some reason

[04:25:03.0000] <annevk>
content that is long gone does not disappear on refreshes?!

[04:26:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
That's the same for anything using WebKit, AFAIK

[04:27:00.0000] <annevk>
posts from hsivonen to blog.whatwg.org might need to be modified to use the proper heading level

[04:27:01.0000] <annevk>
s/might//

[04:38:00.0000] <annevk>
if someone could start a wiki page with things to fix on the blog (markup, etc.) or somewhere else I'll try to do some more stuff tonight

[05:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what the difference is between 'obsolete' and 'deprecated'

[05:35:00.0000] <takkaria>
you deprecate something that's still perfectly functional that you have a vendetta against, but obsoleted stuff is genuinely outdated

[05:35:01.0000] <takkaria>
/me makes it up

[05:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders_: about the caching thing, if so, I think that's coincidental, because Webkit/Webcore itself doesn't have any caching code. it's all platform code

[05:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose 'obsolete' has the advantage that nobody will misread/misspell it as 'obsoliete'

[05:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: or obnoxiouselete either

[05:37:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
MikeSmith: Stop assuming I know stuff.

[05:37:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
MikeSmith: Also, I'm not going home on Friday.

[05:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders_: I guess you'll have to find a way to enjoy yourself in Sweden in the summertime. poor you.

[05:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe instead of obsolete and deprecated we need a third term without their connotations

[05:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., "Conforming but FUBAR"

[05:40:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
"we-don't-like-this"

[05:41:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Cool. Facebook has crashed Opera.

[05:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
Or: Opera has crashed Facebook

[05:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
to assign blame in the right place

[05:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me awaits a day when crashing is obsolete rather than just deprecated

[05:44:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me notes with mild amusement nobody apart from MikeSmith here has a clue about his former plans to go home

[05:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me finally reaches the email where Hixie already queried the obsolete vs deprecated thing

[05:44:02.0000] <krijnh>
/me wants some obsol33t stuff in the spec as well

[05:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think the spec section status markers should be extended, so that as well as showing the stability of each section they also show its awesomeness

[05:46:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
+1

[05:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: you're onto something there

[05:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it should be two awesomeness fields, not one

[05:50:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
What's the scale?

[05:50:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Awesomeness units?

[05:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders_: binary - "This part rocks!" and "This part blows."

[05:50:03.0000] <gsnedders_>
MikeSmith: And the other field?

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
I was thinking more of a continuous linear scale from "this is like so lame" to "this r0x0rz my s0x0rz"

[05:54:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Philip`: Yeah, I was thinking of that

[07:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
is the value of the iframe "name" attribute allowed to be empty?

[07:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
v.nu doesn't require to be

[07:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and in HTML4, it was defined as CDATA, with no constraints on its length

[07:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/browsers.html#valid-browsing-context-name

[07:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"A valid browsing context name is any string with at least one character that does not start with a U+005F LOW LINE character."

[07:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems to require that it not be empty

[08:02:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Is there any dfn of OMG IDL -> ES mapping?

[08:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: venus instance for planet html5 consistently gets a 500 from your site when trying to get your feed

[08:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for quite a while now (many weeks)

[08:53:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Why should ~0 give -1 in ES?

[08:53:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me realize

[08:53:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
*realizes

[08:54:00.0000] <takkaria>
if ~ is bitwise NOT, then it's because integers are signed

[08:54:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Right, and because with two's compliment all bits as 1 is -1

[08:56:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me is for some reason thinking of sign bits, and hence being confused

[09:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
Can anyone explain why this particular example of a summary attribute is actually useful for anyone?  http://source.sakaiproject.org/viewsvn/content/trunk/content-bundles/content.properties?p2=%2Fcontent%2Ftrunk%2Fcontent-bundles%2Fcontent.properties&p1=%2Fcontent%2Ftrunk%2Fcontent-bundles%2Fcontent.properties&r1=39898&r2=39897&view=diff&pathrev=39898

[09:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's from that bug report that Shelly referred to.

[09:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-11668

[09:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
It looks to me like it's just a list describing what each column is, but that info could almost certainly be derived from the column headings

[09:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
(if it couldn't, then even sighted users would have difficulty)

[09:26:01.0000] <takkaria>
or with a title="" attribute on the header table cells so that if you're in a column you can find oiut what it does rather than having to remember a paragraph of text

[09:26:02.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, yeah, I was thinking that too

[09:26:03.0000] <Lachy>
and was about to write it :-)

[09:27:00.0000] <takkaria>
/me grins

[09:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
except I was going to suggest putting the title attribute on the col element, but I'm not sure how much support that would have in practice compared with it being on the th element

[09:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It couldn't be derived from the column heading textContent - e.g. "Column 2 has checkboxes to select whether an item should be moved, copied or removed" is usually implemented as a headingless column of checkboxes, and a sighted user can easily see there's buttons at the bottom of the page for "move selected", "delete selected" etc

[09:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it's hard to say without actually seeing the table, and I couldn't find a link to an example table from that bug report

[09:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I reckon there would be alternative ways to convey that information

[09:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Most webmail systems have the same kind of checkbox thing

[09:29:02.0000] <Lachy>
I know

[09:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
so it doesn't seem that hard to say without actually seeing the table, because you can see the same thing in lots of other tables

[09:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The description could still go in a <th abbr> or something, so <table summary> isn't necessarily the best way of doing it, but it can't be done with visible text)

[09:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
there is no abbr attribute in HTML5

[09:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
although, the abbr attribute in HTML4 wasn't intended for that purpose either

[09:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
It could be done with the title attribute, which is sometimes visible, though it does suffer from some problems like being inaccessible to keyboard users without assistive technology

[09:36:00.0000] <takkaria>
not with a visible indicator, it doesn't

[09:36:01.0000] <takkaria>
oh

[09:36:02.0000] <takkaria>
keyboard users

[10:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
an HTML5 datatype-checking library in python or c++ or other would be a nice thing to have

[10:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
were someone so inclined to write one

[10:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
apparently JF has produced an alternative draft.  I wonder if and when the draft will be made available publicly? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0071.html

[10:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
or if MikeSmith could post a pointer, since he was apparently CC'd on the mail

[10:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: I guess John will announce it when it's available

[11:22:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me rings up his sister, and doesn't get her

[11:23:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Does that mean she's giving birth or something?

[11:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if anyone happens to know how to change the screen resolution in Windows 2000, when you can't see the screen

[11:32:00.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: How can you do anything in windows when you can't see the screen?

[11:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, you can run services. But I don't see why the resolution would matter

[11:33:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Philip`: You reboot to a unix-clone CD

[11:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Darxus: I'll be able to see the screen once I change the resolution to something the monitor can handle without desyncing

[11:38:00.0000] <Darxus>
Heh.

[11:38:01.0000] <Darxus>
Philip`: Reboot to safe mode?

[11:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me manages to guess the right key combinations to change the display settings

[11:45:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
hehe

[11:46:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
fun :P

[11:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
This is why voice control is great

[11:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
At least until you need to reconfigure your microphone

[14:05:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, I've no idea how that can be

[14:05:01.0000] <annevk>
:/

[14:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
watching tonights episode of Top Gear, lovin' how they're reviewing two Aussie cars :-)

[14:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I can't get over they're totally incorrect pronunciation of "Bathurst"

[14:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/they're/their/

[14:30:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me can't get over Lachy being unable to pronounce "Lachlan"

[14:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
I hope they're not propounding any unfounded stereotypes about Australians

[14:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, I do say my name correctly

[14:31:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
Lachy: I think most people who have any clue about Gaelic or Scots pronunciation, the two languages in which your name exists, would say you don't :)

[14:49:00.0000] <annevk>
should we use HTML5 on the blog?

[14:49:01.0000] <annevk>
I already put some form stuff in

[14:50:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Yes

[14:50:01.0000] <annevk>
wondering about <aside> and such

[14:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
No

[14:50:03.0000] <annevk>
reasoning?

[14:51:00.0000] <gsnedders_>
Because I'm crazy.

[14:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wasn't intending to provide any more reasoning than gsnedders_

[14:55:00.0000] <annevk>
/me was also considering dropping the html/head/body tags

[14:55:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
+1

[14:55:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
(No reasoning given)

[15:01:00.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk: do it! drop it all!

[15:01:01.0000] <jacobolus>
then write up a blog post about how it's the new "best practice", and let the flames dance

[15:03:00.0000] <jacobolus>
btw, if anyone wants input into python-based servers' mime types, now is the time: http://bugs.python.org/issue6626

[15:05:00.0000] <annevk>
jacobolus, ah yeah

[15:05:01.0000] <annevk>
the good old days

[15:06:00.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk: I mean, google does it, right?

[15:06:01.0000] <jacobolus>
so it has to be good

[15:07:00.0000] <jacobolus>
actually, google seems to include html/head/body tags, and just drop the close of body. hmm.

[15:08:00.0000] <jacobolus>
that's too bad. you can't use them as evidence

[15:08:01.0000] <annevk>
jacobolus, maybe add .xht and .xhtml?

[15:09:00.0000] <annevk>
.svg ?

[15:09:01.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk: oh, I'm going to add most or all of apache's defaults

[15:09:02.0000] <jacobolus>
the main questions are about what to use when there are multiple acceptable choices

[15:09:03.0000] <annevk>
.ogv oga etc.

[15:09:04.0000] <annevk>
oh ok

[15:09:05.0000] <jacobolus>
e.g. text/javascript, application/javascript, text/ecmascript, etc.

[15:10:00.0000] <jacobolus>
for the moment I've just tried to make the code snae

[15:10:01.0000] <jacobolus>
*sane

[15:10:02.0000] <jacobolus>
I don't know if you've ever looked at the mimetypes module, but somewhere around 2001 it went from being a nice little script to being a nightmare

[15:11:00.0000] <jacobolus>
I'm hard pressed to think of a worse bit of python code I've seen

[15:11:01.0000] <annevk>
html5lib? :p

[15:11:02.0000] <jacobolus>
haven't seen it ;)

[15:18:00.0000] <jacobolus>
it manages to confuse the syntax highlighter for google code, anyway

[15:18:01.0000] <jacobolus>
http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/source/browse/python/src/html5lib/html5parser.py

[15:18:02.0000] <jacobolus>
around line 204

[15:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jacobolus: Will you add the types apache refuses to include?

[15:24:01.0000] <jacobolus>
Dashiva: I wouldn't mind.. someone else presumably has to read/approve whatever patches I submit

[15:25:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Dashiva: I don't actually know much about it though; have a link or quick summary?

[15:25:01.0000] <jacobolus>
Dashiva: all I know is that it was previously completely awful. It would be good to do things "right" though, and I'd be happy to hear what that means to various ppl.

[15:27:00.0000] <annevk>
well for e.g. JavaScript it does not matter at all

[15:28:00.0000] <annevk>
so "right" could be text/awesome-donkey+xml

[15:28:01.0000] <annevk>
for image resources other than SVG it does not really matter either

[15:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jacobolus: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22580

[15:29:01.0000] <annevk>
(having said that, I believe even the sniffing spec states that you should specify the correct media type)

[15:30:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Dashiva: the way the python mimetypes module currently works is to have a 'strict' mode and a 'lenient' mode; I personally think this is stupid

[15:31:00.0000] <jacobolus>
the 'strict' mode is supposed to stick to IANA registered types

[15:31:01.0000] <jacobolus>
but in practice it doesn't of course because anything in a mime.types file it finds is considered 'strict'

[15:32:00.0000] <annevk>
IANA / IETF just doesn't work well for these things

[15:33:00.0000] <annevk>
media types, URI schemes, HTTP headers, ...

[15:33:01.0000] <jacobolus>
anything?

[15:33:02.0000] <jacobolus>
;)

[15:33:03.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk: I'm not convinced IETF is great for protocols either

[15:33:04.0000] <annevk>
character encodings is another disaster

[15:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Great case for decentralized extensibility :P

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
so does anyone know where hsivonen is?

[15:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
he's been off the grid since july 17th and i don't recall him saying he was going to be on vacation

[15:37:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Dashiva: here's apache's current mappings extension -> type http://pastie.textmate.org/569011

[15:38:00.0000] <jacobolus>
I'd just as soon include all of those in Python's standard library, though I'm not sure everyone would be on board with that

[15:41:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, no idea

[15:42:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I'd imagine someone at Mozilla knows, but maybe not

[15:52:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Dashiva: it looks to me like those types in that bug are actually listed by apache these days

[15:53:00.0000] <jacobolus>
video/x-ms-asf, etc.

[15:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
good news everyone!

[15:58:01.0000] <Dashiva>
jacobolus: Indeed, looks like they were added a few months ago.

[15:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen isn't dead

[15:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>

Hixie: He was hit by a car, and not a bus?

[15:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
apparently he's on vacation with no e-mail access

[15:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
boy is he gonna have fun when he gets back and sees two weeks' worth of public-html

[16:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm (positively) surprised it was Roy who did it

[16:02:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, jaja :)

[16:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: "Wow, I saved myself a lot of pain by not being present during this"

[16:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[16:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm very curious to see what we end up voting on

[16:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
i really didn't understand the vote sam last described (obsolete vs deprecated -- what changes would it mean to the spec?)

[16:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Just a word replacement

[16:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I didn't understand that either. John's proposed draft doesn't make summary "deprecated"

[16:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't understand john's draft

[16:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, i understood what he was proposing, but he didn't say why he was proposing it

[16:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
because of WAI consensus?

[16:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, the lack of justification was one of issues I had with it

[16:07:02.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, why are we not using deprecated btw now that we have warnings?

[16:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: deprecated isn't in my dictionary

[16:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, literally. i just searched for "Deprecated" in the dictionary on Mac OS X and it wasn't there

[16:08:02.0000] <Dashiva>
"We've done some new research showing there's no lumiferous aether, but this earlier work says it exists, so let's keep studying the aether"

[16:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh wait that was the thesaurus

[16:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
it seems though that you might be in a minority here and that most people find deprecated much more clear than obsolete but conforming

[16:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: the values that it would cover aren't just deprecated, i mean, they really are obsolete

[16:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: the only reason we allow them is to allow migration

[16:09:03.0000] <annevk2>
that is pretty much how deprecated is used

[16:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
in all specs I've read anyway

[16:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: deprecated implies (to me at least) that it might make sense to make new documents with those features

[16:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
as in the way HTML4 Transitional was "deprecated" but people still use it today

[16:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
and think it's fine

[16:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
that was because HTML4 had a separate conformance class for it, I think

[16:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I suppose you can make the editorial change of "braille" to "Braille" that John did in his draft

[16:11:02.0000] <annevk2>
for most other specs it would always generate a warning

[16:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
and for HTML5 it could too

[16:12:01.0000] <Dashiva>
How about using a word that isn't either deprecated or obsolete?

[16:12:02.0000] <annevk2>
the spec could also explain that you should not use these features in new documents (HTML4 didn't provide much guidance)

[16:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
using "obsolete" made sense when we just had conforming and non-conforming. It doesn't make much sense with the current conforming but obsolete nonsense

[16:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: i'm up for a new word if you have one. "deprecated" isn't in my thesaurus, see above. :-)

[16:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: is lowercase "braille" really wrong?

[16:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'd have expected the word to have become a regular noun by now

[16:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, functionality-wise, it seems to be more akin to legacy than deprecation

[16:15:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, Wikipedia uses uppercase

[16:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: not everywhere, i just checked

[16:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure. I just don't think it's a controversial change

[16:16:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Braille#Capitalization

[16:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Last I recall, @summary was still acceptable in addition to other techniques, used by a perfect and faultless author, for purely structural data of no use to other users

[16:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
answers.com and dictionary.com both seem to indicate that either is acceptable

[16:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dictionary.app uses only uppercase

[16:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, interesting http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/braille/capitalize.html

[16:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html#def-braille

[16:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
that uses lowercase

[16:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
heh

[16:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Enter "Braille/braille"

[16:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
in that case, leave it as is, since John provided no justification for the change anyway

[16:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, like annevk2, I too find myself strongly agreeing with Murray.

[16:41:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: "conforming but not recommended" ?

[16:42:00.0000] <webben>
or "conforming but not preferred"?

[16:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
... or simply "non-conforming"!

[16:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
vestigal syntax

[16:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
s/vestigal/vestigial/

[16:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/syntax/markup/

[16:46:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I always get that one wrong

[16:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Then again, I was spelling ominous quite confidently as "omnious" until I was 25

[16:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure vestigial is really an appropriate term here though

[16:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
a bodily part or organ that is small and degenerate or imperfectly developed in comparison to one more fully developed in an earlier stage of the individual, in a past generation, or in closely related forms

[16:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
organ -> feature, generation -> spec version

[16:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I dunno, you're probably right

[16:49:02.0000] <webben>
Curious how http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/#glossary makes deprecated a subset of obsolete and unhelpful that it doesn't clearly define "exist".

[16:52:00.0000] <webben>
e.g. overlapping set, rather

[16:52:01.0000] <webben>
s/e.g.//


2009-08-03
[17:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
if we clearly define "obsolete" as being a feature which authors must not use, but which must still be supported as defined, and deprecated as meaning a feature in the process of being phased out and replaced with an alternative, such that it intended to become obsolete in the future

[17:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
or we could go with "depreciated" instead ;-)

[17:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: Why would anything be deprecated then? If there's no replacement, we can't start phasing it out. And if there is a replacement, why not start phasing it out right away?

[17:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The old deprecated vs obsolete seems to be based on the idea that you can just say "Stop using this, support is going away", but we aren't going to remove support for still used features

[17:14:00.0000] <heycam>
what's the difference between a poll and a vote in this case?

[17:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me assumes votes are binding, and polls aren't

[17:31:00.0000] <jacobolus>
wow, these are beautiful mime types:

[17:31:01.0000] <jacobolus>
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document

[17:31:02.0000] <jacobolus>
etc.

[17:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, personally, I don't think we should have a deprecated state at all, and would prefer that we simply dropped the conforming but obsolete nonsense entirely. I'm just suggesting this as a potential compromise.

[17:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, I feel the same (I think). But neither deprecated nor obsolete (from HTML4) really fit the HTML5 concept, so I think it'll be trouble with either one. If only there was another word

[17:52:00.0000] <inimino>
"ungood"?

[17:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think the specific word used is less important than their definitions

[17:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
using the HTML4 definition of deprecated would not be a good idea

[17:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
refining the definition of deprecated to avoid the issues with the HTML4 definition is slightly better, though we'd have to accept the baggage associated with its perceived meaning among the web community

[18:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm on the "deprecated is toothless" train. Not just for HTML4, OpenGL is going through the same thing.

[18:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, maybe that's the reason that some people are pushing for the use of the term.  They know it's toothless and still want people to acutally use the summary attribute

[18:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
so maybe it's not such a good compromise after all

[18:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
screw it, let's just go with "obsolete and non-conforming"

[18:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, I wouldn't mind if it was changed to deprecated just for style. As long as it's conforming with a warning the actual result is the same

[18:14:00.0000] <roc>
/me ignores Tom Lord

[18:14:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I would be surprised if there's anyone who would accept s/obsolete/deprecated/ without also removing the warning

[18:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't want the warnings. I think the whole idea of downplayed errors or warnings for obsolete features is nonsense

[18:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I think it's an acceptable compromise for controversial features

[18:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
To me it's like a rfc SHOULD

[18:15:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Or maybe more like a SHOULD NOT [use this], I suppose

[18:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
but the controversy is simply based on people wanting to maintain the status quo, rather than accept change

[18:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's still a step forward, even if not as large a step as ideal. And the next version can include another step.

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i could just use "Features that are not part of the language" and "Features that are included for migration purposes only and trigger warnings"

[18:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I think "conforming" has rough consensus, please don't abandon it :)

[18:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just meant instead of "obsolete"

[18:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I don't think anyone is concered about the use of obsolete for features that are non-conforming.

[18:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's unclear to me, since there was a quote of a definition of "obsolete" that doesn't match what the spec says

[18:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's only the oxymoronic use of obsolete but conforming.

[18:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
why is that oxymoronic?

[18:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
because obsolete suggests it shouldn't be used, but conforming suggests that is ok.

[18:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
they're basically contradictory concepts

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
obsolete means that it is out of date

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
conforming means that you are allowed to do it

[18:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
conforming doesn't mean it's ok

[18:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
technically, that may be so, but you have to consider how the terms will be perceived

[20:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Probably a pipe dream due to Member restrictions, but it would be interesting to see what other WGs have changed their processes after whatwg/htmlwg's example

[20:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: forms and css became a little more open

[20:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
other than that, i'm not aware of any major change

[20:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I think doug has been opening up webapps some too

[20:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
webapps started after htmlwg

[20:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, compared to webapi

[20:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
it is?

[20:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
iirc webapi started after htmlwg too, anyway

[20:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
(webapi and waf were merged into webapps)

[20:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
(but all three started after htmlwg, i thought)

[20:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
(certainly after whatwg)

[20:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
i (and others) pushed to make webapi and waf and webapps more open quite a lot

[21:13:00.0000] <roc>
SVG is getting a bit more open

[21:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: is the value of the iframe "name" attribute allowed to be empty? and/or is a browsing context name allowed to be an empty string? I ask because v.nu doesn't require it to be. And not by accident. For whatever reason, Henri intentionally coded it that way.

[21:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
And fwiw, I note that in HTML4, it was defined as CDATA, with no constraints on its length.

[21:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks

[21:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: Spec currently has, "A valid browsing context name is any string with at least one character that does not start with a U+005F LOW LINE character."

[21:18:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least one character

[21:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
yup, was about to paste that

[21:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
spec seems clear

[21:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
can't be empty

[21:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[21:19:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to file a v.nu bug

[21:19:05.0000] <Hixie>
mathematically, if i negate -1, do i get -1 or +1 ?

[21:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
um, +1

[21:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
was that some kind of knock-knock joke?

[21:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok, good

[21:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
to get me to say +1 ?

[21:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
i was just checking that "negate x" doesn't mean "-abs(x)" but means "-x"

[21:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think web api wg was originally created before html wg

[21:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, FYI, webapi and waf started at the end of 2005. HTMLWG officially started on March 7th 2007

[21:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the merged webapps wg follows mostly open process afaict

[21:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the member-only list is almost never used

[21:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me hopes his last mail to public-html makes John, or at least rubys, realise how silly the approach being pushed to deal with @summary is

[21:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
the things that bug me about this thread:

[21:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
honestly, I don't even care about voting on it, but if we're going to have a vote, I'd like to have one where we actually make a decision on the issue, rather than a rushed one to make a temporary patch to a Working Draft

[21:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
a vote that Sam has been asked to hold and has failed to so far

[21:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
1. john keeps saying that html5 says what i want it to say... but i want summary="" out altogether, which html5 doesn't say, so how is it my opinion??

[21:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
2. john keeps saying we should work with the pfwg, but as i explained, the pfwg refused to reply to my e-mails! http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0056.html

[21:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
3. john hasn't given one shred of valid reasoning for keeping summary="", and has not provided any data at all

[21:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
4. we're exactly following the process (editor makes proposals out of the blue), and he complains that this isn't the process

[21:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
side note: I'm looking at implementing trivial HTML5 elements like <nav> in WebKit

[21:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
5. i'm doing exactly what i said i'd do in terms of writing those proposals (use reasoning and research)

[21:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
what would be appropriate test cases, besides checking the default styling?

[21:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: for <nav>, check that voiceover skips past it (assuming voiceover has "skip navigation" features)

[21:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: parsing should be checked too

[21:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure VoiceOver has such a feature yet

[21:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: oh and HTMLSectionElement has a .cite DOM attribute

[21:46:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: are there special parsing requirements for these elements? should I be testing cases where they are misnested?

[21:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
other than that, i don't think anything in particular

[21:46:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I did notice that section and article have IDL interfaces

[21:46:06.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what bothers me more is that rubys is encouraging it!

[21:46:07.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: for parsing, they're like <div> iirc

[21:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: indeed, Sam does not seem to have done anything to actually resolve the issue

[21:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, regarding sectioning elements and headings, I'm a little concerned that since we've started seeing a lot of early adopters, trying to implement the default sizing for h1 based on nesting level may prove problematic

[21:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
I haven' tested this out though, but it would be worth looking into

[21:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think I know how to make them parse like <div>, but I'm not sure what edge cases to test

[21:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
in parsing? dunno

[21:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
other than that, i don't think there really are any edge cases

[21:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I should check that <p> doesn't close it, and that unclosed <b> or <i> or whatever behaves like it does for div

[21:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[21:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: my intent was to initially add the various sectioning elements so they are recognized by the engine, and then have a separate task to implement the header sizing rule

[21:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: specifically I'm thinking of adding a -webkit-section-depth(n) pseudo-class or something like that

[21:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(I think the pseudo-class could be useful even if applying different sizes by default turns out to be impractical)

[21:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
I'd make it :-webkit-heading(n)

[21:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
IIRC, JQuery has a :heading(n) pseudo class and it would be worth developing something backwards compatible with that

[21:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
(I could have remembered the details about that wrong, though)

[21:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I need to go to bed and wake up in 3 hours, in order to take my MacBook in for repair (again!) and then get to work

[22:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
how does JQuery's :heading(n) work?

[23:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: are you around?

[23:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: yep

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hi

[00:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
you live!

[00:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: mere hours ago i hit my timeout on worrying that a devilish fate may have befallen you

[00:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: and asked around, only to learn you were on holiday until today :-P

[00:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I said two weeks. I meant the adjacent weekends, too.

[00:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
i had forgotten that you had said anything

[00:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really keep track of where y'all are :-P

[00:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
btw i recommend not reading your e-mail

[00:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
for at least another week

[00:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Mail.app is so slow I may have to wait until next week for it to download and filter the pending email :-)

[00:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
public-html has been making me a sad panda

[00:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hmm, implementing <nav> is trickier than I thought...

[00:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
really?

[00:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: what's there to implement other than </p> inference, default style and exposure to VoiceOver?

[00:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I thought it would be trivial but I'm clearly messing something up

[00:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: hey!

[00:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: hi

[00:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
was kind of worried about you.. nobody seemed to know where you were, or if you were on vacation or what. Until earlier today, Hixie heard from somebody I guess

[00:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, glad you're back

[00:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: sorry, I guess I should have broadcast my schedule more widely

[00:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I left an /away message on IRC, but the server running my irssi got rebooted

[00:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[00:59:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, new elements also imply </p> I think

[01:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: my attempted code change (which I thought was trivial) should imply </p> through the same mechanism that <div> does

[01:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I'm not getting the <nav> elements in the DOM for some reason

[01:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
need to debug

[01:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: how much work would it be to take make a standalone binary utility based on the v.nu/whattf HTML5 datatype library?

[01:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
would it be practical at all to try to do so?

[01:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: do you mean a .jar that anyone could load into Jing or MSV?

[01:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: or a utility that includes Jing, too?

[01:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: you should copy <address>, not <div>

[01:05:00.0000] <annevk>
afaict it is identical to <div> apart from foreign content mode

[01:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
<div> is scoping

[01:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me checks if address is

[01:05:03.0000] <othermaciej>
<address> and <div> have different WebKit parsing behavior in a way that I don't actually understand at the moment

[01:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: as far as I can tell, the new structural elements have the exact same tree builder dispatch bits as <address>

[01:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(by inspection of code I've written earlier, not by inspecting the spec)

[01:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.whatwg.org/demos/company-home/ probably shouldn't use flags for languages (in order to be a politically correct good example)

[01:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: at the risk of making clear how little I understand about the v.nu architecture, I have to ask, Does the datatype library have a dependency on Jing?

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: it doesn't

[01:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: Jing and MSV share interfaces for this stuff, so the datatype library depends on those shared interfaces

[01:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK, so to give you the context for why I'm asking: I would like to have something that could be used with rnv

[01:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rnv is C, right?

[01:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, but it has this simple mechanism where you can have it delegate datatype-checking to another command-lined application

[01:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and it has Scheme and stdin/out datatype lib interfaces, IIRC

[01:17:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
right

[01:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm talking about the stdin interface

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it should be possible to write a command-line wrapper host that can hold any Java datatype library

[01:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[01:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and then compile the HTML5 datatype lib with that host using GCJ to eliminate the JVM startup overhead

[01:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
right, that's what I had in mind

[01:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: http://iso-relax.sourceforge.net/

[01:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks

[01:19:03.0000] <hsivonen>
that's the SourceForge copy of the shared interfaces

[01:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oops. maybe I have the wrong URL. sorry

[01:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: http://sourceforge.net/projects/relaxng/

[01:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
that's the one

[01:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[01:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://sourceforge.net/projects/relaxng/files/datatype%20%28java%29/Ver.1.0/relaxngDatatype-1.0.zip/download

[01:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yep, found it -- thanks

[01:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think I figured out what I did wrong in implementing

[01:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I had to hook up a few more places

[01:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes Apple shipped GCJ along with the GCC pieces that Apple ships

[01:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Darxus: If you have a DTD-valid XML 1.0 file that doesn't use Namespaces, you can process it as SGML if your SGML pipeline implements Annex K, IIRC.

[01:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: you're scaring me with this stuff

[01:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
what the hell is Annex K?

[01:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
sweet, got it working

[01:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: it's an annex they made to SGML in order to make XML a subset of SGML

[01:32:04.0000] <othermaciej>
just have to make tests now

[01:32:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ah

[01:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: IIRC, it adds the <foo/> stuff to SGML

[01:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[01:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so next I'm wondering what Darxus would want to process a document as SGML

[01:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
XML processing isn't a subset of SGML processing, though, so the Right Thing happens if the input document is already known to be error-free

[01:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: does a browser implement input type=color already?

[01:40:00.0000] <annevk>
not as far as I know

[01:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think HTML5 shouldn't be silent about mutation events when it comes to the parser, innerHTML and document.open(). But I'd be OK with saying that mutation events aren't required, but if they are implemented, they need to fire / not fire so and so

[01:45:00.0000] <annevk>
I think we're waiting for DOM3Events

[01:57:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, while going through some of the older blog entries to see if additional template tweaks are needed I found http://blog.whatwg.org/vim-checker and it seems that the image is no longer there

[01:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks

[01:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: btw, it's great to have that new design

[01:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's like night and day

[01:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
looks like a real blog now :)

[02:00:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, couple of days ago I suddenly remembered we actually had a design proposed but never implemented it :)

[02:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
grr. someone is *still* sending shockwaves to my office, and I'm unable to locate a construction site with explosives nearby

[02:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me already hoisted remaining hard disks onto rubber footing. no idea if that helps with this kind of shocks

[02:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm surprised at the number of separate places I had to change in WebKit to add a new HTML element

[02:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(6 to be exact)

[02:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: OK, thanks for the heads-up. I just deleted the img and the paragraph that preceded it

[02:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if I were able to tell a mac and a readynas to sleep disks without turning them off 

[02:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if I knew when the next shockwave hits

[02:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yet another problem that solid-state storage would solve

[02:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could suspend the disks from springs

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: has anyone productized a spring-base NAS-holder that I could buy?

[02:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could suspend the NAS-holder from springs

[02:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I want a productized spring-suspender

[02:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me got an external disk recently and it came with stretchy rubber things around each end, but he isn't quite sure what effect they're meant to have

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I bought the softest erasers I could find and placed 4 under the NAS and four under the Mac

[02:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what excitement he has missed

[02:44:00.0000] <annevk>
since?

[02:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
17th July

[02:44:02.0000] <annevk>
heh, your vacation is in sync with hsivonen's

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk>
we put up a new design for the blog

[02:45:01.0000] <annevk>
other than that there's been a lot of process bs email

[02:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
who would have guessed?

[02:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
The blog looks much better :)

[02:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
Although the green of the bar clashes with the green of the title

[02:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hasn't read list email yet, but from subject lines, it seems it has been another round of accessibility and RDFa :-(

[02:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And process. A lot of process.

[02:52:01.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: entertain me?

[02:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: Go read public-html.

[02:55:00.0000] <eighty4>
I don't want to read public-html

[02:55:01.0000] <eighty4>
:(

[02:55:02.0000] <jgraham>
^ That should be the /topic ;)

[02:56:00.0000] <eighty4>
/me is grinig

[03:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs at his Monday mornings, always spent catching up on public-html(-.*)? and whatwg, always full of process discussions

[03:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: for mutation events i'm waiting to learn if they're changing at all before saying anything

[03:13:00.0000] <roc>
jgraham: WAI merged with PETA, we are now considering cross-species accessibility requirements

[03:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
roc: now people are giving me strage looks in the office

[03:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks innocent

[03:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But seriously, jgraham, if you do laugh with a facial expression like that…

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. fielding committed unregistered types to mime.types

[03:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
That's my special facial expression I reserve for painfully funny things

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovered http://www.peta.org/sea_kittens/about.asp recently, and found it hard to tell whether it was real or a parody

[03:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
LOL

[03:27:00.0000] <annevk>
'But if you call fish "sea kittens," maybe people will be nicer to them.' ...

[03:28:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: flickr a photo of jgraham laughting?

[03:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is not /still/ laughing

[03:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I have neither a camera nor a jgraham who is laughing.

[03:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Surely you could find a devilish scheme to make him laugh

[03:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Sadly I don't think I'm witty enough.

[03:30:01.0000] <eighty4>
I'd be willing to help

[03:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
You could try tickling him

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
though people might start giving you strange looks

[03:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: or I guess better yet, it would be grand to have a jing command-line binary that had the v.nu HTML5 datatype library built-in

[04:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: that should be easy

[04:10:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, "just register those" >.5M USD or so

[04:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I *think* the steps are: 1) take a Jing binary, 2) add the datatype lib jar to the same directory that holds Saxon, 3) edit the manifest of the main .jar to point to the datatype lib jar the same way it points to the saxon jar

[04:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah that's why it was parenthetical with a "!" :-)

[04:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me found out who is blowing up stuff inside the hill that my office is on

[04:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: hill trolls?

[04:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: nope. looks like en energy company is expanding its tunnels

[04:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
Does finland have trolls?

[04:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Apparently in Iceland, so many people believe in "hidden people" (i.e. some sort of faerie or so) that they had to divert the main ringroad round the island several times to avoid areas where they were believed to live

[04:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: Moomin

[04:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
isn't that a big white bulbous guy

[04:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Moomins live in a wooden house, not inside bedrock, though

[04:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
sweet i was right http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomin

[04:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Moomins are awesome but I can't imagine them blowing up a hill

[04:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
lol

[04:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
we're getting far more useless bug reports than i expected

[04:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
there's even a prompt now confirming intent to submit

[04:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. they are building a tunnel that is going to be long

[04:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess they aren't going to stop soon

[04:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
you could go politely ask them to

[04:18:03.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose a shorter tunnel would be pretty useless

[04:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
"hi i'm sorry, would you mind putting your tunnel elsewhere?"

[04:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Perhaps if they tunneled somewhere with no hill it would be easier for everyone concerned

[04:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thought these parts of the city were already connected with tunnels

[04:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: maybe they are building tunnels under the existing tunnels

[04:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's what's done in Tokyo at least

[04:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe

[04:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for subways at least (in Tokyo) - the newer a subway line is, the taller the escalators

[04:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
london too, though none are newer than about 4 centuries

[04:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i may be exaggerating a little)

[04:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
Jubilee line extension

[04:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: That's not that deep in the Docklands :P

[04:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Sure but it is also rather new

[04:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
True

[04:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
The Jubilee is deep in the centre though

[04:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
apparently this one is for electricity, water and central heating

[04:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me remembers getting out of the Northern at some station in the centre, only to find the elevator had broken

[04:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
An elevator at a station?

[04:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
On underground lines, yes.

[04:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought they just had escalators

[04:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Not the deep level lines

[04:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Some stations on the deep level lines have elevators and stairs, nothing else.

[04:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[04:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me is not an expert in train journeying

[04:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Russell Square is one such station, IIRC

[04:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Well, get out, see Europe!

[04:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think they should use pneumatic tubes to shoot people up to ground level

[04:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
not if the british run it they shouldn't

[04:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
they'd underfund maintenance and people would be shot out at killed every other week

[04:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
or, more likely, it'd be perpetually out of service

[04:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
There was some circular escalator built for some underground station, IIRC

[04:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The only one ever build.

[04:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*built

[04:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It always had issues, and was shut soon after being installed.

[04:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://districtdave.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=History&action=display&thread=2596&page=1

[04:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6182967.stm

[04:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
When I went in to work last week, a staircase was taped off and had a sign saying it was "out of service" and "engineers are investigating" (which was clearly untrue because nobody was even looking at it)

[04:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The lifts have been broken for a month, but I got an email today saying one was back in service)

[04:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.abandonedstations.org.uk/Holloway_Road_station.html is what I originally saw about it

[04:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyhow, enough procrastinating

[04:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
Covent Garden tube station has a lift and steps

[04:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think Cambden Town might too

[04:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
*Camden

[04:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
Disappointingly the depth of tube lines seems to be considered security sensitive information and as such there are no 3D tube maps showing depth avaliable

[04:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, spiral escalator? Maybe they could make one that's a rotating corkscrew, continually lifting people upwards

[04:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Camden Town doesn't.

[04:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Actually, I think it does.

[04:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
is the square border around the whatwg logo in the new blog design intentional?

[04:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It's just that it's only 40 or so steps, so it isn't that deep, so most people just use them, as the lifts are really slow

[04:51:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Same at Mornington Cresent

[04:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
you can't win that game in one step! cheater!

[04:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It might be that nobody tested the blog in Firefox

[04:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Huh? He got there from Camden town

[04:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok then

[04:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Besides, I had to walk all the way from the elevator to the platform

[04:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me remembers he has an Oyster card back in his apartment, and wonders how much money is still on that

[04:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me remembers he also has a single BVG ticket for Berlin in his apartment

[04:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
They seem highly useful things to have here

[05:05:00.0000] <annevk42>
weird

[05:05:01.0000] <annevk42>
Chromium for linux now no longer uses the platform Chrome

[05:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that changed over the weekend

[05:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't think it is so much that, but they changed their default skin

[05:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me never ceases to be amazed at how easy it is to get IE to crash

[05:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
omg the blog uses <cite> incorrectly!

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the easy way to avoid using <cite> incorrectly is to use <i> where italics are appropriate

[05:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
i fixed the spec to use <i> all over the place recently

[05:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
instead of <em> and various other mistakes

[05:26:00.0000] <annevk42>
the blog uses <cite>?

[05:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I still use <cite> and <em> out of an old habit. perhaps I should start getting used to <i>

[05:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You probably ought to stop misusing @title sometime

[05:26:03.0000] <zcorpan>
<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.brucelawson.co.uk' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>bruce</a></cite> <span class="says">says:</span>

[05:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: pah :-)

[05:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: hehe

[05:27:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess you could change the conformance criteria to make it conforming, as that'd be easier :P

[05:30:01.0000] <annevk42>
adactio, the complaint was that <cite> is incorrect

[05:30:02.0000] <adactio>
That's a common usage of cite on my part.

[05:30:03.0000] <annevk42>
in other news, changing that seems annoying

[05:30:04.0000] <adactio>
I'm going to continue to use it that way even if HTML5 says otherwise.

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk42>
all I have i: <ol class="commentlist"><?php wp_list_comments(); ?></ol> ...

[05:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: using <cite> for personal names goes against the intent of HTML 2.0 founding fathers

[05:31:02.0000] <adactio>
Just as specifying something that browser makers won't implement is fiction, specifying something that authors refuse to adhere to is equally fiction.

[05:31:03.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: HTML 4 corrupted <cite>

[05:32:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: I disagree. HTML4 embraced and extended <cite> ;-)

[05:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: HTML 4 accounts for the majority of time HTML has existed

[05:32:02.0000] <adactio>
You could say that HTML5 is corrupting <legend> but I prefer to think of it a smart extension of an existing element ...just like HTML4 did with <cite>.

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not a fan of the way HTML5 uses <legend>, but the English thesaurus is exhausted

[05:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe we should switch to another language

[05:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
both <legend> and <caption> come with legacy parsing baggage

[05:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
<legend> has practical problems that haven't yet been resolved too

[05:34:03.0000] <Lachy>
but we've yet to find a reasonable alternative

[05:34:04.0000] <zcorpan>
otoh, getting <legend> to work nicely in browsers will be a welcome change for web developers

[05:34:05.0000] <hsivonen>
if we can get authors to use <rubric>, let's go for it

[05:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure how well <rubric> would be accepted in practice. I'm quite sure most people, even native English speakers, wouldn't know what it meant

[05:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
Caption Synonyms: explanation, head, inscription, legend, rubric, subtitle, title, underline

[05:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
of those, explanation (or explain) seems like the only remotely reasonable alternative, given compat issues

[05:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
<rubric> would be highly confusing to most native english speakers

[05:40:01.0000] <adactio>
It's challenging to think of something that works equally well for <figure> and <details>.

[05:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, as for cite, adactio has a point.  If authors are going to ignore what the spec actually says in favour of what they want to use it for, then the spec is just fiction

[05:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
since the only time it ius used in common parlance it means the instructions on an examination paper

[05:41:01.0000] <adactio>
Lachy: I could always twist the wording of the spec to suit my needs. If the spec says <cite> must only be used for "title of work", I'll use it to mark up a person as long as that person is "a real piece of work" ;-)

[05:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
about about we just go with <c> and say it means caption

[05:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if anyone has ever derived any value from the use of the <cite> element

[05:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
s/about about/how about/

[05:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Hixie's main objection is making up any other element name not just the exact name

[05:43:01.0000] <adactio>
jgraham: there's the W3C semantic data extractor which picks up uses of the <cite> element but I wouldn't exactly call that a practical use.

[05:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the short non-fiction version is that <i>, <em>, <cite> and <var> mean italics. <b> and <strong> mean bold and <tt>, <code>, <kbd> and <samp> mean monospace

[05:43:03.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, the only value is for the author as it allows for styling without relying on class names to distinguish among different uses of italics

[05:44:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivoven: I use <cite> (in pretty much every blog post I write) and I don't style it to be italic.

[05:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, a semantic data extractor is not a useful tool by itself. Unless it were used for some real purpose in some application, it's little more than an interesting experiment

[05:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
adactio: Real question: do you think using <cite> in that way is advantageous over using <i>?

[05:45:01.0000] <adactio>
Lachy: agreed; that's why I said it wasn't exactly a practical use. A more practical use would be auto-generated (with JavaScript) footnotes and references.

[05:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
(and restyling it)

[05:45:03.0000] <jgraham>
(or <span>)

[05:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, if that's Hixie's only objection, it seems pretty weak considering the problems with <legend>

[05:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: agreed

[05:46:02.0000] <gsnedders>
adactio: You might, but the vast majority of use makes the small amount of semantic use of it more or less irrelevant in terms of real usage

[05:47:00.0000] <annevk42>
it's not that weak imo

[05:47:01.0000] <annevk42>
in a few years <legend> issues will go away

[05:47:02.0000] <adactio>
jgraham: yes, for the same reason that using <p> to mark up a paragraph of text is better than using <br>s ...or why it makes sense to mark up navigation in a <ul> or <ol> rather than simply a <div> ...authors should be free to use the most *semantically* suitable element. It has *nothing* to do with styling (italics, bullet points, whatever).

[05:47:03.0000] <annevk42>
before <details> is properly supported will also take some time

[05:47:04.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, legend issues have been known about since at least Firefox 2.0, and still after 2 major release cycles, still nothing has been done about it

[05:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk42: How many years compared to the timescale for deployment of <figure>?

[05:48:01.0000] <annevk42>
Lachy, actually some fixes have been made

[05:48:02.0000] <Lachy>
not in Firefox 3.5. Is it fixed in Minefield?

[05:48:03.0000] <annevk42>
I said some

[05:48:04.0000] <jgraham>
(afaict the timescale for the deployment of <figure> is "next major browser release of several browsers")

[05:49:00.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, I think before 2012 or so we shouldn't worry too much about this

[05:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: are there content consumers who don't have prior agreement with you and whose software isn't specific to your site and who derive value from your use of <cite>?

[05:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
(<details> can be faked with js as long as you don't use legend)

[05:49:03.0000] <annevk42>
well, we should get browsers to support things better, but we should not be fixing the problem in the wrong place

[05:49:04.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, since we're beginning to see a lot of early adopters, I think we should pay a little more attention to the problems now rather than later

[05:50:00.0000] <annevk42>
because in the end HTML5 requires <legend> to work just as well

[05:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: It's fixed in Minefield with HTML 5 parser enabled

[05:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[05:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
annevk42: Sure legend should be fixed but blocking several unrelated things on that seems like a bad idea, especially if they are useful

[05:51:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: no, and there are no content consumers who derive use of my use of <p> or <ul> or most other elements ...but they're *still* the right elements to use. If the only argument for using an element is end practical end benefit, we need nothing more than <div> and <span>.

[05:51:01.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, it just delays experimentation a little bit, and you can always experiment by just using a <div> instead

[05:51:02.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, before 2012 wide-scale deployment is not really an option anyway

[05:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, that's not true. Assistive technology derives value from the correct use of <ul>, and, to some extent, <p>

[05:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
adactio: I disagree. There are several other styling-unrelated reasons for using things like lists and paragraphs. (I don't think I ever claimed that styling was the main reason for anything)

[05:52:02.0000] <jgraham>
AT is one obvious one. Improved source readability is another

[05:52:03.0000] <adactio>
jgraham: you didn't, but Hixie is arguing that on the list.

[05:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, improved source readability isn't really value for a consumer

[05:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
unless you count the geeks who look at the source of every site they visit

[05:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I didn't just ask about consumer value

[05:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Saying "I use <cite> because it makes my pages easier to maintain" seems valid to me

[05:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I thought what you said was related to hsivonen's question about content consumers deriving value from markup

[05:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if google makes use of <cite>. I guess it does but only as part of a more complex set of heuristics

[05:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: whether <ul> is useful depends on whether one wants to keep HTML processable without access to computed style for the screen media

[05:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
But maybe explicit markup like that makes automatic extraction of author names from e.g. Google scholar work better

[05:59:00.0000] <adactio>
I use the <cite> element (and every other element for that matter) for the same reason that I choose the particular quotation marks, em dashes, en dashes, ellipses or semi-colons. As an author, I want to choose the most appropriate structure for my content. That means I choose the most appropriate punctuation and the most semantically appropriate markup. That may bring me no practical benefit (yet) but I will still do it 

[06:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
quotes as dashes have immediate appeal to humans browsing content

[06:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me chooses the right punctuation to improve readability and typography which seem like very immediate obvious and practical benefits

[06:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
computed style is similar

[06:00:03.0000] <hsivonen>
how computed style comes about is different

[06:03:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: yes, but when it comes to *which* punctuation to use, it's author preference: do I use a semi-colon or an em-dash to separate a subclause? Do I use a colon or an ellipsis? I choose what I feel is most appropriate. Same with semantics. I have a choice of elements and I choose the one I think is most appropriate for the content. My decision. Not Hixie's. I will continue to choose the semantically appropriate eleme

[06:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I think how people arrange their selectors is a private choice. I think semanticsare useful for interchange 

[06:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm isn't semantics about _shared_ meanings. It seems a little Alice-in-wonderland to say "when I use elements thwey mean just what I chose them to mean"

[06:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so semantics that aren't for interchange aren't different from non-microformat class names

[06:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is not giving this conversation as much attention as it requires to do the topic justice

[06:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, while authors do have some freedom with regards to the punctuation they choose to use, they are generally used according to the grammatic rules of the language.

[06:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
You don't, for example, randomly! use, punctuation throughout @ a sentence? do you%

[06:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
Unless you are writing perl

[06:07:01.0000] <adactio>
But I'm not alone. In fact, I'm going along with the HTML4 definition of <cite>. If HTML5 chooses to revert that decision, that doesn't mean that authors will go along with it. That particular part of the spec becomes fiction precisely because it isn't documenting the *shared* meaning of an element.

[06:07:02.0000] <adactio>
Lachy: re-read what I said about specific cases: semi-colons vs. em-dashes, colons vs. ellipses.

[06:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, if you're writing perl, you're still adhering to the grammatic and syntactic rules of the language

[06:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I see your point, but <cite> is still private even if a lot of authors do it if the choice of element matter for their own selectors and not to loosely-coupled consumers

[06:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, semi-colons, em-dashes, colons and ellipses have distinct purposes. They are not directly interchangeable.

[06:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(a lot of the prescriptive semantics for inline elements are over-precise to be descriptive)

[06:10:00.0000] <adactio>
Lachy: some authors use a semi-colon where I would use an em-dash and visa-versa. Neither of us is wrong.

[06:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
adactio: The meanings of blockquote and h1 are fiction too, as to be real they'd need to "indent" and "bold". Should we change that too so the spec isn't fiction?

[06:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, not everyone uses punctuation correctly in all cases.

[06:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I think you are wrong about punctuation. There are style guides but natural language is really not prescriptivist

[06:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
As long as people think that you are using things in the right way then it is valid usage

[06:12:02.0000] <adactio>
gsnedders: I think you are inferring the exact opposite of what I'm saying. According to Hixie's logic with <cite> (that it is only used to italicise) then yes, <blockquote> should only be used to indent. I'm arguing the opposite. That the semantic meaning is important, not the styling.

[06:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
adactio: You're arguing the spec is fiction if it does not match reality too, and I'm pointing out more examples where it does not.

[06:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
If I were redesigning HTML from scratch knowing what I know now, I wouldn't put <cite>, <em>, <var>, <strong>, <code>, <kbd> and <samp> in the language

[06:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
adactio: And those two examples I gave have presentation semantics in reality

[06:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: That is not fair. Headings are often (but not always) used correctly

[06:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: you have discovered that Hixie is more willing to deviate form "reality" into fiction when it comes to things that aren't browser-implementation-relevant

[06:14:02.0000] <jgraham>
same as tables

[06:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
Blockquote I don;t know about

[06:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: browser implementation reqs are the most reality-based and the non-machine-detectable conformance reqs are the least reality based parts of the spec

[06:15:02.0000] <adactio>
Let me give you another example of author choice, one that comes up a lot on web dev blogs. Suppose you're marking up a <form>. What element do you use to contain your form field and your <label>? Some authors use <div>s. Some authors use <p>s. Some authors use <li>s. We could argue (we have argued) about which is the most appropriate but in the end, it's author choice. The HTML spec shouldn't dictate that level of usage 

[06:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, to some extent yes, but there are still grammatical rules that exist and which should be adhered to

[06:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
adactio: I agree with that totally. Unless there are practical reasons for using one over another e.g. the effect in actual client applications

[06:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
e.g. tables would likely be treated differently in AT to <p>

[06:17:02.0000] <jgraham>
and possibly be harder to navigate

[06:18:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: I think that's a good way to split features: features that need work from browsers vs. features that only need authors to buy in to. What I'm saying is that just as browser buy-in is required for the first type of feature, author buy-in is required for the second. So mandating something in the spec that authors don't agree with (and therefore won't abide by) is as pointless as mandating something that browsers w

[06:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
adactio: (Got cut off after "that browsers w")

[06:19:01.0000] <adactio>
will never implement.

[06:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I tend to agree, although I personally dislike the use of <cite> for anything but the title of work concept

[06:19:03.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: and you, as an author, are free to only use it for titles of work.

[06:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
eww. making innerHTML setter block network and event loop seems evil

[06:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/block/block on/

[06:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm shocked it has even been proposed

[07:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
woah, Rubys has now said flat out that Hixie should accept John's changes and move on! WTF?

[07:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Reading about <cite> led me to @cite, which made me wonder if no one in the RDF circles had tried to also let it accept a person URI instead of only a document URI

[07:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: it was only proposed by Hixie as an attempt to be compatible with ie

[07:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: btw gsnedders found an infinite loop in the html5 parser

[07:31:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: something with <select>.innerHTML='<keygen>' iirc

[07:32:00.0000] <webben>
adactio: What is the point of features that only authors will buy into?

[07:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: thanks.

[07:32:02.0000] <adactio>
webben: what is the point of features that authors won't buy into?

[07:33:00.0000] <webben>
adactio: Very little.

[07:33:01.0000] <adactio>
webben: agreed.

[07:35:00.0000] <webben>
adactio: My point is that the effect on the user experience is what matters (or at least, what should matter), for anything other than syntactic sugar.

[07:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Is there a one-liner about "author education" similar to "the tools will save us"?

[07:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Zeldman will save us

[07:36:01.0000] <webben>
So if different elements for wrapping form controls have an effect on the user experience, I don't see why HTML5 shouldn't have conformance criteria about it.

[07:36:02.0000] <Dashiva>
(and "search engines can use it")

[07:37:00.0000] <adactio>
webben: so you aren't distinguishing between features that extend the platform (canvas, video, etc.) and features that extend the language (header, footer, cite). I think it's unwise to treat all features as being in the same class. There are clearly differences between browser features (which, as you say, directly effect the UX) and language features (which affect semantics ...invisible but still important).

[07:38:00.0000] <webben>
I think all semantic distinctions have a /potential/ effect on user agents.

[07:38:01.0000] <adactio>
webben: I certainly don't equate semantics with "syntactic sugar." HTML is a markup, not a programming, language (or, now with HTML5) it is a markup *and* a programming language.

[07:38:02.0000] <webben>
For example, screen readers offer keys for navigating list elements, tables, and "paragraphs" independently.

[07:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: header and footer should be considered to extend the platform, IMO

[07:38:04.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: as far as exposure to AT goes

[07:40:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivoven: help me think of a better example of "extending the language" i.e. new semantics that don't require undue work from browser makers in order for authors to use them.

[07:40:01.0000] <webben>
adactio: I don't equate semantics with syntactic sugar. But the important thing about semantic features (as opposed to mere naming conventions) is that user agents can /do/ things with those semantics. 

[07:40:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Was I the only one laughing when Sam assumed wcag had peer review?

[07:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wasn't even involved in the process, but I still remember all the blog posts about how it ignored input and feedback

[07:42:00.0000] <adactio>
webben: even naming conventions *can* be used by user agents (see: microformats) so I don't think there's such a clear distinction between semantics and naming conventions. Both can be potentially used by user agents.

[07:42:01.0000] <webben>
adactio: (My point about syntactic sugar is that unlike other features, it's only of interest to authors.)

[07:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me guesses that Sam has never been a working scientist

[07:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes, yes, whatever you said Dr Graham

[07:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
Fuck off

[07:43:02.0000] <webben>
adactio: That's true, and to the extent that user agents can do things with them, it's appropriate for them to specified (see: microformat specs).

[07:43:03.0000] <adactio>
webben: I disagree. When enough authors agree on semantic usage, user agents can make use of that collective decision. Admittedly, this doesn't happen that often but it doesn't happen that often with regular elements either.

[07:43:04.0000] <jgraham>

[09:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So if Shelley's judgement of the anti-summary arguments is valid, what does that say about pro-summary which has even less data, even less reasoning

[09:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's means they're on an equal footing

[11:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.khronos.org/news/press/releases/khronos-releases-opengl-3.2-third-major-opengl-release-within-twelve-months/ - "... the new WebGL™ standard for 3D on the web ..."

[11:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
Seems to be the first time they've used that name, as far as I can see

[11:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
(presumably for the 3D canvas stuff)

[11:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.tgdaily.com/images/stories/450teaser/opengl/openglslide1.jpg - HTML 5 is in there, plus an awful lot of arrows

[11:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.tgdaily.com/images/stories/450teaser/opengl/openglslide2.jpg - "OpenGL 3.2 exposes the capability of DX 10.0 GPUs" - it seems kind of sad that they're using a competing 3D API's version numbers to refer to hardware capabilities

[11:52:00.0000] <Darxus>
There is no way to say a page is in two languages?

[11:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Darxus: you can put the lang attribute on individual elements

[11:54:00.0000] <Darxus>
MikeSmith: Awesome, thanks.

[11:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
np

[11:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
What if you're marking up a multilingual pun which could be read in either language?

[11:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Darxus: but don't ever trust anything I say until you get independent confirmation from a knowledgeable third party.

[11:55:02.0000] <Darxus>
Hehe.

[11:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: per Philip`s use-case, the lang attribute should clearly allow a list instead of a just a single language code

[11:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: n00b

[11:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me prepares v.nu patch of lang datatype-checking, in anticipation of Hixie's spec change

[11:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me dreams of a simpler life

[12:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: it's spelled n〇０b, you n〇０b

[12:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Sry

[12:27:00.0000] <tantekc>
Hixie, Philip` I remember from past chats here that both of you have research that shows that the summary attribute has been problematic, ineffective or both.

[12:28:00.0000] <tantekc>
could you both add links to that research to the Summary attribute page on the whatwg wiki?

[12:28:01.0000] <tantekc>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Table_Summary

[12:28:02.0000] <tantek>
Thanks, and appreciated.

[12:38:00.0000] <webben>
tantek: 

[12:40:00.0000] <webben>
nvm ... thought I had the link to hand

[12:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
tantek: I don't have anything that gives any conclusions like that, but there's some mostly-raw data at http://philip.html5.org/data/table-summary-values.html and http://philip.html5.org/data/table-summary-values-dotbot.html which I'm too lazy to bother editing the wiki for

[12:48:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip` wow that second link is quite revealing.

[12:51:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip` would you like any specific attribution (e.g. full name) on the wiki in addition to the links?

[13:04:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip` - thanks for the research. I've amo�� your links: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Table_Summary#Research

[13:05:00.0000] <tantek>
please feel free to make any corrections to the text I added.

[13:08:00.0000] <annevk2>
tantek, there is also http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/SummaryForTABLE though I think it is somewhat confusing and long

[13:09:00.0000] <tantek>
annevk2 - a few weeks ago there was a discussion about the esw wiki, and several contributors here in this IRC channel claimed their edits were removed.

[13:09:01.0000] <tantek>
as such I proposed that they instead add a page to the whatwg wiki to track the issue

[13:09:02.0000] <tantek>
and be careful to attempt to capture/preserve various points of view - as a scientist should.

[13:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
okidoki, just wanted to point out that wiki

[13:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I propose that if they are going to behave like scientists, they should also wear white lab coats while editing the wiki.

[13:10:02.0000] <annevk2>
I'm somewhat succeeding at staying out of this mess so I think I won't contribute for now

[13:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
tantek: Attribution doesn't matter - people can go to the root domain to find contact information if they want to complain directly to me :-)

[13:11:01.0000] <tantek>
annevk2 - feel free to add a link to the other wiki page to the whatwg wiki so that others may discover it as well, and perhaps help by providing summaries (pun not-intended) of the "somewhat confusing and long" sections.

[13:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
let that be my only contribution then; done

[13:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the problem here is not of cataloging the evidence but of what seem to be irreconcilable worldviews

[13:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
on the one hand, a belief in quantitative studies and willingness to break whatever eggs are necessary to make the omelet

[13:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and on the other hand, a belief in expertise and precedent, and that the issue should be primarily decided by the official designated experts

[13:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
It seems to me like at this point, people are just repeating these positions at each other

[13:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(belief in the experts also results in an unreasonable burden of proof for any position that contradicts the official expert position)

[13:28:01.0000] <annevk2>
I think John changed his position somewhat in that he's not against research, but is against the HTML WG making decisions about the HTML language that contradict existing WAI advice. He argues that we should first change the advice before changing HTML.

[13:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think most of the WAI/PFWG-affiliated people basically think it should be WAI's call, though some of them may be less open than John to changing what WCAG says

[13:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
though the idea that WCAG Techniques should change before HTML5 suggests new techniques is kind of a chicken and egg problem

[13:33:01.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - but the "experts" as you say, often disagree. witness the government document Hixie posted a link to.

[13:33:02.0000] <tantek>
as well as Joe Clark's "WCAG Samurai" effort: http://wcagsamurai.org/

[13:34:00.0000] <tantek>
a well as: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/tohellwithwcag2

[13:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: I think the claim would be that for the W3C, the official W3C accessibility experts (namely WAI) have the jurisdiction to judge the input of other experts

[13:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(note: I'm not necessarily endorsing this view, just trying to state it dispationately)

[13:37:00.0000] <tantek>
I have a feeling that if W3C process/experts succeed in sufficiently slowing down HTML5 progress, at some point what happened before will happen again, WHATWG will continue progress independently. WHATWG didn't need W3C to get started (other than providing motivation/incentive), and potentially doesn't need it to finish HTML5.

[13:39:00.0000] <tantek>
Or we'll get a fork of HTML5 - the WHATWG version (which will presumably be what the browser vendors in WHATWG implement), and a W3C version that reflects whatever W3C experts can pile into it.

[13:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would say the delay at this point is not so much the people making jurisdictional claims but the fact that nothing is ever resolved

[13:41:01.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - but "nothing is every resolved" is just another way of saying filibuster AFAICT.

[13:41:02.0000] <annevk2>
cssquirrel is pretty much lastweekinhtml5

[13:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
The WHATWG context doesn't spawn perpetual flamewars, because what Hixie decides goes unless you have new info, so people learn to move on

[13:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in the HTML WG, the working group in theory has the authority to make a binding decision, but has basically never exercised that authority

[13:42:02.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - I've found that documenting issues in a wiki, with data/research/opinions all captured can often reduce/end perpetual flamewars.

[13:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: I definitely think it's useful to have the reference material gathered

[13:43:01.0000] <tantek>
in reading public-html - there is too much oft repeated, that would be easily disposed of if arguments were explained (and linked to) via URL on a wiki page.

[13:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm just concerned that some people seem to really be making an argument that is jurisdictional rather than epistemological

[13:44:01.0000] <tantek>
since I don't have the personal time volunteer to do this for WHATWG/HTML5 (I'm already doing this for microformats.org), this leaves me little choice other than to summarily delete messages from those that do the most oft-repeating. I'm open to alternatives.

[13:45:00.0000] <tantek>
s/summarily/automatically

[13:45:01.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - even if it is a jurisdictional argument, capturing it will still allow the issues around such an argument to be documented (and hopefully resolved).

[13:46:00.0000] <tantek>
like appealing up to the W3C director to empower groups to do additional research beyond (and thus come to potentially different conclusions than) the top-down "expert" recommendations of other groups.

[13:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think the W3C Process formally requires any WG to take the judgment of any other WG as definitive, though Working Groups are expected to coordinate

[13:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, I'm not sure where John gets that idea from

[13:48:01.0000] <annevk2>
I understand he'd like it to work that way, but that's certainly not how things work

[13:48:02.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej, from my experience with W3C Process, before documents can exit last call, groups MUST make mutually acceptable resolutions to issues raised by the cross-group working groups like WAI, i18n, etc.

[13:49:00.0000] <tantek>
(having personally taking a few documents through/past last call as an editor of W3C working drafts)

[13:49:01.0000] <tantek>
s/taking/taken

[13:49:02.0000] <annevk2>
e.g. the i18n WG has at times requested Unicode Normalization for certain things and the XML WG has declined

[13:50:00.0000] <tantek>
annevk2 - do you have a link to the disposition of issues on a last call working draft from XML WG that documents that?

[13:51:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - not sure if you got the significance of http://wcagsamurai.org/ BTW

[13:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh noes!

[13:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It's a cabal!

[13:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there doesn't seem to be a formal requirement in the W3C Process to treat comments from WAI or the i18n group any differently than anyone else's to exit LC

[13:53:01.0000] <tantek>
accessibility expert Joe Clark deemed WCAG2 "nearly impossible ... to understand", and basically forked from WCAG1, and provided an errata'd WCAG1 to be used *instead of* WCAG2: http://wcagsamurai.org/errata/errata.html

[13:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
though informally the Director could apply a different standard to determining whether their issues are Formally Addressed

[13:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, I recall that WCAG Samurai is a divergent effort

[13:54:01.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - I can't link to a formal requirement, but I do know from experience that in practice, the Director is expected to apply a different (more cautious?) standard to issues raised by WAI, i18n, etc.

[13:54:02.0000] <annevk2>
tantek, they did eventually agree it seems: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xml-core-wg/2009May/0023.html

[13:55:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - the point is, WCAG2 is not without much criticism itself, to the point of causing a rift/split among experts that produced an alternative document.

[13:55:01.0000] <annevk2>
tantek, (the i18n WG agreed with a "lesser" solution)

[13:55:02.0000] <tantek>
annevk2 - that's usually what happens in these cases - some kind of compromise. a "lesser" solution, or dropped features (features that can't be agreed upon for example).

[13:56:00.0000] <tantek>
/me wonders if any / how much of WCAG 1 errata by WCAG Samurai has been incorporated (or even considered for incorporation) into HTML5 by Hixie http://wcagsamurai.org/errata/errata.html

[13:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the folks representing WAI don't seem very open to compromise, though perhaps with a more formal cross-WG request for comments things would be different

[13:59:00.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - in terms of process problems, I strongly recommend you read: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/tohellwithwcag2#WCAG-documents:process

[14:16:00.0000] <annevk2>
i wonder if WAI made any statements in response to that article

[14:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
(I meant "pretty much like" above, not "pretty much", apparently the comparison made it to twitter...)

[14:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk2: Such is the burden of fame

[14:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
prolly also how a lot of bs comes into the world

[14:56:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The basis of news media, for one

[14:57:00.0000] <annevk2>
it's tempting to abuse the attention

[14:57:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's what lastweek is for

[14:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you're gonna read the logs in near-realtime, why not just join the channel?

[14:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The whatwg elite is uniform in geographical origin? That's new to me

[15:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I would call it refreshingly diverse considering how many countries are represented

[15:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
where's that from?

[15:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>

[15:02:01.0000] <annevk2>
maybe she means not American?

[15:03:00.0000] <takkaria>
obviously, people who work for browser vendors and standards orgs are in a terrible situation if they want to write standards about browsers

[15:03:01.0000] <takkaria>
we should get some plumbers and some members of royal families in to make sure their viewpoints are heard too

[15:03:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Joe the Spec Writer

[15:03:03.0000] <annevk2>
wow, what a bs comment

[15:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't othermaciej American?

[15:05:00.0000] <annevk2>
no

[15:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
by current location, yes

[15:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
by background, no

[15:05:03.0000] <Dashiva>
We're in trouble then. Quick, get us an American alibi.

[15:06:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, let's get an Australian in too because they're about as far away from civilisation as you can get

[15:06:01.0000] <takkaria>
oh, wait

[15:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm also not "20-something", I grew up in poverty, and while I wouldn't call myself "disabled", I'm currently unable to use a mouse for extended periods

[15:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but hey, why let facts get in the way when you're stereotyping

[15:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://twitter.com/johnfoliot/statuses/3111346948 -- not unexpected

[15:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I thought we had an Australian, but now I can't think of any

[15:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk2: So he's finally admitting it was a game. Fun.

[15:11:01.0000] <takkaria>
Lachy is from Oz I think

[15:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy is from Oz

[15:11:03.0000] <annevk2>
yup

[15:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
and chaals!

[15:12:01.0000] <takkaria>
chaals isn't part of the cabal though

[15:12:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think he counts as part of the whatwg elite!

[15:12:03.0000] <annevk2>
he's my manager though

[15:12:04.0000] <Dashiva>
sssh

[15:12:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Don't tell them

[15:12:06.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, anne is not allowed to have an opinion without checking it with chaals first

[15:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder what sam would say about that tweet

[15:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Discussing specifics and then generalising seems like a sensible approach, compared to just discussing generalities

[15:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
but the specifics are biased and ignore expertise

[15:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I notice cssquirrel joined the ranks of people who discovered Hixie's bible

[15:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
the last part of that handling-people document is especially apt given all the process nonsense recently

[15:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think they get the irony

[15:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
few people who quote that document do

[16:25:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh mattur is awesome

[16:25:01.0000] <annevk2>
http://www.alistapart.com/comments/tohellwithwcag2/#10

[16:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
... is that authentic?


2009-08-04
[17:34:00.0000] <hober>
hahahahaha.

[18:20:00.0000] <Lachy_>
from the article: "The whole thing is supposed to be of help to deaf-blind people, who were never surveyed for their preferences, an action I recommended to WAI at a face-to-face meeting in 2003. Nor was any user testing carried out. (That’s all I can tell from published evidence, anyway. I sent e-mail inquiries to deaf-blind organizations in several countries asking if they’d been surveyed or had any opinions, with no response.)"

[18:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
that certainly helps to put the whole issue in perspectice, if they have a history of doing no research

[18:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
*perspective

[19:54:00.0000] <hober>
indeed.

[19:54:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The poll appears

[20:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Shelley's links are interesting, considering summary has been rejected DH5 (maybe even DH6) over and over and over...

[20:48:00.0000] <karlcow>
Dashiva: You meant "The poll dancing appears."

[20:58:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Also interesting that Roy thinks summary will be required by government when existing government advice actually discourages it...

[20:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
that government advice was cited by the wai as an example of why we had to keep summary=""

[20:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'd never seen it before then

[20:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think the wai may have assumed i don't read links they sent me

[20:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
especially long documents like that

[20:59:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe someone should link it to Roy too, then

[21:34:00.0000] <karlcow>
Dashiva: Do you have a list of where it is discouraged? and where it is encouraged? (government wise)

[21:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
karlcow: The one mentioned earlier is at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#(i) -- scroll one paragraph up

[21:42:00.0000] <karlcow>
http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=137

[21:43:00.0000] <karlcow>
recommends http://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data.php

[21:43:01.0000] <karlcow>
which says http://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data.php#summaries

[21:43:02.0000] <karlcow>
so UK seems to say follow wcag 

[21:44:00.0000] <karlcow>
from http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=188

[21:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a shame, that summary there would be useful for us poor normal folks too

[21:44:02.0000] <karlcow>
troll

[21:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hah

[21:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's one of the points that's been made so many times. Summaries often contain non-structural information that's useful to all users, not just disabled ones

[21:48:00.0000] <karlcow>
French Gov recommends WCAG 2.0 un WCAG 1.0 http://www.references.modernisation.gouv.fr/rgaa-accessibilite

[21:48:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
everyone says to follow wcag

[21:48:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
wcag is wrong

[21:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's easy to think that way if you're stuck in handicap parking analogies, I suppose. There you have to steal spaces from normal users.

[21:50:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But information can be made available for everyone, so let's not be mean.

[21:50:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And now, for my next trick, I will not be late for my flight. *poof* :)

[21:51:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
not only is it wrong, but the people who wrote it are unwilling to listen to criticism on how it is wrong

[21:52:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
this has been amply demonstrated for many years

[21:52:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
most recently (though by no means exclusively) by their refusal to respond to hixie's direct feedback

[21:53:00.0000] <karlcow>
Canada too  http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/clf2-nsi2/clfs-nnsi/clfs-nnsi-2-fra.asp

[21:53:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
where it is not wrong, it is merely inadequate

[21:53:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
(c.f. their techniques document on using the image @alt attribute)

[21:53:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
(which cites a grand total of 2 examples, both trivial)

[21:54:00.0000] <karlcow>
mpilgrim: I was just trying to see if Dashiva's assertion was true or not "[23:01]  <Dashiva> Also interesting that Roy thinks summary will be required by government when existing government advice actually discourages it..."

[21:54:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
major changes were made from wcag 1

[21:54:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
at the behest of major stakeholders like ibm

[21:54:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
e.g. pages requiring javascript are now a-ok

[21:55:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
(technically the priority level was dropped from 1 to 2 or some such nonsense. i forget how they phrased it.)

[21:55:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
it was EXTREMELY IMPORTANT for ibm that wcag 2 change this requirement

[21:55:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
since they have major "web" products like lotus workplace which are entirely javascript

[21:55:03.0000] <karlcow>
:) a big co influencing a spec… hmmm how surprising… that would be really the first time… never seen that in html 5. <sacarsm/>

[21:56:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
(i put "web" in scare quotes since there's nothing "webby" about them except that they happen to run in some browsers)

[21:56:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
my point is, that's the kind of "feedback" that went into wcag 2

[21:56:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
not anything lofty like john (and now sam (and now roy)) seem to assume

[21:56:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
research?

[21:56:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
user testing?

[21:56:05.0000] <mpilgrim>
seriously?

[21:56:06.0000] <mpilgrim>
don't make me laugh

[21:57:00.0000] <karlcow>
making you laugh… now, that would be vulgar :) I beg not.

[21:57:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
i guarantee you there was ZERO discussion of the summary attribute

[21:57:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
it was just a given

[21:57:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
somebody had a bad idea in like 1997 or 1998

[21:57:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
to add a summary attribute to tables

[21:58:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
they got it into the spec, in a wave of "let's make html more accessible" guilt

[21:58:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
from there, it got laundered through WAI and WCAG

[21:58:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
and now it's a highly polished turd being offered up and the be-all and end-all of accessibility techniques

[21:58:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
and no one is allowed to question it because it came from "experts"

[21:58:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
who *surely* must have researched it at least a little bit

[21:59:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
instead of just regurgitating the same bad advice for 10 years

[22:00:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
and people wonder why accessibility is such a clusterfuck

[22:01:00.0000] <karlcow>
and in clusterfuck, there is cluster. yeeehaaa

[22:01:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
ignore *!*@*.la-grange.net

[22:02:00.0000] <karlcow>
arf

[22:02:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
meanwhile, i'm shocked - SHOCKED! - to discover that roy fielding thinks that appeals to authority are a valid part of technical discourse

[22:03:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
truly shocked

[22:05:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
"sampling is irrelevant within the context of HTML that is required by law or regulation to be accessible to sight-impaired users."

[22:06:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
you can't argue with logic like that!

[22:16:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
heh

[22:16:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
re-reading "to hell with wcag 2" 3 years later is great fun

[22:17:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i remember this complaint when it was made: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2006AprJun/0184.html

[22:18:00.0000] <mpilgrim>

hmm a survey for accessibility http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/e-government/resources/eaccessibility/content.asp

[22:18:02.0000] <mpilgrim>

[22:19:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i met her (well, was briefly introduced) once at csun

[22:19:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
remarkable woman

[22:19:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
can't remember her own phone number

[22:20:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
(or so i was told)

[22:20:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
but contributes to complex standards for years on end

[22:22:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
of course, wcag 2 is still incomprehensible to people with cognitive disabilities

[22:23:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
and still says nothing useful about how to make your own content accessible to such an audience

[23:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone got any suggested UI for how to indicate that the changes have been saved once you click "save" on http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/edit-section.html?section=the-code-element ?

[23:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, nevermind

[23:34:00.0000] <aboodman>
Hixie: I can't be bothered to comment on the list, but I think that having a way to reach all browsing contexts in the same origin is probably also a security hole.

[23:34:01.0000] <aboodman>
even if we had background pages (which i like fwiw), we couldn't allow them to just reach all origins, there'd have to be a mechanism where pages opt inot being part of the set.

[23:35:00.0000] <aboodman>
sorry, I mean that we couldn't allow them to just reach all contexts in the same origin.

[23:48:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970917/struct/tables.html#h-12.1.1

[23:48:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
"The TABLE element contains all other elements that specify caption, rows, content, and formatting. Authors should use the title attribute to provide a summary of the table for non-visual user agents, covering its purpose and structure."

[23:48:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
"Note. A new attribute for the table summary is needed because the caption for visual users is generally insufficient. The title attribute is inappropriate because browsers render this as a "tool tip" which is limited to a single line of text. In some user agents, long lines are clipped."

[23:49:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
this is the sum total of the "research" done on the table summary attribute

[23:50:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
the summary attribute first appeared in the 1997-09-17 working draft of html 4

[23:50:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
it is not present in the previous draft from 1997-07-08 ( http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970708/ )

[23:51:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i can find no discussion of it in the www-html mailing list archives for 1997

[23:51:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
or 1996, for that matter

[23:52:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
it was invented because browsers clipped tooltips

[23:53:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
if browsers had supported multiline tooltips, we never would have had a summary attribute

[23:56:00.0000] <hober>
I'm completely shocked. Oh, wait.

[00:04:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
quote of the day (from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1997Jul/0066.html ): "Deprecating a tag doesn't make it obsolete right away, but clearly indicates that there is a 'better' (or at least, more consistent) way of doing things. Any deprecated elements in HTML4.0 won't be obsolete until HTML5.0, probably - and even then they may still be included."

[00:04:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
and the followup ( from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1997Jul/0068.html ): "Nobody ever said that deprecated elements will no longer be supported by browser vendors. For sure I've never heard anybody part of the HTML WG say something like this. Quite on the contrary!"

[00:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I'm preparing validator.nu for a system update and reboot. I'll deal with microsyntaxes when it reboots. html5.validator.nu will follow if everything goes well.

[00:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: there are a couple of other minor fixes I checked in since the last v.nu deployment. Just schema tweaks, and tested

[00:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is the Kronos stuff something anyone can GET without cookies or HTTP auth?

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is annoyed at a WG Note from the WAI being treated as normative over REC track process

[00:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's kind of surprising to know it is just a Note

[00:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: as far as I can tell, the XML Core WG didn't agree with i18n but added a well-formedness-neutral document conformance req that has no effect on processor behavior

[00:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
someone should make a scientific analysis of who actually practices the handling-people bible on public-html

[00:34:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, I mean that i18n agreed with the compromise

[00:34:01.0000] <annevk2>
meant*

[00:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: ok

[00:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: OK. I'll do a full redeployment after reboot

[00:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: while you're at it, quick question -

[00:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=631

[00:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the current datatype-checking code doesn't make sure that the value of the iframe name attribute is more than one character

[00:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'll wait until DNS updates before I start the updatie process)

[00:38:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: but the spec says, "A valid browsing context name is any string with at least one

[00:38:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
character that does not start with a U+005F LOW LINE character."

[00:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: looks like a genuine bug

[00:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, I'll make a patch for it

[00:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
in the datatype lib that is

[00:39:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, i'll take a look

[00:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
one other open one that came up recently was this:

IETF process is apparently not very shiny: http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=1346&cpage=1#comment-206483

[00:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: need to also report an error if an XML document that has a <meta charset='utf-8'/> is not actually encoded in UTF-8.

[00:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I think what's needed is an extension to the ValidationContext API (a ValidationContext2 interface on the same object) that allows datatypes acquire the Locator object

[00:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
then the Locator object should implement Locator2 which, IIRC, exposes the encoding

[00:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and then the parsers need to implement Locator2

[00:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and then datatyping that is sensitive to the encoding becomes possible

[00:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
there's an open Jing bug about this

[00:43:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[00:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Foo2 interfaces suck, but they are the most compatible way of doing this without breaking the use of the datatype lib with old versions of Jing and MSV

[00:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[00:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Foo2 feels COMtaminated

[00:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[00:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so for now, maybe one thing worth considering is to add an Info message saying, "<meta charset="utf-8"/> found in XML document. Make sure your document is actually encoded in UTF-8."

[00:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or a Warning

[00:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
can't add it in the assertions-checking code because of the problem of schematron only being able to emit errors

[00:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
not if you want to keep the Java assertions code in sync with the assertions.sch file

[00:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: hmm, maybe it's something I could add to the proposed warnings.sch

[00:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[00:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
can't do that either because I have no way of knowing at the point it the document is XML or text/html

[00:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
困った

[00:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I could simply implement what I said above on the V.nu branch of Jing and not wait for the trunk

[00:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, I looked at the build stuff in the jing trunk for generating the gcj binary

[00:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't know who came up with that stuff, but it seems way overcomplicated

[00:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: the Java build process for Jing trunk is complicated, too

[00:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, the gcj thing has the additional disadvantage of being broken

[00:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
woohoo! Locator2 is in JDK 5

[00:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, that's a bright spot, at least

[00:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: anyway, that gcj build uses hard-coded path names all over the place, and the paths it's pointing to seem to have moved since the time the build setup was written

[00:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the gcj/dist file

[00:56:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
It's just a shell script

[00:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't know if that's some kind of standard RPM thing or what, but it's just absolutely arcane

[00:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in contrast to the build setup for the debian trang package

[00:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which just uses a simple Makefile

[00:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so, anyway, what I'm getting at is, I'm going to try to make a non-broken gcj build for jing

[00:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if I can get it to work, I'll send a patch and if it looks OK, maybe you can talk with James and George about committing it to the trunk in place of that thing that's there now

[01:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
seems like a good plan

[01:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[01:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: http://bugzilla.validator.nu/attachment.cgi?id=114

[01:12:01.0000] <annevk2>
reading the June thread again on summary (the "PF Response") it strikes me that the PFWG never even emailed their comment to the HTML WG mailing list

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: looks good, although I'd do s/character/character long/ in the message

[01:15:01.0000] <annevk2>
and there's stuff like http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2009Jul/0055.html o_O

[01:16:00.0000] <annevk2>
was there ever an official reply to the points Hixie made?

[01:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I checked in the Locator2 stuff to the validator-nu branch of jing-trang and to the XML parser

[01:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I didn't add support to the HTML parser yet

[01:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: excellent

[01:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I checked in the browsing-context-name fix, with your wording change

[01:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: thanks

[01:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I just made isContextDependent on AbstractDatatype non-final, too

[01:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I guess I should check out the validator-nu branch instead of the trunk

[01:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so what's the effect of the isContextDependent change?

[01:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't actually know what isContextDependent is for

[01:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

Hixie: http://www.w3.org/mid/Pine.LNX.4.62.0908040517440.6420⊙hdc is your second reply to the same email.

[02:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: not sure if it's worth noting in the diff doc, but the restriction in HTML5 that the target attribute and iframe name attribute must be at least one character is a change vs HTML4

[02:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in HTML4, it's just CDATA, with no further restrictions stated in the spec

[02:25:00.0000] <annevk2>
we made a lot of those things more strict

[02:26:00.0000] <annevk2>
(and some more loose, e.g. id)

[02:27:00.0000] <annevk2>
e.g. accept-charset was CDATA in HTML4

[02:27:01.0000] <annevk2>
should I note it is now actually usefully checked?

[02:27:02.0000] <annevk2>
it seemed too much effort

[02:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Would anyone specify an empty name for any reason other than spec lawyering?

[02:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
one would think someone in California had figured out how to protect disk against minor earthquakes

[02:31:02.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Multiple redundant data centers :P

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: I have deduntant disks, but these artificial earthquakes affect both disks at the same time

[02:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
getting multilocation personal data centers is expensive

[02:32:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't recall the exact value, but it's something like at least 300 miles apart from each other

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I can't think of any home-grown solutions that both absorb shocks properly and don't have extra vibrations afterwards

https://twitter.com/roessler/statuses/3120872586

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
that quote never gets old, does it? :)

[02:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There was an ALA article about "unwebbable" content a while ago. One of the examples [in a comment] was poetry, which "In fact, this is text that deliberately defies conventions and structure."

[02:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Doesn't that imply adding syntax for poetry is by definition an impossible task?

[02:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could use unconventional, unstructured syntax

[02:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or you could say your syntax defies defiance of conventions and structure

[02:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But when you put it into a spec, you're a sellout

[02:42:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Nobody will want your syntax anymore

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is the original text of http://html5.digitalbazaar.com/a-new-way-forward/ archived somewhere?

[02:45:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: I have a copy on my HD

[02:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the "About the Author" bit is interesting

[02:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: it's probably not worth the effort to list them individually, but maybe adding a general statement that "a number of attributes values now how further restrictions; for example, some values that were allowed to be empty in HTML4 are not allowed to be empty in HTML5, ..."

[02:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder if manu will get financial support from companies that depend on the internet

[02:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. "Problem: No Way for Experts to Contribute in a Meaningful Way"

[02:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
interesting, the intent of accesskey in HTML5 was to take a single character

[02:54:01.0000] <annevk2>
it takes CDATA instead though to sucky DTDs

[02:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think that when you are making a serious document posting links to last week and (less so) the CSS Squirrel does not advance your credibility

[02:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/advance/help/

[02:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems to me that the problems manu mentions are either non-problems in my opinion or problems that already have solutions

[02:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: I'm confused by " the intent of accesskey in HTML5 was to take a single character"

[02:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/5/4/?

[02:58:01.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, 4

[02:59:00.0000] <annevk2>
and also s/though/due/

[02:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Without reading the documet in detail it seems to me to be a curious mix of process issues and specific technical issues that Manu feels strongly about

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>

I wonder if I should get into the captioning threads and explain how things at Mozilla turned out the way they did

[03:33:00.0000] <annevk42>
/me would like info on captioning

Hixie: request for stats about equals sign in unquoted attribute values noted

[04:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
last week gets a small plus for "pigs headednessess"

[04:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
+0.1, perhaps?

[04:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so I realize now that v.nu schema and datatype library have have both a "positive integer" and "non-negative integer" datatype

[04:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but the spec has only "non-negative integer"

[04:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does it have something like "non-zero non-negative integer"?

[04:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which is basically positive, for people who aren't sure what positive means)

[04:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, I remember that being wrangled out :)

[04:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: IIRC, the spec has places where a non-negative integer isn't allowed to be zzero

[04:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[04:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll look more closely

[04:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
IIRC, Hixie doesn't trust readers to understand what a positive integer is

[04:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[04:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"Roman era integer"

[04:23:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dashiva: Can you mark "Roman era" up with a time element so I know what you mean?

[04:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
We should call them "optimistic integers"

[04:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders|work: It's before 1592 (or whenever it was)

[04:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
Do what proper mathematicians do, and use ℕ instead of fuzzy words like "integer", so there's no ambiguity

[04:24:02.0000] <annevk2>
MikeSmith, DOM attributes can be limited to only positive non-zero numbers :)

[04:24:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: yeah, I saw that in the spec, but in this case was just referring to restrictions on content attributes.

[04:24:04.0000] <annevk2>
conformance on attributes seems to be phrased like "valid non-negative integer greater than zero"

[04:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[04:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Makes me wonder why we bother with the non-negative part

[04:25:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: use the comment box in the spec

[04:25:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Because you might have a negative integer greater than zero.

[04:25:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: in the v.nu schema, it's actually a different datatype. which makes sense

[04:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
-1 > 0

[04:26:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
A really-complex number.

[04:26:02.0000] <Dashiva>
zcorpan: The barrier of entry is too high (I'd have to load the spec)

[04:26:03.0000] <jgraham>
zero is an integer, just not a positive integer

[04:26:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Because complex numbers aren't enough)

[04:26:05.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: load the multipage version

[04:26:06.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: You getting t-shirts made?

[04:26:07.0000] <gsnedders|work>
zcorpan: That means starting a web browser.

[04:26:08.0000] <Dashiva>
zcorpan: It still requires me to switch to a browser

[04:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: use opera for irc, then you don't need to switch to another app

[04:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
How about... no

[04:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: (Actually they are enough for most purposes, which is why we still use complex numbers instead of anything fancier)

[04:28:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
zcorpan: But I'd still have to change tab!

[04:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: use curl

[04:28:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm using IRC

[04:28:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me notes he is somewhat amused that three of the people in this conversation are in one room

[04:28:05.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe we should have an irc bot for filing spec comments

[04:28:06.0000] <Dashiva>
One of you young'uns with this newfangled 'superhighway' stuff can submit for me

[04:28:07.0000] <Dashiva>
/me waves cane

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
MikeSmith, yeah, maybe file a bug?

[04:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I could paste the spec in a /msg to you

[04:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: I'm in one room too

[04:29:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: How do I request external resources in /msg?

[04:29:04.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: please write an irc bot for filing spec comments so that people don't have to load the spec to file comments

[04:29:05.0000] <annevk2>
MikeSmith, I'd agree that having all the _actual_ datatypes together makes more sense than just having a subset and another set defined in prose

[04:29:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dashiva: You pipe it, from curl.

[04:29:07.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: You don't, you just ask the person you're messaging to paste it to you

Besides, I don't like parsing javascript in my head unless I really have to

[04:30:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: you mean you like it when you really have to?

[04:30:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[04:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It makes me feel useful and accomplished

[04:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me reaches the thread about making unquoted attributes non-conforming

[04:31:02.0000] <Dashiva>
First year I interned at Opera we got a tiny meeting room for our office since there were no free offices

[04:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
One day we come in and find a<!--b&&c-->d on the whiteboard and some scribbled comments about "Does this work?"

[04:32:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Tarquin had decided to outsource :)

[04:33:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dashiva: Serves you right for interning at Opera!

[04:33:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oh, wait…

[04:33:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It's actually valid JS. Pretty useless, but valid!

[04:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah it is

[04:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
Also it won't be treated as a comment

[04:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
but <!--b&&c-->d will be

[04:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh wait, it will be treated as a

zcorpan: Magical IRC regexp matches from the end

[04:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
Magical irc regexp matches whatever makes the most sense

[04:38:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
No, Magical IRC regexp does exactly what you intend it to.

[04:38:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Not even magical IRC regexp is that powerful

[04:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Not quite otherwise s/// would work for anything

[04:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: see topic

[04:39:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That doesn't work, because it throws E_EMPTY

[04:39:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(for the first argument)

[04:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Not in any proper regexp implementation, i.e. Perl's

[04:48:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
You mean there are other proper regexp implementations?

[04:48:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Javascript's!

[04:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
Javascript does indeed allow empty regexps

[04:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(But not as a literal, since it's treated as a comment)

[04:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
It just matches all the distinct substrings with length zero, which seems like a perfectly natural and sensible thing to do

[04:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
(Unless you express it as /(?:)/ which is semantically an empty regexp if not syntactically)

[05:22:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Status: NEW)

[05:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: thinking about the microsyntaxes scraping.. the fact that getting those messages current depends stopping and restarting v.nu seems to really cry out for actual API to grab those in real time, and then some kind of simple DB instead

[05:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the technical limitations of wikis seem like a big deficiency in this case

[05:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe there's some wiki that's capable of storing content as names and values in a db

[05:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
while still providing a wiki interface

[05:32:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
what happened to Google Base?

[05:32:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe there are other things like that around now

[05:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or DabbleDB

[05:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
I believe that if someone writes the software we'll take it

[05:37:01.0000] <annevk2>
but note that having it on the wiki has advantages; e.g. spam control, accounts are sorted out, etc.

[05:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: I understand all that. But I'd really think there'd be an simple online DB with those same features and almost the same ease of use as a wiki, but with a real rest API for retrieving data from it.

[05:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess to me the lack of the network API is the real issue

[05:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess it would be possible to have some kind of thing that scrapes the wiki in real time and exposes an API

[05:41:01.0000] <annevk2>
that's an interesting idea

[05:41:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but that would really seem suboptimal to me at least

[05:41:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
though I guess in this case it's a very small amount of data and the scraping would be very quick

[05:41:04.0000] <annevk2>
maybe, but wiki's have solved a lot of problems

[05:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
no argument from me there

[05:42:01.0000] <annevk2>
accounts, accountability, easy editing, etc.

[05:42:02.0000] <annevk2>
cronjob that scrapes and exposes a friendly API sounds good to me

[05:42:03.0000] <annevk2>
(you'd cache the scraped data)

[05:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: yeah, I guess I'll write one unless somebody else beats me to it

[05:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Surely putting a wiki-like interface on a key-value document store would not be hard

[05:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
In fact something like the admin interface to couch-db is already quite close to what you want I think

[05:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess dabbleDB and Google Base may be too

[05:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the other great thing about wikis is having the change history available, and the record of accountability (as annevk2 pointed out)

[05:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so whatever other mechanism should provide that at least

[05:52:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
git! hg!

[05:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the tools will (en)s(l)ave use

[05:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
*us

[05:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
Surely you could make a user-editable database with two lines of Ruby/Rails code?

[05:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
(or Python/Django or whatever)

[05:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: Surely somebody else must have done that already for me so that I don't have to.

[05:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which two lines?

[05:56:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: import and print

[05:56:03.0000] <jgraham>
those are statements, not lines

[05:56:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, it's not just having the DB, it's having all the Wiki UI stuff on top of it

[05:56:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
change history, etc.

[05:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and Ogg Theora videos.

[05:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
Change history seems like the big one

[05:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: The ones in the tutorial screencasts where you make a user-editable database with two lines of code using the user-editable database scaffolding which conveniently happens to have been written already for precisely this purpose, I guess

[05:58:02.0000] <jgraham>
Because I guess most k-v stores are designed to be efficient rather than to keep records

[06:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I'd rather deal with rel registry before optimizing microsyntax stuff

[06:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is still waiting for DNS for validator.nu to update

[06:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should defer the system update until tomorrow when DNS must have updated

[06:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: you know, for me at least, it really is all about the API. I'd think whatever Wiki could easily have some kind of standard markup for indicating a string on the page that's a key, and whatever chunk of text is its associated value

[06:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and then the Wiki's own backend could expose an API for that

[06:04:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
We should use RDF for that.

[06:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, maybe I'll shut up for now

[06:04:02.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: The reason I was thinking about couchdb is that the API is really the main thing

[06:04:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
what's the backend on the whatwg wiki?

[06:04:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: OK

[06:04:05.0000] <jgraham>
The store just serves json

[06:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[06:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
The problem is I don't know how easy it is to add versioning to that

[06:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
for the rel registry, it could be a GETtable text/plain resource with one registered token on each line and LF line breaks

[06:05:03.0000] <jgraham>
(well I guess it is rather easy to do it manually by adding a version key to each document)

[06:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: what kind of versioning?

[06:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I was thinking of an append-only registry

[06:06:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: MikeSmith seems to want wiki-like history which imp[lies storing multiple versions (or diffs or something)

[06:12:00.0000] <virtuelv>

I wonder what happens if I say that everyone can update the twitter account from http://www.whatwg.org/#updater from @whatwg

[06:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
Guess it's better to wait for Hixie to be around since I think he's the only one with the login details

[06:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh well

[06:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I love how Kyle Weems complains about attacking people (in http://www.cssquirrel.com/2009/07/09/comic-update-manners-after-the-xhtmlacolypse/) and then goes on to publish a comic like http://www.cssquirrel.com/comic/?comic=30

[06:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: that doesn't really seem like a personal attack

[06:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: but I guess the vicious online comic is the equivalent of a nasty e-mail comment that ends with a smiley :)

[06:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I personally just wish that Kyle would into his comics put more depictions of real violence, with some nudity thrown in now and then

[06:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or even some sex. I think it was Einstein who said "there are few things in the world that are funnier than depictions of cartoon characters having sex."

[06:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
there were already references to "snogging"

[06:42:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
OK, where's the drugs and rock and roll?

[06:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
Couchdb already has revision tracking it seems

[06:44:01.0000] <Creap>
hi. a pure decorational image or illustration would not fit to be marked up within a figure, right?

[06:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
kyle gets points for the violence in that latest one, at least

[06:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: hmm, there no longer seems to be "percent" datatype referenced by the schema

[06:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me investigates

[06:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, I guess that's been gone for a long while

[06:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I can't remember what it was used for

[06:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me does Shift-v jjjd

[06:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Creap: yeah

[06:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: so something based on CouchDB would seem like a good way to go.

[06:49:01.0000] <Creap>
'yeah' as in.. figure is not for decorational images?

[06:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
we could build something to meet our own needs, and then productize it

[06:49:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Creap: right, not for decoration

[06:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
figure, in my estimation, is for something that you or somebody else might possibly want to reference by its title

[06:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
see Figure 1.2 at <url>

[06:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: time to turn a profit off the work on tools associated with html5

[06:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. now I'm no longer the only one allegedly having personal preferences against RDFa

[06:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Pointer?

[06:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: http://www.w3.org/mid/4A72916B.5020407⊙dc

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I think I read somewhere that CouchDB happily throws away old revisions when you're compacting the database, which doesn't sound good when you want a reliable version control system

[07:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Ah. Well I guess you would have to build a seperate version control layer then :(

[07:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or you could just use something totally different like a hg backend that stored json files assuming that querying wasn't a priority)

gsnedders|work: IMO, anyone with a name like "Mike" cannot be trusted

[08:08:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Nah, we need to pave the cowpaths and go for <plaintext>

[08:08:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
nate_: or at least not a funny joke

[08:08:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That's nice and simple to parse.

[08:08:06.0000] <miketaylr>
lol

[08:08:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
or at least not an intentionally funny joke

[08:09:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Everything from <plaintext> to EOF is just a single text node)

[08:09:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(It makes parsing simple.)

[08:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
it is kind of an unintentionally funny joke

[08:09:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(It was, of course, marked obsolete in the first ever draft spec for HTML, and still exists in HTML 5)

[08:09:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(In the parsing rules, at least)

[08:10:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I mean, sometimes I just get the urge, and just have to tweet about my cat.

[08:10:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
She's called BetterAstrophy.

[08:10:02.0000] <annevk2>
<plaintext> was the solution to media types before you could do Content-Type:text/plain

[08:10:03.0000] <annevk2>
in retrospect I think it would have been better

[08:17:00.0000] <beowulf>
i go on holiday for a month and come back to find even longer threads on @summary and twitter running amok

[08:17:01.0000] <beowulf>
is there no end to the depths you all will sink!

[08:18:00.0000] <nate_>
...no?

[08:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://twitter.com/WHATWG/status/3124785323 :-D

[08:18:02.0000] <nate_>
I dunno, it seems like a fun experiment

[08:18:03.0000] <nate_>
how deep *can* we sink??

[08:19:00.0000] <nate_>
woohoo!

[08:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders how many of the people abusing the status updater are libertarians

[08:22:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I was under the impression, from what I read on the internet, that everything wrong is the fault of the liberals.

[08:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Isn't there a difference between a liberal and a libertarian?

[08:24:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Yes, there is.

[08:24:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
What I read on the internet was it was the liberals fault, and that liberterians are what makes this country so great.

[08:25:00.0000] <beowulf>
i abused the twitter status, i do not feature on the liberal side of the political compass though

[08:25:01.0000] <beowulf>
i say abused, i think it's important that people buy viagra

[08:26:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Are we going to have to get "I abused @WHATWG" t-shirts

[08:26:01.0000] <miketaylr>
I'll take a size M

[08:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
beowulf, did you really tweet about viagra on @whatwg?

[08:28:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Someone did.

[08:28:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me glares

[08:28:03.0000] <miketaylr>
the twitter status is about to hit critical mass a la reply-all 'stop hitting reply-all' 

[08:29:00.0000] <svl>
The follower count is going into freefall

[08:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
does anyone know why there is a sudden increase in the spam levels on it?

[08:30:01.0000] <svl>
It'll have been posted on some message board somewhere.

[08:31:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: Because once people started spamming it it will have become self-evident it was open too

[08:31:01.0000] <beowulf>
Lachy: annevk2 mentioned on here that it's open to anyone, which appears in the logs

[08:32:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
beowulf: It's been mentioned many times before

[08:32:01.0000] <beowulf>
gsnedders|work: well then i've no idea why it took off today

[08:33:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I think the correct solution is that Hixie should be awake 24/7 to police it.

[08:33:01.0000] <beowulf>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090804#l-691

[08:33:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, the number of followers has dropped by a few hundred already

[08:33:03.0000] <Lachy>
a few minutes ago, it was over 1600. Now it's 1288

[08:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
I love the way that people think it was an oversight rather than a decision

[08:36:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
We probably should have made the barrier to entry a bit higher, because it was almost inevitable this would happen sometime

[08:37:00.0000] <alexmace>
#fail

[08:37:01.0000] <svl>
/me loves that the bandaid 'fix' actually works.

[08:38:00.0000] <jim_c>
gsnedders|work: What's the story with the Twitter account?

[08:38:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
svl: The "ok stop it"?

[08:38:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me wonders why people assume he knows

[08:39:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jim_c: A while ago there was a decision made to make the Twitter account open, knowing it could potentially be used for spam, but thinking being open would all-in-all be more useful

[08:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
svl, what's the bandaid fix?

[08:39:02.0000] <jim_c>
gsnedders|work: I see. That assumes that people who use the internet act like adults. Unfortunately, that's not how it is.

[08:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how long Hixie will keep believing that anonymous free-for-all editing is a good idea

[08:39:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I don't think anyone expected to get a large number of spam tweets all at once, just once or twice occasionally

[08:40:00.0000] <svl>
Ah, nothing. I missed the difference between a link to #updater and triggering that manually.

[08:40:01.0000] <svl>
Thought with six minutes of silence that a change had been made to the homepage to make this just a tiny bit harder

[08:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
my tweet didn't get posted :-(

[08:41:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: Did you check the checkbox? :P

[08:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see a checkbox

[08:41:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
There's a checkbox that says "I have something useful to say" you have to check

[08:42:00.0000] <alexmace>
gsnedders|work: Not anymore there isn't

[08:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
If I disable styles, it shows up

[08:43:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Reloading there still is

[08:43:01.0000] <alexmace>
Seems naive at best to have an open form that updates a twitter account

[08:43:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oh, only from http://www.whatwg.org/#updater

[08:43:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
So it's only required if you have JS disabled

[08:44:00.0000] <gavin_>
alexmace: obscurity was a suitable countermeasure, until now

[08:45:00.0000] <alexmace>
gavin_: That isn't a countermeasure

[08:45:01.0000] <gavin_>
there was no problem in practice

[08:45:02.0000] <beowulf>
no kittens were harmed

[08:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
might be useful to have some kind of moderation on the system

[08:46:01.0000] <alexmace>
Hey, stay in denial if you lie

[08:46:02.0000] <alexmace>
like

[08:46:03.0000] <gavin_>
I'm not in denial...

[08:46:04.0000] <gavin_>
there is a problem now, sure

[08:46:05.0000] <jgraham>
/me decides not to point out that at some level obscurity is the root of all security

[08:46:06.0000] <Philip`>
alexmace: It's only naive if you consider a short-lived period of spam on a Twitter account to be a real problem

[08:46:07.0000] <alexmace>
no exposure of a problem != no problem

[08:46:08.0000] <gavin_>
your definition of problem is strange

[08:46:09.0000] <gsnedders|work>
alexmace: Being _open_ was a feature. It wasn't a problem.

[08:47:00.0000] <alexmace>
Being open isn't a problem

[08:47:01.0000] <gavin_>
is it a problem that a piano might fall on my head today?

[08:47:02.0000] <alexmace>
being careless is

[08:47:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
OK, so it got abused one or twice a month… That was considered acceptable for being open.

[08:47:04.0000] <alexmace>
Anyway, it's disabled somewhere. Even with the box checked it isn't updating anymore

[08:48:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
alexmace: It's not careless. I think everyone around when it was decided for it to be open knew the risk.

[08:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
Does Twitter have some limit on post frequency/quantity?

[08:48:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Through the API yes.

[08:48:03.0000] <gavin_>
Philip`: I don't think you can reasonably argue that it isn't a problem :)

[08:48:04.0000] <gavin_>
it may not be a problem worth "fixing"...

[08:49:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
alexmace: How do you propose to keep it open while making it impossible to spam?

[08:51:00.0000] <alexmace>
I think a better question would be "what is the purpose of the account?" and go from there rather than trying to band aid it

[08:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
gavin_: Well, it's a problem whose sole effect is to reduce the value of the WHATWG Twitter feed, which seems like a pretty limited problem to me :-)

[08:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't seem like a huge problem.  After only an hours worth of spam, it seems to have died down now. Seems people get over their stupidity quicker than I thought.

[08:51:03.0000] <Philip`>
...although I suppose it also has the effect of irritating a thousand people

[08:51:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
alexmace: The purpose of the account is provide updates relating to anything relating to HTML 5.

[08:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Why does it need to be open? (I've never noticed anyone use it for serious purposes, other than the automatic commit notifications)

[08:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
anyone know how many followers it had before the spam started?

[08:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if we just set a record for the most unsubscribed in the shortest amount of time

[08:52:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: There's been things like HTML 5 getting landed in mozilla-central, HTML 5 outliner, and other things posted to it. I don't watch it that closely.

[08:53:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: But yeah, it is mainly commits

[08:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Try looking in search engine caches

[09:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think Hixie should publish the web server password on the WHATWG front page, so anyone can go in and fix the Twitter script even while he's asleep

[09:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
from google cache 8 hours ago, 1,315 followers

[09:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
so we only lost about 50

[09:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
But you said a few minutes ago "a few minutes ago, it was over 1600"

[09:02:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lies, damned lies and statistics!

[09:02:02.0000] <beowulf>
http://twittercounter.com/whatwg/all

[09:04:00.0000] <beowulf>
i hit manual update on that, which changed the results to show a loss of 61

[09:07:00.0000] <alexmace>
gsnedders|work: I'd look at something like hashtags instead

[09:07:01.0000] <alexmace>
At least then you can see the accounts that are posting the info rather than being completely anonymous as it is now

[09:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, It looks like I remembered wrongly. That must have been the number of tweets, not the number of followers

[09:24:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
what the hell is going on with twitter?

[09:24:01.0000] <leeky>
Afternoon! Anyone here able to remove that rather silly "post to @whatwg on Twitter" form on your home page?

[09:27:00.0000] <krijn>
/me thinks we need the gatekeeper for that :)

[09:28:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Can I set up a bot here that says "what the hell is going on with twitter" every minute or so?

[09:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
That would achieve nothing

[09:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also, it seems kind of obvious what's going on with Twitter

[09:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
It seems like Twitter is more or less working like normal

[09:29:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh no, UTF-32 is now the only acceptable encoding

[09:29:04.0000] <MadAtWork2>
I was being facetious, and I don't really know what was going on.

[09:30:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me sighs

[09:30:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Teenagers…

[09:31:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oh well, at least there's a Monty Python reference

[09:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
we just need to increase the signal to noise ratio on twitter.  For every spam tweet someone posts, we should immediately post 2 more useful tweets

[09:32:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
I mean, beside getting a lot of stupid spam from people I don't care about, what's the point of that?

[09:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: Can they be the same useful tweet?

[09:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
no

[09:34:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dashiva: Suffix a number, then they aren't the same

[09:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
"Trapped in twitter factory, send help!"

[09:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
:-D

[09:35:02.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Seriously, what's the point of opening access to that account?

[09:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
MadAtWork2, as a matter of policy, everything in the whatwg has open access

[09:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
just like the blog, wiki and mailing list

[09:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
MadAtWork2: The point was to allow anyone to twitter on the subject of HTML 5. For a long while that has worked acceptably well. Right now people are not so interested in HTML5

[09:37:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Hmm.

[09:37:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Can't we have 2 resources? an open one and an official announcement one?

[09:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
it might be worth closing public access until a more moderated system can be developed

[09:37:03.0000] <MadAtWork2>
aka one I can safely ignore and one I can follow?

[09:37:04.0000] <alexmace>
Seems some have confused open access with anonymous access

[09:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe we should tie it to the blog somehow. That seems to work. Spammers regularly try to post rubbish articles, but a few of us sensible people have moderator access

[09:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not like we have much more control on the IRC channel :)

[09:39:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: Or spec annotation

[09:39:02.0000] <jgraham>
alexmace: It is far from clear that the access is anonymous

[09:39:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah

[09:39:04.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie has all the logs

[09:39:05.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, Hixie only gets IP addresses, and that doesn't really help for a distributed attack like this appears tob e

[09:39:06.0000] <Lachy>
*to be

[09:40:00.0000] <alexmace>
Good luck matching IP addresses to people then

[09:40:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Mostly because I can use an http proxy with relative ease...

[09:40:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Sure but it's hardly anonymous. 

[09:40:03.0000] <alexmace>
It is effectively anonymous

[09:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
Only if people take additional steps to protect their anonmnymity. It's no more or less anonymous than wikipedia for example

[09:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
And the lack of anomnimity there has had interesting ramifications in the past

[09:42:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
It's not about that, it's about what gets on the "front page".

[09:42:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Wikipedia has an article and a history page, but the history page is hardly what people checks first.

[09:42:02.0000] <alexmace>
Continue going on about other issues if you like

[09:42:03.0000] <MadAtWork2>
The noise is kept at bay.

[09:42:04.0000] <Samer>
lol hi

[09:42:05.0000] <Samer>
are we talking about the twitter issue

[09:42:06.0000] <alexmace>
Just ignore the problem

[09:42:07.0000] <Samer>
xD

[09:42:08.0000] <alexmace>
Then it'll go away

[09:42:09.0000] <Samer>
i'm reading the tweets

[09:42:10.0000] <Samer>
they're hillarious

[09:42:11.0000] <MadAtWork2>
In this case the amount of sensible information that gets through is nil.

[09:43:00.0000] <alexmace>
Yup

[09:43:01.0000] <alexmace>
MadAtWork2: It's "open" though

[09:43:02.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Tweeting AS WHATWG and tweeting TO WHATWG are two different things.

[09:43:03.0000] <takkaria>
ok, the experiment has failed, it's not that exciting really

[09:43:04.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, you try finding out who owns a given IP address! In most countries, it will probalby take a good reason and a court order (or be a member of the RIAA lobby group)

[09:44:00.0000] <Samer>
maybe if you leave it for long enough it'll die

[09:44:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
If you want something open, make a page that collects posts to @WHATWG from different accounts.

[09:44:02.0000] <Samer>
we like things complicated

[09:44:03.0000] <Lachy>
at most, all we can do is block an IP address from posting, but that wouldn't do much for the one-time hit and run attacks like this

[09:44:04.0000] <Samer>
:)

[09:44:05.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Which is a good thing but hardly the same as being anonymous

[09:44:06.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Or even go as far as making a new twitter account reposting everything sent to @WHATWG

[09:45:00.0000] <Samer>
have you tried changing the twitter password

[09:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
and more general information is trivial e.g. "that person posting from the white house made a racist comment"

[09:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, then there's also people who go thorugh anonymising VPNs, or are using public terminals

[09:45:03.0000] <MadAtWork2>
jgraham: which translates to "Obama hates america" for Fox News.

[09:45:04.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Someone apparently DOES benefit.

[09:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
MadAtWork2: ?

[09:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think you are agreeing with me

[09:46:02.0000] <Samer>
hhow did this start btw

[09:46:03.0000] <MadAtWork2>
In a way.

[09:46:04.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Speaking of html5 tho.

[09:46:05.0000] <MadAtWork2>
We have header and footer, what is the middle thing?

[09:46:06.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Article? Div?

[09:46:07.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Nothing?

[09:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
MadAtWork2: That's an oversimplification but <section> or <article> depending on what you mean

[09:48:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
jgraham: I'm starting a new webapp, and I'm creating a login page, I have a header I have a footer, and I have a login box, I'm trying to see what would uncle html5 suggest to use in this case.

[09:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I know that you can take some measures to cover your tracks, but in practice many people don't bother and find that actions that they took believing that they would be free of consequences are not actually as anonymous and as free of consequences as they had assumed

[09:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
MadAtWork2: Does it have a header? Probably <section> if it does

[09:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
Otherwise maybe <div>. Depends why you want it

[09:50:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
The login box has a header but it's a legend for a fieldset.

[09:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, O

[09:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
oops

[09:50:03.0000] <MadAtWork2>
so I have page header fieldset with login stuff and page footer.

[09:50:04.0000] <MadAtWork2>
I am trying to understand if I am to wrap the fieldset around a div, a section or what.

[09:51:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
I'm starving for real world examples of html5. :/

[09:51:01.0000] <Samer>
i think it stopped

[09:51:02.0000] <jgraham>
MadAtWork2: It sounds like it might be <section> and maybe you could move the fieldset label to a <h1> or so

[09:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not disputing the fact that most people don't have total anonynimity on the net in all cases, but for all practical purposes in the case of the whatwg status updater, they do, because we have absolutely no way of finding out who's who just from an IP address

[09:52:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
jgraham: Hm, you may be right. 

[09:53:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Still I dream of the day when these questions will be easily answered.

[09:53:01.0000] <alexmace>
Samer: Probably run out of API requests for the hour

[09:53:02.0000] <Samer>
oh lol

[09:53:03.0000] <Samer>
why is the update box on the front page?

[09:54:00.0000] <alexmace>
Which obviously makes it entirely useless for posting useful information

[09:54:01.0000] <alexmace>
"openness"

[09:54:02.0000] <Samer>
i mean instead of logging to whatwg.org just go to twitter.com to update

[09:54:03.0000] <alexmace>
Any discussion of finding people by IP address is just fiddling while Rome burns

[09:55:00.0000] <Samer>
at least people aren't going crazy on the wiki :)

[09:56:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Again, a bot that reposts what is posted to @WHATWG would solve everything.

[09:56:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Open and accountable.

[09:56:02.0000] <MadAtWork2>
It also may or may not improve your manliness.

[09:57:00.0000] <svl>
ooh, we just _gained_ a follower. Saw it go from 1200 to 1201

[09:58:00.0000] <alexmace>
MadAtWork2: Sounds like a good solution to me though

[09:58:01.0000] <alexmace>
Not that anyone seems interested

[09:58:02.0000] <MadAtWork2>
I should tweet it.

[09:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
It's not like anyone can actually do anything

[10:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: We could try DOSing the WHATWG server

[10:05:01.0000] <alexmace>
So who can do something about it?

[10:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
alexmace: Hixie

[10:06:01.0000] <alexmace>
and that's it?

[10:07:00.0000] <gavin_>
this is what happens when your server administration isn't Open!

[10:08:00.0000] <annevk2>
it was a nice experiment while it lasted

[10:08:01.0000] <annevk2>
the blog got abused way more quickly

[10:10:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
haha

[10:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk2: It might still work if you just made it possible for a few people to shut the account down if it was being abused at a given time

[10:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
Otherwise you would need to have a moderation system

[10:10:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Like, say, anyone on IRC

[10:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
jgraham, if we give a few people login details we can simply delete tweets

[10:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
Make a bot that posts each prospective Tweet into IRC, and if nobody says "twitbot: shut up" within a minute then it gets posted to Twitter

[10:12:02.0000] <annevk2>
that'd work too

[10:12:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: "Shut up, you twit"

[10:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Got to be careful not to make a mistake like http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8176194.stm when talking about Twitter

[10:15:00.0000] <alexmace>
Posting it to IRC wouldn't work

[10:15:01.0000] <alexmace>
How would the bot know which you were talking about

[10:15:02.0000] <alexmace>
if they're coming in so quickly that the API usage is being used up every hour you'd just get a torrent coming in 

[10:15:03.0000] <gavin_>
hmm, does the bbc typically publish "swear words"?

[10:16:00.0000] <gavin_>
would they print "fuck"?

[10:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
alexmace: It would know you're talking about anything sent in the past minute

[10:16:02.0000] <alexmace>
Philip`: whatever, it's a poor solution

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
gavin_: Judging by that article, they only print it in direct quotes

[10:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
gavin_: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7481715.stm

[10:17:02.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Philip`: I'm going to call humbug on that.

[10:18:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Seriously.

[10:19:00.0000] <gavin_>
Philip`: interesting

[10:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
gavin_: Not really relevant but a search points at section 2 of http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/delivery/edguidance.shtml

[10:20:01.0000] <gavin_>
interesting set of examples

[10:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, section 3 is more fun

[10:21:01.0000] <gavin_>
I would have thought "Jesus fucking Christ" is redundant, given the inclusion of "fuck"

[10:21:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
Are you guys aware that @WHATWG is being spammed?

[10:21:03.0000] <alexmace>
\o/

[10:21:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hmm... guessing yes

[10:22:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Let me know when you fix it, so I can re-follow

[10:26:00.0000] <alexmace>
GPHemsley: Only one man can fix it

[10:26:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
Oh, Hixie's MIA?

[10:27:00.0000] <alexmace>
Mmm, I love the smell of a dichotomy just before home time

[10:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
GPHemsley, just asleep

[10:37:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
annevk2: Well, who knows where he might be while he's sleeping. ;)

[10:38:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
(In dream world, to clarify.)

[10:47:00.0000] <annevk2>
nice, DanC calls out bogus WAI tactics

[10:47:01.0000] <annevk2>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2009Aug/0006.html

[10:47:02.0000] <annevk2>
would make a good addition to markp's post

[11:49:00.0000] <webben>
/me wishes the discussion of "WCAG" on public-html would clearly (and properly) distinguish between W3C Recommendations and WAI Notes.

[11:59:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe say so?

[12:05:00.0000] <webben>
annevk2: I've just mentioned it to Sam on the other channel though I suspect he may be afk.

[12:10:00.0000] <virtuelv>
someone mind removing that open whatwg-poster?

[12:10:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm not particularily fond of having my twitter frontpage filled with expletives

[12:10:02.0000] <virtuelv>
this is the internet. You _can't_ have nice things

[12:10:03.0000] <virtuelv>
right now, it's spewing racist expletives, evn

[12:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: ↑↑↑↑

[12:12:00.0000] <hober>
:(

[12:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
worked fine for a couple of years

[12:13:01.0000] <annevk2>
:/

[12:16:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk2: it worked, because no-one noticed

[12:16:01.0000] <virtuelv>
in other words, it worked by pure chance

[12:17:00.0000] <virtuelv>
either way, I'm unfollowing it for now

[12:18:00.0000] <factoryjoe>
wow, there's some bad stuff on twitter.com/whatwg

[12:18:01.0000] <virtuelv>
factoryjoe: noted already

[12:18:02.0000] <gavin_>
maybe that should be put in the topic

[12:18:03.0000] <annevk2>
that'd be logical

[12:18:04.0000] <factoryjoe>
sorry, thought it might be redundant to point that out

[12:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
no worries

[12:19:01.0000] <factoryjoe>
anonymity + internet = greater fuckwad

[12:19:02.0000] <factoryjoe>
is that an experiment?

[12:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
we had this on for a couple of years

[12:20:01.0000] <factoryjoe>
ah, i see it's been going on for awhile. 

[12:20:02.0000] <factoryjoe>
the twitter thing?

[12:20:03.0000] <annevk2>
YEAH

[12:20:04.0000] <annevk2>
oops

[12:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
has been on the frontpage pretty much since we got a twitter account

[12:22:00.0000] <factoryjoe>
oh

[12:22:01.0000] <factoryjoe>
is there a desire to ... uh ... stop it from happening?

[12:22:02.0000] <factoryjoe>
or is the idea just to let it play out?

[12:23:00.0000] <virtuelv>
my bet is that twitter would suspend the account long before it plays out

[12:23:01.0000] <annevk2>
currently only Hixie can fix it

[12:23:02.0000] <factoryjoe>
true

[12:23:03.0000] <factoryjoe>
good point

[12:23:04.0000] <virtuelv>
doesn't even he have a phone these days?

[12:23:05.0000] <factoryjoe>
it's probably against the TOS to let anyone post to your account

[12:24:00.0000] <ezyang>
Hm. Does anyone have access to the src code of the script? 

[12:24:01.0000] <ezyang>
I'd imagine that has the credentials. 

[12:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
sigh, i tried putting up a message on the form saying that people should be nice, but that didn't work

[12:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess we'll have to password-protect it

[12:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's so sad

[12:27:01.0000] <annevk2>
can we easily delete all the crap?

[12:27:02.0000] <factoryjoe>
Hixie: the content is pretty offensive... and it'll be associated with the account out of context

[12:27:03.0000] <factoryjoe>
it is too bad

[12:27:04.0000] <factoryjoe>
how long was it there w/o abuse?

[12:27:05.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: I see you never passed the "Greater Internet Fuckwad theory" exam?

[12:28:00.0000] <virtuelv>
factoryjoe: two years?

[12:28:01.0000] <factoryjoe>
amazing

[12:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
factoryjoe: years at least

[12:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
several people knew the old password, fwiw, but i guess y'all forgot what it was :-)

[12:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway i changed the password

[12:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
so it's no longer "WHATWG" which is what it used to be :-P

[12:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
since i figure if people are going to abuse the form, eventually one will try to guess the password too

[12:31:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: you might also want to delete the tweets?

[12:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah yeah, i'll get to it

[12:32:00.0000] <smedero>
fyi, there's no easy way on twitter to mass delete tweets from my memory but somewhat had written a greasemonkey script to do it.

[12:32:01.0000] <smedero>
s/somewhat/someone/

[12:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
aaah

[12:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
don't delete tweets that aren't offensive

[12:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: your /msgs to me are coming up blank -- did you get my message to you?

[12:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: No, try resending. Seems to be a client problem that may have sorted itself out

[12:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[12:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
mpilgrim: i'm in slice btw

[12:40:00.0000] <factoryjoe>
also, hixie, you may want to tweet once more that "the experiment is over. we'll be cleaning up this account momentarily."

[12:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think additional tweets are going to make anyone particularly happier

[12:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
people will just realise things are better when they don't get spammed

[12:41:02.0000] <miketaylr>
agreed.

[12:42:00.0000] <factoryjoe>
well, ok. some acknowledge might help people feel better that no more spam is forthcoming

[12:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i expect that no more spam being forthcoming will make people feel better than spam telling them that no more spam is forthcoming

[12:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's like getting confirmation messages from spamming lists when you unsubscribe -- just irritates more

[12:44:00.0000] <gavin_>
if the confirmation is credible, it actually helps, I think

[12:44:01.0000] <factoryjoe>
i'm with gavin_, but it's up to you

[12:44:02.0000] <gavin_>
(rarely the case with email spam, granted - think twitterspam is different))

[12:44:03.0000] <factoryjoe>
FWIW, i unfollowed

[12:45:00.0000] <miketaylr>
a compromise might be to state something in the profile bio..."now, with 100% less spam!"

[12:45:01.0000] <factoryjoe>
if you admit the issue and reassure people, they might come back, but that might not be important to you

[12:45:02.0000] <factoryjoe>
anywho

[12:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
i agree that we should say something

[12:46:01.0000] <annevk2>
anyone a proposal?

[12:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
"Apologies. Letting everyone update @WHATWG from whatwg.org worked for years, but after today we have taken it offline."

[12:48:01.0000] <annevk2>
?

[12:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
let's not say anything for now

[12:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
if it's still not abused in a few hours we'll post something

[12:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: I have heard that the kind of structural information that blind users like would also be helpful to people with some cognitive disabilities although I don't know if that is really true

[12:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I don't personally know the details of what is useful to different handicap groups - I would expect there is a lot of overlap, perhaps not 100%

[12:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Indeed. I was just making the point that your example of information that may not be needed by sighted users may, in fact, be needed by some sighted users

[12:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I think I qualified it enough that I feel ok with the way I stated it

[12:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"Describing the structure of the table, if it is easy to grasp visually, may not be useful to everyone."

[12:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Fair enough. It wasn't really a critisism

[12:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
If it's not easy to grasp visually, then it's quite likely that cognitively disabled users (or indeed everyone) could use the info

[12:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and even after that qualification, I said "may"

[12:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
cause it's probably a judgment call at that point

[12:58:02.0000] <jgraham>
I am just somewhat wary of the disabled===blind trap

[12:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
In any case it seems like a rather sensible proposal but not too far from what is in the spec today

[13:14:00.0000] <jwalden>
annevk42: fyi, I have some feedback on Opera's implementation of the CSS 3 background-size property in this post: https://developer.mozilla.org/web-tech/2009/08/04/background-images-no-longer-restricted-to-original-size-explore-the-space-with-background-size/

[13:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder what Shelley's objection is to othermaciej's compromise

[13:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
she elaborated at some more length in a later message

[13:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, haven't received that yet

[13:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
jwalden: Interesting

[13:31:00.0000] <jwalden>
I also have, if I remember right, perhaps forty or fifty reftests of background-size and related properties that I should eventually bundle up somehow and post on www-style

[13:33:00.0000] <jwalden>
all of them in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/reftests/backgrounds/ from http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/88e95d638b35 if anyone really wants them *right now*, as opposed to when I get around to zipping them up and making them presentable

[13:34:00.0000] <jwalden>
(i.e. s/-moz-// mostly, also pulling out a few that are engine-specific)

[13:37:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm reading a book called Bad Science at the moment, all about evidence-based methology and such

[13:37:01.0000] <takkaria>
really quite a contrast to public-html

[13:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
takkaria: Does it cover good cop / bad cop bargaining? :)

[13:47:00.0000] <takkaria>
sadly not

[13:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: I read one ofthe author's columns in the Guardian recently and it didn't seem that great

[13:47:02.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: I think that to people who are trained in actual scienific disciplines, it's not that interesting

[13:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
It was on the subject of organic food and made reasonable criticisms of a Soil Association press release that claimed that a report saying organic food provided no health benefits was bogus

[13:49:00.0000] <takkaria>
ah, yeah, the book's like that but more in-depth and will a lot of depth on general scientific methology

[13:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
But seemed to go futrther and claim that organic food in general has no benefits

[13:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
(rather than possibly just not having the one benefit that the press release was focusing on)

[13:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
(which made me think that he probably had some preconcieved idea that organic food is pure hype)

[13:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
(which is the problem with putting ourself on a high pedestal and just being critical of other people; you leave yourself open to the same criticisms)

[13:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok well i think we got rid of the particularly nasty twitters

[14:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i posted on the whatwg twitter feed

[14:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone wants to know the password, let me know

[14:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
(it's not the same as the whatwg account password, for those who know that)

[14:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh and for those of you who do have the account password -- if anyone abuses it somehow again, just change the password and let me know

[14:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
and if you want to know the account password, let me know, i can give that to you too

[14:22:00.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: hm, I didn't read him as saying it had no benefits, just that if it does have benefits, they are not health benefits

[14:22:01.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: and he chided the Soil Assoc. a bit for not making that clearer

[15:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: well, I thought it was sensible, but I'm starting to lose faith in my ability to get buy-in on a compromise

[15:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, if we go with your proposal, then I'll have to concede a lot more than it seems others are even remotely willing, which isn't really fair.

[15:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: if people on the other side are not willing to concede anything, then I assume they will not support my proposal at all

[15:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not going to push it if it doesn't have significant buy-in from both sides

[15:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
like I said, I don't want to ask either side to concede 100% of their position in exchange for nothing

[15:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, it seems with your proposal, I'll have to concede 99% of what I want. The only remaining thing being the validator warning for using it.

[15:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the validator warning, plus strong advice to use text that is visible in all media when appropriate, which is likely the vast majority of the time

[15:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
I can live with that, though obviously I'm not thrilled about it.

[15:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, yeah, that too. Make that 95%

[15:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(plus hopefully support to change WCAG2 to be more aligned with this point of view)

[15:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
even if we do accept this now, I'd still like to leave it open for modification in the future based on new evidence, as always

[15:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
My rough estimation is that my proposal is probably right on the edge of what people on either side might remotely be willing to accept

[15:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
btw, I'm currently working on a way that will hopefully give us new evidence to work with

[15:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so if it doesn't work, we probably just have to vote to decide between people's actual more extreme positions

[15:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
and if my expectations of the results are met, then it should debunk a lot of the claims about how the new proposals don't "offer the same functionality" as summary=""

[15:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
so... redirects in websocket

[15:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me ponders how to make that work

[15:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, are you changing the subject?

[15:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
no, i haven't been worrying about summary at all today :-)

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
please feel free to continue talking about summary :-)

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me is just thinking out loud because the next e-mail on his pile is about websockets

[15:29:02.0000] <Lachy>
no, that's all I've been talking about for ages.

[15:29:03.0000] <Lachy>
about *summary

[15:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, in the interest of getting the publication of a Working Draft for the heartbeat requirement out of the way and decoupling the resolution of the summary issue from that process, would you be willing to agree to a short term compromise solution, leaving the group to continue debating the details of othermaciej's proposal?

[15:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's the compromise?

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i've not yet read the 50+ e-mails on the topic)

[15:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's ok, I haven't emailed this to the group yet

[15:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I am curious what your study is

[15:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I made a proposal for what I think is a compromise (not sure if that's what Lachy has in mind)

[15:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
specifically, remove summary from the Obsolete but Conforming features list, and add a big note to The table Element section stating that there has been a proposal to include the summary attribute as conforming, but the issue is not yet decided

[15:47:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Ah, I see he means something different

[15:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
remove summary="" altogether? i'm certainly very happy to remove summary altogether, yes

[15:47:05.0000] <Lachy>
so that avoid's John's controversial changes of making summary fully conforming now

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's what i've been askin for forever

[15:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but the difference is the class="XXX" note in the table section that makes it clear the issue is still unresolved

[15:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: you might want to see if John Foliot would buy into that as removing his objection to publishing a WD

[15:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
we already have an XXX

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm pretty sure john would object completely to having summary="" be obsolete

[15:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but John is objecting to that since summary is still listed as obsolete, despite the issue still being unresolved

[15:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
since wai requires use of summary="" in one of their non-normative techniques notes

[15:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
i thought that's what you were proposing too, making it obsolete completely, not even conforming

[15:49:04.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not proposing to make it fully obsolete, nor fully conforming. Just a note to say that its in limbo right now

[15:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy is proposing removing all mention of it other than an XXX note that the issue is open

[15:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(for the next WD only)

[15:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, yes, exactly

[15:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really care what the next WD says at all

[15:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
the WDs are obsolete before we publish them

[15:50:05.0000] <othermaciej>
me neither

[15:50:06.0000] <Lachy>
nor do I. I just want the WD published and out of the way so we can meet the heartbeat requirement and move on

[15:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
it seems rather silly to hold up publication based on an orthogonal issue

[15:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
we can just publish your doc as a fpwd to satisfy the process, if process is what you care about

[15:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
frankly I would be ok with publishing a WD with either Hixie's text or John Foliot's text, my only annoyance is that it's been tied to WD publication when a WD by definition doesn't have to reflect consensus or resolve any specific issue

[15:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
my doc isn't ready for publication yet. It hasn't been updated in a while and is very out of sync with the spec

[15:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: *shrug*

[15:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
also, I was awaiting the resolution for the spec licencing issue before I published it

[15:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i don't really have any opinion or concern about the heartbeat requirement

[15:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
furthermore I think periodic WD publication has little meaning except pro forma satisfaction of W3C Process requirements

[15:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: my interest is in addressing the actual issue

[15:53:04.0000] <othermaciej>
which is why I wish we wouldn't mix it up with other things

[15:53:05.0000] <Lachy>
sure, so is mine. But having the actual issue tied to the publication of a draft is proving harmful. So finding a way to untie it and get on with addressing the actual issue seems productive

[15:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's also why I proposed to to rubys in #html-wg the other day that we simply adopt a process in the group whereby any editor can ask for publication as a WD at any time and it be done without debate.

[15:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i would be fine with replacing the entire spec with a picture of bunnies and kittens for WD, if that's what you're worried about

[15:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[15:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
bunneh!!

[15:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
i really couldn't care less about the WD itself, i'm concerned about fixing the actual problems in the language

[15:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, re the study, I'll forward you a copy of the proposal I've sent to a few other collegues

[15:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
cool, I'll watch for it

[15:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm keeping it off list for now to avoid it being destroyed before it even begins by some of the trolls in the group

[16:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
fair enough

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to post it to the whatwg list

[16:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
don't let trolls dictate your behaviour

[16:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
sent

[16:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
don't forget to make the analysis phase blind also

[16:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's important that the people analysing the results not know which group each table is from

[16:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
for the usability testing phase at the end, that will be possible, assuming the assitive technology users don't know any other details about the study

[16:14:00.0000] <webben_>
othermaciej: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0221.html

[16:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
webben_: yes?

[16:14:02.0000] <webben_>
position: absolute; left: -999999px; works well with screen readers.

[16:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
webben_: I do know that one works - what I don't know is if visibility: hidden or using an aural media stylesheet consistently works

[16:15:01.0000] <dbaron>
/me was thinking about implementing the canvas text changes (pretty easy), but wants to know what to do about the ctx.font getter first

[16:15:02.0000] <webben_>
visibility: hidden; is known to have problems with (at least) older AT, and is generally undesirable as it still leaves a layout box.

[16:16:00.0000] <webben_>
aural media stylesheet doesn't work with popular screen readers.

[16:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: what's the question? (looking at e-mail now)

[16:17:01.0000] <webben_>
othermaciej: compare also existing WCAG advice: http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS/C7.html

[16:17:02.0000] <dbaron>
Hixie, pretty much everything about the ctx.font getter is undefined :-)

[16:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
webben_: what about sizing something to 0 width and 0 height?

[16:18:00.0000] <dbaron>
Hixie, like if you set ctx.font="2em serif" do you get back 2em or 32px?  And if the font size on the canvas then changes?

[16:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: oh, i see. i'm relying on http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#css-value

[16:18:02.0000] <dbaron>
oh boy

[16:18:03.0000] <dbaron>
I suppose i should look at that spec then

[16:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: i'm not sure about the units, though

[16:18:05.0000] <dbaron>
"Issue: This document is in its very early stages. The intention is that this specification will in due course supersede DOM Level 2 Style. "

[16:18:06.0000] <webben_>
s/WCAG/WAI/

[16:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: i guess converting to pixels makes sense

[16:19:01.0000] <webben_>
I've experienced problems with WAI's advice of moving content upwards.

[16:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: especially given the example in your e-mail

[16:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: let's say that all units are converted to px on setting, and that the serialisation must use the rules in cssom

[16:19:04.0000] <dbaron>
ok

[16:19:05.0000] <webben_>
iirc had a doubling effect on links in Window-Eyes link list and did funny things with keyboard navigation.

[16:19:06.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: (those rules are basically the canonicalisation rules i made up a few years back)

[16:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: also if you find an editor for cssom, let me know :-)

[16:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
anne's unable to spend time on it at the moment

[16:20:02.0000] <webben_>
othermaciej: re font size/height 0: I'm not sure. I believe authors often avoid those as potential spam flags.

[16:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: i'll update the spec as soon as i'm done adding redirects and authentication to web sockets

[16:21:00.0000] <dbaron>

yes

Aww… how boring.

nah, anne helped already

[16:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks though

[16:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
There's still more.

[16:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's no spam left

[16:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
just messages that were posted

[16:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is fine

[16:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
we don't delete criticism

http://twitter.com/WHATWG doesn't look like it

[16:31:05.0000] <gsnedders>

[16:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
hm, there's some new ones since i last looked

[16:31:07.0000] <Hixie>
i guess twitter is on some sort of delay

[16:43:00.0000] <webben_>
othermaciej: I suspect people will know what you mean, but a large amount to the left -  

[16:43:01.0000] <webben_>
{ position: absolute; left: 9999px; }

[16:43:02.0000] <webben_>
is missing the "-" sign

[16:43:03.0000] <othermaciej>
oh, right

[16:43:04.0000] <othermaciej>
feel free to correct me on the list if you want

[16:43:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I have some meetings to attend to

[16:43:06.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't suppose it'll make a difference until people have monitors 10,000 pixels wide

[16:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And use browser windows that wide.

[16:45:00.0000] <webben_>
/me used to use em units, but found this triggered a very odd bug in Safari, adding this absurdly wide horizontal scrollbar

[16:45:01.0000] <webben_>
dunno if that's still the case in 4.

[16:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's a whole lot of email...

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[16:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
do Set-Cookie headers get honoured in redirects?

[16:49:02.0000] <webben_>
/me wonders whether <ins><details></details></ins> is a better way to meet Roy's use-case than @summary. If textual fidelity is important then textual fidelity is important.

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. if i get a 301 Redirect and it includes a Set-Cookie, does it get set?


2009-08-05
[17:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
should we allow a connection to a wss:// secure socket to be redirected to a ws:// non-encrypted socket?

[17:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Automatically, or by script request, or by user request?

[17:19:01.0000] <roc>
no

[17:19:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Is Tom Lord the latest dmitry or something?

oops, forgot to update my checkin script's WHATWG password

[17:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is there anyone on www-font who could be said to be contributing constructively to a likely useful end result?

[17:28:00.0000] <webben_>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/ 1187 between July and Sept ... isn't it time that list got broke up into months?

[17:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm looking at the archives now - glad I'm not on the list

[17:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: as far as i can tell, the status quo is the most useful end result we can expect to get

[17:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I'm certainly not seeing anything useful reading the archives

[17:37:01.0000] <cying>
grrr

[17:38:00.0000] <cying>
that's the last time i click shortened urls at work

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not even at the office and i knew not to click that link, assuming you mean the one from bill earlier :-)

[17:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, gsnedders|work's infinite loop is indeed implemented in gecko :-)

[17:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
good work following the spec, hsivonen

[17:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
guess i'd better fix that :-)

[17:52:00.0000] <dbaron>
those are always fun.  I think I had more trouble with :root { line-height: 1rem } than :root { font-size: 1rem; }

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
why is the former hard?

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
isn't it the same as line-height: 1em, effectively?

[17:53:01.0000] <dbaron>
yes, except you need to remember to special-case the root

[17:53:02.0000] <dbaron>
in our codebase, at least

[17:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[17:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
this particular infinite loop was that <input> in <select> implies </select> and then reprocesses the token

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
but if you're setting the innerHTML on a <select>, the </select> is ignored

[17:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
so nothing changed, and reprocessing the token just tries again

[17:54:02.0000] <dbaron>
since otherwise you get:  go off and find the root element and get its style... oh wait, it doesn't have one, let's compute it ... ad inf.

[17:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[18:23:00.0000] <cying>
Hixie: yea, i'm slow today :)

[18:50:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: I think there's a possible world not very different from our own where "EOT Lite" is worth supporting

[18:51:00.0000] <roc>
we are making progress towards determining whether we live in that world

[18:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: seems like there's a few big contentious points around that discussion

[18:51:02.0000] <roc>
yep

[18:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
- what to do about root strings?

[18:51:04.0000] <othermaciej>
- what about inevitable pressure on vendors that support only Lite in the face of Classic content?

[18:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
- is it tied to a requirement to implement vanilla OTF/TTF (or is the latter otherwise placed on an equal footing)?

[18:52:01.0000] <roc>
I agree these issues exist

[18:52:02.0000] <roc>
I can imagine them being solved

[18:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe they are solvable

[18:53:00.0000] <roc>
I can't imagine Tom Lord contributing to their solution in any way

[18:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Håkon seemed to like the idea of a format not based on EOT at all

[18:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
in the smattering of messages I saw

[18:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it does seem like Tom Lord mostly just periodically pours fuel on the fire

[19:02:00.0000] <roc>
I take it back

[19:02:01.0000] <roc>
Tom Lord may contribute to the solution by uniting everyone else against him

[19:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
what does HTTP stand for?

[19:06:01.0000] <roc>
Hyper Text Transport Protocol?

[19:06:02.0000] <roc>
or is it Transfer?

[19:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
hm, seems to be transfer

[19:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[19:07:00.0000] <roc>
presumably that was some sort of human experiment, not a genuine request for information?

[19:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
neither really

[19:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
i had remembered it as transport

[19:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Transfer

[19:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
and was thinking out loud

[19:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think by analogy with FTP

[20:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm thinking of sending an email that both quotes from our charter and cites first-order predicate calculus

[20:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
this seems, on the face of it, like a poor choice

[20:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
right well i think i'm gonna take a break, and then read the 84 e-mails on summary that were sent today

[20:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I was *this* close to deciding to just stay out of the whole thing for good

[20:41:00.0000] <roc>
take a break and read www-font instead

[20:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
haha

[20:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, at least the endless flamewars on www-font aren't getting in the way of anything I care about or costing time I could spend on more useful things

[20:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so they could be more entertaining

[21:15:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Yo, opinions requested: I'm putting together some js-based feature testing.  Opera and Safari implement <input type=range>, but don't properly sanitize values.  Should I mark them as supporting that?

[21:56:00.0000] <abarth>
Hixie: do you know what the IP restrictions on RFCs are like?  Can I just copy-and-paste paragraphs from an RFC to an Internet-Draft?

[22:56:00.0000] <ezyang>
Oh noes, infinite loop 

[23:09:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
othermaciej (or anyone who might know), how much of videoElement.canPlayType() does safari support?

[23:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
mpilgrim: we support it, I think it may be buggy in some cases (depending on what release)

[23:11:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
including the codecs parameter?

[23:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yes, we look at the codecs parameter

[23:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the last released Safari may have a bug with properly detecting that XiphQT is installed. It should be fixed in 4.0.3, once that is out.

[23:14:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
use case: http://wearehugh.com/public/2006/12/video.html

[23:14:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
via markup, it works fine (tested in latest release of safari 4.0.x, on windows)

[23:15:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i want to write a script that asks the browser whether it can play that video

[23:16:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
"mp4creator -list 20061225.mp4" says it contains an MPEG-4 AAC LC audio track

[23:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe asking about video/mp4 with the proper codecs parameter will work from script

[23:16:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
and an H264 Baseline (level 1.3) video track

[23:17:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
(in an MP4 container, obviously)

[23:17:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
how would i format the codecs parameter to test that particular combination?

[23:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not an expert on the details of the mpeg-4 codecs parameter values, but I think the example of one in the spec would work

[23:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
though it may not encapsulate exactly that profile set

[23:17:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
the example in the spec always returns "maybe"

[23:17:05.0000] <mpilgrim>
is that the most confident answer i can expect?

[23:18:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
or is there another input that would return "probably"?

[23:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think we might be wrong about when exactly we say "maybe" vs "probably"

[23:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but we won't say "no" (or, in the next version, "") for a codec we can actually play

[23:23:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i have quicktime installed

[23:23:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
but v.canPlayType("video/mp4;codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2") returns "maybe" in win/safari 4.0.2

[23:24:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
but returns "probably" in chrome 3.0.196.2

[23:24:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
(both browsers can play a video matching that codec parameter)

[23:33:00.0000] <roc>
chrome lies, so that's not necessarily a good data point

[23:34:00.0000] <roc>
although I think they may have fixed that bug

[23:37:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i think that's fixed now

[23:38:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
hmm

[23:38:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
v.canPlayType("video/mp4;codecs=foobar") returns "maybe" (chrome 3.0.196.2)

[23:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Safari and Chrome both have bugs here

[23:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
some are in the cross-platform media element code perhaps, and some are likely in the media engine back ends

[00:08:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
sigh

[00:08:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
thanks othermaciej, roc

[00:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish that a week or so ago, someone had taken the time to do the WCAG 2 spec lawyering that I just did.

[00:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you raised a darn good point hsivonen

[00:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I did notice the part that cited summary="" was non-normative

[00:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I did not notice it claimed HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.x as scope

[00:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
also it looks like WAI people are working on submitting the HTML5 techniques (plus probably something ARIA-based) to the relevant section of WCAG2 techniques

[00:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I still think my proposal is a reasonable deal if people take are willing to take it

[00:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so far most of the objection is from summary fans, and mainly the ones staking out a more extreme position than the people closely involved in WAI

[01:06:00.0000] <abarth>
othermaciej: do you know anything about the licensing of RFC text?

[01:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
abarth: no idea about it

[01:07:00.0000] <abarth>
do you know who would be good to ask?

[01:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
abarth: I know there's an RFC describing the IETF's IPR policy, which may or may not cover this

[01:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I read over it once, can't remember the details.

[01:08:00.0000] <abarth>
thanks

[01:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
abarth: IIRC, RFC text used to be very non-Free. However, the policy was recently adjusted, but, IIRC, it's still non-Free. I don't know the details.

[01:10:01.0000] <abarth>
hsivonen: i'm trying to figure out if i can use rfc2109 text in a new cookie internet-draft

[01:10:02.0000] <abarth>
this document

[01:10:03.0000] <abarth>
http://www.rfc-editor.org/copyright.html

[01:10:04.0000] <abarth>
seems to say yes

[01:11:00.0000] <abarth>
as long as i cite

[01:11:01.0000] <abarth>
because my use is within the IETF standards process

[01:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
you're writing a new draft for cookies?

[01:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I need to join these http-related mailing lists I think

[01:12:01.0000] <abarth>
othermaciej: i;m considering it

[01:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
abarth: are you going to include spec language for the actual real cookies people really use, and not just the imaginary "v2" cookies?

[01:12:03.0000] <abarth>
yeah, i want to do real cookies

[01:12:04.0000] <abarth>
with very little deviation (if any) from existing reality

[01:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
because if so, you will have even more of my gratitude than you already do for all the various awesome things you do

[01:13:01.0000] <abarth>
its kind of an embarrassment that no cookie spec exists

[01:13:02.0000] <abarth>
thanks :)

[01:13:03.0000] <abarth>
if you're interested, you should subscribe to http-state⊙io

[01:13:04.0000] <abarth>
here's the git repo i'm working in

[01:13:05.0000] <abarth>
http://github.com/abarth/http-state/tree/master

[01:14:00.0000] <abarth>
i'm triaging rfc2109 text at the moment

[01:14:01.0000] <abarth>
and i'm trying to figure out if i can pull it to the public repo

[01:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah I think I need to subscribe to http-state and ietf-http-wg

[01:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe I can convince ap and/or weinig to sign up too, since they know this area and have been known to be useful standards participants

[01:17:00.0000] <abarth>
i haven't quite gotten the swing of IETF yet

[01:17:01.0000] <abarth>
there seem to be a lot of naysayers

[01:17:02.0000] <abarth>
i think they're used to rejecting crappy ideas

[01:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
good ones, too :-/

[01:23:00.0000] <abarth>
alright, i pushed my branch to github.  hopefully everything is kosher w.r.t. IPR

did you have an open twitter on purpose?

[01:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

Hixie: are you tracking StackOverflow as one of your feedback sources?

[01:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
no

[01:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
seems useful for finding out what developers want to know or didn't figure out on their own

[01:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i see it occasionally

[01:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i just haven't been tracking it

/me marks another part of his life plan as failed, and wonders how he did so badly in English especially

[02:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Oh

[02:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe they didn't like Nabokov as much as you?

[02:43:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: And the other 60% of the marks? :P

[02:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Did you accidentally write all your answers in French?

[02:44:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Non, je ne pense pas…

[02:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay, just a thought

[02:44:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i note that &#x0D; is equivalent to &#x0A; in html, although i tried \r with script with the same result

[02:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder if there are more characters that are stripped before parsing

[02:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
U+000B?

[02:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
German?

[02:46:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Nah, I lack the eloquence to write German.

[02:46:03.0000] <jgraham>
How about Finnish?

[02:47:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
If I tried to write Finnish, I wouldn't have passed.

[02:57:00.0000] <annevk42>
sad that the first person asking for the twitter account is a spammer

[02:57:01.0000] <annevk42>
I guess that is to be expected

[02:59:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Almost inevitable after word got out that it was open yesterday though

[02:59:01.0000] <annevk42>

[03:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The review comment status box on the whatwg spec is pretty annoying nad impossible to hide if your browser window is too narrow

[03:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
It would be better if it was closed by default but said something like "Make comment" so that people would know to open it

[03:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: maybe you could also make it 100% wide (with the input box flexing) when open

[03:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
Then only once you have opened it would clicking do anything. It would also be nice to have more visual feedback about which section you were commenting on (e.g. by changing the backgroung colour of the relevant section(

[03:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
and what zcorpan said so it is always possible to hide

[03:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: how narrow is your screen?!

[03:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: send me an updated .js file and i'll replace the one on the site

[03:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I typically have two browser windows side by side

[03:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
I'll take a look at the js file

[03:29:03.0000] <jgraham>
(sometime)

[03:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can hide the review comment status box?

[03:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, seems to be the unlabelled unintuitive arrow button

[04:01:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Huh. perl -p and perl -ni do different things.

[04:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's because they're different commands

[04:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
What happened to TMTOWTTI?

[04:17:00.0000] <annevk42>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0239.html nice

s/TT/TD/

[04:17:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: I mean in terms of what they do to the file

[04:27:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
So... id attributes can contain any characters?

[04:27:01.0000] <zcorpan>
except whitespace and can't be empty string

[04:27:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
is that what HTML4 allows, too?

[04:27:03.0000] <zcorpan>
i think html4 was more restrictive

[04:28:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
that's what I thought

[04:34:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, the messages on @whatwg that start with @{something} are not shown in the listing where I could remove them...

[04:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, it seems firefox, safari and chrome don't support the event handler dom attributes for <video>, other than .onload :-(

[04:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but they do support the event handler content attributes

[04:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me switches to the more verbose addEventListener

[04:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
I think for <ruby> we should just make support mandatory and remove <rp>

[04:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
especially since it has been stated that the fallback is inadequate

[04:51:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
hm, http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/ED-html5-diff-20090801/ is a big fat 404.

[04:52:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Linked from the latest dev draft of the html5 diff file annevk2.

[04:52:01.0000] <annevk2>
it's not actually supposed to point to anything

[04:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
it's just auto-generated every time I do a commit and when we publish ED changes to WD, the date changes to the publication date and the webmaster will make sure the file is actually there

[04:53:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Okay.

[04:53:02.0000] <annevk2>
feel free to point out any other errors though :)

[04:53:03.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Sure!

[04:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that the #whatwg approach of having no ops on a channel is a pretty bad idea on QuakeNet, because if there's no ops for some time period then anybody can automatically request ops and take over the channel

[04:54:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
It could be worse.

[04:55:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
It could be ircnet.

[05:06:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dashiva: The "To" field.

[05:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
+1 to Lachy's reply to Hixie on public-html, even though we don't do the +1 thing

[05:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: +1 to your +1

[05:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me figures he should probably actually read Lachy's reply before indirectly +1'ing it

[05:26:00.0000] <takkaria>
MikeSmith: +1 (score quotes implied)

[05:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
takkaria: brilliant

[05:26:02.0000] <jgraham>
-1 to MikeSmith's +1 since he did it without due dilligence

[05:29:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
If you are referring to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0261.html I add my +0.1 to it.

[05:29:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me adds 2 + 3i to it

[05:29:02.0000] <MadAtWork2>
I've seen plenty of companies stuck with IE6 and the subsequent security problems because of poopy intranet apps.

[05:29:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
See, I'm just unreal.

[05:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
You can only add numbers within the unit circle

[05:31:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Right now I'm working on a little intranet app, using css3 and html5.

[05:31:01.0000] <MadAtWork2>
People will have to use webkit/presto or gecko :P

[05:31:02.0000] <jgraham>
Like sqrt(0.5) - sqrt(0.5)i

[05:31:03.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: +Δe

[05:32:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Only within the unit circle? :\

[05:32:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me doesn't remember that

[05:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: The set of z such that |z|<=1

[05:34:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Yes, I know what you mean.

[05:34:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
But I just don't remember that restriction.

[05:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well we can't have people going around adding +2 or +3 or whatever

[05:35:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oh, duh.

[05:35:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me adds 2 + i^2 then

[05:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: You can just truncate the value

[05:39:00.0000] <takkaria>
whoever put "device-width" in CSS media queries should be shot

[05:40:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
takkaria: Well, there's a 50% chance it was an Opera employee

[05:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: What do you particularly dislike about it?

[05:44:00.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: well, it's pretty redundant with "width" there

[05:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
IMO people have no business querying my device. They should stick to querying the view port I choose to grant them.

[05:44:02.0000] <takkaria>
jgraham: and it means that people write media queries using "device-width", test in destop browsers and find it works, only for someone else to use a screen whose width is acutally quite small and find that it doesn't work as intended

[05:45:00.0000] <takkaria>
pretty much what hsivonen said

[05:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
being able to query the device means the site can nag "hey, I know your screen is wider, please, please maximize me!!!!"

[05:45:02.0000] <takkaria>
if I have a narrow viewport, then you should be switching on that, not the theoretical minimum or maximum viewport I could have

[05:45:03.0000] <jgraham>
I agree width seems like the right thing to use in almost all situations

[05:45:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Next up: Making UAs report viewport-width as the value of device-width

[05:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
So maybe the world would be better without device-width

[05:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
No, because then people would be bugging others to implement it

[05:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
i tried to kill device- features, fwiw

[05:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me deletes 1025 emails to non-public-html w3.org mailing lists that have also been sent to public-html

[05:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
you could raise the issue yet again

[05:49:01.0000] <Lachy_>
/me tries to calculate the total that has been added to his mail, and then gets stuck with gsnedders' use of imaginary numbers

[05:49:02.0000] <annevk2>
i'd again argue on the side of removal

[05:49:03.0000] <takkaria>
annevk2: is it worth doing, do you think?

[05:50:00.0000] <annevk2>
i don't think hsivonen's concern has been brought up before actually

[05:50:01.0000] <annevk2>
my main argument has been is that you do not need them and that therefore we should not have them

[05:51:00.0000] <takkaria>
I guess I should go poke chaals and get member access so I can post, then

[05:51:01.0000] <annevk2>
though Björn Höhrmann did have a somewhat reasonable case for device-aspect-ratio

[05:51:02.0000] <annevk2>
takkaria, everyone can subscribe to www-style

[05:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
ah, excellent

[05:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is glad a lot of the ratholing moved to the font list

[05:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
glad in the sense that there's now less ratholing on www-style

[05:52:03.0000] <Lachy_>
what's the status of the ratholing on www-font?

[05:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy_: just treat the real and imaginary parts seperately and remember that i^2 === -1

[05:53:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me has not been following www-font at all

[05:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me neither

[05:53:03.0000] <Lachy_>
I read on ars technica that there seems to be some support for the .webfont proposal, but it only mentioned support from the font foundries, not the browsers

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
i'm hoping we can just stick with what we have now

[05:54:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I wish widgets had its own list too

[05:54:02.0000] <annevk2>
i told howcome as much

[05:54:03.0000] <MadAtWork2>
one thing about html/head/body.

[05:54:04.0000] <annevk2>
but he's willing to compromise I think

[05:54:05.0000] <Lachy_>
jgraham, ok, then that gives a total of 5.1 + 3i

[05:54:06.0000] <MadAtWork2>
If I don't use them, does they get created in the DOM?

[05:55:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Like, if I style body with css but do not define it in the html, does it still make sound?

[05:56:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
Hm, looks like it does, according to anne's blog.

[05:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
MadAtWork2: Yes

[05:56:02.0000] <MadAtWork2>
I candidate as resident idiot for idiot-proofing the specs.

[05:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Someone will develop a better idiot before you're finished

[05:58:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
I'm sure.

[06:00:00.0000] <MadAtWork2>
By the way, that site is using most of the bleeding edge techniques available right now, with a noticeable exception, no rgba/hsla for the hover effect.

[06:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what's WARP in the widgets context?

[06:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems the current idea on www-font is to create a format that's a subset of EOT, without the encryption or compression or root strings, so it's compatible with old IE and doesn't have objectionable DRM-ish features and isn't TTF

[06:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
and then there's a hundred posts a day about it, adding no new information

[06:15:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Sounds like public-html, really.

[06:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
are there Process discussions on www-font?

[06:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I haven't seen any (in the past ~week)

[06:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
but there are discussions about e.g. whether someone could hypothetically make an EOT file which happens to be processed correctly by EOT-Lite UAs except for ignoring root strings that limit the font to particular domains, and then the font would be rendered and someone could be sued for violating the DMCA

[06:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
or something like that

[06:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
that's seems technical

[06:38:00.0000] <virtuelv>
fuzzy booleans in canPlayType!?

[06:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
DMCA discussions don't seem to be technical, because nobody understands the legal issues so they just make up claims

[06:39:02.0000] <annevk2>
virtuelv, not a boolean

[06:39:03.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk2: I know that, technically, this is a DOMString

[06:40:00.0000] <virtuelv>
but in reality, this is no different from a fuzzy boolean

[06:40:01.0000] <virtuelv>
either way, I don't want to wrestle strings

[06:40:02.0000] <virtuelv>
I'd much prefer an integer

[06:41:00.0000] <annevk2>
also: http://www.on2.com/index.php?564

[06:41:01.0000] <annevk2>
but it'll take another 4 months or so before we get the details

[06:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
also: http://www.on2.com/index.php?594

[06:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
if the "patent pool free" part is correct and Google "does the right thing" I guess it would mean that everyone can implement their H.264 impl RF?

[06:43:01.0000] <virtuelv>
http://wiki.flyinglogic.com/wiki/Fuzzy_boolean

[06:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
virtuelv, I don't really have a stake in the matter and philipj already argued it should just be a boolean, but apparently it's "too late now"

[06:45:00.0000] <nessy>
annevk2: on2 has no part in h.264 afaik

[06:45:01.0000] <nessy>
but it would be awesome if Google open sourced the On2 codecs!

[06:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
nessy, ah, some line put me of, but it seems they have their own codecs indeed

[06:46:01.0000] <nessy>
annevk2: Theora is a derivative of On2's older VP3 codec

[06:47:00.0000] <nessy>
also, flv is On2's VP6

[06:47:01.0000] <nessy>
(when it's not H.264)

[06:47:02.0000] <annevk2>
ah, and now they're at VP8

[06:47:03.0000] <nessy>
yup

[06:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
it would make sense for Google to give it away

[06:48:01.0000] <annevk2>
would make YouTube cheaper for instance

[06:48:02.0000] <annevk2>
thanks nessy

[06:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. interesting times regarding the codec issue!

[06:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
that would be cool if Google makes VP5 through 8 royalty free :-)

[06:49:02.0000] <MadAtWork>
That would imply that youtube will eventually ever get to use <video>

[06:49:03.0000] <nessy>
yeah, totally!

[06:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if that's part of their motivation for acquiring On2

[06:50:01.0000] <nessy>
that's my guess :)

[06:50:02.0000] <annevk2>
I'm not sure how much clearer they can put it without giving away details: "we think that video compression technology should be a part of the web platform"

[06:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk2, that's still a long way from being a definitive statement about it

[06:55:00.0000] <annevk2>
sure

[06:59:00.0000] <nessy>
maybe with google wave and some other stuff that google is working on they realised they needed a free codec :)

[07:00:00.0000] <nessy>
I just wonder if they will only open source some or all of them

[07:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems that for the ecosystem, it would be best to push VP8 instead of a portfolio of old codecs

[07:05:00.0000] <annevk2>
or VP9 if they're working on that already

[07:05:01.0000] <annevk2>
but yeah, one format with multiple implementations is complexity enough :)

[07:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if they lost hope with MPEG-LA and are now firmly on a non-MPEG-LA track or if this is like AOL acquiring Netscape

[07:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
TechCrunch says Nokia is a customer of On2. That's interesting if true.

[07:14:00.0000] <fearphage>
so where do i direct comments about html5 again? mailing list only?

[07:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
bug database

[07:15:01.0000] <annevk2>
fyi, canPlayType was discussed recently and is highly unlikely to change

[07:15:02.0000] <annevk2>
(also mailing list of course)

[07:16:00.0000] <virtuelv>
isn't on2 the historical origin of theora?

[07:16:01.0000] <annevk2>
yes, see above

[07:18:00.0000] <fearphage>
annevk2: it would make more sense if they were constants like XMLHttpRequest.OPENED and XpathResult and others

[07:18:01.0000] <fearphage>
strings like "probably" nad "maybe" just come accross very poorly

[07:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://twitter.com/annevk/statuses/3144668418

[07:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
virtuelv: I think there is some agreement that canPlayType was a mistake. Sadly it was a mistake that was caught after major browsers shipped it

[07:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
And having dual apis this ealy in the game is seen as worse

[07:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
(e.g. a boolean mightPlayType)

[07:41:00.0000] <virtuelv>
jgraham: I figured as much

[08:04:00.0000] <Xanthir>
So, I'm building a thin feature-testing library for myself for html5.  Safari and Opera both support <input type=range>, but neither of them properly validate input.  Should I mark them as supporting or not?

[08:05:00.0000] <Xanthir>
I'm mainly going to use this to decide whether or not to feed the user a jQuery library to simulate the control.

[08:05:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Xanthir: define "properly validate"

[08:06:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Given an invalid @value, they'll return "" (should be halfway between min and max).  Given an out-of-bounds @value, they return the value unchanged.

[08:07:00.0000] <Xanthir>
The latter should be clamped to [min,max].

[08:07:01.0000] <virtuelv>
filed bugs?

[08:07:02.0000] <jgraham>
Xanthir: If they are both wrong in the same way maybe the spec should be changed

[08:07:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me hasn't looked at this in detail

[08:08:00.0000] <Xanthir>
virtuelv: Not yet - I was just working on this last night for myself.

[08:08:01.0000] <virtuelv>
neither have I, but the behavior Xanthir is suggesting seems more sensible

[08:08:02.0000] <Xanthir>
jgraham: possibly.  The behavior they exhibit with an invalid value is consistent with how other sanitizing types work (like the date and time types).

[08:09:00.0000] <Xanthir>
But I'm definitely not happy with how they handle an overflow/underflow value, nor a non-provided value.

[08:09:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Oh, and sorry if I was implying that the behavior I'm wanting is my own invention.  It's from the spec, virtuelv.

[08:10:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Xanthir: no, I'm not seeing that implication

[08:10:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Ah, k.  Good.  ^_^

[08:10:02.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm just saying that the spec seems to make sense in this case

[08:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the spec is missing error handling when setting HTMLInputElement.value, though

[08:11:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Nod.  It guarantees that the return value of an <input type=range> is a number within the range at all times.

[08:12:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Hm, possibly, but I was setting the value on initialization.  I was using jQuery with $("<input type=range value=foo>").val()

[08:12:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Which, by spec, should return 50 (default min/max is 0/100, so midway between them is 50).

[08:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
Xanthir: I agree that not clamping seems odd. 

[08:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
The halfway between min and max seems totally arbitary

[08:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me points out http://philip.html5.org/data/charsets.html in relation to the charset discussion

[08:17:00.0000] <Xanthir>
It's just a way of defining the 'default' value.  Safari will start a range input on the halfway mark.

[08:17:01.0000] <Xanthir>
But it still returns "" if you didn't set a @value, and haven't touched it yet.

[08:18:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Oh wait, that's lies.  It correctly returns 50 if you just put a range input onto the page and immediately ask it for the value.

[08:18:01.0000] <Xanthir>
But it still sanitizes an invalid value to "".

[08:19:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Ah, no, I got it.  Safari will return 50 for the value of a static <input type=range> in the page.  It returns "" for a freshly-created one that hasn't been inserted into the document yet.  Not sure of exact details on how this works.

[08:21:00.0000] <Xanthir>
I guess I'll go file some bugs today.

It appears that storage events for changes to sessionStorage don't fire at all in Firefox and only fire in the sending window in Safari

[10:14:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
What's expected behavior here?

[10:15:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Example page: http://dev.deeptechinc.com/sidney/messaging/sender.html

[10:16:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Changes to localStorage generate storage events on the child iframe and a spawned window in both browsers.

[10:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
sessionStorage should work for iframes

[10:21:01.0000] <annevk2>
but not separate top-level windows (or top-level browsing contexts, as they're called)

Whoo XML parsing DOS. 

[10:28:01.0000] <ezyang>
Which reminds me of the recent infinite loop fix in the HTML5 spec :-) 

[10:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are you referencing any particular XML parsing DOS?

[10:33:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
annevk2: Thanks, I just  looked through the spec again and it's making sense. I'm trying to accomplish inter-window communication in situations where the windows may not have references to each other, and postMessage can't do that.

[10:34:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
It looks like I'm not the only one who wants this... I just spoke to someone in ##javascript who's using localStorage to communicate between open instances of his site, and this poster had a similar question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1100336/sending-a-message-to-all-open-windows-tabs-using-javascript

[10:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
you want localStorage for that

[10:37:01.0000] <annevk2>
although we probably should've introduced a separate API rather than putting it on top of the storage API :/

[10:37:02.0000] <Sidnicious>
using localStorage works, but it feels like this problem should be solved with cross-window messaging rather than web storage.

[10:37:03.0000] <annevk2>
right

[10:37:04.0000] <Sidnicious>
:)

[10:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
you're not the first to point out this issue, though it prolly bears repeating: whatwg⊙wo

[10:38:01.0000] <weinig>
you want a window.broadcast("message") type thing

[10:38:02.0000] <annevk2>
yup

[10:38:03.0000] <weinig>
interesting

/me tries to work out what language code to use for Chilean Spanish

[11:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is something like es-CL valid?

[11:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
or maybe it's close to es-419?

[11:12:03.0000] <Philip`>
Languages are too hard :-(

[11:12:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Am I right at thinking per ES5 foo = [10, 2]; foo.sort() should result in [10,2]?

[11:12:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me must be reading the spec wrong, somehow…

[11:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, although that is unintuitive, that does seem to be the correct result

[11:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
WTF?

[11:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
because unless you pass a compareFunction, the values are stringified and sorted, instead of being sorted numerically

[11:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Right, I get that from reading the spec. But it seems whacky as hell.

[11:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I know

[11:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
What do you expect [1, 2, "three", 4].sort() to do, if it doesn't stringify everything?

[11:49:01.0000] <ezyang>
I think Python sorts strings either before/after 

[11:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks that it is undefined in Python

[11:50:01.0000] <ezyang>
No, it's definitely defined 

[11:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>

[11:51:00.0000] <ezyang>
I know this has resulted in some hilarious bugs 

[11:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
Python says 1 < "x"

"Consistency! Consistency is all I ask!"

[11:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, Python doesn't seem very consistent at sorting nans

[11:52:02.0000] <ezyang>
Ok. 

[11:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, people shouldn't be silly enough to mix numbers and strings in the same array, so that will never happen!

[11:56:00.0000] <hober>
nobody sorts NaNs well, assuming your sorting function uses < and >

[11:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could be consistent and stick them at the end or something

[11:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
instead of saying sorted([2, nan, 1]) == [2, nan, 1]

[12:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, how badly?

[12:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
did you fail?

[12:14:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I passed everything, just (with the exception of computing which I did no work for and did very well in).

[12:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
are you planning to go to uni?

[12:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I won't get in to almost any university outwith Scotland with the grades I got, though (and only there because the traditional starting age is a year younger, so what I did last year is relevant, not this)

[12:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
you may not need to go to uni, depending on what sort of work you want to do

You could go to a university and be a janitor

gsnedders, that's a poor attempt at refuting my statement.

You could become a Polish builder

No

[12:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, clearly, repeatedly posting links to abu---wisam.ahlamontada.net without any explanation constitues spam.

I have no argument to back up my claim, so you win

[13:15:00.0000] <beowulf>
what happened to the idea of UAs auto generating table summaries?

[13:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's still out there

Nobody proved it could be done

[13:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you're paranoid, go ahead and assume that the summary cabal smothered it to avoid competition :P

[13:16:01.0000] <beowulf>
when i looked at the example summary given on the wiki i thought it might be possible with js, but perhaps i over estimated myself

[13:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
beowulf, which summary?

[13:16:03.0000] <Lachy>
Are you referring to the example in the esw wiki that makes no sense if you think about it?

[13:17:00.0000] <beowulf>
Lachy: yes, i was searching for the link there

[13:17:01.0000] <beowulf>
everything but the "this table presents" seems possible

Hmm. Not great I admit. You can surely get into some univerity with that if you want

[13:18:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I doubt anywhere in England/Wales

[13:18:04.0000] <Lachy>
How can rows contain different content from the columns, in the way described?

[13:18:05.0000] <beowulf>
Lachy: i assumed it was from a real table, are you saying if i try and reverse that into a table it won't work?

[13:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
Or, better yet, can you conceive of a table that accurately fits that description?

[13:19:01.0000] <beowulf>
/me has a go

[13:19:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: Isn't the summary just listing each row/column's heading?

gsnedders: You will get in somewhere. Possibly not somewhere great unless there is somewhere tht really likes you

[13:19:04.0000] <Lachy>
I look forward to your solution. I especially curious about how the merged cells in the first column fit in

[13:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, but then the table wouldn't actually make any sense

ACCC will get you in to do CS somewhere

[13:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, beowulf, in this case, since we can't see the table, we're in effectively the same position as a blind user with assistive technology would be in prior to manually scanning the table

[13:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Where, though?

[13:21:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, I'm wondering if the summary uses AT idioms that we just don't know

[13:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Dunno exactly

[13:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I think half the problem is CS is quite badly taught in general, or is just software engineering, which means probably a lot of the places that would take me with such grades aren't overly good

[13:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
aha

[13:23:01.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: if you write a good personal statement pointing out the public software projects you're involved in and the fact you've worked for Opera, I imagine that will work significantly in your favour

[13:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I agree that is more of a problem

[13:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
You do have an A in CS AH though

[13:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
And all the pratical experience

[13:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
this is what you get when you follow the description literally, although I can't figure out how the merged cells in the first column are supposed to work

[13:24:03.0000] <Lachy>
http://html5.lachy.id.au/output?data=%3C!DOCTYPE+html%3E%0D%0A%3Ctable+border%3D1%3E%0D%0A%3Ctr%3E%3Cth%3E%3Cth%3EExpense+Category%3Cth%3ETotal%0D%0A%3Ctr%3E%3Cth%3EDestinations%3Ctd%3Ex%3Ctd%3Ex%0D%0A%3Ctr%3E%3Cth%3ETravel+Dates%3Ctd%3Ex%3Ctd%3Ex%0D%0A%3Ctr%3E%3Cth%3EGrand+Total%3Ctd%3Ex%3Ctd%3Ex%0D%0A%3C%2Ftable%3E&type=text%2Fhtml%3B+charset%3DUTF-8

[13:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: But having a C in maths is going to be a brick wall in a lot of ways

[13:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I assume that Expense Category would be split into multiple categories

[13:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
The rows make no sense to me though

[13:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham, takkaria: it was my maths that was explicitly cited in terms of rejection for Cam last year, though

[13:26:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Grand total is probably a sum of totals, right?

[13:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Any posibility to retake maths?

[13:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
So the concept is a set of destinations, each destination has a date and a grand total, as well as a set of categories with (sub)totals

[13:27:02.0000] <jgraham>
You could make a reasonable case to have over-extended yourself

[13:27:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Practically no

[13:27:04.0000] <Lachy>
/me has to leave for 30 minutes. If you come up with a reasonable table that fits, I'll look when I get back

[13:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What seems like a far more sensible suggestion is to do something like Open University certificate in maths, which would effectively amount to retaking AH and doing a level above

[13:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I don't think it was purely over-pushing myself that did it, really, more absence in Nov/Dec, spending my time quite unproductively trying to do well in prelims (doing things like making sure I could write about English author I had no intention of writing about in final exam), more or less giving up having done badly in them nevertheless, then having to do all the coursework in too little time, more or less not doing class

[13:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
work…

[13:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The fact it was the first time I had actually really had to _work_ to do well at school, as opposed to just turn up to the class and get A/B without really doing anything more, rather screwed me up too.

[13:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: http://dashiva.net/misc/summary.html

[13:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
fwiw I would expect the table described by that summary to actually be laid out like http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/192 even though that doesn't match the summary at all

[13:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: That doesn't seem to match the summary. At least my understanding of it

[13:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What part doesn't match?

[13:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although I think I have an idea

[13:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me opens the spec and has Opera crash

[13:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
We really ought to fix that.

[13:37:02.0000] <Dashiva>
There's a bug

[13:37:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Or several

[13:37:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I know.

[13:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Several.

[13:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: It doesn't have the seperation between rows and columns implied by the summary. Nor does it have the grand total

[13:38:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It does

[13:38:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: The problem is I always fail at reproducing them when I want to, and always succeed when I don't want to :)

[13:38:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Third subcolumn in the first column

[13:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh yeah sorry that was such an insane place to put that I don't notice

[13:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
it still doesn't have the division between columns and rows implied by the summary

[13:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although I think your table might be as close to what is meant as possible

[13:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Actually

[13:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I see there's a different reading possible, let's see

[13:42:00.0000] <beowulf>
i got a very stupid table

[13:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
beowulf: It probably is a very stupid table

[13:42:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Traveling expenses should not require a complex table in the first place :P

[13:45:01.0000] <beowulf>
my heart goes out to any blind person who has to work out a table from that

[13:45:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It would help if you add more data, so people can tell the structure :)

[13:47:00.0000] <beowulf>
actually, mine is just plain wrong, i'll try again

[13:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: what you said about intranet pages is basically exactly what i said in my first post on that thread

[13:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
There are several possible conclusions from this: a) this is an unusually bad example of a table summary b) navigating tables blind is so hard that even really bad table summaries are helpful c) the useulness of table summaries has been ven overstated since even when used correctly they are not that helpful

[13:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
Those conclusions are not mutually exclusive

[13:49:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Is there any easy way to work out whether a cell is a header cell?

[13:50:00.0000] <beowulf>
th?

[13:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
you mean other than seeing if its tag name is "th"?

[13:50:02.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: d) the table is non-euclidean

[13:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Right

[13:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Oh, to be more exact: is there any easy way to work out whether a cell is a header cell, and for what dimensions it is a header well?

[13:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me realized he forgot the vital latter part

[13:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand your question

[13:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean whether it is a header for a column or a row.

[13:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
or both

[13:55:03.0000] <beowulf>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/194 # 2nd try

[13:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i haven't work out which parts of the spec's algorithm you need to apply to a single cell to work that out, no

[13:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: ok

[13:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: at a minimum you'll need to check that there are no cells that specify this on in the headers="" attribute

[13:56:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Is there anything else?

[13:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: and examine scope="", and if that's absent, the surrounding elements, iirc

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
@scope?

[13:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
scope="".

[13:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
What does it do, though?

[13:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me points gsnedders at the spec :-)

[13:57:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Where in the spec? :P

[13:57:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Under th?

[13:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me introduces gsnedders to the "find in page" functionality of his browser

[13:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me smacks Hixie 

[13:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
beowulf: that table is a great example of why table explanations need to be visible to everyone!

[13:58:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Why do I need "find in page" when I have you? :P

[13:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
because i'm doing other things

[13:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, yours looks like a reasonable attempt at making some sense out of the summary, though I don't think it fits it entirely accurately

[13:59:02.0000] <Dashiva>
beowulf: That's obviously wrong

[13:59:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I guess I just need to work out "Forming relationships between data cells and header cells"?

[13:59:04.0000] <Lachy>
however, I expect it's just an unusually bad example since it appears to have been made up without actually having a table to create it from

[13:59:05.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, is it intentional that Web Sockets is not that strict on redirects?

[13:59:06.0000] <beowulf>
Dashiva: which part was obvious?

[14:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I don't see how what you said is the same as what I said

[14:00:01.0000] <annevk2>
e.g. "blabha 301 fdjksf" also redirects

[14:00:02.0000] <annevk2>
also, there's no difference in semantics between 301-307 within Web Sockets

[14:00:03.0000] <Dashiva>
beowulf: Well, maybe it's just the lack of data

[14:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Try adding a few more trips and categories so I can verify

[14:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: that we should take intranets into account, but that we can't have intranet support as a goal

[14:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: yes

[14:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
We need an oracle to help in the summary guesswork

[14:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think that's quite what I said

[14:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, the first part is. The second part isn't

[14:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
but reading your message, it sounds like you're saying that we don't need to take intranets into account because they don't have to use open standards

[14:06:01.0000] <beowulf>
Dashiva: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/195

[14:06:02.0000] <beowulf>
Dashiva: fwiw, saying i was obviously wrong made me laugh :)

[14:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i had hoped i had explained that my position was more subtle than that

[14:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[14:07:00.0000] <beowulf>
like, the summary makes it crysal clear what the table should be!

[14:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: does html5 really require media="" to be treated as "all"?

[14:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: i thought it just deferred to MQ completely

[14:09:00.0000] <Xanthir>
beowulf: Wow, hm, that's almost right.  The first column doesn't have merged cells, though.

[14:10:00.0000] <beowulf>
fwiw, i would guess that a lot of web authors have used this article as a tutorial on tables http://veerle.duoh.com/blog/comments/a_css_styled_table_version_2/

[14:10:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Fwiw, I'm with the "they just made up a summary without looking at a table" camp.

[14:10:02.0000] <beowulf>
Xanthir: the first col does?

[14:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
beowulf: The grand total isn't grand, summing only one item

[14:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Do you know this summary to be fiction?

[14:11:02.0000] <Xanthir>
Oh, hrm, I suppose it does have merged cells.  The blank cell in the upper corner is merged across two cells.  ^_^

[14:11:03.0000] <beowulf>
Dashiva: yeah i know, i can't think how you have a row with grand total though withuot it being, well, a sub-total

[14:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The total columns are the subtotals, as I understand it

[14:12:01.0000] <beowulf>
the summary says rows contain a grand total

[14:12:02.0000] <beowulf>
so it must be a grand total for the row

[14:13:00.0000] <beowulf>
like, if the total mileage is 8 miles at 0.50 a mile, the grand total for that row is 4

[14:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But the rows don't (explicitly) contain any numbers to total

[14:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Maybe an OU maths course does make sense. I'm not really sure

[14:15:01.0000] <beowulf>
Dashiva: they do if you consider rowspan, no?

[14:16:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, yeah, but we might change that bit of MQ

[14:16:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, so HTML5 would have to require that for compat

[14:16:02.0000] <beowulf>
i should add scope in there i suppose

[14:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
beowulf: Sure, that's what I assumed too. But even then you have a grand total of one item (e.g. your food row)

[14:17:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Assuming a table with Euclidean geometry, like the nice one over on the link beowulf posted, we could easily imagine what the automated summary would be.

[14:17:02.0000] <Xanthir>
And honestly, it sounds relatively decent.

[14:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Did anyone say what was wrong with my table? There was something, but I can't find it in scrollback.

[14:18:01.0000] <beowulf>
you know, now that i've done that, even if a ua auto summarised a table in that way i find it hard to imagine it being useful to a blind person, less a person with learnign difficulties

[14:19:00.0000] <Xanthir>
"The table has four columns: Webhosting Home, Webhosting Home Plus, Webhosting Business, Webhosting Business Plus.  It has six rows: Data Usage, MySQL Databases" etc.

[14:20:00.0000] <Xanthir>
If I was blind, that'd work for me.

[14:20:01.0000] <beowulf>
Xanthir: that sounds more useful

[14:20:02.0000] <Xanthir>
That's a basic table, nothing complex with merged cells or anything, but still.

[14:20:03.0000] <beowulf>
the example summary is not a good one

[14:20:04.0000] <beowulf>
very far from good in fact

[14:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
beowulf: It would be interesting to repeat this exercise for some real table summaries. Sadly I don't know of any real, public, uses of the summary attribute that have structural information in

[14:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I don't know for sure, but given that it's been asked about on the public-html, and no-one stepped forward to present the actual table that it's meant for, it seems likely that it doesn't exist.

[14:33:00.0000] <beowulf>
jgraham: yeah, i think if more people tried to do this there'd be a sudden realisation of the usefulness of @summary

[14:35:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Well, not necessarily.  Another possibility is the realization that we can generate useful automated summaries for simple tables, and that summaries are too difficult to generate even for humans for complex tables - blind people are just fucked in that case.

[14:36:00.0000] <Xanthir>
In other words, in the first case machines can do summaries, so there's no reason to let humans do it, and in the second case humans can't do summaries, so letting them try is a fool's game.

[14:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, some humans can do it

[14:36:02.0000] <beowulf>
yeah, but how does a summary help a blind person or a person with learning difficulties if I can't even draw a table from a summary?

[14:37:00.0000] <beowulf>
or do I miss a point somewhere?

[14:37:01.0000] <beowulf>
perhaps I am a bad case study :)

[14:37:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Perhaps this summary is a bad example

[14:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
This gives me another test that I can perform in my study :-)

[14:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what summary people are talking about

[14:39:00.0000] <Xanthir>
beowulf: I'm saying that it may be true that @summary is never a useful attribute to expose.  ^_^

[14:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
If I take the summaries that people provide for the tables they are given, and ask others who haven't seen the tables to reconstruct the structure of the table and see how well they do

[14:39:02.0000] <beowulf>
Xanthir: i think I agree

[14:39:03.0000] <Xanthir>
When a summary would help a blind person, a machine can do it sufficiently well.  When a summary wouldn't, not even a human can summarize it properly.

[14:40:00.0000] <Xanthir>
There may be a middle ground of tables that are understandable through their summary, but are too complex to machine-generate a good one for.

[14:40:01.0000] <Xanthir>
That'd be fun, Lach.

[14:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
Given any particular algorithm for deriving summaries, I can't imagine it would be too hard to find an example which it doesn't handle but which can be trivially explained by a human

[14:41:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Likely true.  But further questions must be answered:

[14:42:00.0000] <Xanthir>
1) Can humans reliably explain tables well?

[14:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not convinved about the ability for a computer to automatically generate a summary from a table in a way that would provide any more information to a user than they would obtain by manually scanning the table headers

[14:42:02.0000] <Xanthir>
2) If no, or at least partially no, is that 'middle class' of tables common enough to justify allowing bad summaries to float around for tables that *can* be machine-summarized?

[14:43:00.0000] <Xanthir>
That's roughly what I'm talking about, Lachy.

[14:43:01.0000] <beowulf>
do sighted people summarise tables?

[14:43:02.0000] <Xanthir>
There's a clear class of simple tables where that is good enough, and while allowing a human to write a summary might produce a better/shorter one, it might also produce a *worse* one.

[14:44:00.0000] <Xanthir>
So, some tests about people's ability to summarize tables well would be cool.

[14:44:01.0000] <beowulf>
or do we just interogate them using axis as guides?

[14:44:02.0000] <Xanthir>
Also: tests concerning current @summary use and usefulness.

[14:44:03.0000] <Lachy>
Xanthir, I'm planning to do such a study

[14:45:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Yeah, I know, I heard you a page ago.  ^_^  I'm just making it clear what my point was.

[14:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm in the process of developing the methodology, but soon I will need to find or create some actual tables that I can get authors to mark up

[14:46:00.0000] <Xanthir>
beowulf: that's a good question.  If the prevalent methodology of sighted people is to just use them for a row/col lookup based on the headers, then that might indicate that a simple listing of row/column headers is rather useful.

[14:46:01.0000] <Xanthir>
But if we do approach most tables more holistically, then perhaps that sort of machine-generated approach isn't so useful.

[14:49:00.0000] <beowulf>
Xanthir: my guess is the former

[14:50:00.0000] <beowulf>
but then if that's the case it's not a summary of a table you need for access, it's a whole new macguffin entirely, no?

it did

[14:52:03.0000] <jgraham>
where?

[14:52:04.0000] <webben>
..."can buy the fund online. The last column in the first column group tells you the annual management charge that you would be charged. The second column group contains four columns summarizing the fund?s performance over one year and three years, and a fifth column giving a link to the full performance details for that fund."

[14:52:05.0000] <webben>
should end at "for that fund."

"Except that the DOCTYPE should change every time the specification changes, to allow for evolution during the development of the HTML5 spec." -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0274.html

[14:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
I guess that means Hixie should add the spec's SVN revision number to the DOCTYPE to meet that criteria. :-)

[14:54:01.0000] <Xanthir>
So he's basically wanting revision counters in doctype?

[14:54:02.0000] <Xanthir>
haha

[14:54:03.0000] <jgraham>
webben: Did you write that?

[14:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I think that information is pretty helpful to me in understanding the table albeit not essential)

[14:55:01.0000] <webben>
jgraham: a while ago yes

[14:55:02.0000] <takkaria>
I know, let's mark all the english documents we write with the revision of english that we're using so that future people now how to parse what we're saying

[14:55:03.0000] <webben>
about two years ago

[14:55:04.0000] <Xanthir>
Dude is stuck on the ancient idea that version numbers actually *mean* something.

[14:56:00.0000] <hober>
takkaria: heh

[14:56:01.0000] <hober>
takkaria: well, aren't we all speaking en-GB-x-Hixie... should that be the default?

[14:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, a lot of things, though obviously not everything, get dated in some way when they are written, so historians can use that information to help determine the grammar in use

[14:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
so in a way, the date acts like a version number in a constantly evolving language

[15:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders how everyone will be speaking differently tomorrow?

[15:01:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Ie se'eb geni'kaeep'seh eekileh siheteh.

[15:01:01.0000] <takkaria>
Lachy: this is true, but when it comes to practical comprehension, no-one uses dates either

[15:01:02.0000] <Xanthir>
All right, so, dude's premise:

[15:02:00.0000] <takkaria>
natural language is as unversioned as HTML in practice is

[15:02:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Conformance checkers need a version number to know what to check against.  True, but this information doens't have to be in-band.  Just specify the version when you active the checker.

[15:03:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Browsers need a version number to know how to render the page.  False, unless you're assuming that browsers carry around multiple engines frozen from each version.

[15:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, don't you suffix everything you say with the current date and time? (2009-08-05T22:05Z)

[15:03:02.0000] <takkaria>
Lachy: not generally, I find it quite inconvinient

[15:03:03.0000] <Lachy>
s/22:05/21:05/

[15:04:00.0000] <Xanthir>
I need to join public-html so I can respond to stuff like that.

http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/196

[15:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, I wish someone (not me) would inform larry that as far as versioning and conformance checkers are concerned, the interesting question to ask is not does this document conform to the version/profile/whatever that it specifiies itself, but rather does it conform to the version/profile/whatever that I'm interested in.

[15:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: k well let me know if that changes and i'll update the spec

[15:08:00.0000] <takkaria>
Lachy: too practical for the überpedants, that

[15:08:01.0000] <beowulf>
oops, thead not closed...

[15:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, this is where I paraphrased that from http://about.validator.nu/#faq (in the What's wrong with DTD's section)

[15:10:00.0000] <beowulf>
now that i've looked at the site, the summary would have been better had it just quoted the headers

[15:10:01.0000] <beowulf>
if i was having it read to me i think i'd prefer to know detail rather than generalisations

[15:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
beowulf, having the summary attribute merely list the headers is not at all useful

[15:14:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Just in the half-hour or so I've been looking at things, it seems useful to me.  It lets me preload the table structure into my head immediately.

[15:15:00.0000] <Xanthir>
You'd probably be right if you says "not always useful".

[15:15:01.0000] <beowulf>
i'd agree with not always useful

[15:15:02.0000] <beowulf>
but if i wanted to know what i could get from a table knowing the table headers would be a good start

[15:16:00.0000] <beowulf>
it at least lets me ask the table questions

[15:17:00.0000] <beowulf>
and if it's not useful i'd like to know what a useful summary is, if there's a vote

[15:20:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Do I need to pay anything to get on the public-html mailing list?  This w3c form is scaring me.

[15:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
you do not

[15:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, yeah, I'll file a bug once we update MQ

[15:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[15:23:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Hm, the htmlwg page (http://www.w3.org/html/wg/) points me to a form that implies i have to become an invited expert, which also strongly implies that money is involved in this process.  Am I doing things correctly, or is there a simpler way?

[15:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
there's no money involved in getting an invited expert status

[15:25:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Ok, so at the relevant points I should just say "No, my employer doesn't want to pay any money, stop asking me."?

[15:28:00.0000] <annevk2>
Xanthir, http://blog.whatwg.org/w3c-restarts-html-effort

[15:28:01.0000] <annevk2>
(took me ages to find, Google has removed blog.whatwg.org from their index)

[15:29:00.0000] <Xanthir>
ah, i remember seeing that a long time ago.  it's no longer accessible from the "Mailing List" section of whatwg.org, which is where i think i saw it before.

[15:30:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Or, dur, i could just scroll down a little bit.

[15:30:01.0000] <Xanthir>
I should probably go put that on the wiki page.

[15:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
it's was initially an email yes

[15:31:01.0000] <annevk2>
not sure why it should also be on the wiki? did something change?

[15:32:00.0000] <Xanthir>
The "Mailing List" option on whatwg.org takes you to a wiki page, which says nothing about the htmlwg.

[15:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
that's not a wiki

[15:33:01.0000] <Xanthir>
...

[15:34:00.0000] <Xanthir>
indeed it is not.

[15:34:01.0000] <Xanthir>
the tabs threw me off.

[15:35:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Um... is it just me, or are reference links broken?

[15:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
not just you

[15:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't done them yet

[15:35:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
ah

[15:35:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
ok


2009-08-06
[17:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
we get some very odd bug reports through the whatwg form

[17:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, we know. They were mentioned here earlier

[17:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
you may have to raise the bar a little for posting through that form to help prevent spam

[17:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
like requiring people to be logged into the spec annotation system

[17:15:03.0000] <Lachy>
or forwarding them to bugzilla to complete the bug report

[17:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
Yay, I hope this now means we can move onto discussing something else for a while

[17:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, like @alt

[17:17:02.0000] <hober>
Lachy: exactly the thought I had

[17:17:03.0000] <Lachy>
no

[17:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
I expect we'll get a discussion about longdesc again shortly

[17:19:00.0000] <hober>
longdesc="" is so bad it almost makes summary="" look useful

[17:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Want to make a bet, Lachy?

[17:20:01.0000] <Dashiva>
First thread with at least 10 posts, alt or longdesc

[17:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, as long as you promise not to cheat by sending 9 responses to the first mention of alt :-)

[17:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
My reputation would only harm the cause if I did, so no

[17:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: the spec annotation system requires them to have sent feedback already, so that somewhat defeats the point of getting people who haven't sent feedback

[17:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: and i can't redirect them to bugzilla if they haven't got an account yet, which seems likely

[17:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, is the summary attribute explicitly excluded from the table elements' Content Attributes?

[17:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, because if we include it it'd have to say something about being discouraged, and we're avoiding saying anything bad about summary="" lest the attribute or its friends be offended

[17:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
what about letting logged in users have their bugs filed immediately, and others held for moderation (perhaps posted into IRC by a new IRC bot first, and allowing anyone in here to moderate it

[17:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think you could list it and just link to the section about it at the bottom

[17:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I don't think it's a big deal either way (at least to me)

[17:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: write me a moderation system and i'll get right on that

[17:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
but that requires me to do work

[17:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I'll think about it. I'd like to learn how to write an IRC bot one day, and this could give me a good excuse

[17:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you have somewhere to host it, mozbot is a great bot infrastructure that lets you write new modules easily.

[17:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i don't say that just cos i wrote it :-P

[17:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
what's it written in?

[17:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
or what does it require the modules to be written in?

[17:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
perl and perl

[17:27:03.0000] <Lachy>
damn.

[17:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
I will find somewhere to host it

[17:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if my other web host, A Small Orange, will allow me to run IRC bot from there?

[17:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
IIRC, Dreamhost doesn't allow that

[17:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do it as a mIRC script

[17:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
does that mean I would have to be running mIRC?

[17:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I'm wondering if it might be useful mentioning in the note about summary other kinds of disabilities other than blindness that may affect someone's ability to easily comprehend the table, and for whom a visible summary would help

[17:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
like people with cognitive disabilities

[17:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure what to say exactly. It might be better to get advice about this from someone who knows more about different types of disabilities than I do

[17:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not touching that text again

[17:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
sigh, i really feel we're short-changing AT users here

[17:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
and for such stupid reasons

[17:42:00.0000] <beowulf>
i agree

[17:50:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie, Lachy: Why not look into the MozBot (or whatever the software's name is)?

[17:50:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh

[17:50:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
should've finished reading

[17:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
wtf: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7224

[17:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok gotta go

[17:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[17:58:00.0000] <beowulf>
Lachy: you can run bots on dreamhost ps, i run a supybot from one

[18:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
beowulf, http://wiki.dreamhost.com/KB_/_Unix_/_Cron_Jobs_and_Persistent_Processes#What_is_your_persistent_.28background.29_process_policy.3F

[18:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
beowulf, I don't pay for dreamhost ps, shared hosting is sufficient for my needs

[18:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I need to write test cases for my <nav> implementation now

[00:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. Larry poked in-band versioning again.

[00:56:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
How come image width/height only allows integer values?

[00:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Because pixels like to pretend they're atomic

[00:59:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
heh

[01:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, iput.files needs to be readonly

[01:03:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, also, do we really want input.files != input.files?

[01:03:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
interesting how many on twitter are amazed by the audio&canvas demo

[01:03:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
i guess we should have made such a demo when opera 9.0 was released

[01:04:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
it's a good sign, at least

[01:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
do I understand correctly that JF wants the spec to prescribe a UI string for validators?

[01:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me wonders if and if, how, MS Paint is accessible

[01:13:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
for a painting app, you probably want to activate the platform's move-cursor-with-keyboard accessibility feature

[01:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
but to be honest, i don't know why anyone would want to paint with the keyboard

[01:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe hardware will solve the painting thing by moving towards touch screens

[01:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: a live input.files seems like it'd get confusing, i thought we were avoiding live apis where we made new ones up

[01:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
I'd imagine that once the user selects a bunch of files the UA creates a FileList object

[01:22:01.0000] <annevk2>
then everytime input.files is accessed that is returned until the user makes a new selection

[01:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
at which point a new object is created

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what the normal "Hardware ECC recovered" rates for disks are

[01:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me also wonders if a ReadyNAS prefers to do RAID reads from disk one

[01:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I see radically different error recovery counts on the two disks

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: i guess we could do that

[01:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: file a bug or send mail or something?

[01:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
https://twitter.com/myakura/statuses/3157898371

[01:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
let them know that the mailing list is the right place to send feedback...

[01:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, also, DataTransfer.files?

[01:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like techcrunch missed that Firefox 3.5 is no longer in beta...

[01:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: i'm going down the list, one at a time

[01:37:01.0000] <annevk2>
techcrunch also called H.264 proprietary

[01:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
it's not really informed journalism afaict

[01:38:01.0000] <annevk2>
for the admittedly few articles I read there

[01:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen, Hixie: the "them" in the case of that tweet is my friend Masataka Yakura

[01:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will encourage him to post to the list about it

[01:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: surely it's informed to call H.264 proprietary in the FSF sense even if not in the ISO sense

[01:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the problem with simply having <rp> as conforming?

[01:48:01.0000] <annevk2>
it is conforming

[01:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the tweet was about <rb> 

[01:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[01:49:02.0000] <annevk2>
I'm thinking it maybe should not be so you do not need to bother about fallback

[01:49:03.0000] <annevk2>
<ruby> support is mandatory after all

[01:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"proprietary" seems like a good word to avoid using at all

[01:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: video is mandatory, too, but we still have fallback for legacy browsers

[01:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Alan Ginsberg used to make a point of using alternative terms like "unlegal drugs" instead of "illegal drugs"

[01:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe people should just say "unfree" instead of "proprietary"

[01:53:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
video is something a browser could be unable to support due to platform restraints.

[01:53:01.0000] <MadAtWork>
ruby sounds like something that even lynx/links can support in a way or another.

[01:53:02.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, ah yeah, I forgot to mention that the other data point I had was that myakura suggested ruby fallback was very poor

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MadAtWork: we have a blanket exception for platform limitations anyway

[02:00:00.0000] <sayrer>
annevk2: you have to pay to use h264

[02:01:00.0000] <sayrer>
annevk2: if they didn't own it, presumably you wouldn't have to pay them

[02:01:01.0000] <sayrer>
annevk2: so, proprietary

[02:01:02.0000] <MadAtWork>
My point was that for video, or image, or audio, a fallback is necessary, for ruby or rp it's not that useful.

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk2>
sayrer, I always thought proprietary/standards-based was separate from RF

[02:02:01.0000] <sayrer>
annevk2: proprietary is an english word

[02:02:02.0000] <sayrer>
annevk2: I'm sure SDOs have definitions that suit them

[02:03:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
proprietary software can be free.

[02:03:01.0000] <annevk2>
seems I was misinformed

[02:04:00.0000] <sayrer>
annevk2: well, I'm interested in non-proprietary codecs that one would have to pay for

[02:05:00.0000] <sayrer>
but this is just grade school level debate. probably above your average HTML5 argument.

[02:05:01.0000] <annevk2>
did I do anything wrong?

[02:05:02.0000] <sayrer>
not lately :)

[02:06:00.0000] <sayrer>
afaik!

[02:06:01.0000] <annevk2>
no need to be so rude then

[02:06:02.0000] <sayrer>
your average --> does not mean Anne van Kesteren's arguments

[02:06:03.0000] <sayrer>
in case it sounded too personal

[02:06:04.0000] <sayrer>
apologies

[02:07:00.0000] <sayrer>
"your average" means something like "the typical" in american english

[02:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.on2.com/index.php?594 - "Avoid potential costly royalties associated with open standards."

[02:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.on2.com/index.php?308 - "our proprietary On2 Video compression technology"

[02:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Just tell us what the OED has to say about the matter :)

[02:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
They seem to use proprietary/open independently of RF status

[02:12:02.0000] <sayrer>
Philip`: that is funny!

[02:12:03.0000] <MadAtWork>
sayrer: funny, "your average" doesn't actually refer to the statistic average, more like to the statistic mode :P

[02:12:04.0000] <MadAtWork>
AH the quirks of the language.

[02:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Dictionary definitions are boring and pointless :-p

[02:13:01.0000] <MadAtWork>
Philip`: that "potential costly royalties" puzzled me as well yesterday.

[02:13:02.0000] <sayrer>
MadAtWork: I am very bad at avoiding idioms of the USA. I get burned quite often!

[02:13:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Often they are interesting and useful :)

[02:14:00.0000] <sayrer>
HTML5 is an open standard

[02:14:01.0000] <MadAtWork>
sayrer: idioms are part of a human conversation, no need to apologize, but it's still funny how technical term and idiomatic expression mismatch.

[02:14:02.0000] <sayrer>
"HTML5 is an open standard"

[02:14:03.0000] <sayrer>
epither or complitment

[02:15:00.0000] <sayrer>
epithet, even

[02:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me hates it when essays/articles talking about X start with giving a dictionary definition of X, because it just seems incredibly lazy

[02:15:02.0000] <MadAtWork>
jgraham: I guess people enjoys spinnging the meaning of words.

[02:16:00.0000] <sayrer>
HTML5 is an open standard. I will charge everyone the same amount as I license my IPR.

[02:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
By the way, someone should tell the On2 site designers about the value of meaningful URLs

[02:16:02.0000] <sayrer>
URLs don't have meaning

[02:16:03.0000] <Philip`>
They do to humans

[02:16:04.0000] <MadAtWork>
They don't on their own, but they gain meaning.

[02:17:00.0000] <sayrer>
maybe to humans who can parse the bizaree bidirectional URL syntax

[02:17:01.0000] <sayrer>
nobody would wish it on their worst enemy. it is an abomination.

[02:18:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
Hm, to put in image macro terms: "pretty url is pretty".

[02:18:01.0000] <MadAtWork>
Which stands as a value on its own, of course by pretty I mean readable.

[02:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
sayrer: You don't need to be an expert to derive more meaning from a hypothetical "http://www.on2.com/on2-video-advantages" than from "http://www.on2.com/index.php?594"

[02:19:00.0000] <sayrer>
Philip`: dude, people don't even know the difference between the browser UI and the web page

[02:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
and it would make me much less likely to get mixed up when pasting links into IRC

[02:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
index.php?124 is *so* 2002

[02:20:00.0000] <sayrer>
Philip`: do you get that? people don't understand the different trust one should give the web page and the browser chrome?

[02:20:01.0000] <sayrer>
it makes most browser nerd arguments seem pretty stupid

[02:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
sayrer: yay for EV certs, then

[02:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
sayrer: I don't care about those people, I only care about me

[02:21:01.0000] <sayrer>
Philip`: that's what the loser of the argument always says

[02:21:02.0000] <sayrer>
hsivonen: exactly

[02:21:03.0000] <MadAtWork>
sayrer: I trust people will eventually grow up being more and more knowledgeable about web stuff?

[02:21:04.0000] <sayrer>
nope

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MadAtWork: haha

[02:22:01.0000] <sayrer>
user education doesn't work

[02:22:02.0000] <MadAtWork>
You have a crystal ball I don't?

[02:22:03.0000] <sayrer>
it's a hard problem

[02:22:04.0000] <MadAtWork>
Um, no it's not.

[02:22:05.0000] <jgraham>
User education is somewhat different from people growing up with someing as a fundamental part of their culture

[02:22:06.0000] <sayrer>
MadAtWork: show me a study that praises user education

[02:22:07.0000] <MadAtWork>
It's a hardly addressed problem.

[02:23:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
sayrer: My 14 yo sister knows more about pcs than my father does.

[02:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
We could rank people by order of knowledgability of web stuff, and then kill the bottom half, and that'd greatly improve the average

[02:23:02.0000] <sayrer>
MadAtWork: not sure you have a strong argument here

[02:24:00.0000] <sayrer>
Philip`: I've been phished

[02:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is probably a similar effect to waiting 40 years

[02:24:02.0000] <sayrer>
you?

[02:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
(I don't know if people growing up with the web also grow up understaning the difference between the chrome and the web page though)

[02:24:04.0000] <sayrer>
jgraham: it is really a very subtle concept

[02:24:05.0000] <MadAtWork>
Philip`: and somehow at the same time it might relieve some pension fund costs... hmmm...

[02:26:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
In every company I've been the young people knew the difference, the 30-something sometimes did, 40+ people didn't unless they had a background in cs/it.

[02:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should make a web browser which uses primary colours for its chrome and renders all web page content in monochrome, to make the difference clearer

[02:26:02.0000] <MadAtWork>
The stats are lower if you go around asking what a web browser is.

[02:26:03.0000] <sayrer>
Philip`: I guess you agree

[02:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me notes that networkState might not be NETWORK_LOADING when inspecting it in the onprogress event handler

[02:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
1. you receive a byte and decide to que a task to fire a progress event

[02:42:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
2. you find that the video now has completed loading and set networkState to NETWORK_LOADED

[02:42:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
3. the event loop spins and fires the progress event

[02:43:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the non-normative event summary table is convenient for writing test cases but might result in inaccurate or wrong tests

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm again annoyed by Google not providing obvious ways to file bugs against their services

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
finally found a bug report form

[03:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
I imagine an obvious easily-findable bug report form would not be very scalable when you have a billion users

[03:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I always thought you were supposed to use the HixieBot for bug reports

[03:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe having to go through multiple levels of searching in order to file a bug is a bozo filter

[03:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
I just type bugs into the http://google.com search box, and assume they'll find it when analysing the logs

[03:14:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
haha

[03:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It's so sad that with all the compute power and face recognition in Street View, YouTube still hasn't as simple image analysis as detecting and autocropping out letterboxing

[03:16:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: send your complaints about the NSA the same way

[03:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: I prefer to send my compaints about the NSA over HTTPS, to make them stand out more to the loggers

[03:17:01.0000] <Rik`>
isn't the NSA able to collect bugs from our thoughts yet ?

[03:18:00.0000] <roc>
not as far as you know

[03:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Rik`: That's how I complain about Uri Geller

[03:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
we're definitely going to have to make dataTransfer.types visible during drags

[03:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
but what should we do about dataTransfer.files?

[03:20:00.0000] <roc>
I got to use the quadratic formula for work today

[03:20:01.0000] <Rik`>
(thx wikipedia for giving me a quick hint about uri geller)

[03:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(even more sad that YouTube has a "let's fix this in documentation" fix instead of a silent software fix)

[03:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Did you look on Wikipedia to double-check the equation?

[03:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me always does that for things he really ought to know :-(

[03:25:02.0000] <roc>
I am dreadfully embarrassed to say that I did

[03:25:03.0000] <roc>
but at least I had remembered it correctly

[03:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't remember that even when i was at uni

[03:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just wrote a program for it on my TI-83

[03:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
(-b+/-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a or something?

[03:26:02.0000] <roc>
correct

[03:26:03.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, just on dropping right?

[03:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
You ought to just work it out from first principles

[03:26:05.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, isn't that the case for other data too?

[03:26:06.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: for the other data, we can just expose .types

[03:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I am pleased to find I have not forgotten how to do that already

[03:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Unfortunately I have :-/

[03:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
(the trick is that ax^2 + bx + c = 0 === (x + b/2a)^2 + c/a - (b/2a)^2 = 0

[03:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
)

[03:35:00.0000] <Rik`>
jgraham: if a != 0

[03:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Rik`: Well yes, but it's not a quadratic if a = 0

[03:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
You're also assuming 2 != 0

[03:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
otherwise the answer will be undefined

[03:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: but i don't know how to do that for .files

[03:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I notice that http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_vs._XHTML claims that <iframe> is a CDATA element. Is that accurate or not? The current spec doesn't indicate it's a CDATA element.

[03:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
"Lachy [n=Lachlan⊙lpc] has quit" - it doesn't seem such perfect privacy when http://www.google.com/search?q=%22london.perfect-privacy.com points to Lachy as the fourth search result

[03:42:00.0000] <Lachy_>
LOL

[03:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Given their inability to write english sentences, for example "With Perfect Privacy you can anonymize and encrypt your whole Internet", I'm not sure that's a great surprise

[03:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: "A start tag whose tag name is "iframe"  ... Follow the generic CDATA element parsing algorithm."

[03:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
says the tree constructor section

[03:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: thanks

[03:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, in this case, I still have significant plausible denyability since I'm not the only one using their service

[03:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
*deniability

[03:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: seems like the CDATA list in http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/syntax.html#elements-0 should have <iframe> included

[03:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
want me to file a bug on it?

[03:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Given the number of search results, there aren't a huge number of other people using their service

[03:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if you could look at the TCP packets and timings received from the anonymising proxy, and deduce the latency of the user (and thus get some insight into their geographic location)

[04:14:00.0000] <virtuelv>
encrypting the whole Internet

[04:14:01.0000] <virtuelv>
accidentally

[04:16:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me often does that

[04:18:00.0000] <virtuelv>
 http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/6zk5r/i_accidently_a_fleshlight/ ← for those missing the reference

[04:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, that's probably because most services people use don't publicly publish their access logs where they can get indexed by search engines, unlike IRC

[04:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, the images in the forum that reddit page links to seem to be unavailable.

[04:25:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notes that .duration might have interop problems especially for files where the audio component and video component have different lengths

[04:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, what does it mean to "accidentally a fleshlight"? (I know what a fleshlight is, I'm just curious what's being done with it)

[04:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, other than the usual stuff

[04:29:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: that's the point of the meme, there is something missing between accidentally and the (whole) fleshlight

[04:29:01.0000] <virtuelv>
in this case, there is definitely something missing between "your" and "whole internet"

[04:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, how is that a meme?

[04:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: Why is something missing?

[04:32:01.0000] <virtuelv>
http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22accidentally+the+whole%22&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8

[04:32:02.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm not pointing directly to the top result there

[04:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: It seems to make grammatical sense to me

[04:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
it's tempting to write "Hi Sam, I agree that the wording on summary is sufficient for publication. However, like others I think it needs to be made non-conforming before Last Call."

[04:33:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: does the sentence «I accidentally the whole bottle» make sense to you?

[04:34:00.0000] <virtuelv>
you accidentally WHAT the whole bottle?

[04:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: anonymize and encrypt it

[04:34:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk2: Isn't it just

[04:35:00.0000] <annevk2>
hm?

[04:36:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: I don't have a whole internet anywhere

[04:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk2: Tempting to write that. It seems there is a tactic of drawing a line in the middle that people will converge on and then trying to slowly move the line toward the previous, unacceptable, position

[04:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, I'm also annoyed with all the overhead these meaningless emails generate

[04:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/I_accidentally_X

[04:39:02.0000] <annevk2>
we already know the summary issue is not closed

[04:39:03.0000] <annevk2>
no need to hear it again from all the naysayers

[04:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
This "whole internet" thing reminds me of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAUyaELfwBo

[04:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: It doesn't make semantic sense (given that the Internet does not belong to anybody), but that's completely different to not making grammatical sense

[04:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It doesn't make grammatical sense either I think although I'm not sure I can explain the technical reason

[04:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
But grammer allows for things like countable vs uncountable nouns

[04:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
so "I want more waters" is grammatically wrong if you mean "I want more water"

[04:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
(whereas "I want more emails" is fine because email is countable)

[04:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, that depends if you consider the plural of email to be "email" or "emails"

[04:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, I think there are cases where either can be used, and others where only one works.

[04:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
It could say "anonymize and encrypt your whole intranet", and that would be perfectly fine if e.g. you were a network administrator, and the only difference with Internet is that there's only one Internet

[04:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. still stalled with updating and relauncihng the v.nu system, because I hod forgotten to press a button that makes my DNS changes actually have an effect

[04:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
usability++

[04:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: That I think is the critical difference. But I wasn't sure if "singleton" is a concept in grammar

[04:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: If someone made a second Internet, would the sentence magically change from grammatically incorrect to grammatically correct?

[04:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Maybe. I'm also unclear if it is considered a syntactic error to place a non-owned-item after a possesive or if that is a sematic error

[04:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if that could be considered false advertising, since the IRC messages I posted while I was connected to the VPN are no longer encrypted when others receive them

[05:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how many 'anonymising' services are secretly run by government departments

[05:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, http://www.perfect-privacy.com/faq.html#faq6

[05:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: It seems like a good way of targetting people with something to hide

[05:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, probably.

[05:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
But I don't use it for illegal activities. I only access legal services through it

[05:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
like BBC iPlayer and Hulu

[05:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
That is probably illegal if you are not a UK license payer

[05:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
(iPlayer)

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think territorial restrictions on Web sites are antithetical to the Web

[05:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is still bitter that Daily Show now blocks visitors by country

[05:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's their fault for not offering an alternative without territorial restrictions, even if users outside the UK had to pay a small fee

[05:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
UK residents only need a TV license for live video, not prerecorded stuff that's on iPlayer

[05:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
also, IMO, everyone anywhere should be able to pay and subscribe to the BBC

[05:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess that if you're not in the UK then it's just plain copyright infringement, independent of any TV licensing

[05:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, the UK should just make the BBC tax payer funded instead of requring TV licences

[05:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
That seems very unfair on people who don't watch TV at all

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
new legislation in Finland will consider TVless people such oddballs that they can be charged as collateral damage

[05:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
I would for sure subscribe to the BBC if it were possible. But that would require the BBC to forfeit their ability to sell their shows abroad

[05:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Which I assume they don't want to do

[05:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, what's the difference? Either way, theyr'e getting money. What does it matter if it's thorugh subscription fees or DVD sales?

[05:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: If I don't need to pay for subtitling, why shouldn't I be able to purchase the shows from the BBC directly?

[05:29:03.0000] <Philip`>
I believe the BBC says the reason it doesn't have (advertisting-supported) non-UK iPlayer access is that it doesn't have the rights for most programmes, and negotiating the rights is a long and complex and ongoing process

[05:29:04.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Not sell as DVDs but sell to other networks

[05:29:05.0000] <jgraham>
or subsiduries such as BBC America

[05:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the concept of regional networks sucks

[05:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, you're making the false assumption that internet distribution would kill TV distribution, which it won't.

[05:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's like saying just because films are available on DVD before they air on free-to-air TV, then TV networks wouldn't buy those films and show them, but that is clearly not the case

[05:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I'm making the reasonable assumption that offering the shows online reduces their resale value by reducing the market

[05:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me has noticed the thumbnails on iPlayer for movies are almost always photos of actors in interviews, not images from the film itself, and wonders if that's rights-related

[05:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
they just need to adapt their business model to the times, rather than simply fight to maintain an old business model designed for last century

[05:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Indeed, but it's what we're stuck with for now

[05:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
in the case of The Daily Show and Colbert Report, no regional network carries them

[05:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and they don't even sell them to me by episode with DRM infestation on iTunes

[05:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
they don't monetize my willingness to pay in any way

[05:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but I guess I'm preaching to the choir here

[05:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
fwiw, I would quite happily spend the $100/month or so I spend on services that allow me to access content that isn't otherwise available legally in my area on legitimate services if they fixed their business models

[05:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
actually, it's only about $70

[06:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=508075 has ever been a practical problem for Opera

[06:11:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: Yes

[06:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
closing on <body> would be the wrong fix

[06:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
the right fix is reparsing

[06:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
which is a wontfix :)

[06:16:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: (Very very very rare, though)

[06:23:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Anyone know about FF plans for outerHTML support?

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work, zcorpan: ok. thanks

[06:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I wonder if Parallels hung randomly or if Parallels doesn't work properly when the VM hard disk image is on an AFP volume

[12:47:00.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: you there?

[12:48:00.0000] <ojan>
annevk2: or you? i bet you'd know the answer to my question.

[12:50:00.0000] <paul_irish>
is there a more appropriate IRC channel for the webfont conversation?

[12:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
people have discussed webfonts here

[12:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
this isn't necessarily the home base of all people with an interest

[12:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
ojan, somewhat

[12:53:01.0000] <annevk2>
are webfonts even discussed over IRC?

[12:54:00.0000] <Lachy_>
annevk2, not frequently

[12:54:01.0000] <ojan>
annevk2: bit of a n00b question...i want to propose an extension to the CSS position property. is www-style the right mailing list?

[12:54:02.0000] <annevk2>
yeah

[12:54:03.0000] <ojan>
annevk2: k. thanks.

[13:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me ponders whether it's worth responding to the summary issue again explaining why I'm not very happy about the compromise, but can accept it for now, at least until I get more evidence

[13:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
... probably not, but I should at least write my thoughts down for future reference

[13:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I don't think it would be disruptive to do that

[13:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I think it could be constructive

[13:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to show that there are real concessions being made by both sides

[13:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's good to see that we're making progress on listening to each other's arguments: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0341.html

[13:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: yeah...

[13:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
it somewhat worries me that Manu's email does not mention the xmlns namespace issue at all

[13:44:01.0000] <annevk2>
it has been repeatedly pointed out as at least a potential issue to the RDFa guys

[13:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
As long as you can hack it with namespace-unaware APIs to work in simple cases, surely it's good enough to rely on as a fundamental part of a technology intended to become ubiquitous and widely deployed

[13:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a feature, not an issue

[13:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
I'm always met with sarscasm here, damn you guys!

[13:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: what's the xmlns namespace issue?

[13:48:01.0000] <annevk2>
in XML xmlns is put in a namespace

[13:48:02.0000] <annevk2>
a special "XMLNS Namespace"

[13:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
this does not happen in HTML

[13:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
(except in SVG/MathML in HTML, I think)

[13:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: my vague recollection is that namespace-unaware APIs are not entirely interoperable for attributes with colons in them in current browsers

[13:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: I wasn't really clear on why Manu was investigating what happens with xmlns attributes

[13:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: maybe he misunderstood the real issue

[13:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: But parsing and getAttribute seems to work, which is apparently good enough for the RDFa people

[13:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you know, it wouldn't be so hard for them to design something that is essentially like RDFa but avoids namespaces so that weirdness in text/html can be avoided

[13:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
they would get a lot more traction that way, I think

[13:51:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Can I call it irony that a technology from XHTML doesn't use the very methods added for it?

[13:52:00.0000] <annevk2>
othermaciej, yeah I suppose

[13:52:01.0000] <annevk2>
othermaciej, I mean if what he just reported was news to him o_O

[13:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: That'd break compatibility with legacy content that uses xmlns:foo in text/html, though

[13:52:03.0000] <Philip`>
(and legacy parsers and legacy tutorials etc)

[13:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What's the phrase again? Delay, divert, too late?

[13:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Note that we tried to support @xmlns in text/html, IIRC, and had it break tons

[13:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: microdata is "essentially like rdfa" but avoids the problems with rdfa

[13:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You might have tried to support it in a stupid way, so that's not evidence that it's impossible to do anything differently to what's done today

[13:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Well I didn't work then

[13:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: (I'm using "you" in the same sense that you used "we")

[13:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yes, I know… But it means I know nothing

[13:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I've not seen anyone describing what Opera actually tried to implement, and "support @xmlns in text/html" is extremely vague, so there doesn't seem to be enough information to conclude anything

[14:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: I think it was news to him

[14:00:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I think they made xmlns:foo be (xmlns, foo) instead of (null, xmlns:foo)

[14:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: based on earlier private communication with him, he thought there had to be a new spec requirement to require preserving xmlns nodes in the DOM as-is

[14:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
then he misunderstood the issue

[14:01:01.0000] <annevk2>
the issue was that xmlns was not put in the correct namespace when it went into the DOM

[14:01:02.0000] <annevk2>
the other issue of course is that xmlns would mean something completely different in HTML (it would only apply to RDFa)

[14:01:03.0000] <Philip`>
That's only a problem if there are any practical consequences to it not being put in the correct namespace

[14:01:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I'm thinking maybe they could come up with a version that solves the namespace issues, but still have it be close enough to "RDFa in XHTML" that they would be happy to still call it RDFa

[14:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: maybe that exercise would lead them to conclude that microdata meets their needs, I dunno

[14:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems unlikely

[14:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
(so I suppose it would be good to demonstrate those practical consequences)

[14:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
they're never going to make a version that doesn't have prefixes at all

[14:02:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: in any case it seems better than completely rejecting all that feedback

[14:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: maybe you could help him see that he may have misunderstood the issue

[14:05:00.0000] <annevk2>
mah, you're too good

[14:06:00.0000] <annevk2>
I just like to bitch about these things and let someone else care, oh well, I'll write it

[14:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk2: You lost that chance when you were the serious one vs Philip earlier

[14:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
pretty hard to get a break in this channel too :p

[14:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's okay, we still love you

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i hope we have a vote on this summary stuff, i really don't like what's in the spec now

[14:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Can you fix the the issue you added when fixing the infinite loop?

[14:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's on the pile

[14:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
is it urgent?

[14:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to do the file api stuff first

[14:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Not really

[14:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
btw can anyone reproduce http://stanford.edu/~jlebar/moz/screen1.png ?

[14:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Yes

[14:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: e.g. set minimum font size to 16

[14:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
(in Firefox)

[14:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it looks like it may be heading in a direction where it will only be settled by vote

[14:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm ok with that as long as Sam actually calls a vote to decide the issue at some point, instead of letting the issue fester forever

[15:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: But it'd be nice to have a parsing algorithm that worked :P

[15:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i'll get there

[15:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: aah, interesting

[15:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i wonder how to work around that

[16:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me mutters something

[16:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Aahhh! My ears!

[16:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The noise!

[16:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: yt?

[16:31:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, pong

[16:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
when i first specced localStorage, it supported arbitrary structured data

[16:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
but mozilla wanted it to be only strings instead

[16:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
now that Files are being introduced, i've got a request from mozilla to allow localStorage to include File or DOMString

[16:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
would it make sense to just allow any structured data again?

[16:32:04.0000] <sicking>
bet you didn't see that one coming, did'ya ;)

[16:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe using the "structured clone" concept? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#safe-passing-of-structured-data

[16:33:01.0000] <sicking>
we aim to be unpredictable, never know where you have us. Like Ninjas we are

[16:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[16:33:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, hmm.. i would be for that yeah

[16:34:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie,  i'll have to check with the people that worked with localStorage, but IMHO it makes a lot of sense

[16:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[16:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
that means being able to store File, FileList, FileData, RegExps, ImageData, etc

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
as well as any combination of Object or Array that doesn't have loops in it

[16:51:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, sounds good, though a lot of work

[16:51:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, But I think it's the right thing to do

[16:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[16:52:01.0000] <sicking>
RegExps was actually the only thing that stuck out there when i first looked at the HTML spec

[16:52:02.0000] <sicking>
but i guess they can be serialized

[16:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you can serialise ImageData and FileList, serialising RegExp will be a cake walk

[16:53:01.0000] <sicking>
yeah, i guess

[16:53:02.0000] <sicking>
well.. except if they have callback functions

[16:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
it only clones the pattern and flags

[16:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
"Return a newly constructed RegExp object with the same pattern and flags as input."

[16:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
even lastIndex isn't copied


2009-08-07
[17:01:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, so there's one problem

[17:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
what happens if the underlying file goes away?

[17:01:02.0000] <sicking>
there's that too

[17:01:03.0000] <sicking>
but

[17:02:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, storing files means doing IO on the main thread

[17:02:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, something that we're trying not to do

[17:02:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, hmm.. actually

[17:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
Storage is async to disk

[17:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's only sync to RAM

[17:03:00.0000] <sicking>
not sure that sqlite is able to do it that way

[17:03:01.0000] <sicking>
didn't sound like it

[17:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh, you use sqlite as the backend? interesting

[17:04:00.0000] <sicking>
but actually the File object is just a reference, we wouldn't need to read the actual data, so I think it's fine

[17:04:01.0000] <sicking>
ImageData is another cup of tea though, since it has sync accessors

[17:05:00.0000] <sicking>
But File should be fine

[17:09:00.0000] <sicking>
so sounds like we're fine with everything but ImageData

[17:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do you handle ImageData with postMessage()?

[17:10:01.0000] <sicking>
maybe we can create a way to convert File to/from ImageData to allow people to store ImageData

[17:10:02.0000] <sicking>
we don't

[17:10:03.0000] <sicking>
for postMessage we only do JSON right now

[17:10:04.0000] <sicking>
and only to workers

[17:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
let me rephrase... how do you intend to handle ImageData with postMessage()? :-)

[17:11:01.0000] <sicking>
not sure if anyone was aware of it until a few days ago when i looked at the structured clone spec

[17:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[17:11:03.0000] <sicking>
also all the postMessage we have today are wholly in-memory

[17:12:00.0000] <sicking>
so no IO problems

[17:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's a strong desire from people to be able to do heavy-duty image manipulation on background workers

[17:12:02.0000] <sicking>
agreed

[17:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
and i figure once you work out a way to do ImageData cloning efficiently with postMessage(), you can just use the same technique for Storage

[17:13:00.0000] <sicking>
it's not the cloning part that's the problem. It's the storing it to disk

[17:13:01.0000] <sicking>
which you don't need for postMessage

[17:13:02.0000] <sicking>
but do need for pushState/localStorage

[17:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
can't you just keep the ImageData in RAM, give it a unique ID, store a unique ID to the database, and then in the background store the image data to a separate table with that ID?

[17:14:00.0000] <sicking>
not when reading

[17:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean it's not trivial, but it doesn't seem that hard

[17:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh, reading is interesting, yes

[17:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[17:14:04.0000] <sicking>
btw, i expect apple to feel the same way on this

[17:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah reading ImageData from disk is a problem

[17:14:06.0000] <Hixie>
no disgreement there

[17:14:07.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[17:15:00.0000] <sicking>
a possibility is to have two types of structured-clone

[17:15:01.0000] <sicking>
one for postMessage and one for other things

[17:15:02.0000] <sicking>
sort of sucks though

[17:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
so pushState() isn't a problem here, because the popstate event is async

[17:16:00.0000] <sicking>
sort of yeah, though i'd be a little worried about poor UI if the popstate event is delayed by a long time

[17:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'll make Storage fail if it contains an ImageData object, for now, until we can figure out some solution

[17:17:00.0000] <sicking>
sounds good

[17:17:01.0000] <sicking>
i'm not sure how much of structured clone we'll do for next release

[17:17:02.0000] <sicking>
we might just stick to JSON

[17:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well all of this is rather pie in the sky, i'll be the first to admit

[17:17:04.0000] <sicking>
as we're basically branching any day for FF3.6

[17:17:05.0000] <sicking>
hah

[17:17:06.0000] <Hixie>
i don't expect this stuff in browsers any time soon

[17:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
should it throw or convert to null when you pass it an ImageData? (DOM nodes and raw CanvasPixelArrays convert to null)

[17:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
(Error objects and loops throw)

[17:19:00.0000] <sicking>
hmm.. what's the reason not to throw for DOM nodes and other host objects?

[17:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think that was so that we could support it later

[17:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
which would argue for this to convert to null

[17:20:00.0000] <sicking>
ah, hm

[17:20:01.0000] <sicking>
/me ponders

[17:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
the idea being that one day people would postMessage something like { 'text version of the data', DOMNodeOfTheData }

[17:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
and the worker would look at the DOM node and say "oh that's null, must be an old browser, i'll use the text"

[17:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
instead of the script having to test and resend just text

[17:20:05.0000] <sicking>
not sure which is best actually

[17:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
not really sure. i really need a minion to note down the reasoning behind every checkin :-)

[17:21:01.0000] <sicking>
given that it might be slow to get the text version

[17:21:02.0000] <sicking>
maybe i'm thinking too much about perf though

[17:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
this is onl ever used in situations where perf sucks anyway

[17:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
cross-thread, I/O, etc

[17:21:05.0000] <sicking>
i guess there's some truth to that

[17:22:00.0000] <sicking>
not sure if we'll ever do DOM nodes though

[17:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:22:02.0000] <sicking>
given how much of them can't be serialized

[17:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
me either

[17:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll throw for ImageData for now.

[17:22:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's easier to spec. :-)

[17:22:06.0000] <Hixie>
we can work out whether to change the nulls to throwing later

[17:22:07.0000] <sicking>
heh

[17:23:00.0000] <sicking>
people can just convert ImageData to a JS object instead :)

[17:23:01.0000] <sicking>
{ "0,0

[17:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
that'll be even more painful performance-wise :-/

[17:23:03.0000] <sicking>
": [0, 255, 0], ... }

[17:24:00.0000] <sicking>
i know, just kidding. though i'm sure someone will do it

[17:24:01.0000] <sicking>
but as long as slow operations look slow then IMHO we're good

[17:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
or at least if not good, not so bad

[17:24:04.0000] <sicking>
right

[17:25:00.0000] <sicking>
btw, did you test that IE executes DOM inserted scripts out-of-order?

[17:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
off-hand i have no idea

[17:25:02.0000] <sicking>
ok, testing now

[17:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
IE's script execution model is wacked

[17:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
(who would have thought innerHTML could affect it, e.g.)

[17:26:02.0000] <sicking>
i had a recollection that they executed scripts syncronously when you set .src

[17:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm considering just making defer="" on <script> just be ignored, btw, and removing the crap around innerHTML

[17:26:04.0000] <sicking>
i think we should just use the Firefox model

[17:26:05.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: i'm sure whatever they do cannot be summarised in one sentence.

[17:27:00.0000] <sicking>
henris suggestion is basically what we do internally

[17:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
henri's suggestion scares me

[17:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
it makes the parsing even more complex in ways that are very subtle and hard to get right

[17:27:03.0000] <sicking>
it's not a huge deal implementation-wise

[17:27:04.0000] <sicking>
at least it wasn't for us

[17:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
you didn't have to follow a spec

[17:27:06.0000] <sicking>
just check if there are pending scripts when you reach the end of the stream

[17:27:07.0000] <Hixie>
what if i end up speccing something that is subtly different?

[17:28:00.0000] <sicking>
you already are :)

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
i just hate the idea of being able to hit EOF multiple times

[17:28:02.0000] <sicking>
everywhere :)

[17:28:03.0000] <sicking>
no, just one EOF

[17:28:04.0000] <sicking>
but we'd remove the implication that end-of-stream => EOF

[17:28:05.0000] <sicking>
(network stream that is)

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's just weird and confusing

[17:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd have to have two different kinds of EOF tokens in the tokeniser?

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
one for scripts and one for document.write()?

[17:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
er, document.close)

[17:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
(

[17:35:00.0000] <sicking>
/me ponders

[17:37:00.0000] <sicking>
technically no

[17:37:01.0000] <sicking>
Any of these would work:

[17:37:02.0000] <sicking>
1. Two types of EOF

[17:37:03.0000] <sicking>
2. Allowing EOF to go through the tokenizer twice

[17:38:00.0000] <sicking>
3. Start a new tokenizer after the first EOF

[17:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
you've just listed three of my worst nightmares

[17:38:02.0000] <sicking>
4. Reset/Restart the same tokenizer after the first EOF

[17:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
four of my worst nightmares...

[17:38:04.0000] <sicking>
really? you have poor imagination ;)

[17:38:05.0000] <sicking>
the localStorage situation is much worse IMHO

[17:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
the storage mutex?

[17:39:01.0000] <sicking>
yeah

[17:39:02.0000] <sicking>
it's teh suxxorz

[17:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah that's pretty horrific too

[17:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't see a way around it

[17:39:05.0000] <sicking>
and the general way that invalid markup is handled

[17:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
with the <script> thing, just not supporting <script defer> (no src) seems like a solution that solves the problems that were found

[17:40:00.0000] <sicking>
you sure there are no external scripts with defer that does .write?

[17:40:01.0000] <sicking>
i would certainly expect there to be

[17:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
if there are, they're highly unreliable in IE

[17:40:03.0000] <sicking>
how so? a .innerHTML flushes them

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
.innerHTML throws them out altogether if they're not loaded yet

[17:41:01.0000] <sicking>
not in my testing

[17:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
you didn't test well enough

[17:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[17:41:04.0000] <sicking>
well, i can give a testcase where it doesn't throw them out. So seems your testing isn't good enough :)

[17:41:05.0000] <sicking>
though maybe it only works locally?

[17:42:00.0000] <sicking>
i can test

[17:42:01.0000] <sicking>
once i've tested this out-of-order thing

[17:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
make sure it's not cached

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
file:// is sync in IE, i think

[17:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to find my tests

[17:43:02.0000] <sicking>
it's not sync, but it might change things i agree

[17:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/parsing/script-defer-write/

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/parsing/script-defer-write/001.html in particular

[17:47:01.0000] <sicking>
why does http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/parsing/script-defer-write/fail.js give me an "internal error" page?

[17:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
cos i suck

[17:48:00.0000] <sicking>
as does reset.js

[17:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
try now

[17:48:02.0000] <sicking>
is there a delay on those?

[17:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
in IE, yes

[17:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
er

[17:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[17:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
every .js file in that directory takes 2 seconds to generate

[17:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe my testing sucked

[17:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
no, it seems it was right

[17:51:00.0000] <sicking>
i mean, i'd love to not have to do this double-EOF thing

[17:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
compare http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/parsing/script-defer-write/001.html to http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/parsing/script-defer-write/008.html

[17:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
IE throws away the script on 001

[17:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
and on 008 it wipes the document

[17:52:00.0000] <sicking>
yup

[17:52:01.0000] <sicking>
hum hum

[17:52:02.0000] <sicking>
well, lets put it in the spec

[17:53:00.0000] <sicking>
we'll find out when we try to implement it

[17:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
just removing defer="" with no src="", you mean?

[17:53:02.0000] <sicking>
so the plan is to ignore the 'defer' attribute on inline scripts, right?

[17:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:53:04.0000] <sicking>
sounds good

[17:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[17:54:00.0000] <sicking>
i'll just have to fight you on the DOM-inserted scripts execution order... for now

[17:54:01.0000] <sicking>
and no magic at all on innerHTML, right?

[17:54:02.0000] <sicking>
no nuking of pending defered scripts a'la IE

[17:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
right

[17:55:00.0000] <sicking>
/me ponders

[17:56:00.0000] <sicking>
lets just hope that people don't come to depend on the FF3.5 behavior

[17:56:01.0000] <sicking>
of .write working in deferred async scripts

[18:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, afk for a while. bbiab.

[19:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The thread about <script /> reminds me of when Opera was implementing canvas support

[19:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Lots of the early canvas content was of course using <canvas />

[23:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[23:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've sent in the registrations for the two WebSocket ports, the two WebSocket schemes, and the WebSocket HTTP Upgrade keyword.

[23:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's next.

[23:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
MIME types: text/html; application/xhtml+xml; text/cache-manifest; text/event-stream; application/microdata+json

[23:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how we register those

[23:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hey Hixie

[23:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
looks like http://www.w3.org/2002/06/registering-mediatype.html is how i do it

[23:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
hey othermaciej 

[23:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
do you think anyone in that HyBi group (or whatever it's called) is going to try to interfere with the WebSocket protocol?

[23:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(asking since it's under active implementation for both Chrome and Safari)

[23:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can almost guarantee that someone will try, yes

[23:40:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, do application/file too while you're at it. No idea if that'll fly though

[23:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's also under active implementation for gecko

[23:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: noted

[23:40:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm wondering how solid the commitment to "rough consensus and running code" will be

[23:40:06.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, might be worth posting to the HTMLWG about that one. Seems to be more people there with opinion on mimetypes

[23:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe should make sure interested implementors are on the committe

[23:41:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, not sure if dataTransfer.types really qualify as mimetypes though

[23:42:00.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, btw, our plan is to land it preffed off for now I think

[23:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: did you see the recent stuff about BWTP?

[23:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I saw a big flood of email, but I could not tell what it was or if I needed to care about it

[23:42:03.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, in order to gather feedback but still be prepared to change implementation in case spec changes

[23:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: there was a recent e-mail (today i think) asking for review of BWTP

[23:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: my opinion is that BWTP is orders of magnitude more complex than we're looking for

[23:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: but obviously if the browser vendors prefer it to the websocket approach, i'd be happy to just drop websockets in favour of BWTP

[23:44:00.0000] <sicking>
does it do multiplexit? It's the main feature i'm lacking from websocket

[23:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[23:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://bwtp.wikidot.com/main:rational

[23:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
http://bwtp.wikidot.com/main:proposal

[23:44:04.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: we'll probably turn it on for testing on WebKit trunk, but I will suggest that maybe we should avoid anyone shipping it in production until the standards story is settled

[23:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i have no idea how it is proposed that BWTP work at the API level)

[23:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(though I think Safari and Chrome can still get away with shipping stuff without locking it in beyond changing, this API has little value til there is vendor consensus)

[23:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I did just see the review request on whatwg@

[23:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I guess now would be a really good time to review it since the WebKit implementation is at a fairly early stage, but we've prototyped enough to have a picture of how the WebSocket protocol would work and what the likely issues are

[23:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I also really need to give File API a close reading now that Arun has posted the new draft he suggested I should wait for

[23:46:02.0000] <sicking>
actually, my main-main concern is getting through proxies

[23:46:03.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: WebSocket's proxy story is fine, afaict

[23:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: you just use CONNECT, and that works even on port 80

[23:47:01.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, apparently many proxies block CONNECT to non-443 ports

[23:47:02.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, squid being one of them

[23:47:03.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: Darin Fisher claimed otherwise to me

[23:47:04.0000] <roc>
I was told that by default Apache proxies block connect to ports other than 443

[23:47:05.0000] <othermaciej>
or rather, that he deployed a product depending on this (Google Web Accelerator) and it was not an issue in practice

[23:47:06.0000] <othermaciej>
but I have not done anything to verify for myself

[23:48:00.0000] <roc>
Darin Fisher deployed Google Web Accelerator?

[23:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
well, he works for Google

[23:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and that's what he worked on before Chrome

[23:48:03.0000] <othermaciej>
is what I mean

[23:48:04.0000] <roc>
urm

[23:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
there's not much you can do other than fall back to encrypted WebSocket over TLS if there's a proxy futzing with the connection or blocking anything but port 443

[23:48:06.0000] <othermaciej>
and I don't even know if it was him personally

[23:49:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, technically you can probably do non-SSL to 443 as well

[23:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: yeah, indeed

[23:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway - I'm not sure if there is a good answer for non-443 if CONNECT won't fly

[23:49:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, but we might want to consider defaulting to 443 if this really is a problem

[23:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
in what sense?

[23:50:00.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, indeed. Only thing i can think of is to default to port 443

[23:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
surely you just use whatever port the author says to use

[23:50:02.0000] <sicking>
sure, but use 443 if no port was specified

[23:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
non-SSL over 443 seems like a plausible way to avoid the problem for the non-SSL case I guess

[23:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
instead of 815?

[23:50:05.0000] <sicking>
right

[23:50:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I bet the IETF would have a cow over that

[23:50:07.0000] <Hixie>
the ietf would -- yeah exactly

[23:50:08.0000] <sicking>
yup :)

[23:50:09.0000] <sicking>
we can do it on an API level maybe :)

[23:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think it's a problem to have authors just throw :443 in there initially

[23:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
on the long run proxies will adapt

[23:51:02.0000] <roc>
personally I think it's ok to depend on TLS

[23:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
(very long run)

[23:51:04.0000] <roc>
I dunno, it looks like we'll *never* get HTTP pipelining to work

[23:51:05.0000] <sicking>
/me would love to put more pressure on crappy proxies. To solve pipelineing as well

[23:51:06.0000] <othermaciej>
roc, sicking: I guess I should ask Darin F to give more details as to why he thought CONNECT over port 80 is fine, and how he reconciles that with the squid and apache default config

[23:52:00.0000] <sicking>
roc, fennec ships with pipelineing turned on by default

[23:52:01.0000] <roc>
/me whistles

[23:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's easier to get away with pipelining on mobile

[23:52:03.0000] <roc>
I guess that's a positive move, not because it proves pipelining works, but because it puts pressure on the proxy world

[23:53:00.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, it'd be great to hear what darin has to say. cc me and jduell⊙mc, and roc if he wants to

[23:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because carrier proxies are more reliably (and testably!) sane than random intranet proxies

[23:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
cc me, too, if you send mail about websocket

[23:53:03.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, and wfernandom2004⊙gc since he's the one writing our impl

[23:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll Cc if I end up asking by email, or email results if I end up asking more directly

[23:54:01.0000] <sicking>
sounds great

[23:54:02.0000] <sicking>
roc, exactly

[23:54:03.0000] <sicking>
roc, apparently Operas approach is to simply try it, and when it fails re-do the GET

[23:54:04.0000] <roc>
I thought the problem was that we couldn't detect failure reliably

[23:55:00.0000] <sicking>
roc, which sounds to me like it's not *that* common that it fails given how bad re-doing GET could be

[23:55:01.0000] <roc>
gotta run

[00:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: relying on namespace-unaware APIs pretty much means it's less likely that browser engine developers would bother supporting RDFa natively, since it would need RDFa-specific hacks on thee c`++ side

[00:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
seems like a bad idea to desin language features that are known to be unfriendly to browser-internal interfaces

[00:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I'm sure as heck not going to try to implement native RDFa using namespace-unaware DOM APIs in C++...

[00:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
otoh there is not much demand right now for browser-native RDFa implementation in general

[00:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it looks a fair bit more complicated than WebSocket - hard to tell which of the extra fluff is genuinely beneficial

[00:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
seems like nearly all of it could be done at the application level with WS, it is not clear how many of the features give serious benefit from native support in the protocol

[00:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie, sicking: just one HTML5 EOF needed. but the emptying of the parser's internal buffer doesn't automatically mean EOF

[00:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think making script execution block on network sucks horribly compared to what I suggested about deferring EOF emission based on pending scripts

[00:33:01.0000] <sicking>
hsivonen, if we go with the gecko solution, you still need to send something through the tokenizer in order to get it to end the current token though, right?

[00:33:02.0000] <sicking>
hsivonen, i think a better solution is to remove support for defer on inline scripts though

[00:34:00.0000] <sicking>
hsivonen, if we do that then document.write might not be a problem any more

[00:34:01.0000] <sicking>
hsivonen, given how weirdly document.write in deferred external scripts work in IE

[00:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sicking: if there's a partial tag token, it gets killed anyway, but getting deferred EOF right when the off-the-main-thread tokenizer has a partial comment pending would suck

[00:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah, removing defer on inline scripts makes sense

[00:37:02.0000] <sicking>
i might be able to get that landed tomorrow

[00:38:00.0000] <sicking>
if so we'd be able to get feedback on this in the 3.6 cycle

[00:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
great

[00:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I certainly don't want the tokenizer to process EOF more than once. I want to have the decision to push the EOF to the tokenizer in the IO driver

[00:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: that doesn't exist in the spec but that is highly useful

[01:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-wg/1997JulSep/0387.html

[01:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, 1997-09-12 seems to be the date that summary first appeared in an HTML4 editor's draft. http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Group/9709/WD-html40-970912/struct/tables.html#h-12.1.1

[01:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-wg/1997JulSep/0675.html

[01:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
but there appears to have been absolutely no public discussion of it

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: application/file is wrong, but i think we can probably just make the type be "files" or something like that (without a slash)

[02:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I was able to find no discussion at all.

[02:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
I couldn't either

[02:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
which leaves 3 options: unminuted voice discussion, discussion on a WAI list that I didn't search or an editor putting it in without discussion

[02:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, considering how little it was discussed on the record, the current attachment to it is rather disproportionate

[02:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
of course, it's possible that the greatest hits get created by accident :-)

[02:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm sure it isn't the first time a feature was added to HTML4 without any discussion

[02:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: seen https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=508075 ?

[02:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have now

[02:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: any opinion?

[02:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/199

[02:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
we're not doing reparsing.

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: hmm. indeed, that case suggests that WebKit reparses

[02:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
wtf does "interoperability considerations" mean in a mime type registration

[02:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
should i put "implementors are encouraged to implement the damn spec exactly as written"?

[02:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hehe

[02:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
surely there's an RFC defining the procedure?

[02:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
that would be http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4288.txt

[02:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
please point to the section of that RFC that defines wtf "interoperability considerations" are

[02:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why was the Storage interface changed to accept structured data instead of just DOMStrings?

[02:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: to allow File objects to be stored

[02:26:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: See in 4.5

[02:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: what does that section mean?

[02:27:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: I guess problems with interoperability with the specification of current implementations?

[02:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have to list all the bugs?

[02:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: 4.5 implies the considerations are a list of known bugs

[02:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
if so, i think i can push out last call another year or two

[02:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
i could just link to the bugzillas

[02:27:05.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, do you mean these objects? http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/FileUpload/publish/FileAPI.html

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Just link to bugzilla

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yes

[02:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
s

t?

[02:29:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5577.txt is one of teh latest RFCs to be published with a media type registration

[02:30:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Which does nothing like what was said above

[02:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
good times

[02:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd like to point out that the MIME type registration procedures still haven't caught up with apple's UTI work

[02:35:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
UTI?

[02:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504941 is alarming and sad

[02:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yup

[02:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: unsurprising, though

[02:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder whose idea it was to add support for that case to IE or Netscape in the first place...

[02:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not that it matters anymore

[02:37:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I guess it's more likely Netscape or Mosaic

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe I should go read the Netscape 5 HTML parser some time

[02:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I expect it to be rather ad hoc

[02:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does Acid3 exist as individual test cases?

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what was the trick for seeing the Acid3 error console?

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
click the A

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
or shift click or something

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me blinks at the idea of writing a "security considerations" section for text/html

[02:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. acid3 test #71 fails for an interesting reason: Test 71 failed: doc.open is not a function

[02:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: thanks. Is there a .zip for easily testing and editing Acid3 locally?

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
try acid3.acidtests.org/acid3-2009-06-19.tar.gz

[02:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: thanks

[02:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. AFP doesn't pass Acid3

[02:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
tar: support-a.png.404: Cannot hard link to `support-c.png': Operation not supported

[02:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
AFP?

[02:52:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Apple Filing Protocol

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[02:54:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Why are some of your old adhoc tests so evil? :P

[02:54:01.0000] <MadAtWork>
I'd say: "It's a dirty job but someone has to do it"

[03:14:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: What version of OS X/AFP? Hard links are supported with Leopard as client and server, AFAIK

[03:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#iana-considerations

[03:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: Leopard client. ReadyNAS server.

[03:27:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: I guess no server support, and I guess it uses something based on Netatalk, which doesn't support it

[03:27:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Hardlinks are the reason TM requires a Leopard server for AFP)

[03:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why does it show the status annotation box for "#the-marquee-element-0" in the margin when I'm looking at #iana-considerations?

[03:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wanted to use NFS, but the NFS mounts on Leopard die often and randomly

[03:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: "Cache manifests begin with the US-ASCII string ..." - no they don't, they begin with a UTF-8 string

[03:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what does Change Controller mean?

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: looks good

[03:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
when a W3C document supercedes an RFC for registration, how does this appear on tools.ietf.org?

[03:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Do you also need to submit a short RFC that points to the W3C doc?

[03:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me isn't aware of the details of the IETF—W3C collaboration arrangement

[03:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: "CACHE MANIFEST" is a US-ASCII string

[03:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: no idea about the answers to your questions

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, i've filled in the remaining MIME type registration sections

[03:42:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
Hixie: will the october deadline be met

[03:42:01.0000] <MadAtWork>
?

[03:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
by whom?

[03:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It seems unnecessarily confusing to talk about substrings in one character encoding in a document with a different character encoding

[03:43:02.0000] <MadAtWork>
You I guess.

[03:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
i am on track to get the spec ready for last call by october, yes.

[03:44:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
Sweet.

[03:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: fixed

[03:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone (annevk2?) want to volunteer to register all the IANA encoding synonyms we've learnt about?

[03:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm worried that i'll burn out if i have to push through any more of these registrations

[03:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm already up to 9

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
(someone volunteer while i'm sleeping!)

[07:41:00.0000] <mwic>
hey guys, i'm playing  w/HTML 5 and my video tag works great on localhost, but on my (A2Hosting) public host it prompts download... where do I start?

[07:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mwic: check your server's mime type config for .ogg, .ogv and .oga

[07:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
should be application/ogg, video/ogg and audio/ogg

[07:46:00.0000] <mwic>
well, this is a budget host; is that something i could likely edit in .htaccess? Or should i use a different (dedicated) machine for this?

[07:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mwic: .htaccess should be enough

[07:47:01.0000] <rubys>
look here for examples of AddType: http://search.cpan.org/~lds/Apache-MP3-4.00/MP3.pm

[07:48:00.0000] <rubys>
(use the mime types hsivonen suggested instead though)

[07:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
AddType application/ogg ogg

[07:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AddType video/ogg ogv

[07:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
AddType audio/ogg oga

[07:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
esp. when XiphQT still output .ogg instead of .ogv

[07:50:02.0000] <rubys>
/me notes that Apple isn't a fan of ogg  <ducks/>

[07:52:00.0000] <annevk2>
rubys, they're looking into it it seems

[07:52:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, maybe when I feel better :/

[07:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
what container and audio does Flash accept for VP6 video?

[07:52:03.0000] <rubys>
you have new news on this?  That would be most excellent!

[07:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
rubys, did you see the emails from Maciej to the theora list?

[07:53:01.0000] <annevk2>
that's what I meant

[07:53:02.0000] <rubys>
no

[07:53:03.0000] <rubys>
url?

[07:53:04.0000] <annevk2>

I'm also intrigued by http://www.betanews.com/article/Future-of-open-Web-video-may-change-with-Google-acquisition-of-On2/1249481107

[07:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
flv and MP3?

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
rubys, I think everyone is, too bad there will be no details until Q4

[07:56:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me goes back to doing nothing

[07:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me can think of 3 reasons for Google acquiring On2

[07:57:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me was asked whether annevk2 was around at the moment

[07:57:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
earlier

[07:57:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me guesses the answer is yes, then :P

[07:57:04.0000] <mwic>
:( hsivonen i added those lines and no improvement

[07:58:00.0000] <rubys>
is the url on your host public?

[07:58:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
"if the first letter is in fact a digit" — surely that never applies, as it isn't the first letter if it's a digit!

[07:59:00.0000] <rubys>
/me points at the topic

[07:59:01.0000] <mwic>
rubys, if you mean me yes, and as it turns out the public one works

[08:00:00.0000] <mwic>
http://thislandok.twoclick.org/

[08:00:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
rubys: CSS doesn't claim to be illogical though

[08:01:00.0000] <mwic>
i was using a /etc/hosts entry to access the same site, and it still fails there.. wonder why

[08:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
mwic: works for me in Minefield

[08:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
mwic: maybe you fixed the problem but have the old versions cached

[08:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mwic: updating the mime types doesn't properly update cache controls in apache

[08:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, if the resources are cacheable and you change the server config, apache behaves as if the resources didn't change

[08:02:02.0000] <mwic>
hm

[08:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
s/resources/resource representations/

[08:04:00.0000] <mwic>
yep, looks like cached junk.. accessing on a different machine worked great

[08:04:01.0000] <mwic>

[10:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Old news :-p

[10:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's only a day old, and I didn't notice it yesterday

[10:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.khronos.org/news/press/releases/khronos-webgl-initiative-hardware-accelerated-3d-graphics-internet/ - three days

[10:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
did you really know about it 3 days ago though?

[10:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[10:30:01.0000] <MadAtWork>
Prove it.

[10:30:02.0000] <MadAtWork>
(Sorry, couldn't resist a pathos dense situation)

[10:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
MadAtWork, what is a pathos dense situation?

[10:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Actually four - http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090803#l-872

[10:50:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
One with a large amount of pathos in a small space?

[10:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
It could equally well be a small amount of pathos in a tiny space

[10:51:00.0000] <MadAtWork>
Yes. Or a gargantuan amount of pathos in a very large space.

[11:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
This one made me smile: "The big difference is that for the web you only have 2 strings while TCP/IP has an infinite number of 16 bit integers."

[12:47:00.0000] <ezyang>
I think something's fishy with the infinite loop fix. 

[12:48:00.0000] <ezyang>
Namely, "in select" insertion mode, "If the stack of open elements does not have an element in table scope with the same tag name as the token, ignore the token." 

[12:48:01.0000] <ezyang>
Shouldn't that be checking for a "select" in table context? 

[12:49:00.0000] <ezyang>
Actually, I'm not sure what to think 

[12:49:01.0000] <ezyang>
At the very least, <input> is an input element, so it should never be "in scope" 

[12:51:00.0000] <ezyang>
s/input element/empty element/ 

[12:53:00.0000] <ezyang>
Also, I generally see the "If the stack of open elements does not have an element in table scope with the same tag name as the token" talisman when a close tag is encountered... 

[13:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
ezyang: yeah gsnedders|work already sent a mail saying it was buggy

[13:15:01.0000] <ezyang>
savvy 

[13:15:02.0000] <ezyang>
I think the fix might be just to replace "current token" with "select" 

[13:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll look at it when i get to his e-mail

[13:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
probably a week or so

[13:16:02.0000] <ezyang>
:-) 

[13:19:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: yt?

[13:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[13:19:02.0000] <virtuelv>
I've got a question re http://www.hixie.ch/tests/evil/mixed/lineheight3.html

[13:20:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the first test pattern actually has grey lines between glyphs in all browsers I've tested in

[13:20:01.0000] <virtuelv>
is the correct rendering dependent on having anti-aliasing disabled, or are these genuine bugs?

[13:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's a very minor bug with the antialiasing code

[13:22:00.0000] <virtuelv>
how?

[13:22:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(Enforcing anti-aliasing to happenn in some specific way, on a subpixel level is dangerous, patent-wise, fwiw)

[13:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
how what?

[13:23:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm wondering how one can consider different anti-aliasing in different implementations to be a bug

[13:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's not what i'm considering a bug

[13:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
the bug is that if you have two exactly square glyphs exactly aligned horizontally and vertically with no space between them, you shouldn't see a seam

[13:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
that you don't see a seam horizontally but do see a seam vertically is a bug

[13:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
a very minor one

[13:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
but a bug nonetheless

[13:25:00.0000] <virtuelv>
ah

[13:25:01.0000] <virtuelv>
either way, when viewing the actual tests, browsers have far worse problems, I see

[13:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[13:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno how accurate that test is anymore

[13:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wasn't expecting to see errors

[13:31:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Yeah. I was just loading some random page to check if Ahem had been correctly installed

[13:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
o_O at larry's e-mail

[14:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly you're discriminating against people who don't have an email address

[14:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually those are discriminated against because of my policy of only being willing to pay for working group members

[14:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
what the hell? Would anyone seriously Hixie to be so unapproachable that sending him a private mail is simply out of the question?

Print a copy of the spec, highlight all the errors in red pen, then mail it to Hixie

[14:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's probably what microsoft'll do

[14:35:00.0000] <syp_>
Hixie: hi, does the spec mentions if classList should work on non-HTML nodes?

[15:23:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Say I wanted to hack full support for, say, <input type=date> into a page via js.  A non-supporting browser treats that to <input type=text>.  Is there any way for me to stop this, or at least recognize that it was originally type=date?

[15:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, looks like Microsoft did choose to send e-mail instead of snail mail after all. :-)

[15:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Xanthir: Use getAttribute('type') to access the original DOM attribute value, perhaps?

[15:28:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Hmm, lemme try that.  (Sorry, I pretty much avoided JS before jQuery, and so am mostly clueless when it comes to actually using the DOM APIs as written.)

[15:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
DOM--

[15:31:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Ooh, yes, that works well.

[15:32:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Now, next question.  I know getters and setters are part of some level of ecma.  Are they usable in any browser?

[15:33:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Nm - Resig answers this for me.

[15:33:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Answer: all latest browsers except IE.

[15:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
IE8 supports them

[15:35:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Excellent.  That blog post was a bit old.

[15:35:01.0000] <Xanthir>
That means I can write in proper support for the new inputs.

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
syp_: it's only defined on HTML nodes; what happens on non-HTML nodes isn't in HTML's purview

[15:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
Xanthir: A script that implements HTML5 feature support in old non-supporting browsers would probably be much more useful if it supported IEs older than IE8

[15:37:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Oh, indeed, but I can write a lesser form of support for those.  Without setters I simply can't implement the html5 spec properly.

[15:37:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Also: this is for fun.  There's already a webforms2 library around, though I have no idea how good it is.

[15:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I suppose there's also the issue that even if everyone used IE8, a large majority of pages will be processed with the IE7 engine instead)

[15:40:00.0000] <Xanthir>
True, but if you're using html5 features, you're probably going to make sure your page is read as ie8 as well as you can.

[15:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess most people will be completely unaware of it, and will try using <input type=date> and a workaround script and it will fail and they'll have no idea why

[15:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
until someone tells them to change their doctype, and maybe unpress the compatibility button, and maybe remove themselves from the blacklist, and maybe fix their HTTP headers and meta elements

[15:42:01.0000] <Xanthir>
Well, it'll fail in that they can't play with the value properly.  It'll still produce a datepicker and submit properly.

[15:59:00.0000] <Xanthir>

2009-08-08
[17:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: also, "caller" needs to be specifiable with the other specials

[18:06:00.0000] <Samer>
word

[18:18:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, will do

[18:18:01.0000] <heycam>
i'll make it use the same overload resolution as regular operations

[18:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
sweet

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sending something about [Supplemental] also

[18:19:01.0000] <heycam>
ok, still haven't thought more about that

[18:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
html5 is now up to date as far as i can tell

[18:19:03.0000] <heycam>
ah ok cool

[18:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sure i made lots of mistakes :-)

[18:19:05.0000] <heycam>
it'd be good to extend dom's webidl checker to look for non-syntactic mistakes too

[18:21:00.0000] <heycam>
/me heads out to get some breakfast

[18:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: do you have an opinion on the issue about security for prototypes visible cross-origin?

[18:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: e.g. window.location's prototype is visible cross-origin, which might be a problem

[18:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
specifically regarding http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2009JulSep/0269.html

[18:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I saw your email, I was planning to ask abarth for advice

[18:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[18:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
let me know if i need to change anything

[18:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: abarth had a suggestion for how this should work on #webkit, which I agree is sound

[18:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(maybe he wants to suggest it himself though)

[18:59:02.0000] <abarth>
i can write it up in an email if you like

[18:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah if it could be in e-mail form that would be fantastic

[19:00:00.0000] <abarth>
ok, i should get cracking on my emails then

[19:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
short version is, expose the real value same-origin, make a new object per-window with the accessing window's appropriate prototype chain cross-origin

[19:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(doing this for location itself would probably handle its cross-origin-accessible function properties too, though the cross-origin version would need to expose only a limited set of properties)

[19:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
abarth: it might almost need to be a different interface when exposed cross-origin, now that I think about it

[19:01:01.0000] <abarth>
there are subtlies, like what happens if the same-origin guy changes the replace function

[19:02:00.0000] <abarth>
the cross-origin viewers want to see a prisine version

[19:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
right, you can't expose that cross-origin

[19:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
currently the spec disallows doing that (changing replace())

[19:02:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but making a fresh JS wrapper with a fresh prototype will cover that

[19:02:04.0000] <abarth>
in some sense, it could just be an entirely different object

[19:02:05.0000] <Hixie>
but having a new object would neatly fix that, yes

[19:02:06.0000] <abarth>
at the c++ layer

[19:02:07.0000] <Hixie>
how about Window?

[19:03:00.0000] <abarth>
window has a reference monitor

[19:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
wait, this won't work

[19:03:02.0000] <abarth>
so it doesn't really matter

[19:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
if two windows grab each others' Location objects

[19:03:04.0000] <abarth>
you can't see the properties added to he prototyp

[19:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
and then set document.domain so that they can talk

[19:03:06.0000] <Hixie>
their objects need to complare ===

[19:03:07.0000] <Hixie>
compare, even

[19:03:08.0000] <Hixie>
"reference monitor"?

[19:03:09.0000] <abarth>
i don't think that is very important

[19:03:10.0000] <abarth>
if they aren't ===

[19:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
window is an even more special case than widow's cross-origin-accessible properties

[19:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I agree with abarth, I doubt the === condition is relevant to web compat

[19:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
for .window I'm sure it is important that they be ===, so it has to be the same WindowProxy object

[19:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
and i don't really see how to do that safely

[19:04:04.0000] <othermaciej>
for window, yes

[19:04:05.0000] <Hixie>
anyway send mail

[19:04:06.0000] <Hixie>
i'll do whatever you say :-)

[19:04:07.0000] <Hixie>
assuming it works

[19:04:08.0000] <othermaciej>
the window object needs more complex behavior than Web IDL can really express

[19:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh we're well past Web IDL for indow

[19:05:01.0000] <abarth>
window.window and window.frames are just self loops

[19:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
Window

[19:05:03.0000] <abarth>
they don't need anything fancy done to them

[19:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: i meant for that object, not for the accessor

[19:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit has a handful of Window properties and attributes marked as DoNotCheckDomainSecurity

[19:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though maybe that would better be termed AllowCrossOriginAccess or something

[19:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the question isn't really about window but about what happens when you access those properties or methods of Window cross-origin

[19:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
the question seems to me to be the same for Window as for Location

[19:07:01.0000] <heycam>
/me is happy to leave security discussions to others

[19:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
window has no prototype chain, and has an object identity requirement for wrappers

[19:08:00.0000] <abarth>
window does have a prototype chain

[19:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so it's not quite the same

[19:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
no prototype chain?

[19:08:03.0000] <abarth>
if you add stuff to Object.prototype, they show up a properties of window

[19:08:04.0000] <othermaciej>
ok, right, it doesn't expose any properties that are on the prototype chain

[19:08:05.0000] <othermaciej>
the function properties are on Window itself and the prototype is not directly exposed cross-origin

[19:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i should specify that somewhere!

[19:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
please send an e-mail about that :-)

[19:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
god only knows how i'm gonna make that work with webidl

[19:09:03.0000] <abarth>
i bet you can make it work by using different objects

[19:09:04.0000] <abarth>
when viewing cross origin

[19:09:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Window?

[19:10:00.0000] <abarth>
i'm thinking about focus() right now

[19:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you'd have to hack === comparison probably, and switch object types when transferring it cross-origin

[19:10:02.0000] <abarth>
because it's the simplest case

[19:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(like you can vend window cross-origin and hand it back to something same-origin with the window itself and all methods still work)

[19:11:00.0000] <abarth>
window is super special

[19:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think this would be more complicated than the way it works now

[19:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it is

[19:11:03.0000] <abarth>
can we think about the focus function for a minute?

[19:11:04.0000] <othermaciej>
sure

[19:11:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I think same-origin accessors should see the real focus function

[19:11:06.0000] <abarth>
yes

[19:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
cross-origin accessors should see a fresh value made with the accessor's version of the Function prototype chain

[19:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think this might even be what WebKit already does

[19:12:02.0000] <abarth>
ok

[19:12:03.0000] <abarth>
and the object doesn't have a reference monitor

[19:12:04.0000] <abarth>
it's just a plain JS object

[19:12:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure what you mean by reference monitor

[19:12:06.0000] <abarth>
in webkit terms

[19:13:00.0000] <abarth>
someone overrides getProperty or whatever

[19:13:01.0000] <abarth>
and calls SecurityOrigin::canAccess

[19:13:02.0000] <abarth>
to make some decisions

[19:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think once you have the actual function object for window.focus, there are no more security checks involved when calling it or accessing its properties or prototype properties

[19:14:01.0000] <abarth>
window calls canAccess a lot

[19:14:02.0000] <abarth>
right

[19:14:03.0000] <abarth>
ok, that all makes sense to me

[19:14:04.0000] <abarth>
now, window.location

[19:14:05.0000] <abarth>
currently, in webkit, window.location is implemented like window in the sense that

[19:15:00.0000] <abarth>
getProperty calls canAccess

[19:15:01.0000] <abarth>
another way to think about what's going on

[19:15:02.0000] <abarth>
is that there's a different object that cross-origin viewers see

[19:15:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(I should also mention if you access window.focus cross-origin, you always get the original version, even if in the real window object it has been replaced)

[19:15:04.0000] <abarth>
that simply lacks the properties that canAccess woudl return false for

[19:16:00.0000] <abarth>
this account of window.location has two virtues:

[19:16:01.0000] <abarth>
1) it explains why you get the origin methods if they've been changed

[19:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
2) it's faster

[19:16:03.0000] <abarth>
2) the location object becomes less magical and more like a normal JS object

[19:16:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think actually implementing it that way could be easier to implement and might be reasonably secure

[19:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but then at the time you access window.location, you get a different kind of object depending on whether you are doing same-origin or cross-origin access

[19:17:01.0000] <abarth>
right

[19:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
in that case all the magic ends up on Window, which is fine by me, and I have to spec two Location objects, which I can live with

[19:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe Location will actually throw when trying to access properties cross-origin that you are not allowed to

[19:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
someone's gonna have to describe what all the magic on Window is, though

[19:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: correct

[19:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would expect this is incidental rather than required

[19:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i would just define it as two implementations of the same Location interface, fwiw

[19:19:00.0000] <abarth>
the location property of window is then something like a factory

[19:19:01.0000] <abarth>
in that it produces lots of objects

[19:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the cross-origin version would have to throw even when getting or setting unknown properties, to totally match current behavior

[19:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yes

[19:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but in principle, yes, there could be one interface that's general enough that either implementation would fulfill it

[19:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the alternative to multiple objects would be a single object that simply has different property access behavior depending on who's asking, like Window does

[19:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if it's possible to spec it to allow either implementation strategy, and if such a spec would enforce enough of the needed security constraints

[19:21:01.0000] <abarth>
if it throws for novel properties, you're probably ok

[19:22:00.0000] <abarth>
the main difference in observable behavior would be ===

[19:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the other difference would be if you transfer it cross-origin and somehow manage to transfer it back

[19:23:00.0000] <abarth>
there's also the issue of uber powerful viewers

[19:23:01.0000] <abarth>
like file URLs in webkit

[19:23:02.0000] <abarth>
who can see past your canAccess blocks

[19:24:00.0000] <abarth>
but they're completely insecure, so i'm not sure what we can do for them

[19:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that is true, though our file: URL handling is not needed for interoperability and in fact should probably be changed, at least by default when used in browsers

[19:24:02.0000] <abarth>
i'm pretty sure i added a setting for that :)

[19:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the current WebKit model amounts to treating file: as same-origin to everything whenever anyone asks, so in either model it would get the real Location object

[19:25:00.0000] <abarth>
right

[19:25:01.0000] <abarth>
but he could see what another page got if they grabbed the location object of a third page

[19:25:02.0000] <abarth>
or of the file page

[19:25:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that is true

[19:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's an observable difference in behavior depending on the spec model, even if it's very unlikely to matter in practice

[20:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me upgrades http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html a little

[20:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me wonders what the corresponding graph would look like for the HTML WG issue tracker

[20:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
i include the bugzilla count now, but you can't see it cos i've only got one number so far

[00:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, is the buzilla count that small purple dot at the bottom right corner?

[00:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, would be useful if you replaced that long description following the table with a simple key that illustrates each type of line and assigns a label

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: navy, not purple, but yes

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
and yeah, i should probably add a key

[01:04:00.0000] <annevk42>
DOMSettableTokenList no longer stringifies due to the Web IDL change

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh?

[01:14:01.0000] <annevk42>
you removed Stringifies but did not add stringifier before value

[01:14:02.0000] <annevk42>
afaics

[01:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's inherited

[01:14:04.0000] <annevk42>
aah

abarth++ -- http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-abarth-cookie

[01:19:00.0000] <annevk42>
abarth, having said that, shouldn't you aim to obsolete all existing cookie specs and also define cookie2 and set-cookie2 in the same document?

[01:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
can't we just drop cookie2?

[01:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
who uses it?

[01:34:00.0000] <annevk42>
that's cool too

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk42: i added legends http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html

[01:41:00.0000] <annevk42>
not sure I was the one who asked, or are you telling me because it does not work in Opera?!!!11!

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh, sorry, it was lachy

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk42>
;)

[01:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
lachy: i added legends http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html

[01:42:02.0000] <annevk42>
nice trend

[01:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
october baby

[01:51:00.0000] <annevk42>
cool, feedback from Microsoft

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
is it good feedback? i haven't had a chance to read it yet

[02:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/08/07/2013243 "Several sources are reporting that while native audio/video support has been dropped from the HTML 5 spec ..."

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, it seems valid to me

[02:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[02:09:00.0000] <annevk42>
geopriv wtf

[02:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it looks like they are not big fans of a lot of the new elements

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: yt?

[02:14:00.0000] <annevk42>
othermaciej, it seems they're mostly critical of those where the benefit/use case is not clear

[02:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I suppose they probably just skipped mentioning the ones they do like

[02:16:00.0000] <annevk42>
http://www.w3.org/mid/8B62A039C620904E92F1233570534C9B0118D8250546⊙ncac -- are we supposed to take this serious?

[02:17:00.0000] <annevk42>
othermaciej, like <video>? o_O

[02:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk42: I am guessing their review is not nearly done yet

[02:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the sectioning elements seem to have low potential benefit but are also trivial in terms of implementation effort

[02:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems like the main likely effect is to make blog markup look a little prettier, with less <div> soup

[02:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess they are only really good if one is against <div> soup

[02:18:01.0000] <annevk42>
yeah, though most blogs need something like <main> or <content> which is lacking

[02:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
<time> solves a very specific problem with microformats

[02:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk42: good point - I guess arguably everything not in <header>, <footer>, <nav> or <aside> is the main content

[02:19:00.0000] <annevk42>
(and there is a plan to specify access details for the sectioning elements I believe once other things are in order; mapping to AT and such)

[02:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
progress/meter seem useful but they need both default native look and defined custom css styling for sites to use them IMO

[02:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
keygen I am not surprised they hate

[02:19:03.0000] <annevk42>
I wholeheartedly agree with MS that we need a styling story for menu/progress/meter

[02:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
because they are the one browser that has no real reason to do it

[02:20:00.0000] <annevk42>
hyatt completely dislikes the current menu design too, fwiw

[02:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
we have ended up making pretty much every single form control stylable in webkit because authors demand it

[02:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hyatt also doesn't like the current <datagrid> design

[02:20:03.0000] <annevk42>
it's commented out now ;)

[02:20:04.0000] <othermaciej>
we should probably cut it IMO

[02:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's an important feature but it's too late to completely redesign it

[02:21:01.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie cut it

[02:21:02.0000] <annevk42>
I really like the form control styling thing in WebKit btw

[02:21:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Firefox and IE have various degrees of form control stylability

[02:21:04.0000] <annevk42>
I'd be great if you could get css3-ui to be more clear on the details one day and introduce all the new pseudo-elements

[02:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but I like the way some of the details of ours work

[02:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
pseudo-elements seem like a good approach for styling compound controls that are more than one box

[02:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
a lot of div soup is simply because form controls have not been reliably and interoperably stylable

[02:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's dumb to need to pile up DIVs and JavaScript just to get a custom looking checkbox

[02:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and then to have to add ARIA so it can be accessible

[02:23:02.0000] <annevk42>
on top of that you need to learn about ARIA and not make mistakes

[02:23:03.0000] <annevk42>
right

[02:23:04.0000] <othermaciej>
basically reimplementing all the functionality of a checkbox just to change the look

[02:23:05.0000] <annevk42>
I've been telling this to the PFWG since 2006

[02:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
interoperable form control styling seems to be an important thing to specify and I guess no one is really actively pursuing it

[02:24:01.0000] <annevk42>
well, not all the time, but I said it quite firmly back then in some meeting and after that a few more times until it became clear that ARIA was going to happen anyway because it landed in Firefox, etc.

[02:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think even if that was done, it wouldn't completely remove the need for ARIA

[02:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because of the transition period

[02:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
authors would probably be more prepared to accept broken accessibility in some/older browsers than broken appearance in older browsers

[02:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so it's probably easier to get people to use ARIA before it's 100% deployed in every browser

[02:26:01.0000] <annevk42>
yeah, fair enough

[02:26:02.0000] <annevk42>
that's been their argument too fwiw

[02:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's surprisingly pragmatic, you'd think they wouldn't be ok with doing stuff that breaks accessibility at all

[02:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but also I guess they have more competency in designing accessibility features than styling features

[02:29:00.0000] <annevk42>
on the one it was very pragmatic, on the other hand they're still working with some XHTML2 design at the time :)

[02:29:01.0000] <annevk42>
on the one hand*

[02:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk42: when I saw the message you linked, I was not sure if it was intended seriously or sarcastically, but I decided not to ask

[02:36:00.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, Gregg from Google is suggesting that XMLHttpRequest should take filedata URLs. I have a hard time deciding whether that is a good idea given how much functionality of XMLHttpRequest would not be used at all...

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's his use case?

[02:42:00.0000] <annevk42>
your system supports RTF documents; user selects RTF document one way or another; you get a URL out of that; with XHR you can have a single code path for loading the data

[02:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I don't see any legend on the graph, and now neither the thin teal line, green line or navy dot appear.

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: whatever browser you are using doesn't support fillText() -- upgrade to a newer browser

[02:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
Error: context.measureText is not a function, Source File: http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: whatever browser you are using doesn't support measureText() -- upgrade to a newer browser

[02:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's in Firefox 3.5

[02:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
it worked before without any problems

[02:46:03.0000] <Lachy>
oh, no, this machine still has 3.0 :-(

[02:46:04.0000] <Lachy>
I will upgrade.

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk42: seems like that use case would be handled by the File APIs and moving the layer of abstraction down one level, which doesn't seem unduly problematic

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i gotta sleep

[02:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[03:01:00.0000] <annevk42>
got to love this: http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/developers/archive/2009/08/05/version-checking-just-don-t-do-it.aspx

[03:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
heh

[03:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
seems conceptually relevant to the versioning issue in the HTMLWG

[07:44:00.0000] <annevk42>
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/54567

[09:54:00.0000] <abarth>
annevk42: if you're interested in the cookie stuff, you should join the mailing list and comment on the charter

[09:54:01.0000] <abarth>
annevk42: in general, i'm trying to keep the focus narrow

[09:55:00.0000] <abarth>
annevk42: speccing cookie2 is going to take a lot more work and a lot more time than speccing cookie0

[10:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
abarth, if you're going to spec cookies as implemented set-cookie2 is relevant, no?

[10:10:01.0000] <abarth>
annevk2: depends how widely its used

[10:10:02.0000] <abarth>
there was a recent message to the list

[10:11:00.0000] <abarth>
that suggested very few sites use it

[10:11:01.0000] <abarth>
i'm not sure we want to lock down the behavior of cookie2

[10:11:02.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, if we could actually get impl to remove support for it that'd be cool

[10:11:03.0000] <abarth>
which user agents implement it?

[10:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
I thougt set-cookie2, not cookie2, was implemented, but maybe not

[10:12:01.0000] <abarth>
i know they're in opera

[10:12:02.0000] <abarth>
but i'm not sure where else

[10:12:03.0000] <annevk2>
interesting

[10:14:00.0000] <annevk2>
if we're the only ones by all means don't spec it or simply say it's obsolete

[10:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
if we need extensions we can prolly extend cookie0 somehow once the processing model is written down

[10:15:01.0000] <abarth>
i don't think we want to say it's obsolete.  cookie suck in a number of ways.  it would be good to have a long term plan for how to dig ourselves out of the mess

[10:15:02.0000] <abarth>
yeah, that's a good point

[10:15:03.0000] <abarth>
that's what 2109 originally tried to do with Version=1

[10:16:00.0000] <abarth>
but i think they put the cart a bit in front of the horse

[10:16:01.0000] <annevk2>
besides rough consensus you need running code :p

[10:16:02.0000] <annevk2>
(also, versioning sucks :))

[10:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
Wow! I guess Microsoft finally providing feedback about HTML5 was bigger news than I thought. http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/08/08/1231231/Microsoft-Finally-Joins-HTML-5-Standard-Efforts?from=rss

[11:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I know! Microsoft doing what they said they would! It's unbelievable!

[11:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
I see that /. is still up to their high standards

[11:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, are people wondering how much set-cookie2 is used?

[11:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees it in the headers of loads of pages, particularly JSP ones

[13:59:00.0000] <annevk2>
twitter still under attack?

[13:59:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
so now is the time to try to delay last call

[13:59:02.0000] <annevk2>
neh, that'd be around the end of September

[14:00:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
although i agree with the contenteditable feedback

[14:01:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ah, so they're being generous and being one month early instead of two years as they first promised

[14:03:00.0000] <annevk2>
I'm happy they're sending something

[14:03:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
me too

[14:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i hope they continue to send feedback

[14:05:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me will be offline next week btw

[14:06:00.0000] <annevk2>
I particularly like that the feedback is constructive

[14:06:01.0000] <annevk2>
short vacation?

[14:06:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes

[14:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
nice

[14:07:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me will be working from somewhere in France next week

[14:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me laughs

[14:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Of course, being in the same room as zcorpan, this was the first I heard of this vacation :P

[14:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(same room at work, that is)


2009-08-09
[03:31:00.0000] <cyclist>
so basically in, <h1>foo<h2>bar</h2>

[03:32:00.0000] <cyclist>
the <h2> closes the <h1>

[03:32:01.0000] <cyclist>
can't say this is clear from the specification

[03:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
A start tag whose tag name is one of: "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6"

[03:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
If the current node is an element whose tag name is one of "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", or "h6", then this is a parse error; pop the current node off the stack of open elements.

[03:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not explicitly mentioned in the author parts because it's invalid. You can't put a heading inside another heading

[03:36:01.0000] <cyclist>
ahh. ok. so <h1><b>foo<h2>bar</h2>

[03:37:00.0000] <cyclist>
also closes the <h1> although the current node is <b>?

[03:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
No

[03:39:01.0000] <cyclist>
the current node is not <b> or the <h1> isn't closed?

[03:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
is the current node is <b>

[03:40:01.0000] <cyclist>
So, anyway, maybe it would be better to say "emit close tag" instead of "parse error"

[03:41:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, you're not reading correctly

[03:41:01.0000] <cyclist>
yes sorry

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
"pop the current node off the ..." is the bit where the element is "closed"

[03:42:01.0000] <annevk2>
"parse error" is just an indication to validator implementors that they need to show an error if that condition is hit

[03:43:00.0000] <cyclist>
ok. thanx

[03:43:01.0000] <annevk2>
if reading gets too boring, you can always toy around with http://livedom.validator.nu/

[03:43:02.0000] <annevk2>
it should be pretty close to perfect

[03:45:00.0000] <cyclist>
yes, but a fact is that a vast part of the web cannot be forced to fix their pages

[03:45:01.0000] <cyclist>
(because mozilla and IE accepted weird sh*t that confuses bots)

[03:45:02.0000] <Dashiva>
They don't have to fix them

[03:46:00.0000] <cyclist>
so , as a web browser author, i have to support all weird crap

[03:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's what the spec is for, yes

[03:46:02.0000] <cyclist>
"will be for" when complete :)

[03:46:03.0000] <cyclist>
hope this happens soon

[03:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The parsing section has been basically done for ages

[03:47:01.0000] <annevk2>
I don't quite understand why you give me a reply like that...

[03:47:02.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Yeah, if you enjoy infinite loops :P

[03:47:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Really what needs to happen with the parsing section is to get impl. experience of it to see how it works on a large scale of websites

[03:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Hey, that was only innerHTML :P

[03:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me heads off to buy bread and other basic food stuff so he can live to fight another day

[03:51:00.0000] <cyclist>
The thing is that if there is an error in a page, mozilla wouldn't bail out. It will always try to do something "intelligent"

[03:51:01.0000] <cyclist>
So documenting all those undefined intelligences is a bit impossible

[03:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
<insert hixie's sig here>

[03:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
cyclist: Why is it impossible?

[03:52:02.0000] <cyclist>
So, i'm saying that there may always be pages in the www for which mozilla does something that isn't in the spec

[03:52:03.0000] <gsnedders>
cyclist: If it can be implemented, it can be spec'd.

[03:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The spec defines parsing for _any_ character stream.

[03:53:01.0000] <cyclist>
by reverse engineering mozilla, yes.

[03:53:02.0000] <annevk2>
cyclist, dude, that's what the spec does...

[03:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If there are pages that break with the spec algorithm but not with existing web browser, there is a bug in the spec.

[03:54:01.0000] <cyclist>
excellent news!

[03:54:02.0000] <annevk2>
cyclist, it says "parse error" but then it continues telling you what to do

[03:54:03.0000] <annevk2>
cyclist, as I said, the "parse error" thing is for validator implementors

[03:54:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, any impl can fail on a parse error. I doubt any will, though.

[03:55:00.0000] <annevk2>
cyclist, did you even play with the sandbox in the link I provided?

[03:55:01.0000] <cyclist>
i can't (not capable web browser)

[04:00:00.0000] <cyclist>
OK, for example: <body><!-- comment > this is visible </body>

[04:04:00.0000] <cyclist>
And in: <h1><b>foo<h2>bar</h2>xxx

[04:04:01.0000] <cyclist>
the <h2> closes the <h1> but not the <b>

[04:26:00.0000] <annevk42>
cyclist, actually, that depends on the impl

[04:27:00.0000] <cyclist>
that's the official position of the spec?

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk42>
/me shrugs

[04:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
cyclist: No, the spec has a single behavior. But some browsers don't use the same algorithm yet.

[04:42:00.0000] <cyclist>
so the goal is that the browsers will implement the spec, or that the spec will reverse engineer mozilla?

[04:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The spec primarily describes cross-browser compatible behavior

[04:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If browsers disagree, the spec usually picks the IE behavior (if it is sane) or the most sane behavior available.

[04:47:00.0000] <cyclist>
so, when annevk2 before said "that depends on the impl", it means: not standarized yet

[04:52:00.0000] <cyclist>
and thus, is a bug report?

[04:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, e.g. firefox has an alternate parser under development

[04:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://blog.whatwg.org/test-html5-parsing

[04:54:01.0000] <cyclist>
but if it makes part of the web un-renderable, it will default to the other parser

[04:54:02.0000] <Dashiva>
No

[04:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Then the spec gets changed to support that part of the web

[04:55:01.0000] <cyclist>
ok

[05:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#the-before-head-insertion-mode

[05:00:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't see how the note about ending up in 'after head' is correct

[05:00:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If a head start tag is seen, you get put into 'in head', and it doesn't say anything about seeing a head end tag

[05:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If the note is correct, <!DOCTYPE html><title>Title</title><p></p> would give a parse error because title was outside head

[05:03:00.0000] <olliej_>
Dashiva: you would get a validation error -- the browser is unlikely to care too much and you will probably hit one of the error handling paths

[05:03:01.0000] <olliej_>
Dashiva: which i think are also defined

[05:03:02.0000] <olliej_>
Dashiva: but this isn't an area i'm intimately familiar with

[05:03:03.0000] <olliej_>
so i don't know the technical specifics of what would end up happening

[05:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It validates fine in the validator, though. Another reason I think the note is suspect.

[05:04:01.0000] <olliej_>
the validator is still in development

[05:05:00.0000] <olliej_>
so it's possibly a validator error not spec error -- the validator is ostensibly based on the spec

[05:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It should validate, taht

[05:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyhow, lunch time for me

[05:05:03.0000] <Dashiva>
olliej_: The note is informative, not normative.

[05:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm saying it conflicts with the normative spec text

[05:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Yeah, that note is bogus

[05:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
base, command, link, meta, title, noscript, noframes, style, script will only move to in head

[05:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wow. I'm surprised there weren't two hundred replies to feedback from MS.

[05:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: I take it you won't kill me if I send email about it?

[05:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
My name is already in the spec, so no harm done if you do :)

[05:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me wonders what the harm would be if it wasn't

[05:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: Hurting Dashiva's vanity.

[05:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me stops looking at the parser

[06:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Does it make your head hurt?

[11:24:00.0000] <tantek>
greetings, for those of you that edit/contribute to the WHATWG wiki, I want to encourage you to place your contributions in the public domain by adding  {{cc-public-domain-release}} to your User page. I done so myself: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/User:Tantek

[12:51:00.0000] <hober>
done.

[14:05:00.0000] <jgraham_>
/me reads the microsoft feedback

[14:05:01.0000] <jgraham_>
Not really worth waiting two years for

[14:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses he'll get around to reading it tomorrow

[14:06:00.0000] <hober>
jgraham_: indeed, it's pretty underwhelming

[14:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me also notes it isn't, contrary to popular belief, the first feedback they've sent

[14:07:01.0000] <jgraham_>
But at least they identified a guenuine area that he spec could improve accessibiliy (make it clearer that <nav> should be treated specially by AT) that everyone else missed because it wasn't already in HTML4

[14:07:02.0000] <jgraham_>
gsnedders: It is the first feedback that suggests a systematic review of the whole drat rather than just of specific sections

[14:08:00.0000] <jgraham_>
*draft

[14:12:00.0000] <jgraham_>
/me kind of wishes that hsivonen hadn't brought up "where did @summary come from" because it just reenforces the regressive approach to accessibility that has characterised much of the discussion in the HTML WG

[14:12:01.0000] <jgraham_>
Although there has been a litle progress recently

[14:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't fully understand what manu's draft is supposed to be

[14:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, i understand his real motivation (the warning in the microdata section saying that rdfa is an alternative)

[14:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
but what is the "warning" draft supposed to be? A comprehensive list of controversial topics in the spec?

[14:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
A TODO list for LC :)

[14:17:00.0000] <jgraham_>
I assume wihout evidence it is a list of sections that he personally disgrees with phrased in a way that makes it sound like others agree with his disagreement

[14:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i should make one of those

[14:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: you here?

[14:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: yes

[14:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: so, i'm thinking of doing references

[14:19:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't like the sound of this

[14:19:04.0000] <gsnedders>
This sounds like Hixie wanting me to do more stuff for him.

[14:19:05.0000] <jgraham_>
I thought the idea was that we all make one of those, it finally transpires that everything doesn't enjoy consensus according to at least one person and the whole effort collapses in a festering heap of politics

[14:20:00.0000] <jgraham_>
But I might just be particularly cynical right now :)

[14:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: could i convince you to make a patch to anolis that removes elements with IDs that are marked with a particular class if there are no <a href=""> elements in the document that point to that ID?

[14:20:02.0000] <jgraham_>
/me should do something useful like update his anolis

[14:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham_: well, if that happens, i guess the whatwg takes over again :-)

[14:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Recursively, or just the element itself?

[14:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: the element and any children

[14:21:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses just the element itself

[14:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, OK

[14:21:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham_: You assume I've updated anolis :P

[14:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh and the following element, i guess, since i haven't alloweded <di> yet

[14:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: basically, i have <a href="#refsXXX">[XXX]</a>s around, and I have <dt id="XXX"></dt><dd></dd>s, and I'd like the <dt><dd> pairs to go away if none of the href="#refs" refer to them

[14:22:01.0000] <jgraham_>
gsnedders: added 5 changesets with 13 changes to 9 files

[14:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: that way i can have just one source references section for all the specs, and it gets automatically trimmed for each spec

[14:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what's wrong with using the references system that we already have?

[14:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: it seem slike a relatively simple thing to do, i mean, i could do it in JS easily enough

[14:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: what's that?

[14:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: The one I haven't merged into anolis yet?

[14:23:04.0000] <Lachy>
the one that gsnedders already wrote, which works similarly to the one in the CSS spec gen

[14:23:05.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: does it allow me to micromanage the HTML for each reference?

[14:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
why do you need to micromanage like that?

[14:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Because he's an asshole :P

[14:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
because otherwise the markup isn't what i want

[14:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's the reason i stopped using the csswg one

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i had to write the references in some other format, and then pray it turned out right

[14:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
instead of just writing the references in the first place

[14:25:02.0000] <Lachy>
isn't that just a matter of setting up the template the way you want it, but still have them generated in the same way?

[14:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
not as far as I can tell

[14:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
anyway it's just easier to deal with markup than yet another format

[14:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: anyway, would that be something you think you could do relatively soon? It's fine if not, I can write it myself too, I just don't want us to duplicate efforts :-)

[14:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
woah, anolis changed

[14:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, so you want the functionality of the references generator, but instead of using the existing data file (I can't remember what that format is called), you want it to use an HTML based format

[14:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks left

[14:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks right

[14:29:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Changed?

[14:29:04.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders if gsnedders is crossing the street

[14:29:05.0000] <Hixie>
/me finds his two-line patch in the source turns into a 50,000 line patch in index because of jgraham_'s update :-)

[14:29:06.0000] <Philip`>
He forgot to look left again :-(

[14:30:00.0000] <jgraham_>
/me blames gsnedders

[14:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blames jgraham_ 

[14:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i don't want anything external, really

[14:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i'm happy with writing all the references myself

[14:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: What has changed?

[14:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[14:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: jgraham updated pms

[14:31:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Yes, but what did it change?

[14:31:04.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[14:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: my only problem is i don't want to have to figure out which spec generated from my one source doc references each reference

[14:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: have a look at the diff

[14:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What diff? Where?

[14:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sees no commit for three hours

[14:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh the diff was bigger than the maximum size of e-mails to commit-watchers

[14:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[14:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
svn diff -r 3569:3570 http://svn.whatwg.org/webapps/index

[14:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Not at http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker either

[14:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's the "typo" checkin on tracker

[14:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That's a small diff

[14:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[14:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it all whitespace changes?

[14:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
entities changed too

[14:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's html5lib issue, then, no?

[14:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It's not US-ASCII any more

[14:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm

[14:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Did you update html5lib too?

[14:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Did anyone recieve emails on public-html from me today?

[14:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: No

[14:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Just Anolis to tip?

[14:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yes

[14:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
huh.

[14:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I haven't changed anything relating to output stuff.

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.erc.gov.ph/new/m-aboutus.htm (look at the bottom)

[15:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hah

[15:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
IBM used to do that too http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/music/music_clips.html

[15:06:00.0000] <annevk2>
some African telco has a great rap song

[15:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: marketing? or internal?

[15:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
I can't find the link :/

[15:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
If I remember I'll ask some people at work about it

[15:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
gah i hate this conforming-with-warning crap

[15:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
i want to go back to non-conforming but downplayed

[15:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure conforming-with-warning is very good, but "downplayed error" never made sense to me

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's just errors that we don't make a fuss about

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
like using language="Javascript" on <script>

[15:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's mostly harmless

[15:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Dr Hickson. Again we see there is nothing you can spec that we cannot take away.

[15:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
As I see it, people will either try to get down to 0 conformance errors, or not care much

[15:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I doubt anyone will try to fix all other errors but be happy to leave the "downplayed" ones

[15:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so I don't think it achieves anything

[15:31:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I think in the end it doesn't really matter whether the validator gives a "warning" or a "downplayed error" or whatever we call it, as long as the message is there

[15:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if something is harmless, it shouldn't be an error because it will waste people's time to deal with it, if they have a goal of getting to 0 errors

[15:31:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so they can have the "conforming" badge that hsivonen doesn't want to give them

[15:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if we expect people to pick and choose errors to fix, then that's like admitting conformance is meaningless

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: there are errors that are only important in new documents, but that don't matter much if you're just updating an old doc

[15:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: those were the downplayed ones

[15:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm open to other solutions

[15:33:03.0000] <webben_>
that is basically transitional.

[15:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i don't like this conforming-with-warning crap for the same reason -- i think people will treat warnings as errors too

[15:33:05.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: yeah, though clearly that approach failed.

[15:33:06.0000] <othermaciej>
people can get the magical "conforming" badge without fixing all the errors

[15:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but even if that's the case, the problem is that "warning" is too strong, rather than too weak

[15:35:00.0000] <webben_>
How about "Tip"?

[15:35:01.0000] <webben_>
"Tip: Consider using caption with details instead of summary..." or whatever

[15:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
my bottom line is this: if a particular construct is not harmful and not likely to indicate an authoring mistake, then it seems silly to call it a conformance error

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: they are authoring mistakes, in that it is a waste of the author's time to be adding these features to new documents

[15:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so we do want to make them non-conforming in new documents

[15:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well it's also a waste of the author's time to write a / at the end of their <br> tags

[15:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: summary is an aberration in this discussion, in that it doesn't have the same reason for being in this category as the other things do

[15:36:04.0000] <othermaciej>
or to include an xmlns declaration in a text/html document

[15:36:05.0000] <othermaciej>
or to quote attributes that don't need to be quoted

[15:36:06.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yeah, but you need to allow those to enable polyglot documents, which some people want

[15:36:07.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: Well, the same could apply to language="JavaScript"

[15:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
In the specific case of @summary I regard it as a mistake to use the hidden-data solution when various superior alternatives are avaliable

[15:37:01.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: "Tip: You don't need to specify scripts are JavaScript!" etc.

[15:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and in some cases, quoting attributes is preferable

[15:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: summary is in a different category

[15:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: the language="" attribute is non-conforming except when it's redundant with type=""

[15:37:05.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: True enough

[15:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think "it's a waste of time" is a different category of problem than "this is harmful" or "if your document is like this, you probably did something wrong"

[15:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: the problem is with the language="" attribute, not that it is js

[15:38:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me will go to sleep rather than get involved with this :)

[15:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: because if you do it, and then get the error, and then need to remove it, even more of your time is wasted

[15:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: *shrug*

[15:38:05.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: Fine, but my point was more about how to cast the messaging than what the message is.

[15:38:06.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: well, that's up to the validator authors, i don't care what words they use exactly

[15:39:00.0000] <webben_>
I think offering authors tips might be more likely to educate them in the long run.

[15:39:01.0000] <webben_>
since I think authors distrust validators that warn them about things they don't care about

[15:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think tips really address the issue of wanting to be firm with authors of new pages and lax with authors of existing pages being updated

[15:40:00.0000] <webben_>
Hmm. I kind thought it did - tips are something you want authors to consider going forward, by you can ignore it if you're just validating your old stuff as HTML5.

[15:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"be firm" seems like the wrong framing to me, when the issue is practices that are useless but also harmless

[15:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, wasn't the only reason you changed from downplayed error to conforming but obsolete to deal with summary in a less objectional way, despite not actually having that effect?

[15:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yes

[15:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
so now that summary is effectively fully conforming, why can't we revert the other things to downplayed errors?

[15:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the old "downplayed errors" being errors was also foolish, but I never specifically asked Hixie to change them, and I don't think anyone was willing to lie down across the railroad tracks over it

[15:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't like downplayed errors much either, and would rather have them simpliy be non-conforming, but I prefer downplayed errors to the current crap in the spec

[15:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: well, that's the idea, but i think in practice authors will treat whatever the UA says as an error, and either aim for zero "tips", "warnings", "errors", whatever, regardless of whether it's a new doc or not, or ignore the tips for all classes of documents

[15:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: summary still triggers the warning

[15:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would frame the issue like this: withholding conformance is a "punishment", a "punishment" should be for something you did "wrong", for something useless but harmless, the right response is not "punishment" but "advice"

[15:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
so? Just make it a one-off exception dealt with in its own special way like it already is anyway, and make the rest non-conforming.

[15:43:02.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: I think if the UI doesn't clearly distinguish between errors and other things such that it destroys trust in error reporting, that's a big problem with the UI.

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: maybe

[15:44:01.0000] <webben_>
if it's impossible to create a UI that can't make that distinction clear, best to only report clear errors.

[15:44:02.0000] <webben_>
*that can make

[15:44:03.0000] <webben_>
(I think)

[15:44:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think validator.nu makes errors pretty clearly distinct from other kinds of messages

[15:44:05.0000] <othermaciej>
also makes it clear when you get to 0 errors

[15:45:00.0000] <webben_>
I don't think authors would confuse Tips with Errors.

[15:45:01.0000] <webben_>
(well unless you present them in red with warning symbols)

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough

[15:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"Tips" would be harder to mistake for something you absolutely need to fix than "Warnings"

[15:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
pink!

[15:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Everyone likes nice, pink, cuddly, Hello Kitty signs!

[15:47:03.0000] <webben_>
lulz :)

[15:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Sorry, I thought the discusion in here was getting far too serious.

[15:48:01.0000] <webben_>
I agree the current W3C validators have a definite Hello Kitty deficit. ;)

[15:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
clearly instead or "Warning" or "Error" it should be a "Hello Kitty Happy Fun Time Indicator"

[15:51:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Hello Kitty is a printer at my school

[15:51:01.0000] <jcranmer>
so a "Hello Kitty Happy Fun Time Indicator" means "nothing's printing so the print queue now consists of at least 30 entries"

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
pimpmyspec.net seems to have stopped working

[16:36:00.0000] <tantek>
that's a hilarious domain

[16:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, no, it works again

[16:43:00.0000] <csarven>
Which element would best present the allowed number of characters remaining for an input field?

[16:43:01.0000] <csarven>
s/present/represent

[16:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
no element

[16:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
just text

[16:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
possibly <small> if this is supposed to just be a minor piece of text

[16:43:05.0000] <csarven>
I'm thinking samp

[16:44:00.0000] <csarven>
It is minor indeed

[16:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
<samp> is for sample computer output, so it would be highly inappropriate unless you were writing an example of what it might look like

[16:45:00.0000] <csarven>
<E>140</E> would indicate that the textarea allows 140 chars

[16:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's wrong with just 140

[16:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
with no element

[16:45:03.0000] <csarven>
It would be updated dynamically with script

[16:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
then use <span>

[16:46:00.0000] <csarven>
Need to be able to target that for styling and updating the value

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
from what you've said, i'd use either <small> or <span>

[16:47:00.0000] <csarven>
Alright, span it is :)

[16:47:01.0000] <csarven>
Thanks

[16:47:02.0000] <ttepasse>
If it were usable, I'd think about <output>.

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
<output> is more for the result of calculations, but one could argue that it is the right element here, yeah

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually yeah, <output> might be the best answer

[16:49:01.0000] <csarven>
Didn't know <output> existed

[16:49:02.0000] <webben_>
/me wonders about maxlength + CSS generated content.

[16:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's not widely implemented yet

[16:49:04.0000] <csarven>
webben_ maxlength is more of a guideline in my case

[16:50:00.0000] <webben_>
/me would probably use span though ... possibly floated/positioned right out of a label

[16:50:01.0000] <csarven>
You could technically send more than 140 chars (the text may need to be processed e.g., shortURLing)

[16:50:02.0000] <webben_>
I see.

[16:52:00.0000] <csarven>
I think I could totally remove that <E>140</E> from the original HTML output and show it with JavaScript

[16:52:01.0000] <csarven>
I'm not sure if I can use <output> actually. We are using XMLWriter

[19:48:00.0000] <faure>
hi all, when I try to use the parser in html5lib I get a deprecation warning for inputstream.py,  am I doing soemthing wrong?

[23:59:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Can <p> be used in <li> in HTML5?

[00:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[00:00:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
cool

[00:02:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
is <dl>/<dt>/<dd> appropriate for a title and a description?

[00:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd need more information to answer

[00:03:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
I'm making a list of links (titles) with descriptions

[00:03:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
and I'm trying to figure out the best way to mark it up

[00:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
a list of links with descriptions would work well with <dl>, yes

[00:04:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
should I use individual <dl>s within <li>s, or just use one <dl> for the whole list?

[00:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
one <dl>, if i'm understanding what you said right

[00:05:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: http://gphemsley.org/blogs.php

[00:05:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
right now it's just links

[00:05:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
but I want to put a description under each link

[00:08:00.0000] <faure>
hi

[00:08:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
hi

[00:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: <dl> seems appropriate

[00:09:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
one long one?

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:12:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
I'm noticing I'm not very creative when it comes to naming by blogs...

[00:14:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
s/by/my/

[00:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
faure: The deprecation warning should be fixed in the latest trunk, but if you are intended in use the BeautifulSoup backend that is broken

[00:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
But the deprecation warning isn't very harmful

[01:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. An MS rep posting to a W3C mailing list is a news item at C|Net

[01:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, it also hit slashdot

[01:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think having 2 separate drafts simultaneoulsy published as official WDs (Hixie's and Manu's drafts) is going to be a PR disaster

[01:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
also, the W3C's publishing system isn't really designed to be able to fork specs into almost identical, but competing documents.

[01:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
The payload of Manu's draft is a warning about microdata. The rest is just the delivery device.

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[01:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yes, I know. That was clear as soon as I saw the microdata warning

[01:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I haven't even read the microdata warning

[01:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: you should say you object to the idea of publishing 2 WDs then

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: if we publish both, I wonder how we decide which goes at http://w3.org/TR/html5

[01:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's kind of a silly vote, but it's pretty much a silly cote, but it's exactly what Sam asked for by soliciting technical objections to a Working Draft

[01:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, I'm considering it. I'm just trying to work out how to most effectively express my disagreement

[01:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really see much value in a version of the draft with just warnings added, personally

[01:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, we have SO MANY open issues

[01:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I haven't yet read the microdata warning, either

[01:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
thousands fewer than we did a year ago

[01:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
but still many

[01:31:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: Sam just asked for a reason - I think "separate drafts simultaneoulsy published as official WDs (Hixie's and Manu's drafts) is going to be a PR disaster" is a valid reason

[01:31:06.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: we do have some that, at least from the HTML WG's perspective, have been open a crazy long time

[01:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
depends on your definition of "open"

[01:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it might be worthwhile to flag those somewhere, to highlight the fact that the Chairs are not emptying this list

[01:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
the ones in the issue tracker are mostly issues i've considered closed for a long time, and are only still open because the chairs aren't doing their job

[01:32:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean open in the sense that there's an open ISSUE that the chairs do not agree to close

[01:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I should collect a list of controversial issues open more than 6 months

[01:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and then I could make the much shorter list of issues that were open that long, and then closed

[01:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
you mean issues in the issue tracker?

[01:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
or actual issues

[01:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure what you mean by "actual issues"

[01:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
wtf? Manu's first reason for his objection to the garbage collection section is...

[01:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
"It seems to provide normative implementation advice"

[01:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
my intent is to list issues where it seems a number of people are dissatisfied with the spec, and the chairs have not yet declared it resolved

[01:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: things like "there's an infinite loop in the parser when you do X"

[01:37:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I think he might not understand that the requirement there has an observable effect

[01:37:05.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, based on that, we need to remove sections 2 through 12.

[01:37:06.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: as opposed to "i have an indeterminate objection to the general direction that this section is going in"

[01:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: issues like the former are almost never "controversial" (at least I don't recall one where that was the case)

[01:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am thinking things like "missing alt should absolutely never be allowed under any circumstances, not even if alt text is unavailable, or a <legend> or title attribute has the relevant info"

[01:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't really agree with that position, but it seems concrete enough to be actionable

[01:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i don't consider such dogmatic statements to be issues, since they don't have reasoning or research. And issues with only reasoning and research are rarely controversial.

[01:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
if ever

[01:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: whatever you want to call them, our one Chair who does any Chairing considers them to be open issues that block consensus and prevent going to Last Call

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[01:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: by W3C technicality, he is right that if he doesn't either declare consensus or hold a vote then there is no WG decision

[01:43:00.0000] <annevk42>
I checked out that warnings draft the other day... wtf

[01:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so I would like to make the list of things where that hasn't happened yet, despite the issue being raised a long time ago

[01:43:02.0000] <annevk42>
the discussion on public-html is even worse

[01:43:03.0000] <annevk42>
there's now a side discussion whether the warnings are in the right place lol

[01:43:04.0000] <othermaciej>
not because I think it indicates technical problem with the spec, but because it indicates a process problem with the WG if we never close them

[01:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i certainly don't oppose pointing out the complete lack of progress that the HTMLWG has made

[01:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that's pretty much my point

[01:46:00.0000] <annevk42>
also, what's up with this crazy idea of dispatching on a subdomain rather than scheme? especially since it's part of an API call that only deals with non-HTTP...

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wait, what?

[01:48:00.0000] <annevk42>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2009Aug/0013.html

[01:48:01.0000] <annevk42>
I think that guy might be a TAG member even o_O

[01:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
O_o

[01:54:00.0000] <annevk42>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2009Aug/0005.html was the original email btw

[01:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
reading his actual paper is even scarier http://dbooth.org/2006/urn2http/

[02:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#focusable why is the list item "area elements that have an href attribute" marked with class="XXX"?

[02:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I see, there's a comment in the source about it

[02:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
nevermind

[02:09:02.0000] <annevk2>
area is tricky

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
not really sure what to do about <area> and focus

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i really should fix that soon

[02:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
do browsers let you tab-cycle through the <area>s of an image map?

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is that image maps can be used with multiple images

[02:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
so an <area> corresponds to multiple distinct areas that have different places in tab order

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
yet there's a single .focus() method, etc

[02:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
why is that a problem?

[02:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
what will be focused?

[02:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, right

[02:20:02.0000] <annevk2>
doh

[02:20:03.0000] <Lachy>
I misread and throught he was talking about the onfocus event, not the focus method

[02:20:04.0000] <Lachy>
I should wake up better and have some breakfast

[02:20:05.0000] <annevk2>
not a bad idea

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
image maps are so ancient and pretty much obsolete...

[02:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
they are being considered as part of a solution to canvas accessibility

[02:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(ARIA + <area> is the buzzword)

[02:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Hixie just proved that the focus state cannot consist solely of an element if imagemap areas need to be focusable

[02:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
<area> is too limited for the use cases that people actually want image-map-like behaviour

[02:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that is probably true

[02:28:00.0000] <annevk2>
e.g. it fails at hover effects

[02:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
often, people want hover effects to apply to the hovered area, or custom popup text (like flickr), custom borders around the areas, etc.

[04:29:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: yt?

[04:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
When did the cite attribute get added to <section> and <article> and what problem is the pubdate attribute on <article> solving?

[04:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3905#c7

[04:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa! did the spec have reparsing at some point?

[04:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
I didn't think it did

[04:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, the pubdate and cite attributes seem to violate the general principle of avoiding hidden metadata

[04:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
and it seems they were already solved by <time> and <a href><cite>, respectively

[04:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=3068&to=3069

[04:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
I agree that they are pointless and silly

[04:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
pubdate?

[04:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, see #the-article-element

[04:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
are there known to be CDATA elements in the wild where there are multiple <!-- ... --> escape runs?

[04:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
I mean #attr-article-pubdate

[04:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
seems very anti-patterny

[04:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
It came from Chaals

[04:38:02.0000] <Lachy>
d'oh

[04:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: but why?

[04:38:04.0000] <jgraham>
Specifically from "Chaals could improve the Opera intranet if he had a mechanism for identifying the original source of various parts of a page

[04:38:05.0000] <jgraham>
"

[04:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: wasn't that cite?

[04:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
Doesn't seem like anything that needs interoperable semantics

[04:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the pubdate thing smells like Atom

[04:39:03.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Yeah

[04:39:04.0000] <Lachy>
so let's find a way to more semantically attach <time> and <cite> elements to a specific section, rather than adding redundant hidden metadata

[04:39:05.0000] <jgraham>
Dunno about pubdate

[04:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=3115&to=3116

[04:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I wonder if // <!-- is used in JS in the wild

[04:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yes, I believe it is

[04:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
pubdate seems bad too

[04:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
Not sure how to fix it exatly but there should just be a way to associate <time> with a section

[04:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
cite I would happily drop entirely

[04:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
@cite thaat is

[04:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well the cite element too if it came to it but thta isn't going to happen :)

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so it seems that chaals didn't ask for cite specifically, but Hixie decided that cite would address chaals' use case

[04:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
<time for="#section-id"> or maybe have keywords like <time for="_section"> which would link it with its most recent ancestor sectioning element

[04:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: For example. Although the idref solution has all the typical idref problems of non-locality

[04:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
I thought cite was already on the chopping block for it's failure to adequately address the blockquote use case, so I don't understand why it was considered to be a good solution for this

[04:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
what do you mean by problems of non-locality?

[04:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
do you mean in cases where the time element has no other relationship with the element?  Like when it's located elsewhere in the document and doesn't point to an ancestor or very nearby sibling?

[04:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: The authour has to keep two pieces of information in sync that are not necessarily close to each other in the document source.

[04:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[04:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Plus the problem that it can point to something nonsensical

[04:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's true

[04:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
and unlike with <label for>, there wouldn't be any indication at all of an error being present

[04:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
(the advantage of <time role=pubdate> (ergh) is that the semantics are well defined; it applies to the nearest sectioning element)

[04:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
is role=pubdate already defined somewhere, or are you suggesting that as a possible solution?

[04:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
No I'm suggesting it

[04:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[04:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
But not using role really

[04:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
It just seemed like a good english word

[04:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
conceptually, it seems like a reasonable idea

[04:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whether it's reasonable depends on whether it's worthwhile to overlay the semantics of Atom over an HTML page at this point in time in the post-RSS world

[05:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=509009

[05:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe we should do the magic escape thing only for script and style

[05:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or maybe only for script

[05:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if anyone ever uses "</style>" in generated content

[05:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Ctitle%3E%3C!--%3C%2Ftitle%3Ea%3C%2Ftitle%3E--%3E%3C%2Ftitle%3E

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
very sad in WebKit

[05:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/201 is sad in WebKit, too

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/202 is even worse in IE8

[05:30:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: With the first of those I get the same in Chromium Linux nightly as I do in Opera 10 and Minefield

[05:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: what html5.enable setting in Minefield?

[05:31:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
true

[05:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting

[05:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: oops. sorry. 

[05:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the point with the first one is to show that the CDATA escapes apply in WebKit when it doesn't reparse

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so yeah, it's expected that the first case looks the same across browsers

[05:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: BTW I am very unhappy about the idea of adding some heuristics for guessing what mught be a js string to the parser

[05:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
I expect it to be a large amount of complexity for something that works very poorly

[05:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
I would rather have some form of reparsing if there is too much content to break since browsers are clearly willing to ship that already

[05:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: do you have non-reparsing suggestions for dealing with both "<!--" and "</script>" string literals in a Web-compatible way?

[05:58:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: No :(

[05:58:03.0000] <jgraham>
I will think about it more though

[05:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this reparsing stuff is very sad

[05:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if it is a result of accidental ad hoc parser writing or deliberate "helpfulness"

[06:00:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me spent a bit thinking about it earlier

[06:00:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me didn't have any idea though

[06:00:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Could you make a wiki page documenting the full set of constraints i.e. everything that needs to work

[06:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: sure

[06:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/constraints/known constraints/ for gsnedders' benefit

[06:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is JS string detection much more complex than having a small state machine with outside-literal, inside-single-quoted-string, inside-double-quoted-string, inside-regexp, after-backslash? (or something a bit like that)

[06:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, and two inside-comments

[06:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, I didn't expect my mail to be another opportunity for the RDFa proponents to jump in with their overly complex solution :-(

[06:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well they can both be replaced by Microdata too.

[06:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
They can both be replaced by English too

[06:25:02.0000] <jgraham>
IS English machine readable? I assume that is the point...

[06:26:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Well, to some extent…

[06:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
it depends if the machine readability is an essential property of the solution

[06:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Depends on whether consciousness is mechanical

[06:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not convinved it is for either cite or pubdate

[06:27:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: For the use case of performing an automatic conversion of html to the atom model it is

[06:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
but I assume that's not a philosophical debate we want to have

[06:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: on the face of it, it seems you'd need a state machine that knows about //, line break, /*, */, " and '

[06:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, that depends if HTML alone will be used as the only input to the system that generates Atom

[06:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
In any case it's reassuring that a technology designed to allow arbitary microdata to be embedded can be used to embed simple instances of microdata. It is disappointing that in the case of RDFa it is so complex

[06:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, most CMSs seem to have enough data already to be able to generate appropriate Atom feeds, without needing the extra info to be added into the document itself

[06:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Generating feeds from pure HTML is the whole use case

[06:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
which kind of systems would want to do that though?

[06:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
The idea is that there are situations where it is too burdensome to generate multiple representations of a resource

[06:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: You need to handle var x = /[\/"]/ too

[06:30:03.0000] <jgraham>
And that even where it is possible it is more likely to lead to undetected bugs and so on

[06:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
You could use the HTTP Last-Modified date of the HTML document

[06:30:05.0000] <Lachy>
Is the idea to be able to subscribe to a feed in a newsreader, just like I do with Atom and RSS today, but where the actual feed is the HTML document?

[06:30:06.0000] <Philip`>
(Maybe you can't actually, I don't know)

[06:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think Last-Modified is reliable enough to be used in practice

[06:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Yes

[06:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
isn't that what hAtom was supposed to do?

[06:31:03.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That wheel needs reinventing

[06:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Microformats are also more complex than pure HTML

[06:32:01.0000] <tantek>
jgraham - perhaps compound microformats are more complex than some HTML.

[06:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, you have to compare the complexity of HTML+Microformats with HTML+Microdata and HTML+RDFa

[06:33:01.0000] <tantek>
elemental microformats are as simple as any other rel attribute value

[06:34:00.0000] <tantek>
jgraham - but your point is well taken. there are several simplification improvements currently slated both for 1.0.1 versions of hCard, hCalendar etc. (existing well established compound microformats), and patterns for any future microformats.

[06:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I only need to compare the complexity of HTML with the features needed for atom to HTML + {some microdata language}

[06:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wants a javascript tokenizer

[06:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
+ dammit

[06:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
tantek, re this http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Template:Cc-public-domain-release - There was a breif time when the whole wiki was in the public domain. Though I got some complaints and it had to use the MIT license, which is close enough for all practical purposes

[06:39:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me prefers MIT

[06:40:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me prefers Stanford

[06:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
why?

[06:40:02.0000] <tantek>
Lachy, PD is well established (per that template) on both Wikipedia, and microformats.org.

[06:40:03.0000] <tantek>
in the context of wikis/content - the PD license statement is more prevalent than MIT license.

[06:41:00.0000] <tantek>
anyway - just like Wikipedia, WHATWG wiki authors can add the template to their user pages if they wish to do so. (I encourage it)

[06:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
the problem I see with your approach is that without significant uptake, it makes it difficult to know for sure whether any given page is fully in the public domain

[06:42:01.0000] <tantek>
Lachy, it's an incremental thing

[06:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
tantek, I've never seen anyone add a template like that to their user pages.

[06:42:03.0000] <Lachy>
on wikipedia

[06:43:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy - that's where I got the idea from, quite a few do it (because they want their contribs re-used more liberally than GFDL/CC-SA)

[06:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
do you have a user page on wikipeida you can show me?

[06:43:02.0000] <tantek>
if enough authors of a wiki add it, then you can take a vote/poll and make it the policy of the wiki moving forward, and then  you incrementally cleanup pages as necessary

[06:44:00.0000] <tantek>
yes, one sec

[06:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, what's the benefit of MIT over public domain?

[06:44:02.0000] <tantek>
(about 4 clicks)

[06:45:00.0000] <tantek>
*TONS* of users use the Wikipedia version of that PD template

[06:45:01.0000] <tantek>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Public_domain_release

[06:45:02.0000] <tantek>
including myself, Mike Linksvayer, etc.

[06:46:00.0000] <tantek>
on microformats.org/wiki, we transitioned to PD in a few steps. first we made it voluntary with the template, then when a sufficient percentage of authors (per contributions) adopted it, we made it the policy moving forward, and the requested other authors to please consider adding it as well (for past contribs)

[06:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: yeah, regexp literals are a can of worms as an edge case

[06:47:00.0000] <tantek>
and then have been incrementally updating pages as necessary to move them fully into PD.

[06:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does JS allow multiline string literals?

[06:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, raw LF inside string literal?

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: if not, one could hope that no one does document.write("...</script>"); on the same line with a regexp literal

[06:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I understand that PD is regarded as less desirable than "with a specific Free license" in some jurastictions

[06:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: is that just FUD or is there some explanation written by a Real Lawyer somewhere?

[06:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'm aware of the IANAL legends around the point)

[06:48:04.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: But they could easilly do /foo/;document.write

[06:49:00.0000] <tantek>
jgraham, I believe CC0 takes care of that, which is precisely the reason for the wording in the template that says "or any later version published by Creative Commons; with either a waiver of rights, or an assertion that no rights attach to a particular work.""

[06:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Dunno but I recall that CC suggested not using PD in the past

[06:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
that seems strange since, by definition, public domain has absolutely no restrictions (beyond the moral rights imposed in some countries)

[06:49:03.0000] <tantek>
/me has had the microformats.org PD template checked by Lawrence Lessig (a lawyer), which the WHATWG wiki PD template is based on.

[06:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: IIRC the question was over whether the countries allowed you to give up your "natural" rights to things that you created

[06:50:01.0000] <tantek>
jgraham, CC0 takes care of the i18n of PD.

[06:51:00.0000] <tantek>
with language as in the template "...a waiver of rights, or an assertion that no rights attach to a particular work"

[06:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't really understand the situation, in particular how anything that requires a specific document from CC can be considered public domain

[06:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, copyright is not a natural right

[06:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
In the absence of that understanding MIT seems safer

[06:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: depends on whether you believe in Anglo copyright or French Droit d'auteur

[06:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I think the English basis of copyright makes sense and the French basis is empirically bullshit)

[06:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know what the french basis is

[06:54:02.0000] <tantek>
jgraham, book publishers understand PD better than MIT

[06:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: not about money but about the author's artistic relationship with the work basically

[06:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: but empirically, it still boils down to money

[09:03:00.0000] <adactio>
Quick question: how would you define the difference between HTML5 and HTML 5? (i.e. no space vs. with space)

[09:05:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
adactio: Some people use HTML5 to refer to the text/html serialization and HTML 5 to refer to the spec. Other people make no distinction. The spec only defines "HTML 5".

[09:05:01.0000] <rubys>
In most usages, it doesn't matter.  At times it is helpful to contrast HTML 5 (with a space, referring to the vocabulary) from the two concrete serializations HTML5 (quotes not required on attributes) and XHTML5 (draconian).

[09:06:00.0000] <rubys>
gsnedders|work: section 1.7 defines "HTML5"

[09:06:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
rubys: Stop assuming I know what the spec says! :P

[09:08:00.0000] <tantek>
and what methodology led to distinguishing semantics (the spec/vocabulary vs. a serialization) based on a single space character?

[09:08:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me guesses it was the fact the spec wasn't called HTML 5 until the W3C got involved

[09:09:00.0000] <rubys>
like all decisions at the WHATWG, I presume that it was based on data  and reasoning (the way the WHATWG operates)[TM]

[09:09:01.0000] <tantek>
I will humbly submit that that decision was a big mistake, and submit as an example the home page of the wiki, which both inconsistently/incorrectly uses HTML5 and "HTML 5": http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Main_Page

[09:09:02.0000] <rubys>
/me is shocked

[09:09:03.0000] <tantek>
rubys - you're better than that - no need for snark

[09:10:00.0000] <rubys>
/me chuckles

[09:10:01.0000] <tantek>
so is it true the W3C decided to call the spec "HTML 5" then?

[09:11:00.0000] <rubys>
/me checking

[09:11:01.0000] <rubys>
HTML 4.01 is called "HTML 4.01"

[09:11:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
tantek: yes

[09:12:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(As it was Web Applications 1.0  before)

[09:12:01.0000] <rubys>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007May/0909.html

[09:12:02.0000] <tantek>
so therefore this apparent "decision" to use a whitespace character to distinguish a semantic was nothing but an accident of politics then.

[09:12:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
909!?

[09:13:00.0000] <rubys>
it is not clear to me the topic of to include a space or not to include a space was actually discussed.

[09:14:00.0000] <rubys>
That poll posed three questions, here are the first two: Shall we Adopt HTML5 as our specification text for review? Shall the W3C's next-generation HTML specification be named "HTML 5"?

[09:14:01.0000] <rubys>
note the inconsistent use of spaces

[09:14:02.0000] <rubys>
as far as I can tell, the decision and distinction is totally a WHATWG one.

[09:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me never uses the spaces consistently

[09:15:01.0000] <rubys>
not even in python?

[09:15:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I think it's true to say the spec was informally called HTML 5 pre-W3C

[09:15:03.0000] <jgraham>
I never write about HTML 5 in python :p

[09:16:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
"While the HTML form of HTML5" appears in old WHATWG draft

[09:16:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
But that's the only time either HTML 5 or HTML5 are used in that

[09:28:00.0000] <tantek>
rubys, if the distinction of "HTML5" vs. "HTML 5" came from a W3C public-html poll per that URL, how is that a "WHATWG" distinction?

[09:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyone who makes a distinction between HTML5 and HTML 5 (with/without space) as referring to the serialisation and vocabularly, respectively, is wrong.

[09:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
The distiction can only be made based on context

[09:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
or, where it's not entirely clear, by explicitly qualifying it as, e.g., "HTML5 syntax" or "HTML5 vocabularly"

[09:37:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy - the spec itself tries to make such a distinction, and as such is quite confusing.

[09:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
the spec is wrong

[09:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
While it might be nice in theory to have such a distinction, in reality, we don't because we can't make people use them consistently

[09:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
there was a big discussion about this a year or two ago, with many people wanting to find an alternative name for it. We had all sorts of weird and wonderful suggestions

[09:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
like calling the serialisation "tHTML", which was short for text/html or something

[09:40:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
HTML5-with-whacky-backwards-compatible-syntax-which-you-might-just-understand-if-you-do-a-backflip

[09:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There was no distinction early on, as I recall

[09:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And then someone complained that HTML 5 (or HTML5) being both the spec and a serialization was discriminating against the XHTML serialization

[09:54:00.0000] <rubys>
tantek: I don't believe the distinction came from a W3C poll.  That poll used both terms interchangeably.  Since that point, the spec (as you note) makes that distinction.  I share Lachy's opinion that the spec is wrong on this totally minor and nearly irrelevant point.

[09:55:00.0000] <tantek>
it's not nearly irrelevant because it such a convention (using a whitespace as a semantic distinguisher) will result in much confusion (has)

[09:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
In practice there's no distinction, it's just a politicial white lie

[09:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, I guess it's not really wrong. It's a useful convention for the spec to adhere too. But it's not something it can really enforce outside of the spec

[09:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me recalls similarly to Dashiva

[09:56:02.0000] <rubys>
tantek: if this issue is important to you, I'd suggest bugzilla

[09:56:03.0000] <tantek>
for example, http://twitter.com/WHATWG uses "HTML5" to refer to the spec, not the serialization

[09:57:00.0000] <tantek>
rubys - bugzilla is a show stopper user interface, far worse than email.

[09:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
Where has it caused confusion?

[09:57:02.0000] <rubys>
tantek: have you seen the new ability to enter bugzilla reports (ranging from typos to real issues) directly from the WHATWG version of the spec?

[09:58:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me points over there

[09:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me tends to use terms like "the HTML 5 spec", "the text/html serialisation", "the XML serialisation" to avoid ambiguity

[09:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
tantek: You can use bugzilla without using it by using the spec bug reporter?

[09:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Is that still using bugzilla

[10:00:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me wonders what the practical difference between reporting issues in bugzilla and by email is

[10:01:00.0000] <tantek>
gsnedders - # of form fields. see: http://tantek.com/log/2007/02.html#d19t1813

[10:02:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
tantek: I mean from how they are dealt with

[10:02:01.0000] <tantek>
gsnedders - I referred specifically to UI in my statement.

[10:02:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Not how they are reported)

[10:04:00.0000] <rubys>
the UI on the whatwg draft is simple.  Read the document (scrolling as you do so).  Spot something you aren't happy with.  Type in your message.  Click "Submit Review Comment".

[10:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
We could save a lot of work by just putting one giant warning at the top of the spec

[10:08:01.0000] <Dashiva>
... oh wait

[10:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: You forgot a step

[10:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: (Clicking on the bit you want to comment on)

[10:09:02.0000] <rubys>
OMG!  The UI is too complicated!  <ducks/>

[10:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: Actually I think the UI is too unintuituive at the moment

[10:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
It's YATOMTDP

[10:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
(Yet Another Thing On My To Do Pile)

[10:11:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me wonders when jgraham is ever happy

[10:31:00.0000] <tantek>
rubys - the spec interactive bug/comment submission capability is quite clever.

[10:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems to be a failure in practice, though

[10:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
judging by the signal/noise ratio

[10:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: As long as Someone is willing to handle the noise, it can still be seen as a gain overall

[10:41:00.0000] <hober>
If there were an optional email field, we could add it to the cc list on the bug created

[10:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do CC addresses not have to be registered users?

[10:46:00.0000] <hober>
I don't know.

[10:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me assumes it would be vulnerable to abuse otherwise

[11:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
So it seems that we're going to spend a bunch of cycles debating what should have a big red box in the spec

[11:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I stand by my suggestion of pink cuddly "Hello Kitty!" signs.

[11:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
I am totally reminded of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: "Most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small, green pieces of paper, which is odd, because on the whole, it wasn't the small, green pieces of paper which were unhappy."

[13:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
We should just put one giant red box at the top of the spec that says: ...

[13:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There have been objections to HTML5 as a whole, so it's only fair

[13:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
There are many people who collectively disagree with the entire content of this specification, and many others who collectively agree with the entire specification. As such, nothing in this draft is stable..

[13:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: we have text that says that. Does making it a red box make any difference?

[13:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, yes. We put a big red border around the whole spec to make people happy

[13:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
on a more serious note, I wonder if we could address this issue by somehow linking the issues in the issue tracker from the status markers in the draft

[13:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: These "issues" in manu's draft aren't really issues in the sense of the issue tracker

[13:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, I know that, but by doing what I suggest, we guarantee that the issues tracked in both are in sync

[13:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
doing what Manu suggests amounts to arbitrarily inserting notes where random people disagree with something in a section

[13:31:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yup

[13:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me takes a look at what it would take to add that to the annotation system

[13:39:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy - your approach makes more sense to me than duplicating issue content in the spec.

[13:40:00.0000] <tantek>
I should say, a partial duplication of some existing issue content mixed with a bunch of new opinion content that has not been actually captured as an issue.

[13:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
Looks like we will need to add an <issue> element (or similar) to the XML output by status.cgi for each section, and then update status.js to include the information in the status boxes if present.

[13:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
Will also need to update the updateEntry function to be able to send a new status with the patch

[13:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
and update add something to the UI that allows issues to be recorded

[13:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[13:54:01.0000] <rubys>
+1 to linking status to issues

[13:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
if we make the status boxes link to issues it'll be perennially out of date

[13:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
with the exception of the issues tracked on the issue tracker, the turnover rate is very high

[13:55:01.0000] <rubys>
if it is out of date, poke me, and I'll update

[13:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
you realise i go through about 500 issues a week right?

[13:55:03.0000] <Lachy>
if we only link them directly with the issue number, then they won't be out of date for too long

[13:55:04.0000] <rubys>
(I was referring to the W3C issues)

[13:55:05.0000] <Lachy>
since the issues in the W3C issue tracker don't get updated that frequently

[13:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
If people care about what W3C WDs say, then the WHATWG status boxes would have to be folded into the WD somehow

[13:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
besides, all it would take is a link to the issue. We don't necessarily need something in the status box itself to report on the status of the issue

[13:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
no-one should care what a W3C WD should say, as it's out of date by the time its published

[13:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
you mean the issue tracker that has such issues as "tools that can't generate <!DOCTYPE html>", which was resolved almost 9 months ago?

[13:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
obviously we wouldn't need to bother linking to issues that are already closed

[13:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
or "HTML Versioning and DOCTYPEs" that was resolved about 4 years ago?

[13:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
but just from the relevant sections to the open issues. Like linking the table section to ISSUE-32 (I think)

[13:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
the whatwg status tracker is going to track actual issues. If the W3C HTMLWG wants to track bogus non-issues that are open purely for political reasons, then the HTMLWG can do it using its own scripts on its own copy of the draft.

[13:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
fair enough

[14:04:00.0000] <tantek>
/me prefers links to issues (in whichever issue tracking system is more up to date etc.) in the spec over inline snapshots of issue text in the spec.

[14:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i prefer to just resolve the issues when i get to them :-)

[14:08:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, perhaps links to unresolved emails to WHATWG list is your most up to date issue tracking system then.

[14:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
www.whatwg.org/issues is my issue tracking system

[14:09:00.0000] <tantek>
Thanks Hixie.

sicking: pong

[15:51:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, so it says that clearState should clear or history entries related to the current Document

[15:51:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, does that include entries created using normal <a> navigation to other frag-ids?

[15:52:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i.e. could clearState have any effect even if pushState has never been called?

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
it includes that, it includes URLs that come from navigating by hand, everything

[15:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[15:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
at least, per spec, iirc

[15:52:04.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, heh

(whether that's desireable or not is a different question)

[15:52:06.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, is there a reason for this? I can't really think of a reason one way or another on this

feedback would be very welcome on this

[16:55:00.0000] <paulgendek>
hello

[16:55:01.0000] <paulgendek>
what is the intended use of <header> and <footer>, is header intended to be semantic for <div id="header">? or is it section headers only like <div class="main-top">, etc.  it's my understanding that if <header> is used as <div id="header"> then we will have to still use id="header" to denote that it is the header for body, not header for any other sections, like <section id="content"><header>

[16:55:02.0000] <paulgendek>
continued: it would seem to be more semantic to have the header of a layout specified as <section id="header"> since it is the "header" section of the layout, and not specifically a header container for <body>

[16:55:03.0000] <paulgendek>
<section id="header">, container, sidebar, footer, etc.  these are all <sections> in of a design, as we design semantic markup just as we design CSS as well

[16:57:00.0000] <paulgendek>
typically we have <div class="post"> and within we would have <div class="post-top"> or whatever, denoting a top/header container for a post, we could do the same for footer, so is <header> only to be used for this purpose?

[16:57:01.0000] <paulgendek>
as a "section header" and not the header of a design

In HTML5 as currently specced, <header> can be used as the header of many elements, including <body>, <article>, <section>, and the like.

[17:01:01.0000] <hober>
I don't see why "we will have to still use ..."

[17:02:00.0000] <paulgendek>
for practical css designs

[17:02:01.0000] <hober>
just use selectors that pull out the relevant elements

[17:02:02.0000] <paulgendek>
first child and > don't work in ie6

[17:02:03.0000] <hober>
consider <body><header>...</header><article><header>...</header>...</article>...</body>

[17:02:04.0000] <paulgendek>
for body > header

[17:02:05.0000] <inimino>
IE6 is hardly relevant in the HTML5 timeframe

[17:03:00.0000] <hober>
the "article header" selector works fine in all relevant browsers, no?

[17:03:01.0000] <inimino>
for many people IE6 isn't worth supporting even now

[17:04:00.0000] <paulgendek>
i work for a major publishing company and there is still a significant percentage of ie6 users across all of our brands, of over US magazines

[17:04:01.0000] <paulgendek>
which is a pretty wide range of diverse niches

[17:05:00.0000] <paulgendek>
so it seems like it would still need to be supported for some time longer, even though the fight is going pretty strong lately

[17:05:01.0000] <paulgendek>
and there is a lot of html5 website development moving rapidly

[17:06:00.0000] <paulgendek>
so i'm worried about moving forward, the problem is that we _need_ id specific selectors for layout structural elements

[17:06:01.0000] <hober>
you could leave out "layout structural" in that sentence

[17:06:02.0000] <paulgendek>
so header, content, sidebar, footer, should all be <sections>

[17:06:03.0000] <paulgendek>
and would still need id's

[17:07:00.0000] <hober>
there are lots of designs which require the use of class="" and/or id="" in browsers with impoverished selector support

[17:07:01.0000] <hober>
this isn't a spec bug

[17:07:02.0000] <hober>
and has nothing to do with the elements you're talking about

[17:08:00.0000] <paulgendek>
understood, but i don't understand using <header id="header"> and <section id="content"> and being more semantic and organized in the xml style

[17:08:01.0000] <hober>
I definitely don't follow how you get from "I'll need to use class='' or id='' in some cases" to "we shouldn't have these elements at all"

[17:08:02.0000] <hober>
err, I don't understand what you just wrote.

[17:09:00.0000] <paulgendek>
i mean header and footer in the sense of the location of the design/structure of the site, not the actual <header> element.... <header>/<footer> make a lot of sense being the top/bottom containers for <sections>/<articles> etc

[17:09:01.0000] <paulgendek>
but it doesn't make sense being used as the header container in a design

[17:10:00.0000] <paulgendek>
i feel that after body, should be sections... and in the #header section, you can have a header/footer, hgroup, inner content, etc

[17:10:01.0000] <hober>
I don't follow. It makes just as much sense to use <header> as the header for a <body> element as it does to use it as the header for some other sectioning element.

[17:10:02.0000] <paulgendek>
and if the design requires wrapping containers around sections, divs are used

[17:10:03.0000] <hober>
sometimes you'll need to distinguish different <header> elements on the page for styling purposes, so we have class="" and id="", but this also applies to all other elements in the language.

[17:11:00.0000] <hober>
e.g. <em class="rfc2119">should</em> might be styled differently than <em>should</em>

[17:11:01.0000] <hober>
that doesn't mean we need two separate elements

[17:14:00.0000] <paulgendek>
it just seems like it's redundant to have <header> within the body and still need to add id="header" 90%+ of the time in real-world cases than to group all the "header" items of a design into <section id="header">, would it then make sense to have <header> under body but place a <section> within it to apply the structural/layout id ?

[17:15:00.0000] <hober>
Let's assume I have a page with one <body>, one <header> child of <body>, and several <article> and <section> elements with their own <header>s.

[17:16:00.0000] <paulgendek>
<header> seems more appropriate at meaning to the top section of the parent element... and using it under <body> would mean the same thing... so then body > header would be appropriate for accessibility links, "skip to", etc, and you would then still have <section id="header">

[17:16:01.0000] <hober>
the number of <header> elements that require distinguishing with class="" or id="" (in browsers with impoverished selector support) in such as case is more like 10%, not 90%.

[17:18:00.0000] <paulgendek>
if you write css targeting header, and you want to design the header of the layout, you would need to use body > header selector... which is a lot more to type (ridiculous but practical) and not natively supported in ie6

[17:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
wtf, http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/025408!OpenDocument&Click=

[17:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
the hard copy of sRGB is cheaper than the PDF!

[17:19:00.0000] <hober>
what's wrong with <body><header id="foo">...</header><article><header>...</header>...</article>...</body>?

[17:20:00.0000] <beowulf>
you can select that without a class or id, obviously

[17:21:00.0000] <paulgendek>
so a 3-col page layout would be header, section.col, section.col, section.col, footer?

[17:23:00.0000] <paulgendek>
hober: in most cases, at least in my experience with magazine-layout/blog websites, is that the dom is never that simply constructed

[17:24:00.0000] <hober>
I'd probably use <div> for the columns in such a layout

[17:24:01.0000] <paulgendek>
i guess that is what i'm looking for... what is the "holy grail" for common floating column page layouts in the html5 world?

[17:24:02.0000] <paulgendek>
in base structure

[17:26:00.0000] <paulgendek>
i may be confusing myself here :P

[17:26:01.0000] <hober>
body { column-count: 3; column-gap: 2em; }?

[17:26:02.0000] <paulgendek>
hober: in a perfect world

[17:26:03.0000] <hober>
I was joking :)

[17:26:04.0000] <paulgendek>
haha

[17:26:05.0000] <paulgendek>
hoped so

[17:27:00.0000] <hober>
I think the real answer is something handwavy like "use the most semantically appropriate element for your context, or <div>/<span> if none exists"

[17:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
31 to go

[17:27:02.0000] <hober>
cont. "then layer on additional/more precise semantics with class=''"

[17:29:00.0000] <paulgendek>
idk, i think this looks much more elegant: http://www.grabup.com/uploads/418240ad1cf963160cc003c2b76cd0fe.png?direct

[17:32:00.0000] <paulgendek>
and if the h-tags are used in order, along with hgroups when needed, and within <header> tags... it would be practical to design with css, and be semantic... 

[17:32:01.0000] <paulgendek>
am i missing something?

[17:36:00.0000] <hober>
paulgendek: I think I would have marked that up more like so: http://paste.lisp.org/display/85165

[17:37:00.0000] <deltab>
Hixie: with the PDF they have to send someone out to colour-calibrate your screen

[17:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
26 to go...

[17:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
deltab: hah

[17:45:00.0000] <paulgendek>
hober: that really makes me uncomfortable with theming complicated website headers and everything is targeting a first-child or > selector body header:first-child or body > header....  there WILL need to be an id there, and <header id="header"> is redundant 

[17:55:00.0000] <paulgendek>
are there any documented best practices?

[17:58:00.0000] <paulgendek>
i consider the header of a design to be sectioning content, not flow content, but that the section contains flow content

[17:58:01.0000] <paulgendek>
i meant, i consider the header container of a design

[18:06:00.0000] <paulgendek>
would this be appropriate for use today? http://www.grabup.com/uploads/46007d0ff9e19b933047f0eb0cc05ced.png?direct

[18:07:00.0000] <paulgendek>
using sections with id's for sectioning content, but still using <header>/<footer> in their section containers

[18:08:00.0000] <paulgendek>
the section element is the only element that is spec'd to be bolth flow content and sectioning content categories

[18:08:01.0000] <paulgendek>
s/bolth/both

[18:10:00.0000] <paulgendek>
besides article, aside, and nav, of course

[18:17:00.0000] <paulgendek>
or you would use header, nav, article, aside, footer for the sectioning

[18:17:01.0000] <paulgendek>
anyone?

[18:21:00.0000] <smedero>
i've always though <header> & <footer> were more compelling when nested inside an <article> or a <section> than when used in a traditional website template header & footer model.

[18:23:00.0000] <smedero>
i agree <header id="header"> is annoying and relying on selectors could be problematic with large CMS deployments that have a lot of hands in the pot.

[18:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
18 to go...

[18:29:01.0000] <paulgendek>
smedero: here's a template that i'm working with, let me know what you think: http://www.grabup.com/uploads/8b5623a6613dafd5dfd99df70b7081a9.png?direct

[18:36:00.0000] <smedero>
on a first pass that only thing I had to go back and re-read the spec on was <hgroup>.

[18:37:00.0000] <paulgendek>
smedero: i've altered the h-tags throughout slightly, for seo: http://www.grabup.com/uploads/b6e7062958f481eb4088d747c23f2cc3.png?direct

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
woo, all done

[18:40:01.0000] <smedero>
wrt <header id="header">. Many layouts I see about, the "page header" tends to have it is own "header" and "footer" so-to-speak... so I really think <section> is most appropriate there (because you can't nest  a <footer> in <header>... or at least you couldn't last I read that section.) 

[18:42:00.0000] <paulgendek>
thank you smedero 

[18:42:01.0000] <paulgendek>
that was very helpful

[19:15:00.0000] <khmer42>
Does anyone know if any of the broswers (including dev versions) currently have an implementation of the websockets specification?

[19:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
khmer42: webkit and gecko are working on it, dunno if they have anything testable yet

[19:19:00.0000] <khmer42>
Hixie: Thanks. Do you know if without using comet techniques is there anything else that we can work against (even if it doesn't follow the spec) until someone has got an implementation out? I'm thinking Gears/Adobe AIr/browser plugins.

[19:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
i expect flash has something like this

[19:20:00.0000] <khmer42>
After watching the Google Wave demo, I thought websockets had been released into the wild. Google must be using long polling or something, well I suppose they do have the resources :-)

[19:24:00.0000] <khmer42>
Yep I see Flash has XMLSocket, I'll see if anyone else has made JS lib to bridge the WebSockets spec to this, if not I'll have a stab at it myself.

[19:32:00.0000] <inimino>
khmer42: look at Orbited, they had something very similar

[19:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: nevermind, i did the biblio filtering myself

[19:36:00.0000] <khmer42>
inimino: Thanks, I checked them out before and also Kazing but looked like they were using long polling that imitated a socket. We don't have the servers to scale that solution.

[19:49:00.0000] <inimino>
khmer42: yes, it is long polling

[20:09:00.0000] <franksalim>
khmer42, at Kaazing, we have done what you are talking about

[20:10:00.0000] <franksalim>
khmer42, we use flash's socket (not the xml socket, but the tcp one) and bridge to javascript. if we can't use flash, then we try http streaming. then long polling only as a last resort

[20:11:00.0000] <franksalim>
*(xml messages over tcp. xml vs. tcp doesn't make any sense.)

[20:11:01.0000] <khmer42>
franksalim: Sounds interesting, I will got check it out. Is it a complete port of the websocket spec so it will just be ignored in future as websocket compliant browsers come into play?

[20:12:00.0000] <franksalim>
khmer42, yes. it first checks for native websocket

[20:13:00.0000] <khmer42>
franksalim: Cool, I had a play with Kaazing last year and like where it was heading. Is the front end JavaScript API independent of any server products you have? (if you have such products)

[20:14:00.0000] <franksalim>
khmer42, no, there is a single product

[21:28:00.0000] <paulgendek>
why can't <nav> be inside of <footer> ?

[21:44:00.0000] <Code_Bleu_>
for those of you using Twitter, I created a "Twibbon" overlay for your avatar.  Sorry if this is inappropriate to do..just thought you might like to show your support.  http://twibbon.com/join/WHATWG---HTML5

[21:57:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
So far I am really enjoying Microsoft's new more active participation in the WG

[22:18:00.0000] <stefanschipor>
Has anyone tried using new html5 elements like article with css pseudo-class selectors (I'm trying first-child)? I'm running FF 3.5 and it doesn't seem to work. 

[22:19:00.0000] <stefanschipor>
btw, if this is the wrong place or way to ask the question please correct me. new here

[22:41:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
I haven't tried it

[22:41:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
did you check if the <article> element ends up in the DOM properly?

[23:18:00.0000] <stefanschipor>
that's it :) I had a h1 before the articles which was hidden so I kinda missed it. thanks a lot! :)

[23:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
did Mozilla drop their <a ping> implementation?

[23:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I can't remember what happened with that

[23:24:00.0000] <paulgendek>
if anyone is bored and would like to critique: http://paulgendek.com/html5/  html5 blog layout, validates, with some hcard microformats...

[23:24:01.0000] <paulgendek>
going to do single article view with <dialog> for comments

[23:31:00.0000] <tantek>
paulgendek - looks like Optimus likes your microformats: http://microformatique.com/optimus/?format=validate&uri=http%3A//paulgendek.com/html5/

[23:32:00.0000] <paulgendek>
tantek: :) i also added a few hResume tags, although i don't know what will pick up on it

[23:32:01.0000] <tantek>
I think microtron might

[23:33:00.0000] <paulgendek>
tantek: is it running anywhere? 

[23:33:01.0000] <paulgendek>
online

[23:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok, I proposed actually closing some issue tracker issues

[23:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
let's see if it works!

[23:42:01.0000] <tantekc>
othermaciej - your proposed closures seem reasonable to me.

[23:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I think I saw the code for implementing @ping last month

[23:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
my guess is that the code is there but preffed off

[23:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: do you know if Mozilla has any intent to actually ship the feature?

[23:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I know nothing about intent

[23:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: that's what I was hoping to flush out

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
i imagine chrome will want to support it eventually

[23:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
though i doubt it's a priority

[23:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
(ping="" could dramatically improve the performance of google search while improving the user's ability to control his privacy, which are both things google cares very much about)

[23:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: re ARIA, I don't think we have any reason to believe the ARIA group isn't working at the fastest rate possible

[00:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: at the last HTML WG telecon, someone (who I think was a PFWG member) they said they would not give a reply to your issue for 2-3 months

[00:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[00:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
well then aria won't make LC

[00:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
we can always do it after LC

[00:00:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't care if it's the fastest rate possible, it's clearly not acceptable

[00:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there a rush?

[00:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(they said they want to do that so they can address all LC comments at once)

[00:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
do they realise that the odds are that the LC comments will get further replies from people saying "i'm not happy with this..."

[00:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
?

[00:01:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure they thought it through

[00:01:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess they want to make sure all their answers consider all comments... or something

[00:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
given when you sent your comment, 2-3 months from now would result in a 6 month response time from them

[00:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which I think is unacceptable for meaningful coordination

[00:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also, I think ARIA missing LC is totally an option for the WHATWG, but probably would not fly in the HTML WG (it's possible the WG would vote to agree that ARIA can wait until after first LC, but I wouldn't bet on it)

[00:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's far less than the time it took me to reply to the e-mails i was replying to today

[00:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that is true, but you reply to emails that are specifically cast as urgent requests much faster than that

[00:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well i'm not expecting the HTMLWG to actually reach LC until the WHATWG is ready for CR, at the rate the chairs are running the group

[00:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[00:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in case you haven't noticed - I'm trying to change the way the chairs are running the HTML WG for pretty much that reason

[00:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
good luck

[00:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll need it :-(

[00:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i expect that they're working on this weekly cycle now, because of the telecon

[00:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
so you'll not hear anything until thursday or whenever the telecons are

[00:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
this is another reason i hate telecons -- people end up paralysed and unable to make decisions without holding the phone in their hands

[00:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I do not enjoy anything about telecons

[00:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
If the issues I suggested for immediate closure get closed on Thursday, or, hell, even a week from Thursday, that will still be better than I am expecting

[00:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
me too

[00:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: IIRC, I have sent some unresponded-to ARIA feedback in March 2008 (before ARIA went to LC). My preference would be for PFWG to send out replies as soon as they know what they are going to say.

[00:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: if I understood what was said on the telecon correctly, they want to defer deciding what they are going to say until they have had time to consider every single issue

[00:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: it seems to me, that key questions regarding inclusion by reference into HTML 5 hinge on the "Implementors' Guide" side--not necessarily on "ARIA 1.0"

[00:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that doesn't seem like a good approach to me, but I'd rather just send a WG-to-WG request for expedited processing

[00:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: what do you think are the key questions?

[00:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: UA implementation requirements

[00:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: and I think the UA implementation requirements have some bearing on what makes sense to author

[00:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: can you give a specific example?

[00:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: what must an UA do with <input type=radio checked role=checkbox aria-checked=false>

[00:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I think regardless of the UA implementation requirements, that markup should be non-conforming

[00:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I agree, but that's just our opinion

[00:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: sure, but I don't think the Implementor's Guide will affect our opinion one way or the other

[00:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Here's why I think so.

[00:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: it will affect HTML 5 plus its normative references having UA implmentation reqs

[00:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(A) ARIA can't (by its own goals and scope) require anything different than HTML5 for display and behavior of that markup other than through accessibility APIs - so that markup has to be rendered as a checked radio button for normal visual interactive use.

[00:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(B) ARIA Implementor's Guide can specify two possible behaviors for that markup from an accessibility POV:

[00:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
    (1) The conflicting ARIA markup is ignored.

[00:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
    (2) The conflicting ARIA markup means that the checked radio button is expressed as an unchecked checkbox through screen readers and such.

[00:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
clearly neither of B.1 or B.2 is likely to be intended or good behavior, so either way the markup should be nonconforming

[00:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
now, it might be that we think B.2 is bad UA behavior on its own terms, but that seems like a separate issue from authoring conformance

[00:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I personally would expect B.1 to be a little bit easier to implement, but perhaps more complex to specify

[00:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: it seems that there's disagreement on what's easier: B.1 or B.2

[00:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: IIRC, Aaron Leventhal advocated position B.2

[00:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: neither is completely trivial

[00:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
personally I'd be willing to implement either, if it's considered as error-handling behavior

[00:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(the hard part of B.1 is explicitly ignoring certain aria roles, states and properties in particular cases)

[00:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(the hard part of B.2 is explicitly ignoring built-in behavior of the element when certain aria roles/states are set)

[00:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think there's other examples where it's not clear to me how B.1 or B.2 would dictate the UA behavior

[00:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
for example: <input type=radio checked aria-checked=false>

[00:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess it's mainly a problem for position B.2, for B.1 the answer is clear

[00:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but in the case of B.2, does the aria state still apply, even though there is no relevant role defined?

[00:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or, conversely: <input type=radio checked role=checkbox>

[00:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
under B.2, does ARIA report that as a checked checkbox, or a checkbox with no defined checked state at all?

[00:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
no idea

[00:44:00.0000] <paulgendek>
is there an issue with 'figure legend' ? it's in the source but firebug doesn't see the legend, font is inherited from figure

[00:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah <figure> doesn't work in most browsers yet

[00:45:00.0000] <paulgendek>
is there a javascript fix for that yet?

[00:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[00:45:02.0000] <paulgendek>
thx

[00:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
if there is, nobody has updated the issue marker at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-legend-element yet

[00:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
(the fifth icon in those boxes represents js implementations)

[00:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
What document conformance rules is Optimus based on?

[00:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, why didn't you suggest closing ISSUE-4?

[00:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
(html-versioning)

[00:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I personally think it should be closed with no change to the spec, but there has been continuing debate and Larry intends to make a proposal

[00:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: so I'm leaving that one in the hands of the chairs

[00:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[00:56:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: #refsE163 and #refsRFC2965 are still missing

[00:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just fixed 2965

[00:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
E163 is there though

[00:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
paulgendek: there's a problem with parsing of <legend> in all existing browsers, and you can't practically use <figure> with backup styling until it is fixed

[00:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
paulgendek: I raised the issue with Hixie but he was not inclined to increase the number of elements in HTML to fix it

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
<figure>'s not important enough. just pretend that it's not in html5 and that we added it 3 years from now.

[00:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I tried to limit my suggested closures to thinks that it's just painfully obvious should be closed, and where there has not really been discussion to the contrary

[00:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, any idea when the <legend> parsing issues will be fixed in webkit?

[00:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
once all browsers either adopt HTML5 parsing or at least change parsing of <legend> not found in a <fieldset>, <figure> will be practically usable

[01:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
on a completely different note, does anyone want to volunteer to take point on the encoding aliases issue?

[01:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: at the very latest, when we adopt HTML5 parsing, but I will propose doing it sooner

[01:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what's the issue?

[01:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
lachy: http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-July/021207.html

[01:00:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I don't see E163 there

[01:00:05.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#refsE163 doesn't exist

[01:00:06.0000] <Philip`>
(but is referenced)

[01:00:07.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: hm, odd

[01:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's in the source

[01:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
wonder what broke

[01:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what specifically needs to be done? Do we need to update the IANA registry?

[01:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yeah

[01:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: basically i want to remove the "Additional character encoding aliases" table

[01:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: and just have hte IANA registry be all up to date

[01:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: wtf

[01:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I don't have time to do it right now, but if no-one else volunteers within a few weeks, I might be able to do it

[01:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[01:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
what's the process for updating the IANA registry?

[01:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
depends on the registry; i haven't looked into what it takes to update that one

[01:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
given this line:     href="#refsE163">[E163]</a> <a href="#refsX121">[X121]</a></p>

[01:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie, hsivonen: does either of you think it is useful to continue tracking this as an issue: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/17

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
why does this not match two things:         while ($substedline =~ m/\G.*href="#refs([^"]+)"/osg) {

[01:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
Looks like it will take a few e-mails to this list http://www.iana.org/assignments/charset-info

[01:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: depends on what MQ says now. I'll have to check

[01:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2978

[01:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
would it be inappropriate spamming if I suggested a bunch more issue closures?

[01:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am doing one per message to associate them in the issue tracker

[01:11:03.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, doesn't the issue tracker allow one message to be associated with multiple issues?

[01:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I don't know - I'm counting on the automated detection of ISSUE-nn in the subject

[01:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: we fixed that years ago

[01:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: as far as I can tell, the MQ WS issue still stands

[01:12:03.0000] <Lachy>
looks like it does

[01:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: (U+000B isn't a whitespace character anymore in HTML5)

[01:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
is it fixed in HTML5?

[01:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: oh

[01:13:03.0000] <Lachy>
see http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/1 and http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/4 -- your last mail appears in both

[01:13:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: nice

[01:13:05.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how I forgot

[01:13:06.0000] <Hixie>
i'd forgotten too

[01:13:07.0000] <Hixie>
i just checked :-)

[01:13:08.0000] <Hixie>
had to look up wtf vertical tab was first

[01:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: is it searching the text?

[01:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: so yeah, the issue has been addressed. No point in keeping it open.

[01:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, yes

[01:14:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: do you think it would be better to gang them up?

[01:14:04.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[01:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Because the .* is greedy and will match the whole first href, I expect

[01:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: You probably want .*?

[01:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
ohhh!

[01:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[01:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[01:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would just use "while ($substedline =~ /href="#refs([^"]+)"/g)" which works the same and has fewer funny characters

[01:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's an implied \G?

[01:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
i always had problems using /g

[01:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: is there anything to do in response to this: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/26

[01:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
(without the \G, i mean)

[01:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(it appears to be suggestions for accessibility of the spec text itself)

[01:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
for one of those things we're waiting for gsnedders to add features to anolis

[01:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can't read the bottom two paragraphs, they're too "wall of text" for me

[01:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i have a disability, and whoever wrote that doesn't know how to write accessible comments :-)

[01:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
what's still pending about issue 37?

[01:21:03.0000] <othermaciej>
#3 explains why hex/rgb colors are supposed to be bad

[01:21:04.0000] <hsivonen>
also, wasn't issue 54 addressed long ago?

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: ok fixed, thanks for catching that

[01:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
issue 60 is not realistically actionable

[01:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
#4 in issue-26 looks too vague to be actionable

[01:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
issue 60 should have been closed at the telcon a month ago. It was kept open for silly reasons

[01:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I won't suggest closing it if there are anolis changes planned which will help

[01:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I don't understand why 37 is open, indeed

[01:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also I thought 54 was addressed

[01:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Is anyone but Larry expressing active interest in keeping issue 4 open?

[01:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and 60 should obviously be closed in light of the news about the XHTML2 WG

[01:24:03.0000] <Lachy>
issue 54 is pending the registration of the about: URI scheme

[01:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
I haven't heard from Joseph in a while, so I don't know what he's doing about that RFC

[01:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: no idea - I would hope the chairs would make some assessment of who has objections

[01:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It's similar to an implied \G, except it starts where the previous execution of the current regexp on the current string left off, whereas \G starts where the previous regexp on the current string left off (even if it's a different regexp)

[01:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: (so \G is useful when chaining multiple regexps together, and /g works fine if you're just looping over a single one)

[01:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: ah, i see. yeah, i usually use /g with multiple regexps, that's why i had trouble without \G.

[01:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: thanks.

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
do these remain issues of controversy (it's not clear to me from the issue tracker item what the point is): <http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/27> <http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/28>

[01:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
for 27, i'm fine with the WHATWG registry, but others are probably not

[01:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: (Also the /o is redundant unless you've got interpolated variables in the regexp, and the /s is redundant since you're only processing a single line)

[01:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
28 is fixed by abarth's mimesniff draft

[01:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: (Also you should get rid of all the pesky whitespace and variable names, they're just wasting bytes :-( )

[01:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: Anolis changes for #4 in issue-26?

[01:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yeah i just always include /o and /s

[01:30:04.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: Or one of the others?

[01:30:05.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: Hixie mentioned that something in http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/26 is waiting on anolis changes - I do not know what he had in mind

[01:30:06.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, yeah

[01:30:07.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: /s actually isn't redundant here, one of the operations that makes $line into $substedline can introduce more lines

[01:30:08.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: does the HTML5 spec completely defer to mimesniff now?

[01:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yeah

[01:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: where appropriate, anyway

[01:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders where in the multi-level feedback queue of his to-do list that is

[01:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
oh, there

[01:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs, and heads off to work

[01:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Oh, okay

[01:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I'll try and work out the encoding change today though

[01:32:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Clearly you shouldn't use such confusing variable names like "$substedline", and should try to put absolutely everything into $_

[01:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i don't mind the encoding change at all

[01:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I do. You specify US-ASCII and get UTF-8.

[01:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: this is nested inside several loops, one of which uses $_ :-)

[01:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: k :-)

[01:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: If you specify US-ASCII, you should get US-ASCII.

[01:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I spoke to jgraham about it briefly yesterday, I suspect it is in the PMS code the bug :P

[01:34:02.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, what do you expect calling mutator methods like setHours() on a Date object returned from HTMLTimeElement.time and friends to do?

[01:34:03.0000] <heycam>
anything?

[01:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: can i specify cross-spec cross refs and get those too? :-)

[01:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me stabs Hixie 

[01:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, great, now who will edit the spec?

[01:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
manu, apparently

[01:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I didn't say I killed him, or harmed him that much.

[01:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i expect the Date object to be a real Date object with no relationship to the underlying attribute

[01:36:04.0000] <heycam>
ok, so a new one gets returned every time you access it?

[01:36:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[01:36:06.0000] <heycam>
ok you'll need to say that i think

[01:36:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Just a bit of knife play :P

[01:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: can you add a comment in the comment box to that effect and hit the button? it'll file a bug for you

[01:37:01.0000] <heycam>
sure

[01:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me hopes gsnedders used a stab-proof knife

[01:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
He just used one of those plasic toy knives where the blade goes in

[01:40:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, i'm still not sure of the usefulness of having separate date/time/timezone attributes

[01:40:01.0000] <heycam>
it might be better to have one Date and then booleans to state whether certain parts were present

[01:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, are they anything like those useless plastic, cut-proof scissors often given to children so they can't cut themselves, or paper?

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: it seems that whatever you do, you're going to have to end up creating these Date objects for yourself, typically

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: having just these dates seems as useful or more than one date and booleans

[01:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: They're like http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,526590,00.html

[01:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
the claim about them being inneffective as a weapon seems a little inaccurate

[01:44:01.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, I suppose I'd like to see use cases to convince me.  maybe i'll send mail about it.

[01:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
they may not be effective for stabbing due to the blunt end, but they look to be perfectly effective for slitting someone's throat

[01:45:00.0000] <heycam>
btw are <time>s meant to represent an instance in time or an instance in time and an associated time zone?

[01:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
they seem unlikely to reduce the risk of injuries

[01:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
most accidental knife injuries while cooking are from the edge, not the point

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: heycam: a date, a time, or an instance in time with time zone

[01:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: It seems it's designed to reduce injuries when e.g. a burglar breaks into your house and you disturb him and he grabs the nearest knife and stabs you, not when cooking

[01:46:02.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, ok.  currently the spec says only "The time element represents a precise date and/or a time in the proleptic Gregorian calendar."

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: s/injuries/accidental injuries/

[01:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it might prevent deliberate stabbings, but it would also prevent self-defense with a knife

[01:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Presumably it's no good for premeditated attacks, because you've have to be pretty stupid to intentionally take a stab-proof knife to stab someone with)

[01:47:03.0000] <othermaciej>
then again, the UK doesn't believe in self-defense any more

[01:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[01:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
it may not be effecitve for stabbing, but slicing attacks are still as effective as before

[01:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
unless they make it blunt on the edge as well

[01:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Were slicing attacks still effective before?

[01:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
I imagine they're much harder to do

[01:49:03.0000] <Philip`>
and much harder to cause fatal injuries

[01:49:04.0000] <othermaciej>
if you are any good at knife fighting you can mess up an attacker really bad, probably fatally

[01:49:05.0000] <Lachy>
just grab someone from behind, hold the knife to their throat and slice

[01:49:06.0000] <othermaciej>
or if you are strong enough to overpower someone, you can cut their throat or the like

[01:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me notes that discussing murdering techniques is a new low for this channel :-)

[01:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
just slashing at the arms of someone coming for you, they will quickly reach a point where they are likely to bleed to death

[01:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(forearms)

[01:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, seems more difficult and situational than just shoving the knife into someone's chest and then running off before anyone notices you

[01:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Mostly this is in the context of e.g. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/2078201/Gordon-Brown-urges-tougher-punishments-for-teenage-knife-crime.html and not trained knife fighters)

[02:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess the main use case for the stab-proof knife is "violent hasband flies into a rage and attacks wife"

[02:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
*husband

[02:29:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Are you calling myself and Hixie husband and wife? :\

[02:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd like to have stab-proof knives just to mitigate the consequences of dropping a knife

[02:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me shan't enquire which recesses of gsnedders psyche caused him to infer that

[02:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if the stab-proof knives will be delayed by 20 due to a patent

[02:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
*20 years

jgraham: Well, I seemingly often attack Hixie in a rage…

[02:32:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me thinks something is a bit backwards though, seeming he's the one wearing a girls T-shirt

[02:33:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
well, this is an interesting conversation to walk into...

[02:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's inappropriate for use cases to assign gender to attacker and victim

[02:35:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
GPHemsley: See /topic :)

[02:36:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
you people really should have a logic detector at the entrance

[02:36:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
you can't expect me to remember to voluntarily relinquish it every time I come in here

[02:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me also thinks non-violent discourse without stabbing would be good on #whatwg

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aargh. I just realized that if nodes have been moved from a document to another during the parse, the HTML5 parser in Gecko notifies the subsequent child insertion on the wrong document

[02:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
fixing that in a performant way seems like a can of worms

[02:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I need to ship a pointer to the parser's doc to each tree operation

[02:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh.

[02:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hey. Theora support has migrated from Chrome dev channel to beta channel

[02:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nice

[03:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how hard it would be to generate static status markers from the WHATWG dynamic status marker data

[03:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Not hard but possibly not worthwhile either.

[03:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
I can't imagine that it would make people happy

[03:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
status markers are a bit of a sideshow

[03:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
issues need to actually be resolved in some final way - it's only the total lack of closure on anything in the HTML WG that makes people play games with publishing WD and adding status markers and such

[03:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed. I would rather we spent time resolving issues than shuffling little red boxes around

[03:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: it seems to me that autogenerating the markers into the W3C snapshots would address the issue Manu's draft is said to address

[03:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I agree that actully resolving issues is better

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. looks like Wikipedia now tells a bogus story about video codec debate as far as dates of events go

[04:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.exalead.com/search/web/results/?q=html5 - wow, a site that actually uses SVG for real

[04:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
(in the Languages/Countries pie charts)

[04:45:00.0000] <pablof>
Philip`: http://www.opera.com/company/jobs/ ;-)

[04:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, looks like they didn't write the SVG themselves, they just used http://raphaeljs.com/

[05:18:00.0000] <StefanShipor>
hey people! could you take a look at http://bearditch.com/stuff/debate.html and give your 2cents about the markup. Would you structure it differently? It's for a general tabbed content section of a site. If you have the time or mood ofc.

[05:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://twitter.com/mattur

[05:26:00.0000] <paulgendek>
hsivonen: followed... 

[05:28:00.0000] <paulgendek>
StefanShipor: looks pretty good!

[05:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
paulgendek, StefanShipor: You may find http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/ useful in assessing whether you are using sectioning elements in the right way

[05:31:00.0000] <paulgendek>
cool, thanks!

[05:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
paulgendek: In your case I think you have too many sibling <section>s

[05:32:01.0000] <StefanShipor>
jgraham: but why do the untitled sections appear? http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbearditch.com%2Fstuff%2Fdebate.html

[05:32:02.0000] <StefanShipor>
I waas expecting only one since it doesn't have a heading

[05:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
StefanShipor: You have a <body> with no heading, a <nav> with no heading at the top and two <nav>s with no heading further down

[05:34:01.0000] <paulgendek>
<nav> should have <heading> within?

[05:34:02.0000] <jgraham>
(FWIW I think that the approach to sections with no heading in the spec needs to change)

[05:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
paulgendek: Theoretically, yes

[05:36:00.0000] <paulgendek>
i stared at my dom for a few hours and couldn't think of any other ways of ordering elements, etc.  it seems like the most practical for a real world solution, as a base theme, etc

[05:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
paulgendek: e.g. you miught say <nav><h1>Blogroll</h1></nav>

[05:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
paulgendek: In yoour specific case, I think you want to structure the page so that the main page header is outside of the <section>s

[05:37:01.0000] <paulgendek>
that doesn't make sense, because from what i read, you would put the h-tags in the <header>, followed by the <nav>

[05:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Like <body><header><h1>My blog</h1></header><nav></nav><article><h1>My post</h1></article>

[05:38:01.0000] <paulgendek>
i think body's header should be reserved for accessibility links, in a magazine/blog layout

[05:39:00.0000] <StefanShipor>
there will be lots of navs on sites for navigation through posts and such. I hope they don't leave the heading inside nav mandatory

[05:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
I don't know what you mean by accessibility links really (do you mean "skip to content" type links?) but that seems like a strange belief

[05:39:02.0000] <StefanShipor>
cause if you fave "older" and "newer" it's already pretty self-explanatory

[05:40:00.0000] <StefanShipor>
have*

[05:40:01.0000] <paulgendek>
it's nowhere near 2022, we still need to be practical here...

[05:40:02.0000] <paulgendek>
in 2009/2010, i still need skip to content links

[05:41:00.0000] <paulgendek>
may be a want, idk

[05:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
paulgendek: Maybe, I'm not sure what the state of the art in AT is in this regard. But I see no readon why that precludes having a header for the body

[05:42:00.0000] <paulgendek>
because in modern web design, where we have containers, centered, with borders, padding, maybe even nested with special corners, etc

[05:42:01.0000] <paulgendek>
the body header should be reserved for top-most content

[05:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
What is the title of your blog if not topmost content?

[05:43:01.0000] <paulgendek>
like an admin bar that is position absolute, or leaderboard ads that are outside of the centered/bordered container, or the accessibility links that are hidden for screen

[05:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
In any case, at the very least the articles on the page should be nested below the main page title otherwise your markup has the wrong structure (which will show up as an incorrect outline)

[05:45:01.0000] <paulgendek>
we can agree that title of the blog should be an h1, which will take its order correctly just by being an h1... let it be in section#header's header with the site slogan, logo, and primary nav... better for designing real website header sections

[05:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
paulgendek: That's not how headers work in HTML5

[05:46:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: Why should one section's header apply to one of its siblings?

[05:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
Any header can be a <h1> as long as you get the structual elements right

[05:47:00.0000] <paulgendek>
or for the sake of having a clean outline, and the elements where they need to be in the dom for design, should we then hide the h1 in body header, and use an h2 for the logo in the actual header section of the design?

[05:47:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: Why is it a section, even?

[05:47:02.0000] <paulgendek>
because it's a page layout section

[05:47:03.0000] <jgraham>
Note that <header> is not a sectioning element

[05:47:04.0000] <paulgendek>
"header, content, sidebar, footer"

[05:47:05.0000] <hsivonen>
about.validator.nu, etc. going down now

[05:48:00.0000] <paulgendek>
exactly, section is sectioning, which is why i apply the id to sections, for building the page structure

[05:48:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: "section" is _not_ a page layout section. It is a semantic section.

[05:48:02.0000] <paulgendek>
gsnedders|work: the spec says that it's flow AND structural

[05:48:03.0000] <jgraham>
Doing <body><section><header><h1>My blog instead of <body><header><h1>My blog is both unnecessary and wrong 

[05:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
Unless you further nest all other content in that outer section

[05:49:01.0000] <paulgendek>
headers are only for sections and articles

[05:49:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
the body is a section.

[05:49:03.0000] <paulgendek>
body's header is reserved for top content imo

[05:50:00.0000] <paulgendek>
at least, in blog layout

[05:50:01.0000] <paulgendek>
maybe for a single page site or basic app

[05:50:02.0000] <paulgendek>
sure

[05:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
paulgendek: I don't see how to reach your opinion from the spec or from logic

[05:50:04.0000] <paulgendek>
but not for magazine/blog layout that can be fairly complex

[05:50:05.0000] <annevk42>
http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp19#section-2.4 how can HTML be a character set?

[05:50:06.0000] <jgraham>
But I have toi go now...

[05:50:07.0000] <paulgendek>
jgraham: i'll continue to work on it, and we'll see how it goes, thanks

[05:52:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: If you absolutely don't want the body's header to be that, which I think is what you do, then don't you want the whole page in that section?

[05:53:00.0000] <paulgendek>
i see it as the body has a header and a footer, and sections... and all of the structural sections are grouped in a div#container to remain ambiguous... body's header for top most meta-ish content, body footer for debug/version info, javascripts, etc

[05:54:00.0000] <paulgendek>
the #container can then constrain the width and be centered of all the structural sections of the layout

[05:54:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
What is wrong with using header for the header?

[05:55:00.0000] <paulgendek>
i think there is confusion between <header> as the top part of a section, and #header which is the container for the structural header of a design

[05:56:00.0000] <paulgendek>
gsnedders|work: because any css done to the body header for a complex design's header section would nest a lot of selectors based off of "header", which would inherit down to all other headers, you would need to use body > header:first-child, which is much more to type, and not really much more semantic, body is more like a canvas for sections imo

[05:57:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: Per the spec, body is a section.

[05:57:01.0000] <paulgendek>
i'm a front-end developer and i bring this up from tons of real-world application in common practice

[05:57:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: And yes, you do end up with complex selectors in CSS doing almost anything

[05:58:00.0000] <annevk42>
hmm, all the charset registry lists are offline?

[05:58:01.0000] <paulgendek>
it's much easier for css and javascript to target #header than body > header:first-child

[05:58:02.0000] <annevk42>
btw, if I'm right and we cannot use the Unicode mapping algorithm for charsets we prolly need to register more aliases

[05:58:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
then give the body > header:first-child an id of header

[05:58:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
annevk42: http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets wfm

[05:58:05.0000] <paulgendek>
but then you'll have <header id="header"> which is then pointless 

[05:59:00.0000] <paulgendek>
might as well go back to it being a div

[05:59:01.0000] <paulgendek>
at least it's 3 less chars on open/close

[05:59:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: @id has no semantic value anyway, id="foobar" is just as meaningful. It's just a way to select the element.

[05:59:03.0000] <annevk42>
gsnedders|work, that's not a mailing list

[05:59:04.0000] <paulgendek>
and the container with #header is a structural section of a design, not necessarily the header of body

[05:59:05.0000] <Philip`>
"12:52 < jgraham> [...] <body><header><h1>My blog is both unnecessary and wrong" - sounds like an accurate description of many blogs

[05:59:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
annevk42: It is a charset registry list :D

[06:00:00.0000] <annevk42>
sure, but not the one I'm after

[06:00:01.0000] <annevk42>
/me wants ietf-charsets⊙io archives

[06:00:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
annevk42: I don't think I ever managed to subscribe to that when I tried

[06:01:00.0000] <annevk42>
it is supposed to be based here: http://mail.apps.ietf.org/ietf/charsets/threads.html

[06:01:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That's long gone

[06:01:02.0000] <annevk42>
doh

[06:01:03.0000] <annevk42>
where's Julian when you need him

[06:02:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Not on IRC? :)

[06:04:00.0000] <beowulf>
paulgendek: can't you select every header but the body header on the basis that they're all children of another element?

[06:05:00.0000] <Lachy_>
annevk42, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-charsets/

[06:05:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy_: That's older and more dead :P

[06:05:02.0000] <Lachy_>
I noticed taht

[06:05:03.0000] <Lachy_>
*that

[06:05:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
beowulf: Only with :not that really isn't well supported

[06:06:00.0000] <annevk42>
yeah, that's not the archive I was looking for

[06:06:01.0000] <annevk42>
I wonder if we should email iana⊙io

[06:06:02.0000] <beowulf>
header {foo:bar}; body * header {foo:none} # no?

[06:06:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I guess

[06:06:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
beowulf: That would work, but you then have to override everything

[06:07:00.0000] <beowulf>
gsnedders|work: c'est la vie

[06:07:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
beowulf: Only CSS 3 Selectors can be relied upon, body > header and *:not(body) > header

[06:07:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
*Once

[06:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you want to style a specific element, why would you not simply use id?

[06:08:01.0000] <beowulf>
Philip`: iurro

[06:09:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Because @id is _so_ yesterday, and XPointer is _so_ the future.

[06:09:01.0000] <paulgendek>
like i said, maybe in 2015 or whatever, but right now i have to cover all bases, which means older browsers and screen readers, and search crawlers

[06:09:02.0000] <beowulf>
i don't have bare headers in my documents, so it doesn't apply to me :)

[06:09:03.0000] <beowulf>
the top header is usually nested in a <div id=banner> or some such

[06:09:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: Why doesn't @id work now?

[06:10:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: If you want to get one specific element, it seems the most sensible way

[06:10:01.0000] <paulgendek>
header for body, section, article, aside, nav, sure... but that doesnt mean the same as the structural header of the design

[06:11:00.0000] <beowulf>
paulgendek: but that has nothing to do with css, surely?

[06:11:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: How does that effect selecting elements?

[06:11:02.0000] <paulgendek>
it affects css, with the > and :first-child selectors not being supported in ie6

[06:11:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
paulgendek: Well how would you select a specific p element for example?

[06:12:00.0000] <paulgendek>
nested selectors

[06:12:01.0000] <paulgendek>
section#primary article header p

[06:12:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
And when you can't do that?

[06:12:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Because of other siblings, or whatever)

[06:13:00.0000] <beowulf>
paulgendek: doesn't that get all the p's in a header? how do you get just one specific p?

[06:13:01.0000] <paulgendek>
if there is a reason to target that specific p versus the others, then the article would need an id to specify why it's different

[06:13:02.0000] <paulgendek>
section#primary article.different-view header p

[06:13:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
How does that not apply to the case of getting one specific header?

[06:13:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
What is so different between the two cases?

[06:13:05.0000] <paulgendek>
seems like going backwards though

[06:13:06.0000] <beowulf>
paulgendek: that would still get all the p's in the header, no?

[06:13:07.0000] <paulgendek>
<header id="header">

[06:14:00.0000] <paulgendek>
just looks wrong

[06:14:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Is that more backwards than <p id=p>?

[06:14:02.0000] <beowulf>
<header id=banner>

[06:14:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
<header id=pageheader>?

[06:14:04.0000] <beowulf>
<header id=typeline>

[06:14:05.0000] <beowulf>
<header id=hammer>

[06:14:06.0000] <paulgendek>
beowulf: ok, header#banner, sure, but that still is not the header of a layout where you would place user meta, logo, site name/slogan, primary menu, search, etc

[06:15:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Well what header is it?

[06:15:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I'm sure you can come up with a sensible id for it.,

[06:15:02.0000] <paulgendek>
the body's header, which i said i'd prefer to reserve for accessibility links, banners, admin bars, etc

[06:15:03.0000] <beowulf>
paulgendek: when i do html like that i create a div called banner, and place header in it with all that other stuff as siblings

[06:15:04.0000] <beowulf>
div with id banner

[06:15:05.0000] <paulgendek>
the "header" that contains a design's header elements are a section, imo

[06:16:00.0000] <beowulf>
selecting the header is then simply #banner header

[06:16:01.0000] <paulgendek>
why a div? it's structural

[06:16:02.0000] <paulgendek>
div/span seems to be block/inline containers for design

[06:17:00.0000] <beowulf>
is that not what we're talking about?

[06:18:00.0000] <beowulf>
perhaps i'm being stupid

[06:19:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me thinks that trying to describe what design you're talking about in words is never going to be as effective as showing us it graphically

[06:20:00.0000] <paulgendek>
i have to run to work

[06:20:01.0000] <paulgendek>
but here's the design in question 

[06:20:02.0000] <paulgendek>
http://paulgendek.com/html5

[06:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
We could avoid a lot of debate if the new elements were named <element0>, <element1>, etc, instead of <section>, <header>, etc, because that would avoid the problem of people having different intepretations of what the names mean

[06:21:01.0000] <paulgendek>
well i don't agree that <header> is the same a section#header

[06:21:02.0000] <paulgendek>
but we will continue this some other time ;)

[06:21:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
It isn't.

[06:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ooh, there's the "WAHTWG" image again

[06:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: That would be too easy to confuse. How about naming them after animals instead?

[06:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders where it originally came from

[06:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Hmm, that could work

[06:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Then we could add easy-to-remember conventions to distinguish different classes of elements, e.g. inline elements can be named after insects while block elements are named after mammals, so you never have to wonder "hmm, is <video> inline or block?" because it'll be obvious from the name

[06:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Do yo have a bug on file about adding document outline functionality to validator.nu?

[06:31:00.0000] <beowulf>
paulgendek: http://pastie.org/private/9iv6v5eikq3ahbccblhxig # that's how I'd go about it, though I could be wrong

[06:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I think I do, but the bugzilla machine is undergoing a dist upgrade

[06:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: OK

[06:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hrm. interpid seems to map .ogg to audio/ogg rather than application/ogg

[06:33:02.0000] <beowulf>
(there is no need for that class on the nav, obv)

[06:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
beowulf: What's the point of <div class=page>?

[06:34:01.0000] <beowulf>
jgraham: you need a wrapper for the 'page' in the design

[06:34:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh OK

[06:35:00.0000] <beowulf>
a div of a certain width that sits margin auto left and right in the middle of the page

[06:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
I assume just styling <body> doesn't work for some reason that isn't clear in your fragment

[06:35:02.0000] <beowulf>
jgraham: correct

[06:36:00.0000] <beowulf>
jgraham: i'd have to try hard to remember why though :)

[06:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
"OSError: [Errno 26] Text file busy" - WTF?

[06:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
What was my file doing?

[06:42:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll stop looking at that.

[09:05:00.0000] <beowulf>
/me starts editing a spec with warnings on the warnings

[09:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Warning: This warning is controversial"?

[09:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
Add that into each of the warnings, and then everyone should be happy

[09:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Warning: This warning may be self-referential

[09:07:01.0000] <beowulf>
I just want one that says "Danger Will Robinson!" or something

[09:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I see the poll is open. A comment about vote whipping is trying to find its way here.

[09:57:00.0000] <d8uv>
<article pubdate="2009-08-19">[stuff]</article> is invalid. @pubdate can only work for full time AND date strings. This is stupid as hell. 

[10:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
d8uv, not to worry, the pubdate attribute should be dropped anyway

[10:04:01.0000] <sbp>
Lachy: should be as in it is your opinion that it ought to be dropped?

[10:04:02.0000] <sbp>
Lachy: or should be as in it should soon actually be dropped as this is planned?

[10:05:00.0000] <d8uv>
I kinda like the pubdate attribute, honestly. It'd be better if it were more like atom:updated

[10:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
should be as soon as Hixie deals with my feedback about it and realises how much of a stupid idea it was to add it

[10:05:02.0000] <Lachy>
use the <time> element instead

[10:05:03.0000] <Lachy>
visible metadata is always better

[10:05:04.0000] <sbp>
so the former... :-)

[10:05:05.0000] <d8uv>
That's a damn good point

[10:05:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: The time element still requires datetime, so you don't avoid the issue.

[10:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
time doesn't require a full date AND time. It allows just dates or just times

[10:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
"The datetime  attribute, if present, must contain a valid date or time string that identifies the date or time being specified."

[10:07:01.0000] <sbp>
Lachy: where ought the <time> element be used to *explicitly* associate it with the <article>?

[10:07:02.0000] <d8uv>
Yeah. What I'm working on is HTML5 -> Atom, sans micro*

[10:07:03.0000] <sbp>
otherwise you might just be mentioning random times in your article content

[10:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
<article><h1>Heading</h1><p>By Author, <time>2009-08-11</time></p> ...</article>

[10:08:01.0000] <d8uv>
And time is too floofy semantically to be of terrible use

[10:08:02.0000] <sbp>
how does that explicitly associate it?

[10:08:03.0000] <Lachy>
you may also wish to throw in a <header> element there too

[10:08:04.0000] <sbp>
that would require natural language parsing

[10:08:05.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't

[10:08:06.0000] <Lachy>
what's your use case for requiring explicit association?

[10:08:07.0000] <sbp>
so, it's impossible to explicitly associate it?

[10:09:00.0000] <sbp>
d8uv's HTML5 -> Atom thing

[10:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
currently, yes, but there were ideas floated yesterday about how to achieve that

[10:09:02.0000] <sbp>
hmm. what kind of options were mooted?

[10:09:03.0000] <sbp>
got a reference?

[10:09:04.0000] <Lachy>
does the hAtom microformat solve your use case?

[10:09:05.0000] <Lachy>
check the IRC logs for yesterday

[10:10:00.0000] <d8uv>
Use case being how to best semantically do article headers/footers, using explicit data

[10:10:01.0000] <d8uv>
And yeah, I breathe hAtom, but... with hAtom, it's kind of an all-or-nothing thing

[10:10:02.0000] <Lachy>
d8uv, that's not a use case. Why do you need to "semantically do article headers/footers, using explicit data"

[10:11:00.0000] <sbp>
hmm. time/@for=$id and time/@role='pubdate'

[10:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
sbp, yeah, something like that

[10:11:02.0000] <sbp>
ref: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090810#l-326

[10:11:03.0000] <d8uv>
Pretty much to do hAtom, but natively. The use cases for hAtom are really really strong, and I think too strong to hide in Microformat land

[10:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
or there's various RDFa/Microdata/Microformts solutions as well

[10:12:01.0000] <d8uv>
Yeah, I'm working on all of the former, honestly

[10:13:00.0000] <d8uv>
I just hate overloading @class with stuff that would be better expressed explicitly using native semantics

[10:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me agress that bolt-on sematics are less nice than baked in ones

[10:14:00.0000] <tantekc_>
d8uv - web designers have been using the class attribute to "subclass" elements for nearly a decade now. so it's a solution that's both works and has been widely adopted in the wild

[10:14:01.0000] <tantekc_>
hence why microformats took advantage of that existing design pattern

[10:14:02.0000] <sbp>
Lachy: does this mean you'd like ins/@datetime removed too?

[10:15:00.0000] <sbp>
(and del/@datetime)

[10:15:01.0000] <tantekc_>
jgraham - indeed, microformats specifically instructs authors to make use of native language semantics *before* using microformats.

[10:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
sbp, those are questionable. But given their nature, they really can't use visible metadata alternatives. It's more a question of whether or not they're acutally useful in practice

[10:16:01.0000] <tantekc_>
sbp ins/del with datetime attribute is purely backward compat IMHO. I wouldn't recommend authors actually use those tags since they encourage invisible metadata.

[10:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
I've never seen an application actually make use of the datetime attribute on ins and del elements

[10:17:00.0000] <tantekc_>
Lachy - every mediawiki diff page

[10:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me would happily remove <ins> and <del>

[10:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
tantekc_, oh, I stand corrected

[10:17:03.0000] <sbp>
well, I was thinking about <ins datetime="..."><article>...</></> for doing what d8uv asks

[10:17:04.0000] <tantekc_>
with green and red inserted/deleted sections

[10:17:05.0000] <tantekc_>
and *visible* date time information

[10:17:06.0000] <tantekc_>
in practice, real world examples of ins and del have visible datetimes or at least titles

[10:17:07.0000] <Lachy>
I didn't realise they actually used the datetime attributes

[10:17:08.0000] <d8uv>
Is there any block-level equivalent to @datetime?

[10:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
d8uv, I don't understand the question

[10:18:01.0000] <sbp>
shame that certain attributes can't be agglomerated together on mouseover. so for example, if you had <article title="ABC" pubdate="2008"> a mouseover on that could display "ABC / Published: 2008" or something

[10:19:00.0000] <sbp>
that would solve the visible metadata problem. it'd be visible!

[10:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
tantekc_, are there any client side applications that make use of the datetime attributes on ins and del elements though?

[10:19:02.0000] <d8uv>
@datetime is used on time, ins, and del. To say that X happened on D date. I'd love to see something like that, but for section content

[10:19:03.0000] <tantekc_>
Lachy - not that I know of, but I haven't particularly searched, so I wouldn't claim that there aren't any.

[10:19:04.0000] <Lachy>
sbp, it'd also be incredibly annoying

[10:20:00.0000] <sbp>
well, that's a subjective opinion

[10:20:01.0000] <sbp>
I'm not sure how to find out whether it really would be

[10:20:02.0000] <tantekc_>
sbp - indeed, even partial visibility (e.g. via title attribute) is better than invisibility.

[10:20:03.0000] <sbp>
apart from doing a wide poll

[10:20:04.0000] <Lachy>
sbp, just imagine hoving your mouse anywhere over an article and having a tooltip displayed constantly?

[10:21:00.0000] <sbp>
no, I mean only for certain attributes

[10:21:01.0000] <sbp>
so basically certain attributes could be treated as @title adjuncts

[10:21:02.0000] <d8uv>
That's what sbp does on his blog, actually

[10:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
sure, I get what you mean. I just don't think it's usually a good idea to give a tooltip to an entire article

[10:21:04.0000] <Lachy>
where is sbp's blog?

[10:22:00.0000] <sbp>
so article/@title is a bad idea too?

[10:22:01.0000] <sbp>
my blog is a bunch of cheats, I wouldn't take it seriously

[10:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
I generally wouldn't use it

[10:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
but there may be a few cases that it might be acceptble

[10:27:00.0000] <sbp>
thinking about it, the date information is only required in Atom

[10:27:01.0000] <sbp>
there is a motivation for it being secret. I might not want to display it

[10:27:02.0000] <sbp>
as a matter of fact, I don't like displaying dates in my articles

[10:27:03.0000] <sbp>
I don't find them important on a trashy weblog

[10:28:00.0000] <sbp>
but they are required by Atom

[10:28:01.0000] <annevk42>
display:none?

[10:28:02.0000] <d8uv>
BTW, Lachy? You rule. And have convinced me to drop article@pubdate, for the verdant fields of footer/time@datetime. If I want to make it more explicit, I'll use Microdata, possibly RDFa or microformats

[10:28:03.0000] <sbp>
so I wonder about @data-date

[10:28:04.0000] <sbp>
annevk42: sure, or that. but @data-* require no styling at least :-)

[10:28:05.0000] <tantekc_>
d8uv - feel free to hang out in #microformats and ask any questions about hAtom

[10:28:06.0000] <annevk42>
or pubdata then :)

[10:29:00.0000] <sbp>
annevk42: well, in the context of Lachy wanting @pubdate removed...

[10:29:01.0000] <sbp>
sure, if @pubdate stays then obviously that'd be the thing to use...

[10:29:02.0000] <Lachy>
sbp, dates are very useful for readers, as it gives some temporal context to an article.

[10:30:00.0000] <d8uv>
I love microformats, and hAtom has saved me thousands of hours of work, due to my unconventional workflow

[10:30:01.0000] <sbp>
Lachy: temporal context is not important for my articles

[10:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
sbp, it takes talent to be able to write articles of a timeless nature

[10:30:03.0000] <sbp>
no, the opposite

[10:30:04.0000] <Lachy>
I guess it depends what you write about

[10:30:05.0000] <sbp>
I mean I do not expect them even worth reading now

[10:30:06.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[10:31:00.0000] <sbp>
so why date them? :-)

[10:31:01.0000] <d8uv>
sbp writes mainly about 80s hairstyles, so... you know. Dates aren't important, really

[10:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
sbp, can you give a link to your blog?

[10:31:03.0000] <sbp>
yeah. you're just going there for folicular action really

[10:31:04.0000] <sbp>
http://inamidst.com/whits/

[10:31:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Well, personally, I just mindlessly vandalize my own blog, if you believe jgraham, at least.

[10:32:00.0000] <sbp>
note that I'm using HTML5, but only those elements and attributes which were already available in HTML 4.01. the source is just a few lines of python2, http://inamidst.com/whits/code/iris/feed.py

[10:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, that's true. you're site is unique case in which it's administrator is also considered an out of control vandal

[10:34:01.0000] <d8uv>
gsnedders works with Hixie?

[10:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
d8uv, on HTML5, yes, like the rest of us. But otherwise no

[10:35:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I mean, it's hardly as if I stabbed him earlier.

[10:35:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
With one of those toy plastic knives, though, so no harm done.

[10:35:03.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[10:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
So, do I point out that removing @summary never put us in conflict with another spec or not?

[10:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
I have written the email but I am scared of a new thread being generated

[10:37:00.0000] <sbp>
point out to whom?

[10:37:01.0000] <sbp>
have WAI PF said much more about this issue?

[10:37:02.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, no

[10:37:03.0000] <sbp>
last time I went looking, just a few days ago, it seemed they were very quiet

[10:38:00.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, there's no real benefit to saying "you were wrong" imo

[10:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk42: You might be right. But the point is really that where HTML 5 is actually in conflict with other specs it is generally because of irreconcilable technical differences between those specs and required browser behaviour

[10:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Manu seems to want to paint it as "WHATWG are selfish and don't care about anyone else's ideas"

[10:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, that's been pointed out before

[10:40:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Which part?

[10:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
the part about removing @summary not actually conflicting with another spec

[10:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
in that it only contradicts a non-normative guidline in a NOTE

[10:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Indeed. But it is still being presented as if it were an actual spec conflict

[10:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
I know. But there doesn't appear to be much that can be done to make them acknowledge that fact

[10:42:01.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, we've not always approached every group when there was a problem

[10:42:02.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, e.g. CharMod was after the fact, I think

[10:42:03.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, for URLs we did try, but were initially rejected

[10:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk42: Yeah, but we had a meeting with the i18n people and explained the requirements and everything was more or less OK

[10:43:01.0000] <sbp>
funny thing is that WAI PF aren't even chartered

[10:43:02.0000] <Lachy>
what?

[10:43:03.0000] <sbp>
their charter expired in 30th June 2009

[10:43:04.0000] <sbp>
*on

[10:43:05.0000] <jgraham>
So it wasn't like we were unwilling to work with others

[10:43:06.0000] <Lachy>
didn't it get renewed?

[10:43:07.0000] <sbp>
not according to the charter, nope

[10:44:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I guess it's in the process of being renewed.

[10:44:01.0000] <sbp>
if it did, the charter hasn't been updated to reflect that

[10:44:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
CSS WG was unchartered for a time

[10:44:03.0000] <sbp>
probably. they keep giving it little extensions, which is weird

[10:44:04.0000] <sbp>
I don't know why they don't just heap another couple of years on it

[10:44:05.0000] <sbp>
probably internal stuff going on

[10:44:06.0000] <Lachy>
It would make much more sense if they were just given a perpetual charter with the ability to revise it when needed

[10:44:07.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, maybe you should ask Manu first for a list of where he fails we have not taken our input to other groups

[10:45:00.0000] <sbp>
yeah, that'd be fine

[10:45:01.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, maybe his concern is that we put anything in the draft at all without first solving the issue

[10:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk42: Maybe. Which might be a reasonable position (dunno how it would work in practice) but it's not really what he said

[10:46:01.0000] <sbp>
also I notice Janina Sajka signs herself PFWG chair

[10:46:02.0000] <sbp>
whereas the charter says Al Gilman is still chair

[10:46:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Charters often aren't updated for chair changes, FWIW

[10:46:04.0000] <sbp>
ah

[10:47:00.0000] <sbp>
ah yes, the homepage is accurate

[10:47:01.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, since this borders on having a process discussion better safe than sorry applies :)

[10:48:00.0000] <annevk42>
well, maybe not, but this discussion has been going back and forth a long time already, so figuring out what everyone wants first seems better

[10:49:00.0000] <sbp>
better Spiderman than sorry...

[10:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me also notes that if the intent of the warnings draft is to make the draft indicate the stability of various sections of HTML5 then it is woefully inadequate and the process that people have been talking about using to get issues is not going to help

[10:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen's suggestion of porting the WHATWG annotaions would work better

[10:52:00.0000] <sbp>
I'm off. thanks for your help, Lachy et al.

[10:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is anyone intending/planning to actually port the annotations?

[10:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I have too many other things to do to add more things to the pile at the moment

[11:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, port them to where?

[11:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: To the W3C version

[11:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
(without scripting)

[12:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.w3.org/mid/PM-GA.20090811195755.954F1.1.1D⊙sc

[12:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
      Philip`: Now watch that email get buried

[12:01:00.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, maybe you should call it out

[12:01:01.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, Manu is not really representing things factual

[12:02:00.0000] <annevk42>
also, if it's just about other specifications, why does microdata need to be called out?

[12:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Now watch that email get buried

[12:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
      "... the idea that it is not dangerous to read any part of the standard" - hmm, it can often be dangerous to one's composure and/or sanity

[12:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
      So any section without a warning is set in stone?

[12:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
      I think we should carve the HTML5 spec into a mountain, so that it won't be lost to future archeologists

[13:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh no, Manu's draft has pulled ahead in the polls :-(

[13:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh well, I suppose, even if it is published, at least it will become irrelevant as soon as its published

[13:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: there's already a version of the contents list that has static issue markers, iirc

[13:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: ask mikesmith

[13:24:00.0000] <tantekc__>
    Lachy - it appears that the form presents the *option* to cc answers to public-html, but by default no-one is cc'd.

[13:26:00.0000] <tantekc>
      tabulated results: http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/wd08/results

[13:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
tantekc, I know. That's what I've been looking at

[14:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  Lachy: I see more "yes" votes for the vanilla draft so far

[14:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
      This doesn't actually specifiy votes for or against :) "I prefer to publish only the one Editor's Draft receiving the most votes as a Working Draft."

[14:26:00.0000] <anne-w>
       test

[14:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  lol

[14:27:00.0000] <anne-w>
       guess it works... what happened to the logs?

[14:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
    anne-w: fail

[14:27:02.0000] <Dashiva>
      Too bad Ericsson isn't sending in 39 people to vote here

[14:27:03.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, it changed in the short time since I said Manu's was in the lead

[14:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  Lachy: seems like it will be close, either way

I updated my response to the poll linking to jgraham's comments http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0447.html

oops, wrong link

[15:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  how long is the poll going to be open?

[15:12:01.0000] <Lachy_>
       "This questionnaire is open from 2009-08-10 to 2009-08-17."

[15:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  fun, fun

[15:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
      I don't get this comment: "I just dislike having content inside attributes in general..."

[15:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
      It's for a 'yes' vote to Hixie's draft

[15:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  maybe an elliptical comment about summary?

[15:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  it looks like there are only 2 people who voted yes on both documents

[15:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  if I am doing my math right

[15:37:02.0000] <Dashiva>
      I wonder if they know about the poll flaw

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/wd08/results?view=compact is a more useful view, i think

[15:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me shakes fist at Member-only

[15:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  it looks like the WG really doesn't want to publish two competing documents

[15:41:02.0000] <Lachy_>
       oh, much better

[15:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I'm not clear on how voting yes on both amounts to an abstain - is it just because it fails to express a preference, where voters may have a preference in the case we publish only one?

[15:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
      othermaciej: Yes

[15:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
      If you had voted for only one, the 'do both' would still have failed, but your preference would be better placed to be the one

[15:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  I guess preferred / acceptable / unacceptable would have been better than yes / no voting

woah, the IANA said we shouldn't have ports for WebSocket, and should just reuse HTTP's ports

[15:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  that's... surprising

[15:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  but good

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
they also said that if we used our own ports, we shouldn't have two, but should just use one and upgrade in-line

[16:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure how they expect that to work with http...

[16:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  there is such a thing as TLS upgrade

[16:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
sure, but nobody uses it because it's a security nightmare

[16:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I am not sure if it is actually deployed and usable in practice

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
they also said that if we want to use a port than isn't HTTP, we should not use a system port

[16:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  also surprising

[17:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  rubys: any thoughts on my suggested issue closures?

[17:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: he was only here about 60 seconds

[17:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, no, rubys is still here

[17:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
rubys2 left

[17:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  Hixie: yeah, he just changed nicks

[17:18:03.0000] <roc>
  othermaciej: you might be interested in this: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/1238.html

[17:18:04.0000] <roc>
  in fact, it would be good to get some feedback

[17:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  roc: we discussed it briefly among web folks and font folks

[17:19:01.0000] <roc>
  oh good

[17:19:02.0000] <roc>
  http://www.jfkew.plus.com/webotf/webotf-test.html too

[17:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  roc: we are not at all enthusiastic about implementing a new font format

[17:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  roc: and grabbing only chunks of it at a time would be pretty hard to shoehorn into our font infrastructure

[17:20:01.0000] <roc>
  you don't have to grab only chunks of it at a time

[17:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  roc: if all other browsers want to push something, we won't block it, but I don't think we are going to actively endorse any new format

[17:21:00.0000] <roc>
  ok

[17:21:01.0000] <roc>
  thanks

[17:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
google's in pretty much the same position -- we are fine with TTF.

[17:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
if operating systems add support for WebOTF, we would probably follow suit

[17:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
but on its own, it doesn't really seem to solve any pressing problems

[17:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  we are also fine with TTF/OTF, and would not consider WebOTF an improvement

[17:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  but we are less opposed to it than EOT or anything EOT based, since it does not seem to have DRM-like characteristics

[17:22:02.0000] <rubys>
i'm back

[17:22:03.0000] <heycam>
       Hixie, are you sure that "Sean Hogen" in the Acknowledgements section shouldn't be "Sean Hogan"?

[17:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  hi!

[17:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i am not

[17:23:02.0000] <heycam>
       (i remember seeing someone with the latter name send mails, but not the former)

[17:23:03.0000] <rubys>
what's the question?

[17:23:04.0000] <rubys>
irc archives appear to be down

[17:23:05.0000] <othermaciej>
  rubys: I wanted to get your thoughts on my suggested closures of old issues, but I decided to just make a proposal for how to proceed with them on public-html

[17:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  rubys: that being said, your input is still welcome if you have any

[17:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: regarding your comment in the poll, the reason i removed that issue marker was that i was under the impression that the issue had been resolved as part of the compromise maciej set out -- removing the issue marker was one of the things jf and maciej agreed to as far as i understood it

[17:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: and i didn't see your e-mails about it (there was a lot of traffic at the time, i must have missed one)

[17:24:03.0000] <rubys>
othermaciej: where is the proposal?

[17:25:00.0000] <rubys>
hixie: we clearly have a different idea of what closed means, but that's OK

[17:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  rubys: oh, I guess I didn't send it yet

[17:25:02.0000] <rubys>
I guess that would explain why I couldn't find it.

[17:26:00.0000] <rubys>
yes, I do have thoughts...

[17:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  rubys: my suggestion was going to be, close ISSUE-5, ISSUE-6, ISSUE-9, ISSUE-10, ISSUE-11, ISSUE-12, ISSUE-13, ISSUE-16, ISSUE-17, ISSUE-20, ISSUE-26 and ISSUE-28 on Monday if there are no objections

[17:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  and I was planning to ask the team contacts to give me issue tracker edit rights to do it

[17:26:03.0000] <rubys>
oh, I can give you that now.

[17:27:00.0000] <rubys>
but I wouldn't suggest any sudden closure. Weren't you complaining a short while back about a particular vote being rushed? :-)

[17:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  (I sent emails justifying closing each of those issues and soliciting feedback.)

[17:27:02.0000] <rubys>
oh, I think you are aright on all counts except for the one that Julian owns.

[17:27:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  if you would like to suggest a different process for closing them, then I'm fine with that

[17:27:04.0000] <rubys>
and if nobody steps forward and agrees to work an item, it should be closed.

[17:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I think some reasonable period to object to closing is an adequate process, I am willing to make the time period whatever you think is best, if it's not unreasonable long

[17:29:00.0000] <rubys>
it looks like I'm chairing again on thursday, my plan was to announce that the issues that you identified that have no owners will be closed by the next thursday unless somebody steps forward to owning it.

[17:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  I'm willing to leave Julian's open if he insists on it, although I think an issue about an old feature proposal he had is not the right way to represent the fact that he'd like to review a related section of the spec and give some feedback

[17:29:02.0000] <rubys>
he seems to agree that there won't be any major change.

[17:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  the issue is pretty explicitly about a particular kind of major change, so it doesn't seem to represent his intent

[17:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  that being said, I am satisfied to keep it open for now

[17:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  though at some point, Julian's intent to do some review can't block Last Call, if he continues not to do it

[17:31:01.0000] <rubys>
totally agreed on that last point

[17:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  rubys: OK if I send email summarizing this discussion? ("Issues to be announced at Thursday's telecon, and closed next Thursday except for ones where someone objects and steps up to own it." basically)

[17:33:00.0000] <svl>
/me (n=me⊙idn) has left #whatwg

[17:33:01.0000] <rubys>
you can now edit issues.  I love the work you have done, just make sure that you give people an opportunity.

[17:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I'm trying to be extremely conservative in issues that I propose to close, and I intend to give everyone adequate opportunity to object

[17:34:01.0000] <rubys>
as I said, I was going to include it on the announce I was sending out tomorrow, but if you feel you want to go ahead, that's fine.  I feel that announce is low traffic and there is no excuses to miss an email (me glances towards hixie :-))

[17:34:02.0000] <Dashiva>
      What about those of us who only read public-html and not announces? :)

[17:34:03.0000] <rubys>
then you get to read it later (in the minutes :-))

[17:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I think I'll send it separately and mention that you will also mention the details in the announcement, since I think there are people who will be interested, but habitually skip (or at best skim) the announcements

[17:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: oh you sent your comment in an agenda e-mail? i don't read those, they seem to never change.

[17:35:02.0000] <rubys>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0315.html

[17:35:03.0000] <rubys>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0330.html

[17:35:04.0000] <rubys>
no, my comment wasn't in those.  Chris's agenda emails are formulaic, but I try to add more 'spice' to mine.

[17:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i saw your e-mail of those two, but it didn't seem to be a question, so i decided it'd be better for everyone if i didn't add fuel to the fire

[17:39:00.0000] <rubys>
othermaciej: I totally agree about moving 12 and 20 from issues to bugzilla on testcases

[17:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
the first one was from laura, and i'm still waiting for her to explain how i wasn't cooperating before i reply to her e-mails

[17:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
as i'm tired of sending e-mails with questions, and never getting replies

[17:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
yet getting called on not replying to questions

[17:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, as i said, the reason i didn't include the issue marker was that was the agreement with jf and maciej

[17:40:01.0000] <rubys>
I made it clear then that I still view the issue as open.  I tried to encourage you to add back the issue box, and later I tried to encourage manu not to proceed with the poll.  Seem to be batting 000 these days. :-)

[17:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
considering the summary issue open is a huge mistake imho

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's no direction from this point that doesn't make more people less happy

[17:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
so if we want to change the spec at this point, it pretty much has to be a vote

[17:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  I don't think JF and I specifically said either to remove the marker or to keep it, and I personally don't care

[17:41:03.0000] <rubys>
considering it closed invites Formal Objection.  Much better to give people rope and all that.  And sometimes they surprise you.

[17:42:00.0000] <rubys>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0017.html

[17:42:01.0000] <rubys>
JF clearly asked for the mark, and Ian clearly agreed.

[17:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
that was long before maciej's compromise

[17:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  and indeed Ian added the marker at that point

[17:43:00.0000] <rubys>
which you accepted, but not everybody did.  such a hasty process creates ill will

[17:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  if only there were a way to avoid having a hasty process on technical issues right before WD

[17:44:00.0000] <rubys>
othermaciej: want me to dig up all the times recently where you were complaining about a vote being too fast? :-)

[17:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, I think pushing to have warnings in the spec about open issues for summary and, previously, longdesc, has set a silly precedent that has lead us to this time wasting effort to vote on the inclusion of transient warnings that won't last longer than one WD cycle, let alone help to resolve the actual issues at hand.

[17:45:00.0000] <rubys>
Lachy: have you looked at the poll lately?

[17:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I know Hixie's draft is ahead

[17:45:02.0000] <rubys>
so why get upset and argue?

[17:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
      Precedent?

[17:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  rubys: the meaning of my statement was supposed to be - I think there is indeed a way to avoid having a hasty process on technical issues right before WD, several ways, and we should do one of those

[17:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
because I'm annoyed with this whole heartbeat issue having taken 4 weeks of valuable time that could have been spent finding real solutions, rather than meaningless nonsense

[17:47:00.0000] <rubys>
there are only two issues that I'm really worried about.  Issue-35 and Issue-74.

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: btw do you still intend to do the review you said you'd do?

[17:47:02.0000] <rubys>
Lachy: so don't spend your valuable time on it.

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: (just asking to know how to plan for the next few months)

[17:48:01.0000] <rubys>
I no longer see calling out sections as an effective way to proceed.

[17:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[17:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
what's your new plan for establishing consensus?

[17:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  it seems to me the blocker on issue-35 at the moment is not controversy on how to proceed, but rather blocking on a PFWG decision

[17:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  we can (and should IMO) find ways to be more pro-active about unblocking progress

[17:49:02.0000] <rubys>
both 35 and 74 are blocked on PFWG

[17:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  for 74, I believe good progress is being made on proposing a solution

[17:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  and the solution may require little or no change to the spec besides editorial text giving examples

[17:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, yes, that's what I meant. I always spell that word wrong

[17:50:03.0000] <rubys>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/actions/133

[17:50:04.0000] <othermaciej>
  at least, that is what I have heard from my sources involved closely in those discussions

[17:50:05.0000] <hober>
rubys: I'm surprised you're not really worried about issue 41

[17:51:00.0000] <rubys>
41 has no concrete proposal.

[17:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
      Lachy: I wasn't correcting you, I was semi-answering rubys

[17:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  anyway, sorting out the chaff will make it easier for the group to have a shared view of which issues are important to worry about

[17:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  which is why I am starting with the low-hanging fruit

[17:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I'm thinking like a project manager - must get bug trendline to point in the right direction

[17:52:01.0000] <rubys>
othermaciej: that's great, just make sure that everybody has a thursday-thursday period to notice the impending closure.

[17:52:02.0000] <rubys>
not everybody has the bandwidth to keep up with the emails.

[17:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  rubys: I think thursday-thursday is a fine timeline and I'll stick to that

[17:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  I think that way, both primarily-email and primarily-telecon participants get a fair chance to have their say

[17:53:02.0000] <rubys>
exactly

[17:54:00.0000] <rubys>
I have no interest in keeping open issues for which there are no owners.

[17:54:01.0000] <rubys>
And for issues with owners, I want dates.

[17:54:02.0000] <rubys>
35 and 74 have dates in Nov and Dec, which is what concerns me.

[17:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me would rather see progress than dates :-P

[17:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: what's your new plan for establishing consensus?

[17:55:01.0000] <rubys>
close items with no owners, give issues with owners a chance, and then close the issues either when they complete or fail.

[17:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
so the issue tracker's list of issues in the state Open (not Raised, not Pending Review, and not Closed) is the list of issues that need to be resolved before LC?

[17:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
or do you mean the list of issues not marked Closed?

[17:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  I think establishing committed owners and deadlines for the issues that remain after closing the low hanging fruit is a fine next step

[17:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  that leaves the questions of what to do if the deadline is missed (can't let it slip indefinitely), and what to do if there are multiple competing concrete proposals

[17:59:01.0000] <rubys>
Hixie: after a bit of cleanup, I do see the issue tracker as being that.  And othermaciej is doing a fine job at kicking off that discussion.

[17:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: which states are the ones i need to look at to see issues blocking LC?

[17:59:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  I think Hixie is asking if issues marked as "Raised" or "Pending Review" are considered open in the sense of blocking LC

[17:59:04.0000] <othermaciej>
  (it's not entirely clear to me what the distinctions are)

[18:00:00.0000] <rubys>
Raised means no owners.  Destined to be closed due to lack of interest unless somebody steps up.

[18:00:01.0000] <rubys>
Pending Review means that the owner considers his or herself done.  Also destined to be closed.

[18:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  by what process will Destiny work its will?

[18:01:01.0000] <rubys>
Open are the key ones, and what is key is getting agreement.  Telling people that it is closed only pisses them off.

[18:01:02.0000] <rubys>
othermaciej: taking your list and giving people until a week from thursday to volunteer is a great process.

[18:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  rubys: all right, then in my next pass I will consider all Raised and Pending Review issues for the chopping block if they do not get caught in the first pass (where I am hoping to find issues where no real dissent remains)

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: who owns issues with no action items?

[18:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm assuming the people with action items own the issues with them)

[18:04:01.0000] <Dashiva>
      If hybi were to create a generic bidirectional tunneling protocol, wouldn't that immediately get blocked in firewalls for the same reason the firewalls block non-http in the first place?

[18:05:00.0000] <rubys>
hixie: tell me which ones, and I'll demote to raised or find an owner.  I just demoted 60.

[18:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/37 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/59

[18:05:02.0000] <Dashiva>
      (Well, not immediately, but as soon as the firewalls change)

[18:05:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  Hixie: it seems to me that based on what Sam said, issues with no action item should be given an opportunity to find an owner, who presumably thereby receives an action item

[18:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I will continue my review of open issues tonight

[18:06:01.0000] <rubys>
demoted 37.  Will kick Mike again about 59.

[18:07:00.0000] <rubys>
s/presumably/definitely/

[18:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can volunteer to own 59 if you like. And then immediately announce I've done it. :-)

[18:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
(the html5 spec has had an "author view" for a while now)

[18:07:03.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I like that idea

[18:07:04.0000] <othermaciej>
  Hixie: is it possible to produce a copy of your spec that has the "author view" as the default stylesheet?

[18:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  Hixie: I suspect people will be a tiny bit more satisfied if they can follow a link to the "author view", even if there is no material difference

[18:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: sure, that's technically trivial.

[18:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
Is it possible generate a copy which excludes all the implementer stuff from the file, rather than just hiding it with a stylesheet?

[18:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
That should make the file significantly smaller and at least partially resolve the issues people have with the monolithic spec

[18:10:01.0000] <rubys>
if nobody else volunteers for 59, it will get closed.  I would must rather have a situation where somebody (in this case Mike) was given every opportunity and failed rather than telling them NO and have them be convinced that the only reason why they failed was that they weren't given a reasonable opportunity.

[18:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  people might be slightly even more satisfied with that, even though there is even less material difference

[18:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: technically yes, but someone would have to make the script to do it.

[18:10:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[18:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
I assume it would just take a small script to strip out any element with a class="impl" on it

[18:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  we should give Mike the opportunity to weigh in on whether Hixie's author view (if it can be linked standalone) satisfies the goals he had for H:TML

[18:11:02.0000] <rubys>
Mike is traveling at the moment, but he does log on.  He also plans to be on Thursday's call.

[18:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yes

[18:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  Lachy: are you willing to volunteer to make that script

[18:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wouldn't mind having Mike's H:TML draft published non-normatively in addition to an author only copy

[18:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  ?

[18:12:03.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, maybe.

[18:12:04.0000] <Lachy>
I might even be able to do it now, if I can base it one one of my existing scripts I use for generating the authoring guide

[18:12:05.0000] <othermaciej>
  if someone actually makes the script, then we may be able to persuade Mike that the author view is a win-win solution

[18:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  or if it does not meet some of his goals, we can ask him to articulate what those are

[18:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, if it works like this: cat source | author-view > author-only-source, will that fit into your tool chain?

[18:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it has to be a web service for me to put it in my toolchain

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: (i can't be parsing the html5 spec a dozen times at once on the local machine)

[18:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Well, I will proceed under the assumption that such a simple system will be very easy to integrate into a web service

[18:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
      So you prefer to rely on a dozen remote machines to each parse it?

[18:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yup

[18:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: so long as it's not mine :-P

[18:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't understand why that system doesn't collapse constantly, since it has lots of potential points of failure

[18:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
it sucks that we don't have a nicely integrated system that allows the source to be parsed just once and processed such that it results in multiple output files

[18:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: the only critical point of failure i don't control is pimpmyspec.net

[18:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me should probably move the multipage splitter onto a proper server, rather than on an old machine in his parents' house over an ADSL line

[18:24:02.0000] <Dashiva>
      Where's the fun in that?

[18:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i have a number of preprocessing steps that happen before the source becomes valid HTML that can be parsed

[18:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: e.g. merging source files from whatwg.org/demos, filtering the references, etc.

[18:26:00.0000] <rubys>
I seem to be able to go from Hixie-source to w3c split out spec in about 15 seconds on a rather midling AMD e-machine that I purchased for $199 earlier this year.

http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4616541

[19:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, a lot of these actions have been open a long time

[19:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how to help people make progress on them

[21:03:00.0000] <roc>
  this BWTP thread looks like a textbook case of feature creep

[21:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  roc: gonna vote in the HTML WG poll?

[21:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/wd08/

[21:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I encourage you to vote your conscience, despite the relative triviality of the issue at stake

[21:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  roc: BWTP looks like feature creep to me too - I wonder if there is a middle ground that adds a few of the most useful features but otherwise is closer in simplicity to WebSocket Protocol

[21:11:00.0000] <roc>
  othermaciej: your wish is my command

[21:15:00.0000] <roc>
  hmm, and I missed the part about BWTP having "forgiving syntax"

[21:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if there are features that actually make sense to add, and don't put onerous requirements on server-side implementations that don't need those features, i hope we can add them

[21:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i haven't seen any such features yet

[21:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  Hixie: I haven't had a chance to give it a close review

[21:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  for now I am taking it on faith that being "like http" would make things easier for server-side implementations embedded in an existing Web server

[21:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  but I don't have the context to evaluate the merit of this claim

[21:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  and the corresponding claim as to the client side seems wrong

[21:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
it certainly wouldn't make it easier for standalone servers

[21:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
which i expect to be the common case

[21:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
on the other hand, i've written a websocket server in 99 lines of perl

[21:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  I would love to hear from someone in charge of a big existing infrastructure which would be easier for them

[21:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  (although I suppose that risks enterprise-itis)

[21:52:00.0000] <dave_levin>
   othermaciej: Bidirection Web Transfer Protocol vs Web Sockets?

[21:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  dave_levin: yes

[21:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I don't know if I should bother to argue with the crazy people who think that instead of a ws: URI scheme (or similar), the URIs should just be http://ws.specific-magic-hostname.org?the-actual-url-goes-here

[21:54:00.0000] <dave_levin>
   othermaciej: I'll see if I can find someone on the Google Talk team to look them over if that would be helpful. They sit pretty close to me.

[21:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: it would be helpful if they could review websocket in general

[21:59:00.0000] <roc>
  othermaciej: ask someone who's actually in charge of actual infrastructure what would be easier for them ... do not ask their Architect

[22:00:00.0000] <dave_levin>
   Hixie: Honestly, they were a bit slow on all of that, but I think they are ready to focus more on these issues. I'll talk to them.  I think Ukai has also been talking to someone on that team (since he has been working web sockets in WebKit).

[22:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[22:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i'm not sure we even have any of those :-)

[22:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  roc: *shudder*

[00:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     annevk42: the comment box on the poll seems like a good place to enumerate what's not factual about Manu's draft

[00:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  I wonder if this poll will top our record for most total votes (which I believe is 88)

[00:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me is surprised to find on review that neither anne nor james have voted yet

[00:51:00.0000] <Mrmil>
Looks like there is a boom in HTML 5 tutorials...

[00:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  hsivonen: do you know what's up with this issue? is there still a conflict? http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/38

[00:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  looks fixed, nevermind

[01:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  hsivonen: does ARIA still depend in any way on CURIEs?

[01:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  (re http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/51 )

[01:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     othermaciej: AFAIK, no, but I'll check

[01:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     othermaciej: can't find any mention of curie in the latest ARIA spec.

[01:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  hsivonen: ok, thanks

[01:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me wonders whether he has the stomach to review issues 46-60

[01:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  this is an incredibly boring task, which the chairs should have long ago done or delegated :-(

[01:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     indeed

[01:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     othermaciej: thank you for doing it anyway

[01:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     Issue 53 seems to have draft text now

[01:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     issue 54 has been addressed

[01:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  I'm not sure what to suggest for issue 48

[01:10:03.0000] <Lachy>
issue 54 is pending the registration of about: URI scheme

[01:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  yeah

[01:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
I would close it, but some people wanted it kept open until that's done

[01:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  I think I'll suggest raising a separate issue on registering the about: URI scheme, if registering the scheme needs to block Last Call

[01:11:03.0000] <Lachy>
good idea

[01:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     othermaciej: about ARIA specifically: ARIA was fixed to acknowledge similarity of role to "XHTML Role Attribute Module" without actually importing the definition

[01:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  or we can track it in bugzilla, if a scheme registration doesn't need to block Last Call

[01:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  do media type registrations normally get updated before or after LC?

[01:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     I hope the pont of issue 56 is to update AWWW if it turns out that real-world URL processing conflicts with Architecture

[01:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     s/pont/point/

[01:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  I have no idea what issue-56 is about

[01:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  but I believe the plan to defer to WEBADDRESS or IRIbis or whatever addresses it

[01:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     if issue 56 needs to be an issue, it should be a TAG issue filed against Architecture

[01:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  so the only ones I don't know what to do with are ISSUE-48 and ISSUE-53 out of this next batch

[01:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if you mean mime types, we let the IESG know that we're going to register them when we hit LC, then we register them at CR.

[01:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  Hixie: ok, so a task on MIME type registration doesn't need to block LC?

[01:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  Hixie: or do we need draft registration text before LC, and if so do we have it?

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     BWTP seems like a lot of feature creep :-(

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: the draft registrations for all the MIME types I'm aware that we need to register are all at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#iana-considerations

[01:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  Hixie: ok, sounds like the issue on registrations can be closed, the

[01:29:00.0000] <hober>
I hope the ARIA folk handle their LC comments by either renaming @role to @aria-role or allowing the host language to use a more appropriate existing attr (in our case, @class)

[01:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  hober: I don't think putting aria roles in @class is viable

[01:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  too many existing pages would then appear to have an ARIA role accidentally

[01:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     hober: renaming role isn't on the table

[01:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     hober: hasn't been since Firefox 3.0 froze

[01:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me hasn't finished reading the scrollback but notes that he has a script that strips non author view stuff from the spec somewhere

[01:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     hmm. my email isn't appearing on public-html

[01:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
  jgraham: do you think it would be feasible to integrate it with Hixie's toolchain?

[01:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
      I also hacked together an anolis module to copy status annotations from the WHATWG data to a static spec

[01:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     jgraham: awesome!

[01:33:03.0000] <jgraham>
      I haven't checked it works very properly or anything

[01:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
      I will continue to poke at it a bit

[01:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
      othermaciej: pobably

[01:34:02.0000] <jgraham>
      *probably

[01:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  jgraham: it would be useful - so we can see if such a spec would satisfy those who want an author-only spec

[01:34:04.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, great, that means I can take that off my todo list for today

[01:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     anyway, the content of my email to list was that issue-30 isn't controversial anymore, because WAI-CG agreed to the obsoletion of longdesc if aria-describedby gets in

[01:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  hsivonen: I saw your email

[01:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  hsivonen: I even replied to it

[01:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  I may have seen it not-via-the-list

[01:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     othermaciej: ok. then SMTP at my end isn't horked

[01:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
      biab

[01:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  hsivonen: mails seem to be appearing in the archive out of order

[01:38:02.0000] <otherarun>
/me (n=arun⊙adpsn) has left #whatwg

[02:37:00.0000] <Hixie>

[02:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2009Aug/0085.html

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i couldn't tell if he was unintentionally proving our point about prefixes being confusing, or if he was being sarcastic.

[02:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     I can't tell what his point is, either, but the email looks very confused.

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     http://www.w3.org/2009/07/30-rdfa-minutes : "We need to structure it so that it's easy for the W3C to accept the RDFa IG. RDFa isn't controversial, so shouldn't be an issue."

[02:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
what the? I've never known anyone to claim that <div xmlns:dc="..."> was invalid XML

[02:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me fights the urge to reply to the anti-pattern thread and point out less than factual statements

[02:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, which anti-pattern thread?

[02:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, on rdfa list

[02:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     Lachy: on public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf

[02:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://hoppipolla.co.uk/410/spec-annotated.html first cut with no headers or stylesheet and with all the removed sections and so on left in

[02:52:00.0000] <annevk42>
     the BWTP guys know that eventually the UTF-8 frame type won't be the only option available, right?

[02:52:01.0000] <annevk42>
     they're so fixated on it...

[02:59:00.0000] <annevk42>
     would it make sense to extend bogus comments to also include <% ?

[02:59:01.0000] <annevk42>
     apparently WebKit/Trident already does that

[03:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     annevk42: is it guys or guy?

[03:00:01.0000] <annevk42>
     and e.g. http://www.lex24.ilsole24ore.com/Redazione/Riforma_cpc/Riforma.html would look better at the bottom

[03:00:02.0000] <annevk42>
     hsivonen, there's more on the hybi list

[03:00:03.0000] <annevk42>
     but fair enough

[03:01:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       annevk42: Is that not quirks only, at least in WebKit?

[03:01:01.0000] <annevk42>
     no

[03:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, what have you added to that copy of the spec?

[03:02:01.0000] <annevk42>
     also at the top of that page, not just the bottom

[03:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah, I see, a few sections have Status annotations

[03:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
      Lachy: It should in theory be all sections that have status annotations in the WHATWG draft but I may have missed some

[03:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     jgraham: let's ship it!

[03:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
      s/I/my code/

[03:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, the one for the introduction is missing, which is the one I checked for first and didn't see

[03:06:01.0000] <annevk42>
     hsivonen, how do you feel about having <% besides <? ?

[03:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
wait, that's weird. It is there

[03:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
      Lachy: I don't have the introduction do I?

[03:07:02.0000] <jgraham>
      It's in the header which I don't have

[03:07:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, you do. It says:

[03:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
Introduction

[03:07:05.0000] <Lachy>
Status: Working draft

[03:07:06.0000] <Lachy>
1 Background

[03:07:07.0000] <Lachy>
...

[03:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
the abstract is in the header

[03:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
      Oh yeah

[03:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     annevk42: assuming that WebKit/Trident already does it, I'm open to trying it.

[03:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
unless supporting it is really needed for compatibility reasons, I don't think we should

[03:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
have Mozilla received any bugs about supporting it?

[03:15:00.0000] <roc>
  supportin gwhat?

[03:15:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       <% as comments

[03:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
roc, webkit and trident apparently support it

[03:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     Lachy: no bugs against the HTML5 parser at least

[03:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://brand.icxo.com/htmlnews/2007/07/11/919666_1.htm

[03:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://yuanyunfu.artron.net/exhibi_2.php?aid=A0000016&wrkid=BRT000000033876

[03:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
      http://www.51234.org/sy/3777.html

[03:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it depends on whether supporting that as a comment is really the best solution. If they're only testing it with browsers that do, then that would explain why they havne't noticed or fixed the error

[03:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     the last one is a "reported attack page!"

[03:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
and presumably they have no intention of outputting JSP into the HTML

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     it's pretty clear that it's error recovery that makes the error less obvious to authors

[03:20:01.0000] <annevk42>
     well, a) the cost is minor and b) it is far more likely they just tested in IE than anything else

[03:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     the question is if Gecko and Opera are worse off by not doing it if Trident and WebKit do it

[03:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     also, the implementation would be trivial

[03:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     no new states. just another transition

[03:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
      Most of the <%...s seem to be in attribute values rather than in text content

[03:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
     assuming we are OK with the % in the trailing %> ending up in comment data

[03:22:00.0000] <annevk42>
     I don't think that matters one bit

[03:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think the question we should be asking is if Microsoft and Apple would be willing to drop support for it

[03:23:00.0000] <annevk42>
     it's an error, but for the pages I've looked at so far not displaying <% is better

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>

[03:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
      That one looks a bit like it intentionally wants to use <%...%> as a comment

[03:32:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Hixie: yt?

[03:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
      Lachy: After discussion with gsnedders|work I will convert the author view generator to a anolis module that runs before things like the toc are generated

[03:41:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       jgraham: http://74.125.77.132/search?q=cache:5iAdTkTth4EJ:krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090703+http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090703&hl=en&client=opera&strip=1#l-1126

[03:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, ok

[03:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
what's happened to krijn?

[03:44:00.0000] <annevk42>
     he's in hiding

[03:47:00.0000] <svl>
  The computer he logs things from isn't exactly the most stable. :/

[03:48:00.0000] <annevk42>
     given that nobody else seems to be willing to log, it's been pretty awesome for us :)

[03:48:01.0000] <annevk42>
     I filed a bug on the <% crap btw

[04:02:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Wait! This means the evil cabal can say anything!

[04:05:00.0000] <remysharp>
    Is Lachy around?

[04:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
remysharp, yes

[04:06:00.0000] <remysharp>
    hi - I've got a link for you - discussion possible alternatives to the legend issue

[04:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[04:06:02.0000] <remysharp>
    it's not for public consumption - I couldn't get a preview of the blog post - but here you go:

[04:06:03.0000] <remysharp>
    http://remysharp.com/figure-legend.html

[04:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
Not for public consumption? By posting it here, you've made it public anyway

[04:07:01.0000] <remysharp>
    brucel: I've added your example in too: http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/tests/html5-details-label.html

[04:07:02.0000] <remysharp>
    sorry, not quite what I meant - as in it's a blog post

[04:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah

[04:08:01.0000] <remysharp>
    it's not the "real" url, more that comments won't work! :)

[04:08:02.0000] <remysharp>
    screw it I can publish it now anyway.

[04:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
remysharp, I'll take a look in a moment, just busy with some work stuff right now

[04:10:01.0000] <remysharp>
    np

[04:11:00.0000] <remysharp>
    This is the latest url anyway - with examples of alternatives to the legend in figure & details issue: http://remysharp.com/2009/08/12/saving-figure-detail/

[04:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
remysharp, your claim about hgroup isn't quite correct

[04:16:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Should <iframe></iframe> fire an onload event?

[04:16:02.0000] <remysharp>
    okay, so it *would* come up in the TOC?

[04:16:03.0000] <remysharp>
    Lachy: enlighten me :-)

[04:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
basically, using <hgroup> means that all the headings inside it are grouped, such that they only the top level heading within it will appear in the TOC

[04:17:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       remysharp: hgroup comes up in the TOC as the highest ranked heading within

[04:17:02.0000] <remysharp>
    Right - so actually it's not a viable solution at all in my particular example - cheers.

[04:17:03.0000] <Lachy>
so, e.g. <hgroup><h2>Foo</h2><h3>Bar</h3></hgroup> should appear in the TOC as "Foo"

remy_, I'm not a big fan of reusing <header> for this purpose. As I told brucel yesterday, it's not the right semantics.

[04:20:01.0000] <remy_>
Aye, he mentioned that too

[04:21:00.0000] <remy_>
I just want to get the alternatives up there.

[04:21:01.0000] <remy_>
My preference is label, but I want to see what screenreaders do when it's embedded in a form

[04:21:02.0000] <annevk42>
     you people should just be patience

[04:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, it's good to have a discussion about the alternatives again to show that Hixie's stubbornness about using <legend> is not good

[04:21:04.0000] <annevk42>
     with time <legend> will be fine

[04:21:05.0000] <brucel>
       I think that we're open to almost any solution as legend won't fly

[04:21:06.0000] <remy_>
time? in that time authors won't use legend

[04:21:07.0000] <jgraham>
      annevk42: I don't think that's a good answer

[04:22:00.0000] <remy_>
and there'll be a mess of solutions

[04:22:01.0000] <annevk42>
     jgraham, I think it is

[04:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, that's what Hixie said, but authors are going to push forward with whatever hacks they can to work around the problems today, and unless we come up with a real solution, the result with be a huge mess in the long run

[04:22:03.0000] <jgraham>
      People think that they ought to be able to use it today since it is not having any effect in UAs and will become frustrated and discouraged when they find that they cannot

[04:22:04.0000] <remy_>
by the time all the current browsers have been weeded out it's going to be well beyond 2022!!! :)

[04:22:05.0000] <annevk42>
     oh please

[04:22:06.0000] <annevk42>
     stop the drama

[04:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
      Especially given the long half life of legacy browsers

[04:23:01.0000] <brucel>
       It will result in either no-one using the new elements (figure, details) or using header/ label anyway

[04:23:02.0000] <remy_>
The bottom line is that I want to give a caption to figure and details.  I'll run with my own solution if the spec sticks with legend

[04:23:03.0000] <remy_>
and others with have their own solutions

[04:23:04.0000] <remy_>
and when it *is* supported properly, we *won't* use legend -

[04:24:00.0000] <remy_>
that particular part of the spec, is sadly, fiction.  There's no point in it being there because we can't use it at all :(

[04:24:01.0000] <brucel>
        wrt visuals, legend isn't a cowpath, it's more of a cowpat

[04:24:02.0000] <annevk42>
     it's like complaining you cannot use <datalist>

[04:24:03.0000] <remy_>
not really, because we *can* use datalist

[04:24:04.0000] <remy_>
I've seen Dean Edwards demo using it and it works

[04:24:05.0000] <remy_>
it doesn't vomit all over the DOM like legend does.

[04:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we're not using <legend>, i'm dropping <figure> until we can. it's just not an important enough feature for us to worry about.

[04:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
      annevk42: It makes a difference if, say, firefox implemets <legend> and couples it to AT in a sensible way but I can't use it because of legacy parsing issues in other browsers

[04:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
same with <details>

[04:25:03.0000] <jgraham>
      So I am forced to use some other solution to get those AT hooks

[04:26:00.0000] <brucel>
       that's daft, Hixie - they're far too useful to drop. Why would you not use label, if it  proves to play nice with AT?

[04:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
      Hixie: Totally disagree. If nothing else it is one of the cornerstones of the @summary situation

[04:26:02.0000] <jgraham>
      s/situation/compromise/

[04:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
      Since they represent improved visible-data alternatives to @summary that, unlike <caption>, the a11y community seems to believe in

[04:27:01.0000] <annevk42>
/me is with Hixie on this

[04:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
brucel: they're not so useful that we've not been able to live 19 years without them

[04:27:03.0000] <jgraham>
      Hixie: That is a terrible argument

[04:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: realistically, neither <figure> not <details> are necessary for including explanatory text about tables

[04:28:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Hixie: That's true of the whole HTML 5 spec.

[04:28:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Hixie: We can drop the whole parsing section. We've been able to live without them for 19 years.

[04:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
      Since it applies to all x for x in html 5 where x is not in HTML 4

[04:28:03.0000] <brucel>
       When I ran a webteam we would have killed for figure and details

[04:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
      Hixie: Neither are required but both are better than <caption> in certian situations

[04:29:01.0000] <remy_>
Aren't authors (i.e. me) going to end up using aside for figures then - that doesn't quite sit right.

[04:29:02.0000] <brucel>
       particularly details, as we were not in a position to add jQuery/ scripts to simulate details

[04:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: no, e.g. <video> we haven't been able to live without (people ended up using proprietary technologies to get around it)

[04:29:04.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, while we can probably live without <details> until UAs are ready to begin supporting it, which might not be a bad idea given that we don't know about potential implementation problems yet, but <figure> is really useful to avoid having to go with the more complicated aria stuff that authors won't readily use

[04:29:05.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: and the parsing section we've only lived without by having huge reverse-engineering efforts duplicated in all vendors

[04:30:00.0000] <beowulf>
      wq

[04:30:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Hixie: And there's been a lot of duplicated work to make stuff appear like a legend by web authors.

[04:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i've never been convinced that either details or figure particularly help with table, to be honest

[04:30:03.0000] <jgraham>
      Hixie: Other people have, however :)

[04:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
we'll just wait a bit more and see what happens with <legend>

[04:32:01.0000] <remy_>
Hixie: *nothing* is going to happen with <legend>

[04:32:02.0000] <remy_>
there may be a few new browsers that fix it

[04:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's not nothing then is it

[04:32:04.0000] <Lachy>
to avoid repeating the same arguments again, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Sep/0375.html

[04:32:05.0000] <brucel>
       Hixie: if label plays nicely with AT, what's your aversion to using that?

[04:32:06.0000] <remy_>
but 100% of the browser landscape screws the render with it right now

[04:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
brucel: label is completely inappropriate. it does weird things with forms, it has weird APIs, etc.

[04:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
remy_, that email contains a nice little styling trick you might like to use

[04:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
remy_: and 10 years from now, it'll be near-0.

[04:34:00.0000] <remy_>
Hixie: you think?  I don't think so.  I think IE7 and 8 will still have a strong hold on the browser landscape

[04:34:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Hixie: People are using HTML 5 _today_. 10 years from now HTML 5 will be as relevant as HTML 4.01 is today.

[04:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, authors don't work in the future, they have to deal with the problems now, so endlessly deferring issues until such time as they might theoretically be fixed is not a good solution

[04:34:03.0000] <brucel>
       what kind of wierdness with forms/ APIs? Could legend doees terrible things with visuals

[04:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is somewhat reminded of "The fact that xHTML2 won't be widely used before the end of the decade is not a problem."

[04:35:01.0000] <brucel>
       could -> cause

[04:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: exactly

[04:36:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Hixie: huh?

[04:36:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Hixie: If people are using HTML 5 today, surely HTML 5 should be compatible with UAs today?

[04:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: we're not "endlessly deferring", we're just waiting until browsers implement the parsing spec. it's already happening. If you want to make it happen sooner, speak to your eng team.

[04:37:00.0000] <remysharp>
    Seriously though, there's legacy/existing browsers to deal with.  The vast majority of the language of HTML 5 works right now

[04:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: in the soundbite world, maybe; in the real world, specs and implementations co-evolve over many years.

[04:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
remysharp: the vast majority of the HTML5 language doesn't work right now.

[04:37:03.0000] <remysharp>
    this is the exception and <figure> is an element we, as authors, want to use

[04:38:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       Hixie: The vast majority of HTML 5 can be made to work quite easily

[04:39:00.0000] <remysharp>
    gsnedders|work: spot on.

[04:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, the point is that <legend> fails to meet the graceful degredation principle

[04:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: show me an implementation of pushState(). of <audio>. of UndoManager. of <script async>. of <iframe sandbox>.

[04:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
remysharp: if you want to use it, the most effective thing you can do is ask browser vendors to fix their parsers.

[04:40:01.0000] <remysharp>
    sorry, by language I'm talking about the elements (a small part of HTML 5 admittedly)

[04:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
just elements? or attributes also?

[04:40:03.0000] <remysharp>
    Sure but the starting point for authors is the elements, no?

[04:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think there really is a meaningful concept of "starting point" that applies here

[04:41:01.0000] <remysharp>
    speaking to other authors, that's what they're focusing on right now.  I love the JS stuff, I think it's awesome, but right now, the interest is being able to use better semantics in the docs

[04:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
right now the interest is in being able to use what works

[04:41:03.0000] <remysharp>
    Absolutely

[04:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
well that doesn't include <figure>

[04:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
so stop using it :-)

[04:42:02.0000] <remysharp>
    that's right -

[04:42:03.0000] <remysharp>
    but we're sooo close to be able to use it :)

[04:42:04.0000] <brucel>
       only because of the insistence on legend does it not work

[04:42:05.0000] <jgraham>
      Hixie: From the point of view of vendors changing the whole parser has a high risk since it consumes a great deal of resources and may lead to compat regressions. On the other hand the reward for vendors of being able to say "we support the <figure> element" is much smaller than being able to say "we support <video>" or whatever

[04:42:06.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: why is it so much smaller?

[04:42:07.0000] <jgraham>
      You are placing the onus in the wrong place compared to the benefits

[04:43:00.0000] <tantekc>
/me tends to agree with brucel and remysharp - <label> is preferable to <legend>, and both <figure> and <details> seem quite practically useful.

[04:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
      Hixie: Because <video> is an end-user visible feature that reduces the dependence on, often unstable, plugins

[04:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     I think we should consider both <label> and <legend> tainted as far as use in <figure> or <details> goes

[04:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
<label>'s a non-starter.

[04:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     although I can't quite remember what the problem with <label> was

[04:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
      <figure> is mainly useful for authors and AT

[04:44:03.0000] <remysharp>
    are there any tests that show label is problematic?

[04:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. it would prevent you from having form controls in captions or <details>'s legend.

[04:44:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       uh, what's the use-case for that?

[04:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not thrilled about the idea of reusing label, as discussed in that email I linked to above, but I prefer it over legend

[04:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
      gsnedders|work: Form controls in <details> should be obvious

[04:45:02.0000] <remysharp>
    gsnedders|work: possibly an advanced section search...maybe

[04:45:03.0000] <hsivonen>
     the spec feedback box makes "find on page" less useful in Firefox

[04:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: a fill-in wysiwyg form on Flickr that allows you to type in the title of the photo and the photo credit, say.

[04:46:00.0000] <remysharp>
    so exactly what is the issue if there's a form inside a <detail> with labels? I don't know what the browser would do /justasking

[04:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. the only browser that doesn't get rapid uptake is IE, and in IE you can pretty easily work around the parsing of legend.

[04:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
so it's not a big deal.

[04:46:03.0000] <tantekc>
      Hixie - isn't the Flickr editable scenario actually just contentEditable?

[04:46:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
       remysharp: <label> would imply a closing </label>

[04:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantekc: i don't see why it would be

[04:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
my preferred solution is introducing a new element if we can find a suitable name (maybe <c>?), or possibly redefining <header> as remysharp suggested

[04:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     remysharp: <label><input></label> makes the label become the label for for the input

[04:47:03.0000] <karlcow>
      "When a LABEL element receives focus, it passes the focus on to its associated control." - http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.9

[04:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     Do iframe, noembed or noframes really need the <!-- ... --> escape functionality?

[04:48:01.0000] <remysharp>
    aye, but if there's no associated input element, what happens, I thought nothing (assuming the input element isn't embedded inside the <label>)?

[04:48:02.0000] <remysharp>
/me just mocking a test

[04:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
     hmm. I imagine they might if there are "comments" in the fallback markup

[04:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     whee! MediaWiki doesn't allow me to say <!-- or -->

[04:54:01.0000] <remysharp>
    Lachy: there's something funky (as in not great) with the email you gave me: http://jsbin.com/uraco (2nd form, styles the label for input el as the caption for the <detail>)

[04:55:00.0000] <remysharp>
    Lachy: hmm - in fact, looking at FF3.5 there's a rendering bug, if I trigger a redraw, it correctly puts the label in the table caption, but on load it doesn't work.

[04:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     Did I miss any requirements: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/CDATA_Escapes#Requirements ?

[04:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
remysharp, brucel, as a workaround, I'd recommend instead of misusing other new elements, you could just use <span class="legend"> for now, and then when legend finally is supported, it's easy to switch to <legend>

[04:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     in particular, is the ability to use "</style>" in CSS string literals inside inline CSS a Web compat requirement?

[04:59:02.0000] <Lachy>
and since no UA actually does anything with <figure> or <legend> now anyway, you don't lose much by sticking with <span> for the short term

[05:00:00.0000] <remysharp>
    Lachy: I guess that's my problem, if we use something like span, we'll end up either sticking with it (and not switching in years to come) or there'll be all kinds of inconsistent solutions out there - as there is now.

[05:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'm going to bed now

[05:01:01.0000] <remysharp>
    If the spec remains, then yeah, I'll be using my own way to solve this, but it just feels like it's close to being right

[05:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     Lachy: if you can stick to span now, why bother with <legend> later?

[05:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     remysharp: <caption> is even more tainted than <label> and <legend>

[05:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, because the benefit of using <figure>/<legend> is that you get the prober association, which helps with accessibility. Using span will never provide that, but it's a quick and easy workaround that won't cause irreperable harm later

[05:05:01.0000] <remysharp>
    hsivonen: oh, absolutely, it's completely screwed in the browser outside of a <table> element

[05:06:00.0000] <brucel>
       I'm not seeing any ill-effects using label inside details ina  form when I don't associate label using for="id" (because it's inside the details element so doesn't need explicitly associating)

[05:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     <header> sucks, because it pairs nicely with "footer", and having it for two radically different purposes would be bad

[05:06:02.0000] <brucel>
       Have asked some friends with screenreaders to see what happens for them

[05:06:03.0000] <brucel>
http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/tests/html5-details-label.html

[05:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, the point is, blatently misusing elements like <header> now is going to potentially create more problems later when UAs try to make sense out of the element in the future, beyond the normal problems created by the inevitable unintentional misuse

[05:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     I'd prefer to have a completely novel element name for the purpose that the spec now uses <legend> for in <details> and <figure>

[05:08:01.0000] <brucel>
       would like to know more about the label wierdness that Hixie alluded to

[05:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     I can't think of a good English word

[05:08:03.0000] <jmb>
  <description> ?

[05:08:04.0000] <remysharp>
    Lachy: if that's the case, then I'd like to find out what screenreaders do with label

[05:08:05.0000] <jmb>
  even if it is overly verbose

[05:08:06.0000] <hsivonen>
     jmb: could work!

[05:08:07.0000] <jgraham>
/me could live with <description>

[05:08:08.0000] <remysharp>
    jmb: that just feels like we're repeating <caption> <heading> <label>, etc doesn't it?

[05:08:09.0000] <brucel>
       hsivonen, I'm agnostic about the actual element we do use - just not legend as we can;t use that now or forseeable future

[05:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
<desc> would be better

[05:09:01.0000] <remysharp>
/me agrees with brucel too though

[05:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
     Lachy: overlaps with SVG, we don't want more SVG overlap

[05:09:03.0000] <brucel>
       what about longdesc?? (heh)

[05:09:04.0000] <jmb>
  remysharp: I don't deny that

[05:09:05.0000] <Lachy>
oh, damn

[05:09:06.0000] <annevk42>
     can't you guys just put your effort into getting browsers fixed?

[05:09:07.0000] <Lachy>
<summary> :-)

[05:09:08.0000] <jgraham>
      annevk42: What more would you like me to do to get browsers fixed?

[05:09:09.0000] <annevk42>
     Gecko is getting fixed, WebKit shouldn't be too hard to fix either, and I'm sure a few here can try to get Opera inline

[05:10:00.0000] <brucel>
       sure, I'll get on the phone to Redmond straight after lunch, annevk42

[05:10:01.0000] <remysharp>
    annevk42: because we still have to work with existing browsers

[05:10:02.0000] <annevk42>
     there's a workaround for IE, no?

[05:10:03.0000] <jgraham>
      Lachy: <summary> has the wrong english meaning

[05:10:04.0000] <brucel>
       why have workarounds when there's a chance to spec a work-straight?

[05:10:05.0000] <remysharp>
    annevk42: IE completely shitcans the legend element

[05:10:06.0000] <remysharp>
    annevk42: http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ies-details-element-treatment.jpg

[05:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
actually, if we use <figure><summary> and <details><summary>, then we could make people happy and allow them to use it for table too in some way and finally ditch summary=""

[05:11:01.0000] <annevk42>
     remysharp, also with createElement?

[05:12:00.0000] <annevk42>
     oh well, I don't really care until 3 years from now :)

[05:12:01.0000] <remysharp>
    annevk42: do you mean on the detail element?

[05:12:02.0000] <jgraham>
      Lachy: Still has the wrong english meaning

[05:12:03.0000] <remysharp>
    annevk42: if so, yeah, that's on there.

[05:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, it's not completely inaccurate.

[05:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     Lachy: worse than <description>

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     what about <fc> for "figure caption"?

[05:14:01.0000] <remysharp>
    hsivonen: but then we'll have <dc>, which seems daft if it's the same thing, no?

[05:14:02.0000] <brucel>
       while I like description, could live with summary, could live with label, c, fc and dc (for details caption), Hixie said he'll take his toys home if he can't have legend

[05:14:03.0000] <Lachy>
Since caption is defined as "A title, short explanation, or description accompanying an illustration or a photograph." (answers.com) and a summary is like a short explanation

[05:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
but <description> is acceptable

[05:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     remysharp: daft, but better than <legend>

[05:15:02.0000] <remysharp>
    hsivonen: dude, *anything* is better than <legend> right now! :)

[05:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
     oh, and <c> would work, too

[05:16:00.0000] <remysharp>
    isn't <c> an attempted replacement for <caption> then?

[05:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
brucel, I wouldn't worry about Hixie. He can usually be convinced with reasonable arguments

[05:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
yes, <c> is good if we accept new single letter element names

[05:16:03.0000] <hsivonen>
     how do I create a <dt> element it mediawiki?

[05:16:04.0000] <Lachy>
our previous attempts at doing so have all been replaced with longer names

[05:17:00.0000] <remysharp>
    Lachy: that's a slippery slope isn't it?

[05:17:01.0000] <remysharp>
    I mean, I'm all for it if we need a new element though.

[05:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
what slippery slope?

[05:17:03.0000] <brucel>
       so where do we go from here wrt to <c>, description, <rubric>, etc?

[05:17:04.0000] <remysharp>
    using single letter elements

[05:17:05.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see how that's a slippery slope

[05:18:00.0000] <remysharp>
    Lachy: that's cool then :)

[05:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
we have <a>, <b>, <i> and they haven't caused any problems

[05:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     brucel: I suggest filing a bug against the spec in the W3C Bugzilla explaining why <legend> sucks and why alternatives suck less

[05:19:01.0000] <brucel>
       like I said, am agnostic about name of new element (if we can't reuse label/ caption for reasons I don't understand so be it: I'm all for pragmatism). But figure and details are highly useful but not if unstylable. (I know of one accessibility-focussed agency that already regularly use <hx> rather than legend because of the visual horrors that it entails)

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     brucel: please mention that in the bug

[05:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
brucel, yeah, and if you can, be specific about which organisation, as it could give a little more weight to the argument, especially if they're of any real significance

[05:22:00.0000] <brucel>
       will ask them if they'd go "on record" (tho they're talking unstylability of html4 form legends, not html5 extended legends)

[05:23:00.0000] <brucel>
       Is the process of filing a w3c bugzilla bug documented anywhere (as it's almost cetainly elaborate)?

[05:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, well, I've heard of a few people thinking that the old fashion design of fieldset/legend makes them unappealing to use

[05:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
brucel, yes, one sec...

[05:25:00.0000] <brucel>
       I guess a mail to the list would be useful too - maybe accessibility-focussed readers would know more about how AT reacts to  labels in figure and details

[05:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
brucel, http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=HTML%20WG&component=HTML5+spec+bugs

[05:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
just write a summary and comment, and then submit

[05:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/08/12/judge-orders-microsoft-to-stop-selling-word

[05:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder how much that will impact organisations in the US that depend on MS Word

[05:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
     Lachy: not good. (the MS patent thing)

[05:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
     the only silver lining is that it demonstrates the evilness of software idea patents

[05:32:00.0000] <brucel>
       cheers Lachy. Bye y'all.

[05:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but there have been plenty of patent infringment cases that demonstrate the same thing, and yet still they persist

[05:37:00.0000] <brucel>
/me (n=brucel⊙9212) has left #whatwg

[05:55:00.0000] <krijnh>
Testin'

Passin'

[05:55:02.0000] <krijnh>
Tee hee

[06:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like it probably shouldn't be too unreasonable for Microsoft to change OOXML to remove the feature that infringes the patent

[06:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
(like, it wouldn't involve redesigning the entire file format)

[06:03:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Or moving away from XML, or anything big.

[06:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't understand the patent at all since it uses lots of words like "metacodes" that he doens't understand

[06:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although it seems to be about associating external metadata with a document, which, if I have not misunderstood, is an insane thing to have a patent on

[06:06:01.0000] <jmb>
jgraham: sounds like most patents

[06:07:00.0000] <jmb>
jgraham: i.e. completely incomprehensible

[06:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It gives some clear examples later on

[06:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Yeah I just read enough to grasp that

[06:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
That is incredibly silly

[06:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
I mean it might work but it is a really obvious idea

[06:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/misc/cdata.png

[06:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not sure it's a lot easier to read than hsivonen's text version, but maybe it is

[06:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Do you know whether actual minifiers do escape </script>?

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: thanks. linked from wiki

[06:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I don't

[06:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: That seems important to find out

[06:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: yes

[06:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. Crockford's minifier has a field of use restriction that makes it non-Free

[06:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
I would expect them not to since escaping adds bytes and is not needed for HTML compat

[06:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: that's a reasonable expectation

[06:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
www.cheapextinguishers.com/index.php?cPath=18&osCsid=ab35aa82681ce6a1c114d53f70a3f56c   </title></a><script>var o=document.links[3];if(o)o.innerHTML=o.innerHTML.replace(/\n([^"]+)/g,'');</script>

[06:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
more reasonable than my expectation

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ouch

[06:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I fail

[06:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
pt>

[06:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
So we either need to implement the RegExpLiteral production from ECMAScript or do something different

[06:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lots of pages seem to have that pattern

[06:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
and if I'm counting the quotes correctly, it'll break

[06:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
IS there any way to tell apart regexps and divisions without a full JS parser?

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
<script>g=1; x=2

[06:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
/3/g;

[06:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
/4/g;

[06:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
</script>

[06:38:04.0000] <Philip`>
Doesn't look fun

[06:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Even ignoring the regexp stuff, it'll break when someone writes something like <script language=vbscript>document.write("hello world") ' comment</script>

[06:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though I don't have any examples of that in practice)

[06:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh crap.

[06:46:03.0000] <Philip`>
(but it seems like a legitimate thing to write (at least to the extent VBScript is legitimate))

[06:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
(If you don't like VBScript, imagine it's <script language=python>print("hello world") # that's an excellent greeting</script>)

[06:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't like the idea of making non-JS languages so fragile, even if JS could be handled perfectly

[06:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
non-JS languages are extensibility and extensibility is bad  :-)

[06:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Extensibility is only bad when other people extend it in ways we don't like

[06:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
and we like Python so that's good

[06:49:03.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I'm pretty sure you need a full parser

[06:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Even just with JS, there's <script type=text/javascript;e4x=1><x><!-- this example's great --></x></script>

[06:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
e4x in inline script is just looking for trouble

[06:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
mmmm e4x

[06:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's lucky that web authors are always so careful to stay out of trouble, then

[06:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish <script> had a sane parsing model to begin with...

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Has anyone demonstrated a practical attack based on script reparsing?

[06:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know

[06:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
What is the theoretical attack?

[06:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the next interesting thing is whether <!-- can be made not take effect if there's non-whitespace on the line before it

[06:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me worries about minifiers again

[06:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: are there instances of <!-- in the wild where it's meant to be an escape but it's not at the start of a line?

[06:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Dunno, ask Philip` 

[06:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Server returns a page with <script>var x="$escaped_user_input"</script> (safely escaping any '"' and '</script>'), attacker inputs "<img onload=alert('oops')>......", attacker somehow causes the output to stop before it prints the </script>, their own script gets executed, I guess

[07:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Maybe their input includes U+0000 or some invalid bytes or something, so the server dies with an error message after printing half the output)

[07:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is this the theoretical attack that people are thinking of?

[07:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess the careful server needs to escape < as \u003C

[07:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: your attack works in WebKit: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/205

[07:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I can't think of any easy way of searching for cases where <!-- is used for escaping

[07:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Is is possible to do reparsing whilst mitigating that attack?

[07:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
What does gecko do?

[07:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: Philip`'s attack works is Gecko, too (with the old parser)

[07:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
It runs the script in hsivonen's example too

[07:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
(in Firefox 3.0 at least)

[07:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh right, I forgot I was using the new parser. Oops

[07:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/CDATA_Escapes#Proposal_.232

[07:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
how about Proposal #2?

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does it suck, too?

[07:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
when was maxlength put back on textarea?

[07:28:01.0000] <annevk42>
is 2b easy to implement?

[07:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk42: should be easy enough

[07:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
having to escape < as \u003C in inline JS pretty much defeats to point of having it parse as CDATA to begin with...

[07:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
You probably only really need to escape user input like that, not your own trusted code

[07:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk42: I assume you just need a couple of extra states indicating that you are at the start of a line with only whitespace and so on

[07:34:02.0000] <nessy>
 resolutions...

[07:34:03.0000] <nessy>
ups - wrong window

[07:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me continues to be unable to think of a good way to detect escaped </script>s

[08:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can someone remind me of a host-native object whose constructor is exposed on window and the constructor takes an optional argument?

[08:24:00.0000] <remysharp>
is there an svg version of the whatwg logo about (I found a reference on an old email but I couldn't get the attachment)? ta

[08:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: What do you mean by host-native?

[08:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
remysharp: you could extract the logo from Sam Ruby's blog assuming he is OK with it

[08:24:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: backed by C++

[08:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Worker

[08:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Now I'm confused

[08:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
Image?

[08:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Optional width and height)

[08:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
Aren't all arguments in js effectively optional

[08:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
Since they are just replaced by undefined

[08:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Image is different, because the interface name and the contructor name differ

[08:28:03.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[08:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
apparently Gecko's IDL doesn't support WebIDL constructors automagically

[08:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh.

[08:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm in a maze of indirection

[08:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there some kind of convention for JS constructors to ignore extra arguments if there's a larger number of args than what spec allows?

[08:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: That happens in js in general

[08:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[09:49:00.0000] <rubys>
Sam is OK with people using my SVG logos.

[09:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
that makes it sound like you're two persons :)

[09:51:00.0000] <rubys>
Yeah, I could have phrased that better.

[09:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
It would explain a lot

[10:54:00.0000] <beowulf>
i wonder if the net effect of publishing a spec draft with warnings will be that people are disinclined to submit feedback on the items marked controversial

[10:58:00.0000] <annevk5>
it's likely we'll publish that draft then?

[10:59:00.0000] <beowulf>
i think the poll shows without-warnings 10 ahead, and publishing one only as a majority

[11:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's only 6 ahead, and shrinking :)

[11:05:00.0000] <rubys>
My only hope was that it ends up with one side being a clear winner.  Looks like I'm not likely to get that.

[11:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, 'one draft' is a solid winner

[11:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
We should start a grassroots get-out-the-vote campaign

[11:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Ask Ericsson

[11:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
the with warnings draft still has over 50% voting no, though it is close

[11:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Manu says: "Clearly /something/ caused the WAI/PFWG to object, en masse, to the way things were being handled re: @summary in HTML5:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0556.html"

[11:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe someone should point him to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0583.html - "Of course it is not from WAI"

[11:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me goes to check up on that "microdata makes sense" email, to see if there's any response

[11:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think the only discussion on that list has been with someone who seems to not understand XML Namespaces

[11:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
0 replies, how surprising

[11:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, feel free to do so.

[11:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
'The "real" reason why xmlns should "not" be used' is a nice thread

[11:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: No thanks

[11:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'll just mention it on IRC and maybe he'll read the logs

[11:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Or maybe he'll accidentally skip over your line

[11:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Quite possibly

[11:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Anyway it doesn't seem a point worth wasting tens of man-minutes on by posting to the list

[11:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's what www-archive is for :P

[11:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
It doesn't seem a point worth wasting man-minutes on by posting to www-archive

[11:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's why I'm not doing it myself. The claim about all the objections coming from WAI has been debunked several times before. Once more probably won't help

[11:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
just like so many other debunked claims people keep repeating

[11:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Anyone reading www-archive has accepted waste up-front

[11:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
spending a few seconds deciding to ignore waste on www-archive is outweighed by the good stuff that often gets posted there

[11:33:00.0000] <rubys>
I've got Richard Schwerdtfeger to agree to discuss the current state of the answers to Ian's questions on ARIA on tomorrow's call, and it is my opinion that these answers will be enough to unblock Ian.  Now the question is: what does it take to get Hixie to join this *one* call?

[11:34:00.0000] <annevk5>
why can't Richard just say it over email?

[11:34:01.0000] <annevk5>
will give us a clearer log of the state too...

[11:35:00.0000] <rubys>
why is the sky blue?

[11:35:01.0000] <annevk5>
I'm not a physicist

[11:35:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not just Ian who doesn't attend the calls

[11:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Don't the rest of the non-callers deserve to hear the answers too?

[11:36:01.0000] <rubys>
I am not a psychologist.

[11:36:02.0000] <rubys>
the answers will be minuted.

[11:37:00.0000] <annevk5>
well, that's all I had

[11:37:01.0000] <rubys>
I believe a dialog is necessary.  And what has been going on the mailing list is not exactly a dialog.

[11:37:02.0000] <annevk5>
I assumed that since you were able to talk directly with Richard that much would be clear

[11:38:00.0000] <rubys>
I think I've been pretty clear: http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/08/12/Mountain-Mohammed-Mohammed-Mountain-Please-Talk

[11:38:01.0000] <rubys>
Looks like I

[11:38:02.0000] <rubys>
've pissed of Matt May.

[11:39:00.0000] <annevk5>
that blog entry was not clear on whether answers to ARIA LC comments would be discussed on the call

[11:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me notes that the sky is blue due to refraction of light

[11:39:02.0000] <annevk5>
in any case, it seems absurd that they can be discussed there, but that we cannot get a reply to our emails for another couple of months

[11:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, as long as PF's ASAP is as fast as it is, it doesn't seem like dialog can happen any faster than it currently is

[11:43:00.0000] <rubys>
FWIW, Richard and I not only work for the same company (so I can catch him via internal IM), we are in the same department.

[11:52:00.0000] <rubys>
In case is still isn't clear: Ian's ARIA LC comments will be discussed on tomorrow's call.

[12:00:00.0000] <rubys>
http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/08/12/Mountain-Mohammed-Mohammed-Mountain-Please-Talk#c1250100182

[12:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: if the PFWG folks are willing to give a sneak preview of their answers on the phone, I can tell them to high degree of certainty if Hixie will find their answer acceptable

[12:06:01.0000] <rubys>
excellent.

[12:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: I can also help clarify Hixie's request if needed, because based on things I've heard, I believe they may be confused between implementation requirements and authoring conformance requirements

[12:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"they" meaning the people trying to come up with an answer

[12:07:02.0000] <rubys>
A summary of what I understand to be the answer to the key issue: "Other than the role attribute, the host language takes precedence".

[12:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
whose key issue is that?

[12:08:01.0000] <rubys>
based on your answer, it is clear that I don't understand Ian's issue.

[12:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie's key issue is simply that he'd like to make "nonsensical" combinations of native markup and ARIA nonconforming

[12:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's fine to let ARIA take precedence in behavior if someone actually does it

[12:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but ARIA apparently doesn't let host languages make any ARIA markup nonconforming

[12:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the idea being that if you tell ARIA that your radio button is a checkbox, you probably did something wrong

[12:10:01.0000] <rubys>
my understanding is that in the case on nonsensical combinations, non comforming is not only OK, it is preferred; furthermore, the host language takes precedence in everything but role.

[12:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe I should talk to Hixie and make sure *I* understand his issues

[12:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wait, are you stating what you think Hixie's position is, or what you think ARIA currently says?

[12:12:01.0000] <rubys>
even better, convince him to attend this one meeting.  I'm willing to clear the calendar of other items if that is what it takes.

[12:12:02.0000] <rubys>
I am stating what I believe the next draft of ARIA will state.

[12:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think convincing Hixie to attend a telecon is beyond my powers

[12:14:00.0000] <rubys>
See my latest comment on my latest blog post.

[12:15:00.0000] <rubys>
It is a damn shame when principles stand in the way of progress.

[12:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, am I correct in understanding that it would be inappropriate for Shelly to formatlly object to canvas being in HTML5 due to our previous vote on the issue in which the group formally decided to include it?

[12:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
or is it possible for such a formal objection to actually hold up progress?

[12:26:00.0000] <rubys>
Did you see Dan's response?   (by the way Cynthia Shelly isn't talking about an objection, Shell***E***y Powers is)

[12:27:00.0000] <rubys>
I do believe that the course of action that Shelley described would be treated as out-of-order

[12:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, I know. I didn't mention Cynthia

[12:28:00.0000] <rubys>
no, but you misspelled shelley

[12:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[12:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
sorry. I didn't realise you'd associated my typo with Cynthia's last name

[12:29:00.0000] <rubys>
oh, joy, matt responded again to my post

[12:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure which response from Dan you're talking about though. He hasn't responded to this http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0604.html (nor the one before that in that thread)

[12:51:00.0000] <rubys>
Lachy: I was talking about DanC's response before that point.  I do believe that objecting to canvas is out of order, and I do believe that the last call date is in jeopardy -- the latter mostly because the right people aren't volunteering to help.

[12:52:00.0000] <rubys>
Does anybody know of a javascript implementation of the HTML5 progress element that can be used on legacy browsers?

[12:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't remember having heard of one

[13:00:00.0000] <annevk5>
rubys, what parts need helping with in your opinion?

[13:03:00.0000] <rubys>
Whatever parts won't be ready until December. :-)

[13:03:01.0000] <rubys>
I don't have insight into a more granular breakdown of the tasks. 

[13:03:02.0000] <rubys>
I take it that DaveSinger and RichardS do.

[13:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
so given those names you think the issues are primarily with accessibility and maybe video codecs?

[13:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
given your statement "the latter mostly because the right people aren't volunteering to help" I was asking the above question, fwiw

[13:15:00.0000] <rubys>
just to make sure that we are talking about the same issue, two links: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/actions/133 and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0611.html and I should have said RichardS and Maciej

[13:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I believe it would be out of order to reopen the decision, but it's not out of order to make a Formal Objection to a decision before her time

[13:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm surprised that this wordpress exploit is even possible http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2009-August/070137.html

[13:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just upgraded the whatwg blog and my own blog to the new patched version.

[14:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: I don't know of a JS progress implementation, but studying the element it looks like it is probably doable with script to a rough approximation

[15:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: a2

[15:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
er, ignore me

[15:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
I pressed a sequence of incorrect keys...

[16:25:00.0000] <SamerZ>
what wig


2009-08-13
[17:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
Hm, I should make the RDF conversion algorithm ignore itemprop=""s that have no ":" or "." if the item="" was empty

[17:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: got a second to talk about ARIA?

[17:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[17:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
we just passed r3600

[17:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
woot!

[17:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
ok so

[17:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
if we rotated one degree for each revision, we'd be very dizzy by now, but facing the same way as we started.

[17:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
little known useless facts, brought to you by Ian.

[17:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I think it's not that little known :P

[17:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
well if i hadn't told you we'd reached r3600 first :-P

[17:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you'd worked faster and done one commit per second, it would only have taken an hour to reach this far instead of five years

[17:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Now that's a useful fact

[17:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
lol

[17:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
actually the repo started in like 2006 or 2007 or something

[17:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So like 4 edits per day

[17:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
sounds about right

/me wonders where othermaciej went

[17:41:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Candlejack

[17:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: got interrupted, hang on a sec

[17:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have a hard out in 15 minutes

[17:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: Sam convinced one of the PFWG big shots to attend tomorrow's telecon and possibly talk about the blocking last call issues on ARIA

[17:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I'm not even going to ask you to attend, but I plan to

[17:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I'd like to understand your Last Call comments and other objections clearly, so I can give informed comments on their plans

[17:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'll be asleep and far from any phones at the time of the telecon

[17:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: to be clear - is your concern solely about document conformance, and leaving HTML5 the freedom to define "nonsense" states as nonconforming?

[17:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i think you understand them -- we just want to be able to have well-defined conformance criteria for authors that are sane (no radiobutton checkboxes or headers that aren't headers or whatnot), and well defined conformance criteria for implementations when the author ones are ignored.

[17:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: let me ask you about one hypothetical

[17:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
let's say it is defined that in the <input type="radiobutton" role="checkbox" checked aria-checked="false"> case....

[17:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
conformance checkers were allowed to flag the checked/aria-checked conflict as nonconforming, and specs were allowed to specifically define cases as nonconforming, and "native" state is defined to take precedence for implementations

[17:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
would it be important to have the same for role, so that for example <input type="radiobutton" role="checkbox" checked> can be disallowed by the host language?

[17:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think your answer will be that, yes, conflicting roles should be disallowed even if no other state is conflicting

[17:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
i think that's important, yes

[17:48:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but I want to confirm

[17:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd like to make any contradictions between html semantics and aria semantics a conformance error

[17:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
all right, I think I can give them an informed opinion tomorrow, in that case

[17:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
and i'd like to make any such contradictions have crystal clear implementation requirements, ideally requirements that cause the visual semantics to be propagated to the AT even if the aria semantics would contradict the visual semantics

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. native semantics should win (i think that would lead to more accessible pages)

[17:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roger that

[17:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. <h1 role=checkbox> shouldn't be valid either, and should act like an <h1> to ATs, not a checkbox

[17:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm assuming that <div>, for example, would have null intrinsic semantics and thus be compatible with any ARIA role

[17:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
right

[17:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
seems likely

[17:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't checked all the roles, but i assume that would be true

[17:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I can also imagine some elements might be compatible with other roles despite having a default one, though I have not checked the list in detail either

[17:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for example, they have an example of giving <li> a menuitem role, which seems reasonable since lists are often used as menus (whether pop-up or static)

[17:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems reasonable

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i gotta go

[17:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[17:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
later!

[00:25:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: yt?

[00:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
here

[00:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
guess rubys and I were not talking about the same issue then :/

[00:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: when the user presses the stop button, does the tokenizer need to emit EOF?

[00:29:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Can I have a copy of the source of html5?

[00:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: unspecified currently. probably yes.

[00:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: sure http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/source

[00:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's a bit of a problem in Gecko...

[00:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: or do you mean the source i sent to pimpmyspec.net?

[00:30:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: With header :)

[00:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[00:30:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: yes

[00:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
hm

[00:30:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Gecko wants the stop button to kill the parser synchronously

[00:30:07.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: we can probably allow various implementations, interop is of little consequence in that case

[00:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: OK. thanks

[00:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: send mail if you want the spec to mention it, otherwise, it's just a UI feature and out of scope, your choice

[00:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: hold on, i'll have to get my script to generate the temp file then abort it

[00:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: whatwg or w3c?

[00:31:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: I was guessing it would be something like that

[00:31:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: either/both

[00:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the thing is, there are more than UI features that trigger the same behavior

[00:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: specifically, app cache can cause stop button-like behavior

[00:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
my script generates 10 difference files that it then uses as input to the various processors like anolis

[00:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in which case a synchronous EOF is bad, bad

[00:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
different, rather

[00:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/source-whatwg-html5

[00:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: grab it now, it'll get nuked next time i run the script

[00:33:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: thx

[00:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that's more like location.replace() behaviour, i think

[00:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: though if you don't think that's clear enough, send mail

[00:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
afk for a while

[00:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think I'll create a patch. if it works, I'll feed the result back into the spec

[00:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
evening, folks

[00:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: what issue?

[00:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: are you going to be at the telecon?

[00:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I have other commitments that will prevent me from being there properly

[00:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: no prob, just wanted to know

[00:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I told Sam I would be there to be able to explain the ARIA integration issues, and comment on the PFWG's sneak preview of their proposed resolution thereof

[00:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be nice to have backup from someone who know the issues but I can do without

[00:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
othermaciej, oh, in http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090812#l-315 Sam Ruby seemed to be talking about Last Call so I asked what needed helping and he replied with links just about the <canvas> accessibility discussion in the end

[00:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: I think the group of accessibility folks who want to make a canvas accessibility proposal may need help from people who know a lot about how canvas works

[00:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: I'm not entirely convinced this is the most problematic issue, but it does seem to be the one with the farthest-out action item due date

[00:50:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me realizes why PMS uses UTF-8, he thinks

[00:55:00.0000] <annevk5>
othermaciej, it would be best to get help from people who made desktop apps written in some graphics library accessible, methinks

[00:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: that might be better

[00:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: if some of the relevant accessibility people are there, I'd like to hear from them what kind of help they want, and see if I can convince someone with the right skills to help them make a proposal sooner rather than later

[01:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Do tell

[01:04:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Were you still using your own modified Anolis before updating?

[01:04:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Which had a subtly different API, as I changed it slightly when merging?

[01:04:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Could be

[01:05:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: I want PMS source! :P

[01:05:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Also see html5lib #111

[01:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: If you want the source why not look at it?

[01:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Yeah I just got that bug report

[01:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
html5lib really really needs some love

[01:08:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Where is the PMS source? I forget

[01:09:00.0000] <jgraham>

jgraham: encoding needs to be output_encoding

[01:14:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: I can email you a patch

[01:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: did you manage to find your non-author-content-stripping script?

[01:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Yeah I am integrating it into anolis

[01:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sweet

[01:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hold on and I will upload some sample output

[01:19:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Clearly it doesn't work

[01:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: A patch would be welcome

[01:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: http://hoppipolla.co.uk/410/output.html

[01:24:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Is it not always using html5lib to parse now, on PMS?

[01:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Literally the first time I have run the code so probably horribly wrong

[01:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Maybe. Did you change something else too?

[01:25:02.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, fun -- http://mail.apps.ietf.org/ietf/charsets/msg00146.html -- and here I thought UTF-8 was fine

Hixie: Do you just use regexps to split the spec source into different documents?

In any case do you mind sharing what you do?

[02:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
if we split out the canvas API, I wonder if the public-canvas-api mailing list that was set up a year and half ago for this purpose would finally see some use, or if the work would moved to public-webapps or stay within public-html

[02:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has no idea how splitting out the canvas api would work

[02:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
presumably, it would take the CanvasRenderingContext2D API, leaving the actual element within HTML5 and have normative references between the two specs

[02:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
That seems like the type of complex surgery that leads to undefined behaviour in the gaps

[03:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
why? How would defining the 2D context in a separate spec pose any more challenges than defining a 3D context, which is currently being worked on elsewhere

[03:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't see why it would be complex, as long as you don't mind having lots of normative references to the HTML5 spec

[03:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well the 3D effort hasn't actually produced any interoperable implementations yet so you can't really use it as an example of why it will work

[03:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I don't think there'd need to be normative references from HTML5 to the Context2D spec, unless I'm forgetting things)

[03:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe if all the references are in one direction it will work better.

[03:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
Take whole of section 4.8.11.1 The 2D context, and most of 4.8.11.3 Security with canvas elements (the parts specific to where the 2D context api sets the origin-clean flag) and put it into it's own spec

[03:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
and have most of the normative references go from the 2D API spec to HTML5, with just one normative reference from HTML5 to say that implementations must support the 2D context

[03:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why do you need to say they must support the 2D context?

[03:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
However I would still worry about people assuming that some issue will be defined in HTML5 and HTML5 assuming that the context defines the issue

[03:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
And I don't see anyone who benefits from splitting it out

[03:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
you could possibly get away without requring support for it, but in reality, implementations need to support it regardless

[03:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since implementors implement things when they think their users want them not when the spec reaches a certian stage

[03:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, i'm not saying it's a good idea. Just that it's possible to do so if a) someone volunteers to edit it, and b) the HTMLWG decides it's a good idea

[03:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
I imagine one possibly tricky issue is mixing contexts (e.g. you draw a 3D scene, and then draw a 2D rectangle on it, then draw some more 3D, and what ends up in the bitmap?) which would need to be defined in some central place but might depend on details of the contexts

[03:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: In reality they need to support GIF and PNG and JPEG too, but the specs don't need to tell them that

[03:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes, I know that

[03:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
Practically I don't think it makes a jot of difference if HTML5 becomes a Rec. without accessibility hooks for canvas, as long as the work on those hooks is actually happening

[03:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what happens if you draw on both 2D and OperaGame contexts?

[03:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: so need for support doesn't much relevance on your proposed need to make HTML5 require support

[03:14:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
But then they aren't valid HTML 5, and that's the end of the world as we know it (and I feel fine)

[03:14:03.0000] <jgraham>
Because no implementor will go "oh we can't make out <canvas> implementation accessible because that is a HTML6 feature and we are only working on HTML5 features"

[03:14:04.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: You can't draw on opera-2dgame contexts

[03:14:05.0000] <jgraham>
And authors only care about what is implemented

[03:14:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: A lot of authors care about validity, though

[03:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: but you can use it to access the canvas bitmap state, and the 2D context path state

[03:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ah

[03:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Since canvas accessibility will almost certianly not involve static markup but DOM APIs that isn't very relevant

[03:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway I don't imagine we will get consensus on the view that practicaility beats purity

[03:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I didn't use that as an argument for why there needs to be a normative reference. I agreed with you that we could get away without it. I just noted that it would need to be supported anyway

[03:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Okay, so there doesn't need to be a normative reference from HTML5 to 2D, so it's all nice and one-way :-)

[03:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Well, except for things like examples in the HTML5 spec

[03:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
and things like references to the 2D API for colour space explanations

[03:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I don't see why mixing a 2D context and a 3D context would be tricky, as each one draws immediately over the top of whatever else was put there before it. It's like paiting with one brush, picking up another and painting with that and then going back to the first brush.

[03:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
it might not give particularly sensible results if the authors wasn't careful, but it would allow authors to draw 3D objects in a 2D scene, which might give some nice effects

[03:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Implementations don't use paint brushes - they use buffers in system memory and other buffers in video memory and have to efficiently transfer data between buffers until it eventually ends up on the screen

[03:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
and arbitrarily mixing 2D and 3D sounds like something that might be complex to implement correctly and efficiently

[03:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
And if you draw a 3D scene, then draw a 2D rectangle onto it, what happens to the depth buffer underneath the rectangle?

[03:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work, is your e-mail supposed to mean something to me? :-)

[03:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
it wouldn't affect it. Any depth information would be maintained by the 3D context object, which isn't relevant after the image has been drawn on the actual canvas. So the 2D context would just draw on top of it without knowing anything about the previously drawn 3D image, and likewise when the 3D context draws again

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: When the 3D image is drawn onto the canvas, the entire buffer will be copied, so it'll overwrite any 2D stuff that was drawn before

[03:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
right

[03:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
so you couldn't usefully mix 2D and 3D

[03:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, I suppose you could still draw 2D on top of 3D)

[03:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but not the other way around)

[03:32:02.0000] <Lachy>
why is there a difference?

[03:33:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
3D drivers like to own a rectangle

[03:33:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
it's possible to do 2D drawing using 3D APIs though

[03:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
It sounds like this will need to be defined

[03:33:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but currently no one does

[03:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: The 2D drawing operations can modify the canvas bitmap directly; 3D drawing usually works in its own hardware-accelerated world and then gets copied to the canvas, so it ignores whatever's already in the canvas bitmap

[03:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
Since it sounds like there are two possible approaches (at least)

[03:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
(hence the difference)

[03:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
however using 2D for 3D drawing is tricky

[03:34:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Presumably one could keep the whole canvas bitmap in the 3D world

[03:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
(assuming the 2D drawing isn't hardware-accelerated too)

[03:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
Somehow

[03:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(because at least older versions of OpenGL are not good about anti-aliasing of polylines or polygons, and are pretty bad at drawing text as well)

[03:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: One could, e.g. Mozilla uses Cairo which has some OpenGL/DirectX backends (though apparently they're not great)

[03:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I can ask my more graphics-oriented colleagues who are in the WebGL group to raise this issue

[03:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I expect mixing 2D and 3D will do weird and non-interoperable things in the first cut, but I'm also not sure it is a terribly important use case

[03:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: Could be useful to ask - it seems like it'd be nice to have sensible interactions between 2D and 3D contexts, e.g. you could render a 3D scene then use getImageData to apply an edge filter

[03:58:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: WPF uses 3D *hardware* for accelerated 2D drawing, very aggressively

[03:59:00.0000] <roc>
using getImageData to apply edge filters when you have 3D hardware available is grotesque

[03:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: it might be that modern 3D hardware does everything you need for 2D graphics

[04:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
What's wrong with grotesque? :-)

[04:02:00.0000] <roc>
grotesque is tolerable

[04:02:01.0000] <roc>
incredibly slow is not

[04:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
You just need to make your JS engine faster :-p

[04:02:03.0000] <roc>
well

[04:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't currently think of any really compelling use cases for mixing 2D and 3D APIs

[04:03:01.0000] <roc>
even a hand-tuned vectorized assembly language edge filter running on the CPU is going to be orders of magnitude slower than a GPU-based implementation

[04:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
You just need to make your JS engine run on the GPU, then

[04:04:01.0000] <roc>
that was my line

[04:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
How hard can it be?

[04:06:00.0000] <roc>
we definitely want to be using a cairo GL backend so we can mix 2D rendering, 3D rendering and custom GPU programs efficiently

[04:06:01.0000] <roc>
there are quite a few places we could use the GPU to speed up regular Web browsing

[04:07:00.0000] <roc>
but there's so much else to do...

[04:07:01.0000] <roc>
fortunately cairo-gl is making progress on its own

[04:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it's quite common to want to draw a HUD over a 3D scene and to use high-quality fonts on the HUD

[04:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: doing it with a 3D API tends to be annoying

[04:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Ah, text sounds like a good example

[04:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
though would you necessarily want to use the 2D API directly on top of the 3D image, when you could easily create a temporary canvas and do some 2D text drawing then load it as a texture into the 3D canvas API?

[04:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: well, the texture loading so that there's no pixel supersampling and so that it gets mapped to a plane that is guaranteed to be perpendicular to the line of sight is annoying

[04:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it's much nicer to be able to treat the same rectangle as a 2D surface and let the infrastructure do whatever texture magic it needs to do

[04:38:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Change the URLs :)

[04:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
done

[04:39:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I guess I ought to have had the g flag seeming there are multiple URLs :)

[04:53:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
Hixie: I think I understand the issue Mozilla had with clientX, screenY positions of the "drag" and "dragend" events now. It's unclear what those attributes are relative to. Implicitly I would interpret that it's the current mouse position relative to the source node. But apparently there are alternative interpretations.

[04:55:00.0000] <annevk5>
client is relative to the viewport and screen relative to the screen iirc

[04:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
sebmarkbage: yeah we need a user interaction events specification to define this stuff

[04:57:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
annevk5: yea, but which viewport if dragged across multiple windows? source or target? obviously it should be source, but it's undefined.

[04:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
when a JS constructor/method takes an optional string argument, should null behave like no argument or like "null"?

[04:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
sebmarkbage: it should be relative to whatever viewport it is being dispatched to, imho

[04:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
by convention?

[04:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: "null"

[04:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
by WebIDL

[04:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: thanks

[04:59:03.0000] <sebmarkbage>
Hixie: I agree. Which is the source viewport for "drag" and "dragend".

[05:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
sebmarkbage: ah, right

[05:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I intend to push an optional constructor argument for XMLSerializer in the Firefox 3.6 timeframe. Due to lack of feedback on public-webapps, I'm assuming this isn't a horribly bad idea.

[05:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the constructor argument is a MIME type for explicitly requesting particular serialization format

[05:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
unknows default to XML

[05:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
*unknowns

[05:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
you realise that if you're the last person to have touched XMLSerializer, you then officially own it and will be expected to write its spec, right

[05:02:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Yes, I realize that.

[05:02:05.0000] <Hixie>
sweet

[05:02:06.0000] <Hixie>
we have a volunteer!

[05:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
that was easier than i expected

[05:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: is XMLSerializer actually useful enough to be worth extending?

[05:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: well, WebKit and MySpace compat are indicator suggesting Gecko's default behavior should change

[05:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: but the current Gecko trunk behavior is useful, so the optional argument would allow that behavior to be requested

[05:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Is it a bad idea not to allow MIME type parameters?

[05:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the API is just kind of lame - the idea that you create an object just to call a single method that does the whole operation without needing an object for state is bogus

[05:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
i.e. "text/html" is the same as "text/HTML" but "text/html; charset=foo" is different?

[05:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: this introduces object state!

[05:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I can see the use of forcing serialization as XML or HTML

[05:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: yeah, but it's state that should be a parameter to the operation!

[05:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I don't think it's a given that it should be a parameter on the method

[05:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
offering a MIME parameter also seems needlessly general

[05:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
presumably HTML and XML are the only two formats actually on offer

[05:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: currently yes, but I can foresee offering XHTML and SVG modes that are somehow nicer than generic XML in the future

[05:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Gecko already has distinct XML and XHTML serializers

[05:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit always tries to be "nice" about serializing elements in the XHTML namespace as XML

[05:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, for what exactly do we now have a volunteer?

[05:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i think hsivonen said he'd write the XMLSerializer spec

[05:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(i.e. make the markup HTML-compatible to the degree possible, for instance by only using minimized syntax for void elements)

[05:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: no, I said I realize I'm expected to if I touch XMLSerializer :-)

[05:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[05:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess in Gecko internals, XMLSerializer has a stream interface in which case making it stateful is useful

[05:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but if I wanted a way to add forced XML and HTML serialization, without considering special Gecko needs, I would just add markupAsXML and markupAsHTML methods to Document and Element to go along with innerHTML

[05:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so you have a way to force either serialization that's just as convenient as getting the native serialization

[05:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
saying new XMLSerializer("application/xml").serializeToString(doc) instead of doc.markupAsXML smells like Java to me

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
basically, with my patch, new XMLSerializer() creates a serializer that picks HTML vs. XML from the HTMLness flag on the document

[05:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
new XMLSerializer("text/html") forces HTML

[05:14:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and new XMLSerializer("application/xml") forces XML

[05:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
well bummer

[05:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
html5 doesn't pass acid3.

[05:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
i suck.

[05:15:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I understand your proposal, I just think it's a bad API for that functionality

[05:15:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: 72?

[05:15:05.0000] <Hixie>
71

[05:15:06.0000] <hsivonen>
right

[05:15:07.0000] <hsivonen>
72 was from memory

[05:15:08.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Wait, what… Currently XMLSerializer() returns HTML in HTML documents?

[05:15:09.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: in shipped WebKit, yes

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: in shipped Opera and Firefox, it requires bogus stuff that's neither HTML nor XHTML

[05:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
three options

[05:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
i make acid3 allow uppercase or lowercase

[05:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I have to admit that was not really a considered decision

[05:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
i make html5 uppercase instead of lowercasing (bad for dom/xhtml consistency)

[05:16:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: It's HTML 4.01, so I'd make it case insensitive

[05:16:06.0000] <Hixie>
i make html5 case-sensitive

[05:17:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
s/it c/acid3 c/

[05:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm leaning towards making acid3 case-insensitive, yeah

[05:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: would you change it knowing that changing it would break a MySpace feature unless MySpace changes their JS?

[05:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: the real web compat requirement is not having namespace declarations, right?

[05:17:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: yes

[05:17:05.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, can we make it simpler than media types?

[05:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: IDL constants are more complex

[05:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would consider text/html to be a less bogus choice than XML with HTML elements moved to the null namespace

[05:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: I could make it "html"

[05:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
if those are the only two choices

[05:18:04.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, we could just have "xml" and "html"

[05:18:05.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: I think it should just be two methods on Document/Element

[05:18:06.0000] <othermaciej>
like I said

[05:18:07.0000] <othermaciej>
doc.markupAsXML

[05:18:08.0000] <othermaciej>
vs

[05:18:09.0000] <othermaciej>
XMLSerializer("application/xml").serializeToString(doc)

[05:19:00.0000] <annevk5>
doc.innerHTML ?

[05:19:01.0000] <annevk5>
doc.innerHTML depends on the HTMLness/XMLness of a Document

[05:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
innerHTML unfortunately has to mean "serialize as this document's format" which I guess is what XMLSerializer has to do, if we can't convince myspace to change

[05:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm saying two new properties similar to innerHTML would be a nicer API than two new modes for XMLSerializer

[05:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
easier to feature test for, too

[05:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I wouldn't be at all surprised if it wasn't just MySpace running naive regexps over XMLSerializer output

[05:20:03.0000] <hsivonen>
the feature testing argument makes sense

[05:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. zcorpan isn't here

[05:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan owns Document and Element now, right?

[05:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
an equally feature-testable approach would be to add two new methods to XMLSerializer, but I still think that is needlessly complex

[05:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
fair enough

[05:22:01.0000] <annevk5>
is it defined how to serialize SVG subtrees within HTML btw?

[05:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not sure. It will need to get defined in detail.

[05:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: fixed acid3

[05:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: thanks

[05:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
added http://acid3.acidtests.org/acid3-2009-08-13.tar.gz for those of you who use acid3 tarballs

[05:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I still get Test 71 failed: doc.open is not a function

[05:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: could very well be my bug

[05:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: firefox passes test 71 for me, so, that seems like your bug.

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: with what value of html5.enable?

[05:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
true

[05:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. interesting!

[05:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
wait, you thought i had it set to false?

[05:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i live on the edge!

[05:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
:-)

[05:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
only luddites would have html5.enable set to false!

[05:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
clearly we need to add an EnableHTML5 hidden pref to Safari, and make it not do anything

[05:33:00.0000] <annevk5>
hah, you'd have to fix some parser bugs first!

[05:34:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hixie: Are you a luddit even if your just checking whether the old parser has a bug?

[05:34:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
*you're

[05:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders|work: nah, then you're just living in the past

[05:34:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me stabs self for that mistake (with a plastic knife, again)

[05:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
without knowing what XMLSerializer does, exactly, I would make the API something like document.toString([type]) where type = "html"|"xml"

[05:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I understand that this is not backward compatible)

[05:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
basically, I want to accomplish the following:

[05:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
 1) Make XMLSerializer applied to HTML docs compatible with WebKit

[05:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
 2) Have an API that people won't be too unhappy with in the future for serializing HTML docs/subtrees as namespace-correct XML

[05:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
 3) Do this in the Gecko 1.9.2 timeframe

[05:49:00.0000] <Mrmil>
Hi, I have a little offtopic question: I heard that <input type="file"> is not stylable for security purposes. Can anyone tell me an example of such abuse? :)

[05:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
 4) I don't want to make unilateralist Browser Wars -type actions.

[05:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
Mrmil, http://lachy.id.au/dev/markup/examples/forms/file/

[06:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Mrmil, those demos worked in older versions of Firefox. They've since made it more difficult though, since you can't type directly into the control any more

[06:02:00.0000] <Mrmil>
Lachy: Ok, thanks, will check it out

[06:06:00.0000] <Mrmil>
Lachy: it reminds me of clickjacking a little bit

[06:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[06:13:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
Hixie: About separating copy/paste and drag/drop. I think we missunderstand eachother. I'm asking for the current copy/paste model to be replaced with what's already implemented in WebKit (which is also similar to IE).

[06:18:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
The distinction is that it's valid for data in a copy/paste operation to live for a long time, while in a drag/drop operation the data can be considered invalid after dragend. It has nothing to do with whether or not the code supports multiple apps or not.

[06:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505783 xml:base is actually being used from script

[07:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200908/maillist.html Namespaces seem to dominate the discussion

[07:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200907/msg00157.html

[07:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see how that's much of an improvement over xmlns, since his using.foo="" attributes create just as much of an abstraction as xmlns:foo does, just with a slightly different syntax and processing rules

[07:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
but the idea of using elements  like <com.example.foo> is intriguing and possibly worth further investigation

[07:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me bets that it has compat issues

[07:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although maybe it would be OK as long as people are using namespace-unaware APIs

[07:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
it has compat issues where he suggests document.getElementsByTagName("id") would match an element like <com.example.id>

[07:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh yeah, that wouldn't work

[07:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I'm going to reply, although I'm afraid I'll get sucked into more debate than I want to get sucked into

[07:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's not clear whether he's suggesting the syntax should work in XML too, thus providing a complete alternative to xmlns, or whether it would just apply to HTML

[07:48:00.0000] <annevk42>
I kind of like nl.annevankesteren.example

[07:48:01.0000] <annevk42>
as element and attribute namespacing-style

[07:52:00.0000] <annevk42>
hmm, apparently the On2 takeover is under attack

[07:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should register the domain stom.cu, for use in reverse-DNS custom names

[07:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Why aren't you doing it yourself?

[07:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Because I assume it costs money

[07:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You can make that back by selling the rights to <somename>.stom.cu

[08:00:00.0000] <annevk42>
it's not available

[08:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
US$1150/year, apparently

[08:00:02.0000] <annevk42>
that too

[08:00:03.0000] <Lachy>
charge roylaties for people using cu.stom.elements in their vocabularies :-)

[08:00:04.0000] <Philip`>
annevk42: According to something like http://www.marcaria.com/register/domain/domain_registration.asp?country=Cuba ?

[08:00:05.0000] <Lachy>
woah, why would a .cu TLD be that costly?

[08:00:06.0000] <Philip`>
That says lkjfxhgklejhxgkljh.cu is not available either

[08:00:07.0000] <Dashiva>
I suppose expecting a four-letter name to be free is naive?

[08:01:00.0000] <annevk42>
Philip`, ah ok

[08:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
"I'm using <progress> right now to indicate how far someone is in providing translations for our program.  I'm waiting for browsers to catch up and actually display the element, but in the meantime the fallback content is fine." - oh no, legacy content before the feature even exists :-(

[08:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, do you have a reference regarding the On2 takeover being under attack?

[08:05:00.0000] <annevk42>
a Dutch one

[08:05:01.0000] <annevk42>
apparently the stockholders of On2 are not satisfied

[08:05:02.0000] <smedero>
in english: http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10308834-93.html

[08:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like haggling over the price

[08:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Sounds like something everyone should've seen coming

[08:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(Well, those involved in the deal)

[08:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
The shareholders would be a bit silly if they didn't try to squeeze as much money out of Google as they could

[08:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
the amount being offered is already "a 57 percent premium over On2's closing stock price on the last trading day before the announcement", and it's absurd to think receiving 157% of the company's value is too low

[08:11:00.0000] <annevk42>
apparently not

[08:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, the article also mentions it was trading much above that not long ago

[08:11:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Stock prices do bounce

[08:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
the article doesn't say whether that was just a spike in the stock price or whether it normally trades steadily around that price

[08:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The people who control the release of the announcement have a high interest in as low a price as possible, so it'd seem likely they'd time it for a low 

[08:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me tries to get a graph from google finance

oh, thanks smedero 

[08:14:04.0000] <smedero>
(2007 to June 2009)

[08:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
so it's been on its way down since 2007, with little sign of it starting to suddenly increase

[08:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
With that kind of insight, you could make millions on the stock market

[08:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
:-D

[08:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, it was at $29 back in 2000. It's only a matter of time before it gets back up there. The shareholders should demand that much!

[08:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/pf-summary/tabular-data.html#attr-table-summary

[08:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How appropriate, the summary description is so dense as to require a summary :)

[08:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
That version also adds table.summary, table.createSummary(), table.deleteSummary()

[08:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, the latter two are probably just bad copypasting of the element-specific methods

[08:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(Not that I've seen anyone use create/delete table methods in the first place)

[08:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, it doesn't help that not only is it one excessively long paragraph, the line-height used in that copy of the spec is too low. The whatwg copy uses line-height: 1.35, which is much more legible.

[08:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm starting to understand what they mean about "inaccessible to people with cognitive disabilities"

[09:24:00.0000] <annevk42>

[09:38:00.0000] <Philip`>

perhaps: http://twitter.com/collinjackson/status/3287900575

[09:39:01.0000] <annevk42>
yeah

[09:39:02.0000] <annevk42>
he made some small change I suppose

[09:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What happened to cool URIs do not change

[09:46:00.0000] <smedero>
It is coolness factor was not high enough to trigger immutability 

[09:46:01.0000] <smedero>
s/it is/its/

[09:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
"< Dashiva> (Not that I've seen anyone use create/delete table methods in the first place)" - I was going to say "here's a zillion pages that rely on those methods", but actually I grepped for (create|delete)(Caption|THead|TFoot|TBody) and found zero :-(

[09:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[09:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I didn't even know they existed until I read the webapps spec for <table>

[10:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
Actually I have it right now, on https://mail.google.com

[10:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, in your survey response, you wrote: "In general I'm ok with publishing all Editor's Draft that have majority approval, but they have to offer *some non-normative difference* in my opinion." (emphasis added)

[10:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
don't you mean they have to offer some *normative* difference?

[10:43:00.0000] <annevk42>
doh

[12:01:00.0000] <annevk42>
oh yes, I'm on ietf-charsets now

[12:02:00.0000] <annevk42>
I guess I should ask a question on how to register an alias now given that there's no official thingie for that

[12:24:00.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, http://mail.apps.ietf.org/ietf/charsets/msg01830.html

[12:25:00.0000] <annevk42>
/me eagerly awaits the first email pointing out it is completely impossible ever to register anything with a "x-" prefix and that the remaining one looks dodgy

[12:33:00.0000] <annevk42>
/me also subscribed to http-state for good measure

[12:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me subscribed to ietf-charsets to track the issue

[12:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, Would it be possible for you to publish a full, non-split version of HTML5 that includes all of web workers, web storage/database, etc?  Reading those split out specs is annoying since so many of the references to HTML5 aren't linked.

[12:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: You could write the code to handle cross-spec cross-referencs :-)

[12:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I replied on xml-dev: http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200908/msg00203.html

[12:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, that doesn't solve the other problem of me having to keep more than one spec open, thus using up more than one tab

[12:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me doesn't really understand why shareholders can sue in this case

[12:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thought shareholders got to vote in situations like this, and that's it. Sucks to be a minority shareholder.

[12:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Kinda sucks to be a publicly held company, too, sometimes.

[13:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I just broke pimpmyspec doing an upgrade. Sorry

[13:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh wait, I think I just gave it invalid input

[13:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems to work

[14:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk42: nice. note the long list of other aliases that we need to register that aren't in teh spec yet, though

[14:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i haven't been maintaining the source in a way that would make that pretty

[14:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Upgrade = applying patch from me?

[14:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yes

[14:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, I guess I should tell you now you've done it that I didn't test it or anything :P

[14:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: did you notice the namespace thread on xml-dev?

[14:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
uri?

[14:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm not on xml-dev)

my reply: http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200908/msg00203.html

the email I replied to: http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200907/msg00157.html

[14:06:00.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, you mean once we update the spec to no longer use the Unicode matching algorithm?

[14:06:01.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, or some other list I've missed?

[14:06:02.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, in any case, once I figure out how this works that should be no problem :)

[14:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk42: some other list you've missed

[14:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll get you a link in a few minutes

[14:07:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
Hixie: today's telecon was actually marginally useful

[14:07:02.0000] <othermaciej_>
(it hurts me to type that)

[14:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: you mean it allowed you to communicate with people who seem only able to make progress holding a telephone to their ear?

[14:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: indeed, I believe I successfully served as Speaker-to-Telephone-Users

[14:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think they didn't actually understand the issue, and for some reason hearing the examples of role conflicting with native semantics out loud helped them

[14:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
otoh, "most useful 15 minutes of telecon time ever" is a pretty low bar

[14:12:00.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, other than the list that says ISO-8859-1 must be treated as windows-1252 I cannot find anything

[14:12:01.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, within HTML5, that is

[14:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk42: yeah hold on i have like 18 things going on here

[14:15:00.0000] <annevk42>
hmm, my mind shifts to wondering how I can cause some overflow exception to occur :evil:

[14:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk42: http://www.mail-archive.com/whatwg⊙lwo/msg16301.html

[14:20:00.0000] <annevk42>
ah crap

[14:20:01.0000] <annevk42>
that also involved toally new encodings

[14:21:00.0000] <annevk42>
such as a bunch of legacy Mac encodings

[14:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wouldn't worry about all of them necessarily

[14:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
especially if IE doesn't do them

[14:21:03.0000] <annevk42>
all browsers support them

[14:23:00.0000] <annevk42>
solving the whole problem seems like a daunting task

[14:25:00.0000] <annevk42>
based on a 4M data set it appears these Mac encodings are actually used too

[14:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's a reason i shied away :-)

[14:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
:-( sending legacy mac encoding to a public network sucks

[14:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk42: oh man i totally forgot to remind you about the podcast idea, thanks for remembering

[14:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: interesting proposal, though it seems to suffer from the lack of graceful degradation

[14:31:00.0000] <annevk42>
1) we need a list of encoding names required for web compat 2) we need documentation that gives you the canonicalized encoding name for a given encoding name 3) we need a mapping to Unicode for a given byte stream + canonicalized encoding name 4) we need a mapping from Unicode + a canonicalized encoding name to a byte stream

[14:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it seems like a slight improvement would be <x class="com.example.y"> instead of <com.example.y>, where "x" is the closest corresponding HTML element

[14:31:02.0000] <annevk42>
the outcome is not profit, so not sure how to motivate people here :)

[14:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm all out of time, otherwise i'd be all over this

[14:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
was someone asking me about the spec splitter script i use at some point?

[14:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
something about regexps or something

[14:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Myself and jgraham were talking about it at work…

[14:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i must be psychic

[14:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't remember why we were discussion it, but the conclusion was it would probably be easiest and best to ask you for your script rather than write our own

[14:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*discussing

[14:45:00.0000] <virtuelv>
document.write("<base href='"+some_url+"'>");

[14:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: ah. i can send you the script if you want, but it won't help you much (it's quite dependent on the setup i have here)

[14:45:02.0000] <virtuelv>
is the behavior specified somewhere in HTML5?

[14:45:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Yeah it would be nice to know how you process the spec. ATM I am just making some very simple assumptions about the use of start and end markers

[14:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: yes

[14:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham⊙oc?

[14:45:06.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: I assume it does set it?

[14:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
and gsnedders⊙oc?

[14:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Sadly not :(

[14:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Sure

[14:46:03.0000] <jgraham>
Thanks

[14:46:04.0000] <gsnedders>
gsneddon

[14:46:05.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: it's relatively complicated, but yes, more or less

[14:46:06.0000] <gsnedders>
/me would much rather have gsnedders, as it keeps confusing people :(

[14:46:07.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: and it gets more complicated with opera's "delayed script execution" setting

[14:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders, jgraham: sent. it's a work in progress, though, so it might change tomorrow, say

[14:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
the <!--START xxx--> markers in particular changed semantics completely a few weeks ago

[14:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, regarding that pragmatic namespace thread, I had a thought about the getElementsByTagName() issue that couldn't work for back compat issues...

[14:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Is there any reason why the whole script gen toolchain isn't in SVN?

[14:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Thanks

[14:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, it's possible, if the idea of using custom elements like <com.example.foo> works out, it might be possible to introduce a new Selector that could be used with Selectors API, conceputally like querySelector("???.foo")

[14:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: it contains passwords and stuff, and is so tied to my local setup that i really don't see the point

[14:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I'd expect the perf of such a selector to be bad

[14:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I thought that might be an issue too, but I'm not sure

[14:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
at least if DOM implementation internals aren't changed

[14:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, it may need some DOM internals to be changed, so that the browser somehow remembers the last segment of the tag name and just matches against that, rather than trying to do a partial string match against the whole element

[14:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
although, to be honest, having to do getElementsByTagName("com.example.foo") isn't so bad, especially if it can be combined with JS libraries that take shorten it a bit

[14:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
var com_example = { 'foo': 'com.example.foo' 

[14:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Oops, silly enter key)

[14:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
var com_example = { 'foo': 'com.example.foo' } ... with (com_example) getElementsByTagName(foo)

[14:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
That's nice and short :-)

[14:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
Die with statement, die

[14:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, actually you could do var com = { 'example': { 'foo': 'com.example.foo' }} ... with (com.example) getElementsByTagName(foo) and then it's even shorter

[14:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
Wait, not shorter

[14:59:03.0000] <Philip`>
Longer

[14:59:04.0000] <Philip`>
but with prettier symbols

[15:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I was thinking some kind of wrapper function like function xxx(tagName) { document.getElementsByTagName("com.example." + tagName); }  xxx(foo);

[15:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Would 'with' be much less problematic if it was like "with (foo) { .bar == foo.bar }" (instead of "bar == foo.bar"), like in VB, since it would let you identify variable accesses that need to care about the with?

[15:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
er, I mean: xxx("foo");

[15:01:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Please let's not encourage use of with

[15:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's a solution to all problems!

[15:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, should we stop using "with" in english too?

[15:02:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I guess that would help

[15:02:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: Only if it refers to the with statement

[15:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, you just broke the rule

[15:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
No, it's only a 'should'

[15:03:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I had a good reason to break it :P

[15:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Seriously, though, with is headed for the scrap heap of history

[15:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
On the web, the scrap heap is kept in the living room

[15:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
http://hoppipolla.co.uk/410/spec-full.html

[15:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, that's a terrible metaphor

[15:05:03.0000] <jgraham>
http://hoppipolla.co.uk/410/spec-author.html

[15:05:04.0000] <Lachy>
What are the reasons to avoid two-way normative references?  Is it just a problem with the process that causes hold ups in spec development, or is there some real technical reason for it that actually affects the content of the spec?

[15:05:05.0000] <Philip`>
but anyway I guess I mean we're stuck with it

[15:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: It's an error in strict mode

[15:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
Like yesterday's jam

[15:06:02.0000] <Dashiva>
But we can't stop kids from playing in the heap, no

[15:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: No one implements that yet

[15:06:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I don't think there is a technical reason, it's just that if both sides of the xref are new, the specs can only be at most one step apart on the standards track

[15:06:05.0000] <othermaciej>
(where WD, CR, PR are the relevant states I think...)

[15:06:06.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: They will by the time the cloud castles discussed here are implemented :)

[15:06:07.0000] <Lachy>
right, so it's a problem with the process

[15:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
Shouldn't we fix the process?

[15:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I wouldn't say that kind of rule is a *problem*

[15:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it doesn't make sense to make something a frozen REC with an unstable normative reference

[15:07:03.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Presumably it makes conflicts or underdefinition more likely

[15:07:04.0000] <Philip`>
We should fix the process so there's no need to split it into a separate spec (since process issues and LC feature freezes were the reason to propose splitting it)

[15:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
if we try to fix the process at all

[15:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, good point

[15:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
maybe

[15:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think splitting out canvas is not a worthwhile way to spend our time at this point anyway, so I don't think we need to worry about the best way to do it in theory

[15:08:04.0000] <Lachy>
there was also the reason that people thought it would be better if the API were developed by a more graphically oriented group than HTML

[15:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
unless one of you wants to volunteer to edit the split spec and can have it WD-ready in like a month or so

[15:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
Shelley volunteered. Not sure how good she'd be as an editor, but she's welcome to try and put forth a proposal, at which point we can evaluate it and then decide how to proceed

[15:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems to me she volunteered to be declared editor with other co-editors in a newly created Working Group

[15:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I did not see where she volunteered to write some quality spec text in a timely manner or maintain it as needed

[15:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
Personally, I don't really care if we split it or not

[15:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
me neither, I'd just rather not spend a lot of time discussing it until someone steps up and does a passable initial attempt


2009-08-14
[17:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
Now that we have the ability to generate a copy of the spec with static annotations, I wonder what it would take to combine that with the dynamic annotations in the WHATWG copy so that the script only needs to check for changes in the annotations since the last commit

[17:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
that would significantly reduce load time on the spec

[17:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
it would actually increase load time for the spec itself

[17:30:03.0000] <Lachy>
the bottle neck is the javascript performance, not the download time

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
on another note, maybe we should have people pass a test to prove that they have read the html5 spec before they're allowed to propose text- or process- level changes to the spec or wg.

[17:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: in your browser maybe :-)

[17:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: in safari, the JS runs nice and fast

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
crap i marked the last checkin editorial but it affected html5 parser implementations

[17:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't like using safari for reading the spec because it lacks essential features I need for reading it efficiently

[17:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that would seriously cut down on the number of proposals, if enforced

[17:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: What kind of test, given that people are unlikely to retain even a small part of the whole spec?

[17:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: open book

[17:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: like what?

[17:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders what he's missing!

[17:34:02.0000] <Dashiva>
So more like a "Read these sections" in practice then :)

[17:34:03.0000] <Lachy>
like Find As You Type

[17:34:04.0000] <Lachy>
without having to press cmd+F or '/' to start searching

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: no, there are plenty of questions that require a clear understanding of many partso of the spec to answer.

[17:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
only Firefox has that feature. My repeated attempts to convince people that we need it Opera have failed :-(

[17:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
and Safari's find feature has an unacceptable delay

[17:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: putting a finger on a single key is too much?

[17:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I find it more than acceptable in return for being able to have single key shortcuts

[17:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, I hate single key shortcuts, and yes, being forced to press a single key I never remember to press is annoying

[17:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, if I find some time this weekend, I'll see if I can take a look at the annotations script and merge it with the static version

[17:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[17:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, how does status.cgi work? Is it backed by a database or static files?

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
backed by mysql

[17:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
would it be possible to get a copy of that database, status.cgi and any other files used for the annotations?

[17:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
last time I tried to do anything with the annotations script, my attempts failed because I couldn't substitue status.cgi with static files and so the script wouldn't run properly

[17:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, maybe I don't need to. I can just set up a local server side script that passes off all requests for status.cgi to your copy, thus bypassing the cross-origin restrictions

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>

i like how manu decided that microdata -- which was introduced 3 months ago -- was controversial under his 4 month rule

[00:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
but let it not be suggested that he's just doing this because he wants to bring attention to rdfa!

[00:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk42: DanC and rubys very specifically asked me to send a fresh email per issue

[00:49:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that's why I asked him for citatations...

[00:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>

feedback so far on charsets

[06:10:00.0000] <annevk42>
giving Windows-31J a Windows-932 alias can be done, giving encodings an alias that starts with "x-" cannot be done and registering treating things such as ISO-8859-1 -> windows-1252 is considered unwise

[06:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk42: why unwise?

[06:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk42: I can understand the x- stuff on the level of principle but not on the level of usefulness

[06:19:00.0000] <annevk42>
not sure, I asked some follow-up questions

[06:19:01.0000] <annevk42>
this is the feedback in email form: http://mail.apps.ietf.org/ietf/charsets/msg01833.html

[06:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
are people document.writing their flash objects in order to get around some Eolas-non-infringement silliness in IE?

[06:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or do people just love to document.write stuff?

[06:21:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: Most offline applications do treat ISO-8859-1 as ISO-8859-1

[06:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me mumbles about *Internet* Assigned Name Authority vs. "offline"

[06:23:00.0000] <Lachy_>
hsivonen, yeah, the Eolas patent is a large part of the reason, and even though Microsoft have, I think, since entered into a licencing agreement, that problem doesn't exists as much. However, Opera still suffers from the issue cause we don't pay the licencing fees

[06:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy_: Opera has code for working around Eolas?

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: I can see how it would suck if Java or Python APIs magically changed their meaning of ISO-8859-1 suddenly

[06:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it would still be good to have a Web-aware new decoder getter

[06:25:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: Surely that's the inevitable result of getting them defined as aliases, though?

[06:25:03.0000] <Lachy_>
hsivonen, AIUI, we implement the same document.write workaround that IE did

[06:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy_: I see. That's news to me.

[06:26:01.0000] <Lachy_>
but for flash embeded without document.write, we still require the click to activate nonsense

[06:43:00.0000] <krijnh>
Missing logs for 11th and 12th fixed, thanks Lachy_

Indeed :)

[06:44:03.0000] <krijnh>
I've only stripped some quit/join messages

[06:46:00.0000] <Lachy_>
krijnh, there may still be some missing. I think there were a few hours during which I wasn't connected

[06:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
Did you strip the bit where you admitted you were going to strip some secret discussions and then strip your admission and then deny all knowledge of it?

[06:46:02.0000] <krijnh>
Yeah

[06:46:03.0000] <krijnh>
But who cares

[06:46:04.0000] <Lachy_>
so if someone wants to fill in those hours between around midnight and 08:00, give or take a few hours, feel free to do so

[06:46:05.0000] <krijnh>
Philip`: I already said that two minutes ago, see the logs

[06:46:06.0000] <krijnh>

[06:47:00.0000] <krijnh>
And in the meantime, don't flag any lines

[06:59:01.0000] <krijnh>
Also, when a bus drives by, sometimes the LAN cable (with only 4 wires, because the other 4 are used for phones) becomes unstable

[06:59:02.0000] <krijnh>
I don't think a UPS would solve that

We should run logs on multiple independent machines and then have a cople of servers that pull logs from each logging node, merge the logs, and publish them

[07:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me logs IRC on a (fairly) stable server, but has no way of viewing the logs other than cat

[07:03:03.0000] <jgraham>
Redundancy is they key on such mission-crtitical applications

[07:03:04.0000] <krijnh>
jgraham: it's already producing smoke when Sam posts some links to it from his site :)

[07:03:05.0000] <Philip`>
krijnh: Sounds like you need caching :-)

[07:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
krijnh: Oh the /. suggestion was just to increase your downtime and/or set fire to your house

[07:04:01.0000] <krijnh>
That's three times 'you need' I don't really agree with :)

[07:05:00.0000] <krijnh>
Let's just not make HTML 5 a failure, so people don't need the logs anymore in a few years, okay?

[07:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
krijnh, you really need things you don't agree with

[07:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
krijnh: Also, you need to transfer the entire contents of your bank account to me

[07:06:00.0000] <krijnh>
(I think I once started making a backup on http://krijn.html5.org/irc-logs/)

[07:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
krijnh: I suggest you get a bank with a large overdraft, remove all the money to the overdraft limit as cash and then transfer the remaining debt to Philip` 

[07:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm afraid that's missing the point :-(

[07:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
looks like I can run a persistent process on my server, like IRC. I just need to find out what software to use to do it

[07:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
irssi!

[07:12:02.0000] <Lachy>
krijnh, could I get a copy of your logging software, so I can set up a mirror?

[07:12:03.0000] <annevk42>
hmm, krijnh is just hosting his IRC logs

[07:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, yeah, but he has some nice scripts that format it as HTML that I don't want to rewrite if I don't have to

[07:13:01.0000] <krijnh>
Lachy: the logging software is just mIRC

[07:14:00.0000] <krijnh>
You don't want to receive my crappy scripts either :)

[07:14:01.0000] <krijnh>
Or put differently, I don't want to share my crappy scripts with the outside world, cause then nobody will ever take me serious anymore

[07:15:00.0000] <krijnh>
Self-handicapping ftw

[07:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
fine. I will have to find or write my own alternative.

[07:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
for now, I will try to figure out how I can install irissi on my server

[07:15:03.0000] <Philip`>
"apt-get install irssi"

[07:15:04.0000] <Philip`>
then run it in screen

[07:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
then configure it a tiny bit

[07:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
I have no experience using screen. How does that work?

[07:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
the apt-get command is not available

[07:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Substitute the appropriate package manager for your Linux distro

[07:17:01.0000] <krijnh>
But I plan on rewriting some stuff

[07:17:02.0000] <krijnh>
And using Bens suggestions for styling as well

[07:17:03.0000] <Philip`>
You type "screen", and it runs a shell, and you run stuff in there; then you can press ctrl+A D to detach the screen, and "screen -r" to reattach to it later (possibly from a totally new ssh session or whatever)

[07:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
you'll want to add -U to those to force UTF-8 sanity

[07:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
unless your copy of screen is configured to be sane-by-default

[07:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I have no idea what linux distro is being used

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems to work for me without -U, with some combination of LANG=something.UTF-8 (both outside and inside screen) and suitable irssi configuration

[07:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Try 'cat /etc/lsb-release' perhaps

[07:20:02.0000] <Lachy>
# screen

[07:20:03.0000] <Lachy>
Cannot access '/dev/pts/1': No such file or directory

[07:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
# cat /etc/lsb-release

[07:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
cat: /etc/lsb-release: No such file or directory

[07:21:02.0000] <beowulf>
Lachy: if you are on dreamhost it's debian and there's a pre built irssi on the web somewhere

[07:21:03.0000] <Philip`>
Do you have root access to the server, or is it a silly share hosting thing?

[07:21:04.0000] <Lachy>
beowulf, no, this is asmallorange.com

[07:21:05.0000] <Philip`>
*shared

[07:21:06.0000] <Lachy>
it's a shared hosting thing

[07:21:07.0000] <Lachy>
so i might be out of luck

[07:21:08.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, package managers won't work then

[07:21:09.0000] <Philip`>
and you'd have to install stuff manually

[07:21:10.0000] <Philip`>
Does 'gcc' exist on there?

[07:22:00.0000] <krijnh>
Why can't mIRC just log to a remote server :/

[07:22:01.0000] <krijnh>
That would solve a lot

[07:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
krijnh: I guess it can, if you set it to use a network drive

[07:23:00.0000] <krijnh>
True

[07:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which could be attached to Samba on a real OS)

[07:23:02.0000] <krijnh>
:)

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
If someone has scripts to display IRC logs, I could probably run them on my server

[07:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
gcc is there

[07:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, so it's not totally hopeless

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
If irssi isn't already installed you could probably just do ./configure && make to set it up without much pain

[07:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
You can install stuff like that on Dreamhost. At least I managed to build python

[07:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
You might be a bit stuck if screen doesn't work because it can't access the /dev stuff, though

[07:28:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dreamhost TOC forbid IRC clients/bots

[07:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's why I'm not trying this on dreamhsot

[07:28:02.0000] <beowulf>
they are frowned upon, not forbidden, afaik

[07:28:03.0000] <Lachy>
but anyway, I wonder what it would cost to get a non-shared server for running all of my stuff on

[07:28:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
beowulf: When I looked it up, it was forbidden. This was, however, around a year ago, though

[07:28:05.0000] <beowulf>
the irssi process gets killed every now and then

[07:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://wiki.dreamhost.com/KB_/_Unix_/_Cron_Jobs_and_Persistent_Processes#What_is_your_persistent_.28background.29_process_policy.3F

[07:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me could in principle run it but isn't actually going to

[07:29:02.0000] <Lachy>
"IRC-related persistent processes of any kind (including, but not limited to, bots, bouncers, etc.) are STRICTLY PROHIBITED, and are in violation of our TOS. "

[07:29:03.0000] <hsivonen>
not such a Dream after all :-(

[07:30:00.0000] <beowulf>
http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Irssi

[07:31:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: non-shared meaning dedicated? Or do you just mean VPS?

[07:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, not sure. Whatever will let me run anything I like without restriction

[07:31:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: http://www.cheapvps.co.uk/plans has unmanaged VPS from £5.00/month and is apparently good

[07:33:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
http://www.intovps.com/ is apparently good too

[07:33:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
http://slicehost.com is meant to be very good, but twice as much (i.e., $20/month)

[07:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the deal with http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/namespaces-algorithms.html#lookupNamespaceURIAlgo not special casing "xml"?

[07:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
$120/year isn't too bad. Not sure if it's worth it though, as I would currently only need it for running an IRC logger, which isn't essential

[07:35:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I'll probably be getting an account on the 5GBP/10USD (the 5GBP being cheaper…) VPS in Sept.

[07:36:00.0000] <krijnh>
There's not really a problem with how it's currently done, right?

[07:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
krijnh, just the stability problem

[07:36:02.0000] <krijnh>
(Apart from my sarcasm wrt smoking computers)

[07:36:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
krijnh: Apart from it going down half the time :P

[07:36:04.0000] <Philip`>
I think 128MB RAM isn't really enough if you want to run Apache and MySQL or anything like that

[07:37:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me points out nobody ever visits his blog

[07:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that WebFaction isn't a VPS but does seem to be pretty good

[07:37:02.0000] <krijnh>
A PII 450 mhz with 512MB is :)

[07:37:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Processes take up RAM even with no visitors :-)

[07:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if the lack of 'xml' and 'xmlns' special casing in the above algorithm is an error or by design

[07:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
and then one person loads your site and you get six Apache processes starting up

[07:38:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: I don't need many workers waiting, though :)

[07:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
if there's lots of stuff downloading in parallel

[07:38:04.0000] <hsivonen>
in other news, I'm in the Namespace drudgery land again

[07:38:05.0000] <hsivonen>
RDF Tax FTW!

[07:38:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
w00t! namespaces!

[07:39:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me still doesn't get how the tax is specific to RDF and not all XML with Namespaces

[07:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: ~10MB times not many is still a lot if you've only got 128MB in total (including for all the rest of the OS) :-p

[07:39:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, care to elaborate?

[07:39:03.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: XML has Namespace because of RDF

[07:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
really?

[07:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: lookupNamespaceURI in Gecko trunk doesn't have interop with WebKit when applied to HTML DOMs

[07:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: yes

[07:41:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: If there's a will there's a way :P

[07:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Demonstrably false

[07:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
so the designers of namespaces had RDF in mind as they were creating it, and not just the idea of creating multiple vocabularies that don't conflict?

[07:41:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: sssh

[07:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me uses http://www.gandi.net/hosting/ which seems about the same price as CheapVPS for 256MB RAM (~£12/month incl VAT)

[07:42:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: And who visits your site? :P

[07:42:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Apart from that on Anne's hosting!)

[07:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: It's had 1.2TB of traffic in the past month :-p

[07:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2007Dec/0116.html

[07:43:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Dude, how much pr0n is that? :P

[07:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: sssh

[07:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Actually it's mostly SVN)

[07:44:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Binary files in SVN!? :\

[07:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[07:45:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Also: SVN!? :\

[07:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
The repository is about 6GB, I think

[07:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
which really wouldn't work with DVCSes

[07:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Why?

[07:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Why what?

[07:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Why wouldn't having a 6Gb repo work with DVCS?

[07:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Because everyone who wants to check it out would have to download the 6GB repository, instead of the ~300MB subtree revision that they're usually interested in

[07:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/SubprojectSupport

[07:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
Sounds like it solves that problem

[07:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Unless I misunderstood the problem

[07:52:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Why have everything in one repo is nobody cares about parts of it normally?

[07:53:00.0000] <annevk42>
hsivonen, RDF has brought us a great many wonderful thing

[07:53:01.0000] <annevk42>
s

[07:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
(I assume the problem is roughly "there is a whole load of artwork which people don't need to check out often and source code that they do")

[07:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
"This implementation has not been completed due to these problems. A newer implementation is in the works ..." - doesn't sound like the problem is actually solved

[07:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh well I heard that Git had soloved these problems. Maybe the new thing is fixed

[07:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and it certainly wasn't solved several years ago when we started using SVN)

[07:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and migration would be a pain, even if it the new system was better)

[07:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It's approximately that problem, although there's some artwork which people do check out (in order to run the game) and lot more which they don't (which is mostly source material for artists, and isn't publicly visible at all because its copyright status is often questionable)

[07:58:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me wonders what game

[07:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also there's lots of versions of precompiled executables in SVN, which is fine in SVN because everyone just downloads the latest revision and it's got everything they need to run the game, and we wouldn't want to use a DVCS where everyone has to download all historic revisions of those files too

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and if we don't include the executables in the VCS then it's more of a pain for anyone who wants to run it)

[07:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: http://os.wildfiregames.com/

[08:00:00.0000] <annevk42>
next suggestion from the encoding front: do your own registry

[08:00:01.0000] <annevk42>
I kind of like that solution to be honest

[08:01:00.0000] <annevk42>
that way we can just specify what is required for "web encodings" lock it down and be done with it

[08:01:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Is it fun?

[08:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Not as a game to actually play, because it's nowhere near finished

[08:17:00.0000] <annevk42>
http://www.rockmelt.com/ -- lots of talk, no walk?

[08:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk42: what is it about?

[08:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't even noticed any talk :-)

[08:18:02.0000] <annevk42>
supposedly some new browser backed by Andreessen

[08:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
which engine?

[08:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
It may or may not have some social networking features like facebook integration

[08:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: wasn't Flock supposed to be that browser?

[08:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me bets on a WebKit backed browser with similar ideas to flock but more usable

[08:20:02.0000] <jgraham>
AFAICT Flock is a usability disaster

[08:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. so if a telecon isn't recorded, WCAG doesn't require it to be accessible, but if it is recorded, WCAG requires the recording to be accessible

[08:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
did I understand WCAG right?

[08:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
WCAG 2 that is

[08:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me assumes that the minutes would count as an accessible version albeit with some information loss

[08:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the entire premise here is that the minutes aren't really equivalent to the audio data

[08:24:00.0000] <annevk42>
hsivonen, could be true, I believe it's also that if you publish a video rather than keep it to yourself it needs to be accessible

[08:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
In any case I am stunned that Laura thinks the situation shouldn't be improved for some people if it can't be improved for anyone

[08:24:02.0000] <annevk42>
hsivonen, see also the Flickr debate

[08:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
s/everyone/anyone/

[08:24:04.0000] <annevk42>
jgraham, she hasn't said that

[08:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk42: Well true. But she did bring it up as a "social/policy question"

[08:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Which kind of implies that she wouldn't see audio+minutes as an improvement over minutes alone

[08:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does Opera implement lookupNamespaceURI per spec?

[08:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I just realized that the spec design badness sicking mentioned in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505178#c10 is yet another reason why the DOM specs make dynamic CURIE-using content suck even more than one would expect

[08:47:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>

aaargh. there's document.createNSResolver

[08:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
grr.

[08:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whew. maybe createNSResolver isn't as crazy as I thought

[08:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
if we have audio recordings, then in theory, someone could take the time revise the minutes to be more accurate than they are when they're done live

[09:00:00.0000] <annevk42>
yup

[09:09:00.0000] <annevk42>
http://mail.apps.ietf.org/ietf/charsets/msg01781.html is interesting

[09:09:01.0000] <annevk42>
maybe we should just standardize the IE mapping

[09:50:00.0000] <annevk42>
hmm, old guard doesn't want recordings :/

[09:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems to me that a big advantage of recordings is that it allows you to check how something was presented in a telecon e.g. you can see if things were (accidentially) misrepresented

[09:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Not to mention that it expands the scope of people to whom explainations are avaliable

[09:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I agree. The current system relies on people reviewing the minutes for themselves to see if what they said was accurately represented

[09:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since rubys seems to be suggesting that he plans to use telecons for more liason work in the future

[09:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: In general the minutes are horrible to read. I often try to follow along on IRC a bit but generally it is impossible to pick up the substance of what anyone is saying

[09:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
I know

[09:55:01.0000] <annevk42>
yeah, DanC says they're not too important since it's only for people who want it while rubys seems to be pushing more people to attend

[12:00:00.0000] <aboodman>
Hixie: want to clarify something about workers and cross-origin requests: As I read the current spec, the behavior is simple: workers can only be created from same-origin resources, importScript() allows cross origin resources.

[12:00:01.0000] <aboodman>
is that correect?

[12:00:02.0000] <aboodman>
(I got confused by some older messages I saw on the list that indicated it was more subtle)

[12:07:00.0000] <dave_levin>
aboodman: Yep.  importscript is support to be like <script> iirc

[12:10:00.0000] <hober>
hmm, html4all.org's dns registration expired

[12:14:00.0000] <dave_levin>

[12:15:00.0000] <aboodman_mac>
dave_levin: can you state whether you think that matches my parsing of it above?

[12:15:01.0000] <aboodman_mac>
all the talk about redirects is freaking me out. but this does basically say that you can only create workers from same-origin resources, right?

[12:15:02.0000] <dave_levin>
aboodman_mac: Yes.

[12:16:00.0000] <aboodman_mac>
Ok. I don't think we have test coverage for this in webkit.

[12:16:01.0000] <aboodman_mac>
i will make a patch.

[12:16:02.0000] <dave_levin>
aboodman_mac: Possibly not.

[12:16:03.0000] <dave_levin>

annevk42: the fact that an accessibility "expert" refuses to discuss accessibility in an accessible medium is ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT

/me wonders if any HTML WG members would actually require transcriptions of audio

[13:11:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
at the risk of agreeing with john foliot, that's really beside the point

[13:11:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
even if we ignore deaf people, there are hearing impaired and hard of hearing people who could have trouble keeping up with a live telephone conversation

[13:12:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
even if we ignore those people, there are people whose shaky command of the english language would preclude them from keeping up with a live telephone conversation

[13:12:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
even if we ignore those people, there are people who would be asleep during the live telephone conversation, regardless of when it was held

[13:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought the issue was audio recordings, which aren't live

[13:13:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
even if we ignore those people, there are people who were sick yesterday (cough me cough) and were in no condition to attend a live telephone conversation

[13:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Transcriptions would certainly be more useful regardless of accessibility, because you can skim-read and copy-and-paste etc)

[13:14:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
even if we ignore those people, there are people who would like to be able to read, search, copy-and-paste, and generally interact with written text

[13:14:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
jinx

[13:16:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
anyway, it boggles my mind that the w3c charges companies a million dollars a year to participate, insists on weekly teleconferences, puts people in leadership positions who use their position to harass people into attending those teleconferences, then says they don't have the money to transcribe the teleconference

[13:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Surely you aren't claiming the w3c is inaccessible?

[13:17:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
as far as i know, the WHATWG has never held a teleconference

[13:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Sorry, forgot my </sarcasm>

[13:17:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
never insisted that people attend a teleconference

[13:17:03.0000] <annevk42>
it boggles my mind that not publishing recordings is ok, but publishing them but not publishing an additional transcript that was not part of the conversation in the first place would not be acceptable

[13:17:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
yes, i was getting to that part too

[13:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There's no lobby for people who don't attend telcons

[13:18:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
apparently, the w3c has a policy -- and we all know how much work goes into their policies -- that inaccessible mediums are fine as long as you don't share them

[13:19:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
and john foliot takes this opportunity to... blame anne!

[13:19:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
so awesome

[13:20:00.0000] <annevk42>
I asked for clarification just in case I misunderstood

[13:20:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Does anyone know when JF went from against wcag2 to being for it?

[13:20:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
no, you understood perfectly

[13:21:00.0000] <annevk42>
I was afraid of that

[13:21:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
dashiva: as soon as he decided that hixie was against it (which he's not, but that's irrelevant)

[13:21:02.0000] <annevk42>
Dashiva, somewhere between the ALA article and now? :)

[13:22:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
meanwhile, i would STILL like to know what Richard Schwerdtfeger and maciej talked about

[13:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
mpilgrim: Actually, the only reason they were talking was so maciej could proxy for Hixie. It doesn't matter for the rest of us.

[13:25:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
i'm actually interested in the roles and states module (aka ARIA)

[13:26:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i was on richard's team at ibm while he was working on getting it into xhtml2

[13:27:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i've written code -- which as far as i know is still being used -- to allow you to use roles and states in text/html (by abusing the class attribute)

[13:27:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
i even, shocker of shockers, think that much of the roles and states module is a good idea

[13:28:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
hampered only by the albatross of xhtml2

[13:28:01.0000] <annevk42>
I just unsubscribed from your twitter account and blog :p

[13:28:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
which people are finally rectifying

[13:28:03.0000] <annevk42>
/me -> food

[13:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm curious to see how this will end up being retold

[13:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk42: The current telecons aren't in conflit with WCAG because WCAG only applies to the web

[13:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe s/conflict with WCAG/inaccessible/ or somesuch

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
When people talk about .tags on HTMLCollections, is that stuff like document.all.tags("blink") or something else?

[13:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's that

[13:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But it's leaked outside of just document.all

[13:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
At least it's not document.body.all

[13:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
Like fld.children.tags('td')[0].style.borderColor='#FF9966' etc?

[13:52:03.0000] <Dashiva>
My eyes

[13:52:04.0000] <gsnedders>
My kingdom for my eyes?

[13:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, most seem to be children.tags or all.tags

[13:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
(where "most" means "somewhere between most and all (inclusive)")

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Does .all exist on all HTMLElements in IE?

[14:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders why he doesn't get everything to ietf-charsets

[14:09:00.0000] <annevk42>
you mean s/to/on/?

[14:09:01.0000] <annevk42>
and by that do you mean emails or understanding?

[14:10:00.0000] <annevk42>
actually, why do I bother, it's Friday and I'm in France, ttyl

[14:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
emails

[14:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
s/to/sent to/

[14:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ooh, I found one that's not all or children

[14:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
www.cartonservice.fr/public_site/info/contact.php?g_contact=2                                                   var coll = document.dmd_cata.tags("input");

[14:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe there are more, but this regexp is incredibly slow and I don't have any progress indicators

[14:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me does it a faster way

[14:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Madness

[14:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, there's just that one and

[14:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
www.mums.ac.ir/erc/fa/cornea2                           for (var R = 0; R < document.forms[S].elements.tags("SELECT").length; R++) {

[14:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
matching (?<!all|children)\.tags\(

Lastweek is so last week

[14:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or at least earlier this week

[14:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is there anyway to get the html parser to create an element in no namespace?

[14:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: No

[14:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
Why would you want that?

[14:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Because html5lib has code for that case

[14:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: And using a conforming DOM Level 3 Core impl causes the DOM impl to break

[14:51:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Is it possible to create with any namespace that's no html, svg or mathml?

[14:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, only via createElementNS()

[14:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: As it creates element in no namespace using createElement(), and that means localName, prefix, and namespaceURI are None

[14:52:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Oh well html5lib will, eventually, allow you to put html elements in no namespace thater than in the HTML namespace

[14:52:03.0000] <jgraham>
At the moment it ought to put everything into a namespace

[14:52:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(I get around 800 failures due to this bug)

[14:52:05.0000] <gsnedders>
It doesn't.

[14:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, why will it allow you to put html elements in no namespace?

[14:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
DOM is badly broken

[14:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Because for non-browser cases there is really no good reason to pay the namespace tax in the common case

[14:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
fair enough

[14:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Adding "assert namespace is not None" causes 1800 failures!

[14:54:03.0000] <jgraham>
Since there is no interoperability concern and namespaces make many otherwise good apis suck

[14:54:04.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Well clearly something is going wrong

[14:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
I con't really look at it right now though

[14:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
Fell free too make a patch or keep complaining at me untill I do

[14:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is looking at it right now

[14:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
token.get("namespace", self.defaultNamespace) returns None

[14:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, the TreeBuilder is being created with namespaceHTMLElements=False

[14:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Because it defaults to not namespacing them

[15:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
We default to breaking the spec. Sounds great. :\

[15:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
We default to sane behaviour for most python applications

[15:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
But the default cn be changed if you are really bothered

[15:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can one get transcripts for $1.35 a minute by people who reside in North America and have health insurance?

[15:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do it on Mechanical Turk for $0.01 a minute

[15:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
play it back to a google voice account and have google voice voicemail transcription do it

[15:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: does Google have voice transription that works and doesn't require per-speaker training?

[15:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[15:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
awesomeness!

[15:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
(for some definition of "works", anyway)

[15:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
is it available for ed users for dictation?

[15:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
*end users

[15:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think it's available anywhere other than google voice voicemail transcriptions right now

[15:15:05.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I mind more than anything else because False is currently _really_ broken, and I'd rather we defaulted to following the spec

[15:15:06.0000] <hsivonen>
:-(

[15:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Do you mind if I add a warning for the False case currently, warning that it is broken?

[15:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are people _against_ making the working group more transparent???

[15:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
what kind of crazy world do we live in here

[15:16:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Earth

[15:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: One with lawyers

[15:18:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe maciej could make a statement on Apple's behalf (even if it's only that he'll have to talk to the lawyers) to defuse it :)

[15:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
new draft for about: URI scheme will be published soon. http://www.ietf.org/staging/draft-holsten-about-uri-scheme-02.txt

[15:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
I got mailed about it from the submission tool when joseph submitted it, so I hadn't had a chance to review it beforehand

[15:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, he's made a little bit of a mess out of some sections, but hopefully I can get those fixed and have an updated draft soon

[15:22:00.0000] <krijnh>
Is http://twitpic.com/dw92r the new Opera logo?

[15:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
krijnh, no

[15:23:01.0000] <krijnh>
I've never seen it before

[15:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
at least, I hope not. It looks like whoever made that did some weird stuff with all the logos

[15:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if anyone in here knows what the new Opera logo looks like

[15:24:02.0000] <krijnh>
50% in here works for Opera, no? :)

[15:24:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Is there a new Opera logo at all?

[15:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, no comment

[15:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Exactly

[15:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Yes.

[15:25:03.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, don't spoil the surprise

[15:25:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: But it's already been announced!

[15:25:05.0000] <Lachy>
where?

[15:26:00.0000] <krijnh>
On Hicks' site

[15:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[15:26:02.0000] <krijnh>
And in his Sitepoint interview

[15:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It doesn't exist until it's unveiled

[15:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Rumors, which may be lies

[15:27:02.0000] <krijnh>
Damnit :)

[15:27:03.0000] <gsnedders>
krijnh: Just because 50% of people in here are from Opera doesn't mean 100% of people from Opera know :)

[15:27:04.0000] <Lachy>
krijnh, gsnedders, can you post a link? I can't see it anywhere on his site

[15:27:05.0000] <gsnedders>
It was on Twitter, IIRC

[15:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me got asked when he got home from work one day by a friend whether he knew anything about it, and didn't even know about the tweet at the time

[15:28:01.0000] <krijnh>

"The answer is yes, I have."

[15:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
Don't quote mine!  "And if the next question was have those designs been accepted and are they going to be used, the answer is no."

[15:31:00.0000] <krijnh>
Who cares, the answer is yes! :)

[15:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
there have definitely been proposals for a new logo

[15:31:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Everyone and their dog has redesigned the Opera logo, pssh :P

[15:31:03.0000] <krijnh>
:D

[15:31:04.0000] <Lachy>
there's been many, from others even before Hicks joined us

[15:31:05.0000] <Dashiva>
I mean, I interned there three summers in a row, and it was a discussion topic every time

[15:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"It sucks" "I agree" "Let's talk about it while nothing happens"

[15:32:01.0000] <krijnh>
Like now :)

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
the entire thread on the recording of teleconferences is ludicrous

[15:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does WebApps actively maintain DOM Level 3 Core errata?

[15:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
No

[15:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[15:59:00.0000] <scherkus>
silly question, but I've never thought about it before

[15:59:01.0000] <scherkus>
is there anywhere in the spec that says _not_ to apply default styles to an element?

[15:59:02.0000] <scherkus>
someone was wondering if <video> could have border: 1px solid black; applied by default

[16:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It could. The spec says nothing normatively about rendering.

[16:01:00.0000] <scherkus>
I suppose it's one of those "user agents reach consensus" sort of thing

[16:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The informative advice in the spec for video is…

[16:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks

[16:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
video {}

[16:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
So no style :P

[16:03:02.0000] <scherkus>
:P

[16:03:03.0000] <scherkus>
where is that btw?

[16:04:00.0000] <scherkus>
...or are you referring to how nothing is mentioned at all :)

[16:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Nothing is mentioned, so implicitly that is what the rendering section says for it :)

[16:31:00.0000] <Xanthir>
Bwahahaha

[16:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: Do you have a transcript of that?

[16:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
(or a summary)

[16:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me is currently incapable of viewing video

[16:43:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: scroll down

[16:43:01.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: search for "needed to put a software license"

[16:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
jacobolus: Oh, okay, I didn't actually open the link

[16:43:03.0000] <jacobolus>
and read the next few ¶s

[16:44:00.0000] <jacobolus>
I'm the "Audience member" in the transcript; my shouted question is inaudible in the video ;)

[16:48:00.0000] <inimino>

/me blinks at the teleconference recordings discussion

[17:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
trying to prevent information from being shared at all on accessibility grounds is the sort of thing that gives accessibility people a bad reputation

[17:12:00.0000] <hober>
indeed

[17:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm very confused, to be honest

[17:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
we have textual transcripts of the calls. Someone offers to provide audio recordings to make the group even more transparent.

[17:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
This is faced with the following responses:

[17:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
- the w3c doesn't have the resources to do it

[17:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
- it makes people feel uncomfortable

[17:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
- there might be legal implications

[17:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
- it would be unfair to people to have the audio recordings but not have equally good transcripts, and so we shouldn't do it at all

[17:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
this is like the _definition_ of "stop energy".

[17:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, I can understand people being uncomfortable with being recorded, but I think as a public working group, our mandate for maximum public information sharing should take precedence

[17:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
the entire reaction just baffles me

[17:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
a healthy environment would have been one in which people just said "sounds great! go for it!"

[17:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
In the same healthy environment, could someone propose a terrible idea and then people would say "sounds great! go for it!"?

[17:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno, give it a try

[17:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
(btw, the irony of people complaining that a transcript isn't available when we have minutes is not lost on me)

[17:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the scribes should take offense

[00:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. Crockford seems unrepentent for wasting people's time by getting lawyers review an instance of gratuitous license proliferation

[00:20:00.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, I hope Sec-From is renamed to Origin once we sort out how redirects have to work for CORS

[00:21:00.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, that was the idea anyway as I understood things

[00:32:00.0000] <annevk42>
Lachy, many about URLs also take a fragment identifier

[00:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: eh?

[00:56:00.0000] <annevk42>
othermaciej, Crockford uses the MIT license with "Don't use it for evil." appended to it

[00:56:01.0000] <annevk42>
othermaciej, when e.g. IBM lawyers ask for a different license if they want to use his code he gives them "IBM can use it for evil." and everyone is happy...

[00:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk42: wheee

[01:05:00.0000] <annevk42>
Lachy, emailed comments instead

[01:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk42: everyone is not happy. I, for instance, have sought alternatives to Crockford's software to avoid using code under an unusual license with a FOU restriction that lacks clear definitions

[01:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the current poll has now officially received more total votes than any previous HTML WG poll

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk42: moreover, if you have been permitted to use code under a set of licenses (e.g. OSI-approved licenses) and someone has a different license, it sucks to have to go through some kind of approval procedure even if you believe Crockford's addition not to carry any legal weight

[01:22:01.0000] <jacobolus>
seriously?

[01:22:02.0000] <jacobolus>
eep

[01:23:00.0000] <jacobolus>
hsivonen: if you write to him, you could probably get a special license, like IBM :)

[01:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jacobolus: yes. custom licenses are not funny

[01:23:02.0000] <jacobolus>
I think it's pretty funny; but then, I don't have to worry about it

[01:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jacobolus: not good enough unless the custom license is the MIT license verbatim

[01:24:00.0000] <jacobolus>
I think it's likely he'd do it if you made the case

[01:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jacobolus: unlikely, when I decided not to waste my time trying, I already knew he hadn't fixed the license after having given a one-off license to IBM and having been criticized by an IBM employee for it

[02:55:00.0000] <vvv>
What is "An absolute IRI "? A typo?

[03:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
vvv: It's probably easiest to think of IRI as a complicated way of saying URL :-)

[04:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
could someone explain to me why the minutes aren't an acceptable transcript of the meetings anymore?

[04:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm somewhat shocked to discover that the information i've been relying on for the past god knows how many years has suddenly stopped being adequate

[04:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Because it's generally impossible to work out what was said during the meeting based on the minutes

[04:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
but this only becomes a problem if we also provide an audio transcript?

[04:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
See mark's talk from earlier 

[04:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090814#l-510

[04:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, it's because providing the audio for those who can hear it is perceived as providing more information to such people, than is available to the deaf. Whereas with the minutes only, everyone is at an equal disadvantage

[04:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
why is it acceptable that people can actually call in then?

[04:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
surely currently people who can't call in are at a disadvantage too

[04:48:02.0000] <Dashiva>
But calls aren't on the web, so it's okay

[04:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, they are, but accessibility guidelines aren't so extreme as to restrict the use of technology that is inherently inaccessible.

[04:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Also: http://twitter.com/diveintomark/status/3310162153

[04:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
this is some sort of special mode of thinking that i can't wrap my head around

[04:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
although, there are relay services that deaf people can use to make phone calls, and could in theory use that for the telcon

[04:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are other reasons to not be able to attend the calls

[04:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
like not having a phone, or being asleep

[04:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
(both of which affect me)

[04:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's why we still do the important stuff asynchronously

[04:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
I personally find the telcons to be of questionable value, and usually choose not to attend. But there are some people who do find them valuable for whatever reason, and there's no reason to restrict them from doing that

[04:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure, just like there's no reason to restrict publication of audio recordings without transcripts

[04:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
but apparently that's not allowed these days

[04:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
someone should go tell the podcast industry, btw, that they're all displaying quite unacceptable behaviour

[04:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me calls "not it"

[04:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
some podcasters do publish transcripts

[04:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if radio suddenly becomes unacceptable if they start broadcasting on the web, too

[04:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it's like "You're not having any dessert until you've eaten your greens" where some authority is enforcing rules so that your incentives are aligned with wider benefits than the benefits you care about yourself

[04:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
wcag has guidelines about live broadcasts over the internet

[04:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
(where dessert is audio recordings, greens is transcripts, and your mother is the W3C)

[05:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I presume this is related to what Wikipedia says is the principal-agent problem)

[05:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think anyone in their sane mind would consider comparing listening to audio recordings of htmlwg telecons to my mother's deserts.

[05:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
but maybe my mother's deserts are just unusally good.

[05:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
the problem I see with the arugments about it on public-html is that the accessibility advocates are simply taking the moral high ground, rather than explaning what the actual value of a full text transcript will be in this case and evaluating the cost/benefit ratio

[05:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
and they're ignoring the issue that arguments from morality don't carry that much weight with pragmatists

[05:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
i am shocked that they would proffer such unnuanced arguments.

[05:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought the point of accessibility was that it fails when you evaluate the cost/benefit ratio - if it didn't, everyone would make things accessible because it's good business sense, but they don't, and legislation is often needed to skew the ratio

[05:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Cost/benefit ratios aren't sufficient because they ignore unmeasurable benefits like respecting human rights)

[05:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
often, the problem is just that people fail to perceive the benefits of making things more accessible

[05:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/sufficient/a sufficient measure/

[05:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem i have with the arguments is that we already have transcripts, and if the transcripts aren't good enough, then that should have been a problem already, and doesn't suddenly become a problem when someone volunteers to provide an additional format.

[05:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
that and the fact that it's one hell of a horrible way to run a community if you tell someone who volunteers to do something "sorry but that's not good enough"

[05:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
when someone volunteers to do something, the right response is "thank you" and "how can i help you"

[05:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me volunteers to rob a bank

[05:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me waits for someone to ask how they can help

[05:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i was assuming i was talking about people volunteering to do things that actually benefit, or at least affect, the community :-P

[05:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'll donate half the money to the members of the WHATWG and HTML WG

[05:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
sweet!

[05:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
how can i help?

[05:17:03.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: my mother always preferred the mountains to the desert

[05:18:00.0000] <jacobolus>
maybe transcripts are like an oasis?

[05:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
aw man, i hate that word. I always forget there's two "s"s because I pronounce it "dizurts"

[05:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I'd like a face mould so I can disguise myself as you with a latex mask

[05:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
(You shouldn't get in trouble because you'll have a great alibi, being in a different continent)

[05:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
wouldn't that be illegal for me to do

[05:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
Why would it?

[05:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
aiding and abetting, conspiracy to commit, you name it

[05:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
I can tell you it's for a fancy dress party, and you won't know any better

[05:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
luckily for me, i'm not so good with the masks

[05:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
now if you want some normative text...

[05:21:04.0000] <jacobolus>
wow, Hixie would be in great company if they start making latex masks of him. Nixon, Salinas, ...

[05:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me was thinking more of Tom Cruise

[05:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i could send some people wearing masks of me to commitee meetings at TPAC

[05:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
that would save me a lot of time

[05:23:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Philip`: you should just wear one of these http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Richard_Nixon_mask.jpg

[05:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon_mask - "A Richard Nixon mask is a mask with the features of Richard Nixon." - wow

[05:24:01.0000] <jacobolus>
no one ever said wikipedia wasn't pedantic

[05:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, leaving pubdate in is silly because it's a bad solution to the problem, regardless of whether or not there's another existing way to solve the problem

[05:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not _that_ bad a solution

[05:32:02.0000] <Lachy>
we shoud remove pubdate and then focus on finding a better solution, rather than doing it the other way

[05:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
it has all the problems of duplicated, hidden metadata

[05:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
how is that good in any way?

[05:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
the perfect is the enemy of the merely good enough. Or in this case, the good is the enemy of the barely ok, but still.

[05:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
duplicated hidden metadata is to be discouraged where possible, but dates in general are always hidden data

[05:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
even <time> hides the time

[05:33:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's not a black-and-white world

[05:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
and other assorted aphorisms

[05:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sees grey, too

[05:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
(sorry, it's late and i've been watching too much west wing.)

[05:34:03.0000] <Lachy>
no, time annotates visible data with an unambiguous version

[05:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's duplication of information with a hidden copy

[05:34:05.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, I must go. i will respond to your e-mail later with improved arguments

[05:34:06.0000] <Hixie>
k :-)

[05:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what he was going to buy today… something he needed to buy, but keeps forgetting…

[05:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
Paperclips?

[05:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No.

[05:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Salt?

[05:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, but maybe it was pepper…

[05:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I'm all out of ideas

[05:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to work out quite what he's doing this year

[05:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: Wouldn't <time rel=something> unambiguously link it to the article?

[05:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
<time> doesn't have a rel=""

[05:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
(rel="" is for links)

[05:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I know, but inventing an attribute that does the same (even or rel)

[05:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i thought the problem was that we were using an attribute

[05:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's part of it, another part is that it often duplicates the date

[05:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
adding an attribute that basically duplicates class="" but with special keywords seems a bit heavy-handed for this small use case

[05:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it might be the only solution that makes sense

[05:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, i really must sleep

[05:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:52:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, that's like pubdate duplicates time, isn't it?

[06:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm surprised Sam says this working group [htmlwg] has a lot of communication problems, considering other WGs like PF are unable to communicate at all outside telcons

[06:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
How far does the scale go?

[06:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe you are mistaking quantity of communication for quality

[06:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Communication that doesn't happen is the worst quality of all

[06:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Worse than e.g. offensive communication that causes people to stay away and avoid communicating again in the future?

[06:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes, better to try and fail than never to try at all.

[06:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Besides, we know from experience that these people tell other people about staying away, so we'll find out about it.

/me tries to find Big Buck Bunny as VLC-compatible 1080p Dirac but fails

[11:16:00.0000] <annevk42>
http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/index.php/download/ ?

[11:16:01.0000] <annevk42>
oh, Dirac

[11:16:02.0000] <annevk42>
sorry

[11:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm intrested in comparing 1080p CPU loads between Dirac, Theora and H.264

[11:20:00.0000] <annevk42>
is Dirac still interesting once Google does the non-evil thing?

[11:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know

[11:24:00.0000] <annevk42>
I still have a hard time seeing how not publishing data can be considered a good thing

[11:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I have a hard time understanding the absurdity of painting the HTML WG as an accessibility offender for suggesting publishing recordings of telecons when the telecon mode of communication is inaccessible before you hit the record button, and the HTML WG charter deliberately tries to downplay telecon and telecons are part of the traditional W3C/WAI communication culture

[11:30:00.0000] <annevk42>
it is indeed total crap

[11:53:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: url?

[11:54:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk42: with regard to Google and on2?

[11:54:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm more worried about the shareholder lawsuit

[11:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0764.html

[11:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: is a shareholder lawsuit in a case like this something that may actually derail things or business as usual in the U.S.?

[11:58:00.0000] <TJAtkins>
They could always just trade the shareholders for GOOG shares.  ^_^

[11:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
TJAtkins: isn't the suit simply about some shareholder wanting more GOOG shares?

[11:59:01.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: unknown

[11:59:02.0000] <virtuelv>
I would assume it's for the purpose of raising the final price

[12:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: hence, more GOOG shares, since it's a stock swap

[12:00:01.0000] <virtuelv>
yeah

[12:00:02.0000] <TJAtkins>
Oh, buh, I'm dumb.  Sorry, wasn't aware that there was an actual lawsuit going on *right now*.

[12:01:00.0000] <TJAtkins>
My impressions is that that sort of thing is business-as-usual here in the US, but it could always blow up.

[12:02:00.0000] <annevk42>
TJAtkins is Tab Atkins?

[12:02:01.0000] <TJAtkins>
yeah

[12:02:02.0000] <annevk42>
welcome

[12:02:03.0000] <annevk42>
(unless I missed something I haven't seen you here before)

[12:02:04.0000] <TJAtkins>
Yo.  ^_^  I've been sitting around with a different name for a while, but figured it was more productive to use the name I'm known by.

[12:02:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Might as well take it all the way

[12:03:00.0000] <annevk42>
heh

[12:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've been trying to watch the chat more often lately, get a little more involved in WHATWG stuff.

[12:18:00.0000] <annevk42>
From that document Adam pointed out about cookie history (see http-state archives): ".3.1 Fixing the Incompatibility. Because the two extant major browsers dis-agreed on how to treat unfamiliar attributes, we were inexorably led to introduce one or more new headers to resolve the problem."

[12:18:01.0000] <annevk42>
I'm glad we're no longer doing that now and whenever someone proposes it we oppose it

[12:18:02.0000] <annevk42>
I hope one day someone writes a paper on writing "modern" standards...

[12:20:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I've read that transcript bit

[12:20:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I find the whole argument to be utterly bizarre

[12:21:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the choice is between making no data available, and making data available so that third-parties, if they so choose, can transcribe, and have 100% accuracy on what is being said

[12:21:01.0000] <virtuelv>
and some would prefer to see zero-data available

[12:22:00.0000] <virtuelv>
please tell me I misread these people

[12:25:00.0000] <annevk42>
sorry

[12:26:00.0000] <annevk42>
another interesting quote from that document: "RFC 2965, HTTP State Management Mechanism, took 5 1/2 years to become a Proposed Standard, and yet the major vendors largely ignore it"

[12:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
interestingly, this guy doesn't focus on HTML5 and MPEG-LA issues: http://seekingalpha.com/article/154160-google-on2-deal-debunking-myths-questioning-vp8-s-quality

what's a "four-screen strategy? desktop, phone, TV, ???

[12:48:00.0000] <inimino>
TV, desktop, laptop, phone

[12:48:01.0000] <inimino>
it's some marketing BS from some mobile phone company or other

[12:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmmkay. What's the point of counting desktop and laptop as distinct?

[12:50:00.0000] <inimino>
mobility, leading up to the main point of our glorious cell-phone-enhanced future

[12:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. thanks

Settlers' II is damned addictive.

[13:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Isn't that like 15 years old?

[13:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me remembers playing it like 15 years ago

[13:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hell, I'm still sort of addicted to Civ 2.

[13:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yes

[13:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Likewise.

[13:07:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me got both of them back in '97 or so

[13:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Civ2 is probably my number one reason for booting Windows)

[13:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(And it saddens me it is 16-bit and doesn't run natively on 64-bit Windows)

[13:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, just virtualize it.

[13:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You can run that thing on W95

[13:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Win 3.1, too, IIRC

[13:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
S2 runs in DOSBox fine :P

[13:10:00.0000] <inimino>
hsivonen: I just remembered, it's actually cinema, TV, PC, phone

[13:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Find a copy of Master of Magic.  DOSBoxes wonderfully, and it's a *great* game.

[13:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if he really needs more timewasters

[13:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
You do.

[13:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
inimino: oh, I see. what codecs do digital cinema systems use?

[13:13:00.0000] <inimino>
the over-the-top Nokia marketing video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-2qQS3NY0

[13:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes http://www.gog.com/ since their installer automatically includes stuff like DOSBox to make things work

[13:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: My diary's already, uh, three months and a half months behind

[13:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Simple solution: cut it loose!

[13:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
inimino: i can see what nokia's marketing speak means, but codec strategy-wise, the cinema case seems different from the cases where the decoder is shipped to the viewer rather than to a theater

[13:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Agreed - I'm not sure how the two necessarily have to be related.

[13:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe my strategy mindset isn't broad enough

[13:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me contemplates what to do

[13:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
btw, why do people seem to assume that purchasing transcripts is an issue?

[13:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if the W3C has a policy requiring transripts, surely it would be sensible for the W3C to already have a mechanism for sending audio to a service provider and getting text back

[13:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does the policy exist withou such a mechanism in place? what's the issue here?

[14:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>

gsnedders: isn't settlers II too easy?

[14:23:01.0000] <jacobolus>
TabAtkins: and likewise Civ II?

[14:23:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Too easy?  You're not playing it on a high enough difficulty.

[14:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: No

[14:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Depends on the dificulty

[14:24:01.0000] <jacobolus>
I suppose at Deity level, it's a bit slow to finish a game

[14:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
s/Tabtkins/jacobolus/

[14:24:03.0000] <jacobolus>
TabAtkins: the one city challenge is pretty tough, I guess

[14:24:04.0000] <jacobolus>
I never managed to do that one

[14:24:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've never been able to win a one-city challenge in Civ4 FfH...

[14:24:06.0000] <jacobolus>
but I didn't ever put too much time in on it

[14:25:00.0000] <jacobolus>
ffh?

[14:25:01.0000] <jacobolus>
Civ II was certainly harder than Civ III, to be sure

[14:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Civ2 IMO is the best of the Civ games

[14:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Fall From Heaven - the absolute best mod for civ4.

[14:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: I'd agree for the vanilla game.

[14:27:00.0000] <jacobolus>
gsnedders: I was always a bit partial to SMAC

[14:27:01.0000] <jacobolus>
it's been quite a while though

[14:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
A mid-dev version of FfH is actually included in the Civ 4 release.  The full version is better, though.

[14:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh man, SMAC.  I always forget to include that in the list of Civ games, because to me it was just "Alpha Centauri".

[14:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So good...

[14:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I just love SMAC's government system.

[14:31:00.0000] <kristallpirat>
Civ II very good, AC very good, Civ IV with Beyond the sword mod very good

[14:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me should play Civ IV more probably

[14:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me ought to get The Settlers II 10th Anniversary Edition too

[14:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Basically Settlers II with 3D graphics)

[14:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If I ever sat down to make a game, I'd reproduce Master of Magic with more modern graphics.  And less bugs.

[14:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me remembers when he had an invisible decaying lizardman/airship that couldn't transport cargo and was immune to damage.

[14:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It had some... issues... with buffer overflows overwriting game data.

[14:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh well, back to S2 for me.

[14:37:01.0000] <jacobolus>
gsnedders: anyway, how do you make settlers II hard?

[14:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: By being shit at it :)

[14:38:01.0000] <jacobolus>
haha

[14:38:02.0000] <jacobolus>
my advice: just expand using as many of the cheapest mil. buildings as you can, and lots of wood choppers

[14:38:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Huh?

[14:39:00.0000] <jacobolus>
huh what?

[14:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks jacobolus is thinking of some other game

[14:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
You don't buy mil. buildings

[14:39:03.0000] <jacobolus>
gsnedders: we're talking about the one with the little roads and people walking back and forth along them?

[14:39:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Or am I missing what you mean?

[14:39:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Just loads of barracks?

[14:39:06.0000] <jacobolus>
there are like 4 types of buildings

[14:39:07.0000] <jacobolus>
military buildings

[14:40:00.0000] <jacobolus>
you expand fastest if you buy only the cheapest ones

[14:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, right

[14:40:02.0000] <jacobolus>
and then destroy half of them afterward

[14:40:03.0000] <jacobolus>
if you're especially ambitious you can go replace them with very spaced out castles much later on

[14:40:04.0000] <jacobolus>
but that's not really necessary

[14:40:05.0000] <jacobolus>
then once you get close to enemies you build guardhouse thingums

[14:41:00.0000] <jacobolus>
er, watchtowers?

[14:43:00.0000] <jacobolus>
gsnedders: I imagine that playing settlers ii against humans is harder, but I never tried it

[15:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/rad/2009/08/html5.html

[15:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Any browser dev have any clue if/when XBL2 will ever be supported in your browser?

[15:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wondering about it's use in styling new input types, and if I should instead go ahead and get some work going on the CSS list for them.

[15:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: The difficulty is establishing yourself on another continent

[15:29:00.0000] <jacobolus>
gsnedders: any particular map that's tricky?

[15:29:01.0000] <jacobolus>
I only ever spent about two weeks playing settlers ii, and it was very long ago

[15:29:02.0000] <jacobolus>
but I have some hazy recollection of some of them

[15:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: Just any that involves establishing yourself on another land mass

[15:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Primarily avoiding your first mil. building being overrun almost straight away

[15:32:00.0000] <jacobolus>
oh, hmm. I think you might just have to go somewhere there's no enemy right next door

[15:32:01.0000] <jacobolus>
gsnedders: what if you build a big mil. building, so that a bunch of troops get shipped there?

[15:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: There are maps where that isn't an option :)

[15:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: I guess my issues then are normally not enough gold :)

[15:34:00.0000] <jacobolus>
gsnedders: the trick to that is to train as many of your troops as possible in big military buildings

[15:34:01.0000] <jacobolus>
it's much cheaper

[15:34:02.0000] <jacobolus>
the tiny ones are useless for training, and should have gold shipments turned off

[16:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
great, now i've been dragged into this nonsense debate

[16:21:00.0000] <aboodman_mac>
Does anyone know with access control what is supposed to happen if you request a cross-origin resource which redirects to a same origin resource, and there is  no access control involved?

[16:21:01.0000] <aboodman_mac>
It looks to me like it should succeed.

[16:22:00.0000] <aboodman_mac>
I mean via XMLHttpRequest

[16:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sounds like it should work.  The final resource being delivered is same-origin, and so as long as that information is passed along properly it should be ok.

[16:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Neat, JF answered my question. A bit strange to get the answer to an IRC question on email, but it works. :)

[16:56:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hello all!

[16:57:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm a little confused about the proper usage of the "section" and "article" elements.  Should either be used as a child of the other, or does it not matter?  I see this @ http://www.alistapart.com/d/previewofhtml5/structure-div.gif and then this @ http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/html5/html5_structure.png

[16:58:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I meant to reference http://www.alistapart.com/d/previewofhtml5/structure-html5.gif from ala.


2009-08-16
[17:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Either can be used as a child of the other, as appropriate.  In many instances, though, <section> will be a child of <article>.

[17:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because in many cases <article> will be used to denote the main content of a page.

[17:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But you can, frex, have something like <article #pagecontent><section .pagesection><article .blogpost><section .sectionofblogpost>...

[17:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Taking from w3.org (if that's allowed here), they write "The section element is not a generic   container element. When an element is needed for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead."  This is important for me to understand, because I may be upgrading the html of portlets within a portal, so I'm wondering if the portlet as an application should use div'

[17:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Smashing's use is perfectly appropriate, though, if they're only getting down to the actual *article* after having some extra data before/after it.

[17:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Probably should.

[17:11:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Right now I have <div class="portlet"><div class="portlet-topper"><div class="portlet-title">Blog Application</div><div class="portlet-content"><!-- blog application --!></div></div>

[17:12:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: I think looking at the editor's draft portlet should probably use section  not div.

[17:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rule is: if something should appear in an outline of the page, use <section>/<article>.  If it shouldn't, use <div>

[17:12:02.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: "The section element represents a generic document or application section. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading, possibly with a footer. Examples of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis. A Web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, contact information."

[17:12:03.0000] <webben_>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/semantics.html#the-section-element

[17:12:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'll note that your use of a <div> for the *title* is worrying already.

[17:13:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: So a portal site is split into sections, some of those sections are applications.

[17:13:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Sure, that's how it's been, because portlet's can optionally remove their topper, title,

[17:14:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
For instance, the web content display portlet is often configured to skip right into the portlet's content, which is why I was wondering if the html should remain div based, because it has more to do with the structure of the page, but I can also see how it's thematically grouping content.

[17:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just use the "outline" rule.  You don't have to quibble about semantics then.  If you collapse the whole page into an outline, and your bit should show up, use the <section>.

[17:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, it's probably the case that the outermost div should be a <section>.  The others are probably good as <div>s.

[17:16:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: I guess I'd suggest <section class="portlet"><header><h1>Blog Application</h1></header><!-- content --></section>

[17:16:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Would you then say that <div class="portlet-topper"> could be <header> and <div class="portlet-title"> could be <h1>.  From what I've read, sections are recommended to begin new header deliniating.

[17:17:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Sure, I need to wrap that content so there you would recommend using a DIV?  I really appreciate your input on all of this, by the way, all of you.

[17:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I agree with webben_

[17:18:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: Assuming you need it to be the same for all portlets, can't think of anything else than div off-hand.

[17:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And yeah, probably just wrap the content with a div.  Again, just mentally apply the outline rule.

[17:19:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
All right, let me make a pastie of what I've gathered so far from what you've said.

[17:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But if you can determine that some portlets *are* important enough to do so, consider an <article> or <section> to wrap it instead.

[17:23:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://pastie.org/585342

[17:23:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The first one labeled "HTML4" is actually what we've been using for some time, I never liked the spans being there alongside the divs.

[17:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, except you can probably drop most of the classes.

[17:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Keep the .portlet class, but the others can be targetted just fine with child selectors.  ^_^

[17:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
".portlet > header", ".portlet > header > h1", etc.

[17:26:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: I suspect that may be a menu not a nav: http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-nav-element vs. http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#menus ?

[17:26:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, we walk the fine corporate line of trying to move towards html5 but keep ie6 compatibility.

[17:26:02.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: depending on what the contents are.

[17:26:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Right now, most of that can be achieved through CSS, and JS using document.createElement function.

[17:26:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Child selectors aren't available in ie6, unfortunately.

[17:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bah, right.  I am lucky enough to have been allowed to basically throw IE6 over the bridge at my job.

[17:27:01.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: How are you selling migration to 5 to the biz?

[17:27:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
webben_ by the grace of God.

[17:27:03.0000] <webben_>
heh

[17:27:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I have no idea how, but they like it.

[17:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It looks fancy!

[17:28:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
They're letting me style our new website using CSS3 almost exclusively, as long as the unCSS3'd ie browsers look good and consistant.  

[17:28:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
They don't mind letting the new browsers take on the added improvements.

[17:28:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Woo, lucky you.

[17:29:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: e.g. rounded corners with CSS3 and square corners for the old?

[17:29:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Exactly.

[17:29:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm happy I got them to accept the rounded corners issue.  That's about it.

[17:29:03.0000] <webben_>
yeah, rounded corners is about as far as we've got where I work.

[17:29:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, ie6+ supports gradients, so IE actually gets the gradients too.

[17:29:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Firefox is the tricky one, I have to calculate the colors for the gradients by using the inset shadow property.

[17:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm?  How are you getting gradienets in ie6?

[17:30:01.0000] <webben_>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms532997(VS.85).aspx ?

[17:30:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We have browser selectors out of the box and ie supports gradients using the filter property.

[17:30:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, k.  I stay away from the filter properties.

[17:31:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Me too, but the end effect let's me get away with a lot without introducing images to the design where they weren't necessary.

[17:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So far I've dealt with it by using a gradient-generating image script in PHP.

[17:32:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The really, really great thing about this is, if I can convince them to move forward with some of the html5 adoptions in our portal, then our clients will take those html5 adoptions with them too.

[17:34:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Which is why using proper standards is so absolutely important to me.

[17:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Cool.  ^_^

[17:35:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: "inset shadow property": like this? http://markusstange.wordpress.com/ ?

[17:36:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It seems pretty straightforward, so http://pastie.org/585351

[17:37:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I think I'm in good graces because I wrote this ( http://tiny.cc/JTlyy and http://tiny.cc/KyH4B ) a day after someone asked if we could support mobile

[17:37:01.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: class="portlet seamless" would make more sense to me. ... it's still a portlet, even if it's borderless

[17:38:00.0000] <webben_>
or class="portlet portlet-seamless" if .portlet.seamless is going to cause a world of ie6-inflected pain.

[17:38:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
ie6 has limited support of css chaining but I'm aware of how most of it needs to work.

[17:38:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
yea, adding the portlet class to them both makes sense, webben_

[17:39:00.0000] <webben_>
if it is seamless, tho, why do you need a div inside the seamless section?

[17:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ooh, shiny: http://tests.themasta.com/blogstuff/boxshadowselect.html

[17:39:02.0000] <webben_>
TabAtkins: Is that shiny for Fx?

[17:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[17:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's all -moz-box-shadow

[17:40:02.0000] <webben_>
very nice

[17:40:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Our shiny is shiny in ie6+, firefox, and safari

[17:40:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
which includes any other trident / gecko / webkit browsers, obviously.

[17:40:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, just put -webkit-box-shadow, and some IE filters on it.

[17:40:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Definitely reproducible.

[17:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Note: I didn't make that.  It's from the blog that webben_ linked to.

[17:41:01.0000] <webben_>
I guess one could use SVG data URIs for extra-http-request-less gradients in opera

[17:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, that's *two* technologies I don't know how to use.

[17:43:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We used -moz-box-shadow as the secondary solution to -webkit-gradient and Microsoft.Gradient

[17:43:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
For example @ http://pastie.org/585353

[17:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, cool, php can help write data uris for me.

[17:47:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So now I have http://pastie.org/585355

[17:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I approve.

[17:48:00.0000] <webben_>
Tick! ;)

[17:49:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: altho note my note about menu

[17:49:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Okay, the next big beast to tackle of the portal's page container.

[17:50:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I thought menu was gone in HTML5.

[17:50:01.0000] <webben_>
still here afaik

[17:50:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, when would it be proper to use nav versus menu and vice versa?

[17:51:00.0000] <webben_>
nav = site links ; menu = commands

[17:52:00.0000] <webben_>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/semantics.html#the-nav-element vs http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/interactive-elements.html#menus

[17:52:01.0000] <webben_>
"control panel" sounds to me like commands/toolbar

[17:52:02.0000] <webben_>
so menu

[17:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, I didn't realize that <menu> was meant to be used for in-page markup.  Cool.

[17:53:01.0000] <webben_>
other lists of links ... ul or ol I guess.

[17:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
btw: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/#menus for the multipage version

[17:54:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I see what you mean.

[17:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I need to really read and digest that section soon.

[17:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
For now: grocery store, to prepare for tomorrow's grilling party.

[17:56:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Why seamless versus borderless-container

[17:56:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
because of the meaning?

[17:58:00.0000] <webben_>
i guess various reasons

[17:58:01.0000] <webben_>
shorter, more abstract

[17:59:00.0000] <webben_>
"container" seems redundant

[17:59:01.0000] <webben_>
it's a section so... it's going to be a container

[18:00:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: also http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/embedded-content-0.html#attr-iframe-seamless

[18:04:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I see.

[18:05:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Great, I'm writing all of this up.

[18:05:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Thanks webben_

[18:06:00.0000] <webben_>
JonathanNeal: yw :)

[18:09:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
All right, here's the tougher one.

[18:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Any number of portlets can exist in here @ http://pastie.org/585373

[18:12:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm curious if a section would replace wrapper, a header would replace banner, an h2 would replace current-community and be moved outside of the h1, both the h1 and the h2 would be wrapped with an hgroup, and a footer would replace footer.

/me is too sleepy to think, but I'm sure one of the other #whatwg will answer eventually (if not just mail the help@ mailing list: http://www.whatwg.org/mailing-list#help )

[18:20:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Should a <nav> ever go inside a <nav> for child pages?

[18:39:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm getting all crazy with this one.

[18:39:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
You guys will have to tell me what you think.  It's perhaps incorrect.

[18:41:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Here's my latest working copy @ http://pastie.org/585387

[19:19:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Anyone around?

[19:26:00.0000] <jcranmer>
no

[19:29:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I figured as much :-)

[22:34:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hi all

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk42>
aboodman2, aboodman_mac_, answered your question

[02:37:01.0000] <aboodman_mac>
annevk42: thanks for replying

[02:37:02.0000] <aboodman_mac>
looking now

[02:41:00.0000] <aboodman_mac>
annevk42: ok, thanks. I am working on this area of webkit now, and want to be sure I don't break anything.

/me wonders how much cardboard he needs to stick underneath his laptop's system board to bend it enough that it will successfully boot

[02:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. http://www.fsf.org/resources/formats/playogg tells people to install VLC which expands the installed base of encumbered codecs, too

[02:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
they could tell people to install Firefox, which wouldn't expand the installed base for encumbered-format players

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk42>
note to self: make a simple python script instead to generate encoding tests rather than cp 001.htm 00x.htm all the time

Hmm, ten thicknesses of card under the PCMCIA slot seems to be sufficient

[05:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You probably even enjoy making it work

[05:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
I only had to take out 30 screws to reach it

[05:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I put 29 screws back in, which I consider a success

[05:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, i've got less than 3 days backlog on my main folder of input

[05:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you run out, you might have to start answering questions when asked.

[05:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
lots of XXX markers to worry about still

[05:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
and bugs

[05:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i don't like replying in realtime, i much prefer letting threads settle, since that way i can just look over the whole thread and use the best ideas.)

[05:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
anywya it's way past my bed time

[05:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[08:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. the StuffIt Expander download has become like downloading Real Player

[08:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and worse

[08:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
very tacky

[08:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me archives a old PPC 2005 version of StuffIt Expander and refrains from downloading the new version

[08:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has an old 68k version somewhere

[08:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I got tired of .zip files getting assigned to StuffIt Expander, which launches Rosetta

[08:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, couldn't you just change the default application for .zip files, without having to remove StuffIt Expander?

[08:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
Select any zip file, change the default app and click Change All...

[08:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: apparently not

[08:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
(I know it's made slightly complicated by the stupidity of Macs sometimes relying on invisible metadata for choosing default apps)

[08:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I've gone through the usual steps in both Finder and Firefox

[09:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: but there's something somewhere that makes Firefox write the HFS creator code for StuffIt expander onto zip files

[09:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or so I suspect

[09:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
could be some very, very legacy setting migrated a dozen times somewhere in the bowels of Carbon in the parts that came from Internet Config

[09:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or something like that

[09:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's what it's called. The way the creator code is used has to be one of the most annoying design flaws I dislike about macs

[13:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>

it's weird how rubys can quote chapter and verse of the w3c process document, but can't be arsed to read the mailing list archives from a few months before he was installed as our Fearless Leader

[17:39:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
i guess Fearless Leaders don't need to avail themselves of history

[17:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to be fair, the W3C mailing list archive search is a pain to use

[17:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it took me a good 5 minutes to find that email

[17:47:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i searched for this: alt "from: ian hickson" site:lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/

[17:47:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
the message you linked is the 3rd result

[17:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
ah, using Google would have been a better idea

[17:50:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
on an unrelated note, google's lawyers would really like employees not to use "Google" as a verb

[17:50:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
so now i say "search" and assume everyone uses Google

[19:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: are you at all interested in what the PFWG had to say (informally and tentatively) about your Last Call feedback on ARIA btw? I can't remember if I told you after the telecon

[19:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: or would you rather wait for their promised email on the topic?

[19:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
i need either a satisfactory edit to their spec, or a satisfactory reply that convinces me that no edit is needed, or an unsatisfactory reply i can reply to

[19:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I can tell you what reply is likely coming

[19:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I agree that such informal info is not enough to act on

[19:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
let me just say it instead of asking whether I should:

[19:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
1) They already (tentatively) planned to make native element semantics "win" over ARIA semantics for everything but the role attribute; host languages could make conflicting states nonconforming, and in case of a conflict the native semantics win (so <input type="checkbox" checked aria-checked=false> will be presented as checked.

[19:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
this is unpublished and not yet stated officially in a public forum

[19:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
2) They were not planning to do this with role, but after my examples of nonsensical role combinations, such as <input type="radionbutton" role="combobox">, they agreed to reconsider this.

[19:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
And to give some form of feedback on this soon, possibly privately.

[19:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Whether they will follow up with an actual public post or actual spec edits, I cannot say.

[19:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
they also said that if there is a limit on what elements are allowed to have what roles, they would want to review that

[20:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[20:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
well

[20:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
until all that is something i can act on...

[20:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if they stated something about #1 on the record, and agreed as to #2 (that host languages can limit what roles apply to what elements), would you feel like that is something you can act on?

[20:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
what i need to be able to act on something is the normative text

[20:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
which forms of normative text would be satisfacotry: (a) a snippet in an informal reply; (b) an Editor's Draft including new text; (c) a published Working Draft containing the new text?

[20:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
(b)

[20:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and is it ok if (b) is Member-only or otherwise not fully public?

[20:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(as long as you get to see it?)

[20:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
member-only is fine

[20:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, it's dumb, but it's just regular w3c-dumb, it doesn't prevent me from doing my work

[20:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
what i need to be able to reference aria from html5 is the text that i'm going to be referencing, so i can make sure it makes sense

[20:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
authoring and implementation conformance criteria

[20:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
and host language hooks

[20:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
same as with any other spec

[20:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm hoping that they give at least an informal reply soon

[20:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe Sam asked for one in "72 hours" on the conference call but I will be generous and assume that means business day hours

[20:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
with that in hand, it's probably not hard to get it in an Editor's Draft in less than their projected 3-month timeline to reply at all

[20:15:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
given the history of interaction, i expect their response to be a poetic reading of the revised spec during next week's teleconference

[20:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I will give Sam credit for pressing them to give some kind of response

[20:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
let's see if it actually works

[20:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm really not in any rush

[20:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think it's a problem if aria isn't in HTML5 LC

[20:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
we can always add it in the next version, like half the other features in the spec

[20:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
though i will be amused if we go to LC without ARIA given that the whole reason for ARIA's existence is that ARIA is something that can be done quickly instead of requiring the whole of HTML to rev

[20:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
this particular feature is somewhat important because it's actively being implemented by user agents and validators

[20:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if it has to be held up for substantive technical reasons, fine, but it would be a shame for it to be held up solely by procedural BS

[20:20:01.0000] <Hixie>

[20:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
some people

[20:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
some are also triangular.

[20:24:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's wonderful.

[20:24:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
the <kbd> example obviously needs to say "Keyboard error, no keyboard present. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to continue"

[20:25:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I so just repeated that reply to Beth, Hixie, thanks.

[20:25:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That was excellent.

[20:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
mpilgrim: i prefer my more subtle references. :-)

i used the flickr api to reverse-engineer the original URL based on the filename in the <img src>

[20:28:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's one of my suggestions so far, but I wanted to get feedback from the whatwg channel on it.

[20:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
mpilgrim: :-D

[20:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: seems reasonable, though it's probably a little early to be using <section> and company still

[20:29:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
yah, if you want to use the new semantic elements, you need to make accommodations for IE and older versions of Firefox

[20:30:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
mpilgrim and hixie, we are aiming for ie6+, ff, safari, opera, chrome compatibility.  We're using some CSS and JS to give some of the browsers support.

[20:31:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It's not anything remotely complicated, just the document.createElement function.

[20:31:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
do you know about modernizr?

[20:32:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We've already been using that for abbr tags, since we also aim for accessibility.  I had a long discussion about whether or not adopting the HTML5 draft would be accessible, but he who knows about Section501 gave a positive review - actually most are excited about moving forward.

[20:33:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We don't use modernizr, but we've had support for browser and css-capability-based selectors for a while.

[20:34:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We actually have a serverside script that takes care of most of it, and it actually attaches the class to the html tag, which is okay to do in JS (not in static, I believe).

[20:35:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i assume you mean section 508, but that's neither here nor there

[20:35:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
mpilgrim, thank you.  I am certainly not an expert.

[20:36:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Seriously, I am absolutely lucky to even get the attention I do.  However, I'm a big HTML5 fan, even if it's not done.

[20:36:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
html 5 does a lot of good for accessibility

[20:37:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
it codifies a lot of recent work in the accessibility field

[20:37:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Awesome.

[20:37:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
and will (perhaps sooner, perhaps later) be integrating roles and states as well

[20:37:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
(a.k.a. ARIA)

[20:37:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well that's why I'd love you guys to see my two drafts, did you see the first one i just posted on pastebin?

[20:37:05.0000] <mpilgrim>
i did

[20:37:06.0000] <mpilgrim>
html5 attempts to make @accesskey sane

[20:38:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yea, someone was mentioning aria.

[20:38:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
and is the first standard to include the de facto "negative @tabindex" thing that's implemented in IE and Firefox

[20:38:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I have no idea how I got the thumbs up to look into how we can move to html5 but we are for sure going there, how much we actually take from the new elements and semantics is up to how much research we do.

[20:38:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So that's why I'm here.

[20:38:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
there's other stuff too

[20:38:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Normally I just write jQuery plugins.

[20:39:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Here is my other draft @ http://pastebin.org/9577

[20:39:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
work on rich <canvas> accessibility is only just beginning (html 5 has basic support for including fallback content, but nothing for "accessifying" dynamic scripted graphics)

[20:41:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
if you're targeting current browsers and assistive technologies, you should include skip links before your navigation

[20:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: you can replace "<meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type" />" with just <meta charset="utf-8">

[20:42:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
since i think ATs don't yet support the <nav> element

[20:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: also, it looks like your h1/h2/h3 shouldn't be in an hgroup

[20:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: since the h1 is for the site and the h3 for the page, at least those two should be distinct

[20:42:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hixie, I thought they should, could you tell me why you think they shouldn't?

[20:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal:  see http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#distinguishing-site-wide-headings-from-page-headings

[20:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
other than that it looks good

[20:43:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, I want to be as perfectly implementing these technologies as possible.

[20:44:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, are you suggesting that the h1 and h2 tags are okay, but the h3 tag should be distinct from the Company Title and Community Title?

[20:44:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
eg, the h3 exists within a different <section> where it is the h1?

[20:45:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
AFAIK, http://www.webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/ is the best article on skip links

[20:45:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
mpilgrim, are you referring that link to me?

[20:45:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
yes

[20:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: i'm not sure exactly what the community title is

[20:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: so it's hard to say exactly what should happen

[20:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: but the h1 and the h3 are titling different things, so they shouldn't be in a gorup

[20:46:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
mpilgrim, that's great, I love that.  We would need to use some kind of unique styling to hide those links from users without removoing them from screen-readers.

[20:46:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
in your second html 5 prototype, you had a <nav> section. i'm saying that even if you're using the <nav> element, you need to include a "skip navigation" link before it, because current ATs don't support the <nav> element yet.

[20:46:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Typically, like for the company logo on the h1 tag, we use font-size:0,text-indent: 99999em; overflow: hidden; or something where it's not hidden to screen-readers but stylistically invisible.

[20:46:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
the webaim article shows you how to hide them properly but make them appear for screenreader users *and* keyboard-only users

[20:47:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, we're using the nav section as the main site navigation.

[20:47:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
see http://www.webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/#focus

[20:47:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We would probably attach #skip to a class so it could be re-used.

[20:48:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's great.

[20:48:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
yeah

[20:48:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
a class is fine

[20:48:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hixie, are you then also saying that, if there was to be an h2, the h2 should be the company branding (you know, like the company slogan) if it's to be looped in with the h1 in the hgroup?

[20:49:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i actually insert them dynamically before certain types of blocks (large chunks of code or ASCII art)

[20:49:01.0000] <mpilgrim>

[20:50:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
^-- dynamically creating skip links using jquery

[20:50:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yay, jQuery.

[20:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: not sure i understand the premise of your question

[20:54:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
For skip, http://pastebin.org/9578

[20:55:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hixie, I didn't want to be lazy and ask you how you would do it, so I was trying to understand how/when you think these tags should be used.

[20:55:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I asked a question badly though, it seems.

[20:55:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
poorly, rather.

[20:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: my problem is i don't understand what the community title is

[20:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: do you have a site, a site subsection, and then a page?

[20:56:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, that gets complicated because our product is pretty big.

[20:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: if so, then you want an h1 for the site, an h2 for the subsection, and an h3 for the page, none in an hgroup

[20:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: since they would all be titling different things

[20:56:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://www.liferay.com/ We're a portal.

[20:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: the way to think about it is this -- if you were to put every single page into the same HTML file

[20:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: would there be a single heading or multiple headings?

[20:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: the answer is presumably you'd have one site header, and then one subsection header per subsection, and one page header per "page" in each section

[20:57:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hixie, I completely understand what you mean by if you were to put every single page into the same html file.  At work, I describe multiple pages as paginated content.

[20:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: so, <hgroup> is basically saying "there's only one header here"

[20:58:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's how we won keeping h1 as the company name and not the page title, because if every page was one page then that would be the global title of them all.

[20:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
right

[20:58:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I see, I see.  So, truely, if we wanted to group an entire company, and then an entire community, and then a page, they would each exist within their own (sub) sections

[20:59:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I see what you mean.  Thanks for the skip css, mpilgrim.

[21:00:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
mpilgrim, if the AT doesn't know the nav element, will it still try to read the ul/li's inside of it?

[21:01:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
AFAIK, ATs just ignore unknown elements (like browsers do)

[21:01:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
so yes, it will still read the list of links

[21:01:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
as a list

[21:02:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
of links

[21:02:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Excellent, just like they have been in html4 and so forth.

[21:02:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
yeah

[21:02:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
i haven't done anything drastic, like testing that

[21:03:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm looking for the documentation that explains the usage of header tags within the hgroup as basically saying "there's only one header here".  I agree and believe it, but part of enforcing these standards, I need the docs to back it up, but I'm looking.

[21:03:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
hence the "AFAIK" disclaimer

[21:03:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
mpilgrim, yea, we have a guy who will test that and then we can work from there, but at first, I want the draft to be as html5 friendly as possible.

[21:03:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
yay, testing!

[21:04:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
please report back if there are any oddities with current ATs + new HTML 5 markup

[21:04:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That will be weeks from now.  The first few weeks will be extensively reviewing and re-reviewing and testing the elements and new themes themselves.

[21:05:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
"weeks" is better than "never"

[21:05:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We love standards, so standardizing on something means really being pro about it.  I think we've slipped on being pro about html standards, so that's perhaps why I'm getting such an opportunity.

[21:05:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
mpilgrim, here here.

[21:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hixie, other than the multiple headings, did you have any other objections or suggestions?

[21:06:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Actually, that remark is for anyone.

[21:06:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
/me wanders off

[21:08:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, in case there is, I'll check back in 15 - 20 minutes.  Thanks already so much!

[21:38:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hello again!

[21:41:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Where do you think accesible nav items like skip navigation should go, within the main navigation?

[21:55:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So this is right?  http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/2844/hgroup.jpg

[22:07:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Or even http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/2844/hgroup.jpg

[22:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
<section> tags effectively reset the meaning behind the numerical value of header tags, right?

[22:18:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Can article elements have sub-article elements within them?

[22:21:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Nvm, they can have nested children.

[22:37:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
"I wish we had had this information on Thursday." gee, if only there were some sort of asynchronous communication protocol we could have used instead of a live teleconference.

[22:43:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
:-D

[23:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
is sam just going to not reply to me, do we think?

[23:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mpilgrim: I think Sam's emails sometimes make him seem more interested in smacking Hixie on the nose than in building consensus

[23:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused (again) by sam's recent e-mails

[23:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
does he think wai is different than anyone else?

[23:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think I pretty much said that I expect everyone (including you) to justify their position if there is a disagreement

[23:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
i've always been clear that i make edits based on people bringing forward issues and showing problems in the spec, arguing for changes based on reasoning and data.

[23:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't matter if it's WAI, the pope, larry page, an implementor, or the US House of Representatives

[23:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
(all but one of whom have in fact sent feedback)

[23:40:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
hixie: the only part of the "Consensus Resolution" that matters to these people is the one this one:

[23:40:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
""""We recommend that HTML5 state that "For guidance on accessibility requirements for text alternatives authors should consult WCAG 2.0." and that HTML should not provide any guidance that conflicts with WCAG."""

[23:41:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i.e. they want you to remove all the examples in the entire @alt section and replace it with a link to WCAG 2

[23:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mpilgrim: I'm not sure that is what matters to them

[23:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
mpilgrim: in fact Steve Faulkner specifically said they are *not* requesting that the current examples be removed

[23:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
however, it seems like a worthwhile exercise to find out what does matter to them

[23:44:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i stand corrected

[23:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
see, THIS is why i asked for a statement of what problem they were trying to solve

[23:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I would think that clear mutual understanding of people's positions should be an active goal for the chair

[23:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
sam says he understands what steven wants

[23:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
he just won't tell me!

[23:45:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
"fetch me a rock"

[23:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
because apparently being editor involves some sort of game of tea leaf reading, in his eyes

[23:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't believe he said that he knows what Steven (or rather, WAI) wants

[23:46:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
but i stand by my original statement, that that recommendation is the sole reason for bringing up the consensus resolution again and again

[23:46:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
see also this discussion on bruce lawson's site shortly after the resolution was initially published: http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/alternate-text-in-html-5/

[23:46:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
they don't give a shit about helping people

[23:47:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
they just want you to defer to the "experts"

[23:47:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
JF has actually stated that, on-list

[23:47:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
"You need to stop contradicting WAI, even if you have proof that they need to update their advice."

[23:47:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
that's not an accessibility advocate

[23:47:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
that's a W3C advocate

[23:47:05.0000] <mpilgrim>
not that there's anything wrong with that, per se

[23:47:06.0000] <othermaciej>
he just implied that it is wrong to ask them to justify themselves, because Hixie hasn't justified what's in the spec (and when it's pointed out that Hixie did, he claims he knew that and just sort of sweeps it aside)

[23:47:07.0000] <mpilgrim>
(well, i don't personally think the W3C needs advocates, but however he chooses to spend his time is his business)

[23:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i didn't even ask them to justify anything!

[23:48:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
but someone who actually gave a shit about actually helping disabled people would never say "WE ALL NEED TO FOLLOW THE SAME BAD ADVICE"

[23:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i just asked them to tell me what they wanted to solve

[23:49:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
(source for that JF quote about not contradicting WAI: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0149.html )

[23:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that's more or less isomorphic to asking them to give the reason for their suggested changes 

[23:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(I suppose the "justify" formulation is more generous by allowing a reason to be given that is not in terms of a problem.)

[23:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mpilgrim: I do remember him saying that

[23:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: justification is something based on reasoning and data, which is something i typically would ask for once i understood wtf we were actually trying to solve, if a solution was being proposed that wasn't obviously correct

[23:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: but i'm a long way from getting to the point of looking at the solution yet

[23:51:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
othermaciej: this discussion about the Consensus Resolution is the same thing

[23:52:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
this time it's @alt instead of @summary

[23:52:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
but it's all the same discussion

[23:52:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
just search-and-replace the name of the attribute, and you could play out this entire thread in advance

[23:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: they gave me the exam answer. i'm asking for the exam question. the justification is the workings that lead to the answer.

[23:53:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
hixie: there is no technical justification

[23:53:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
you have to defer to their guidance because they're experts

[23:54:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
there. isn't. anything. else.

[23:54:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
to their argument

[23:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
mpilgrim: that's possible, but i intend to continue giving them the benefit of the doubt.

[23:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the Goals section of this document is admittedly a bit thin on stating the goals

[23:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am assuming the general high-level goal is to make content including images accessible to the blind

[23:55:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
i stopped giving them the benefit of the doubt when JF referred to his fork as "the respect draft"

[23:55:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
and made it clear that he was not an accessibility advocate

[23:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have to mention in fairness that not everyone in WAI agrees with JF or likes him being acting as their advocate

[23:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
mpilgrim: i treat all input independently of where it comes from, which means in this instance not caring if there's a history here.

[23:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and that, conversely, JF has shown himself more open to negotiating than other WAI advocates

[23:58:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
in related news, i'm anxiously looking forward to seeing sam's next excuse for not publishing the editor's draft that the working group has told him they want published

[23:59:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
not that it matters

[23:59:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
hixie's made over 60 edits since the poll began

[23:59:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
time marches on

[23:59:03.0000] <othermaciej>
mpilgrim: I believe he will publish it

[00:00:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
then you are less of a cynic than i

[00:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am differently cynical

[00:01:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
steve has published http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/HTML5/textalternatives.html

[00:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Sam would prefer the other draft, but doesn't care enough to put his credibility on the line

[00:01:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
(linked from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0826.html )

[00:02:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
perhaps sam could latch onto that and claim that it was an editor's draft of a rewrite of the @alt section

[00:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
While Sam is willing to indulge late-breaking objections to publication, I doubt he will enter one himself

[00:04:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
well, steven did say "I have taken it upon myself to work an alternative version of the spec that impacts on both of these parts"

[00:04:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
sounds poll-worthy to me!

[00:05:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
Sam would obviously prefer Manu's draft; he voted for it, after all.

[00:07:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
hixie: you said "The WHATWG is going to be ready for last call in less than two months" ( http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0844.html )

[00:07:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
what does that mean, exactly?

[00:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Steve's draft doesn't seem to be in line with the WAI resolution as stated

[00:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(it doesn't include any of the ARIA stuff, and it doesn't allow <figure><legend> instead of alt, to give two concrete examples)

[00:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
mpilgrim: it means we'll be at zero issues in the three issue trackers that have real issues in them before the end of october.

[00:09:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
ok

[00:10:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
and then what happens?

[00:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
then the spec goes to last call

[00:10:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
...within the WHATWG

[00:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
and the w3c, unless the wg decides otherwise

[00:10:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
snort

[00:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe the W3C condition for Last Call would be closing out all issue tracker issues, followed by some sort of vote

[00:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have decided to work on the former, I do wish I had somewhat more active support from Sam

[00:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am having a hard time reading the issues graph

[00:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
is there any particular browser I should use?

[00:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
safari trunk works

[00:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so it does

[00:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually safari trunk shows two bugs

[00:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
one is that fillText() doesn't support its width argument

[00:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
and the other is that there's some sort of repaint bug

[00:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
sometimes you have to cause the window to repaint to see the labels

[00:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
in Safari 4.0.3 what was missing were the green and cyan lines

[00:18:05.0000] <othermaciej>
is Issues measuring issue tracker issues or something else?

[00:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(guessing based on e-mails and bugs being the other lines)

[00:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess the data doesn't fit that hypothesis so nevermind

[00:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
issues is the XXX markers in the spec

[00:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
some of them show as red boxes 

[00:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
others are just in comments

[00:59:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
YAY!ch-T-M-L

[00:59:01.0000] <annevk42>
the sync database API is now async?

[00:59:02.0000] <annevk42>
mwaha

[01:05:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
What is currently <div id="wrapper"> would best be replaced with <section> or <article> in HTML5?  My assumption is <section> because it doesn't specifically intend the page to have any subject, it could be completely administration based.

[01:06:00.0000] <annevk42>
<section> has certain implications so <div> is probably better

[01:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if something is in fact a section, it's good to use <section>

[01:07:01.0000] <annevk42>
I think we should have an element for <div id=wrapper> / <div id=content> / <div id=main> though

[01:07:02.0000] <annevk42>
othermaciej, not if it doesn't have a header

[01:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
if its peers are <aside>, <nav>, <header>, etc

[01:07:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
well, the thing is that the page does have a header.

[01:07:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[01:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
then per current spec, <div> would be correct, but it does seem useful to have an element for the main content

[01:08:01.0000] <annevk42>
you typically want something like <header/> <content/> <footer/> but we do not have <content/>

[01:08:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://pastebin.org/9577 - in this example I'm using section.  I know accessibility folks mentioned that I need a skip element in the nav

[01:09:00.0000] <annevk42>
JonathanNeal, oh, for that markup you do not need id=wrapper at all

[01:09:01.0000] <annevk42>
JonathanNeal, just style the body element

[01:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, <div id="wrapper"> seems redundant

[01:10:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, what if the site needs to be a certain overall width and centered.

[01:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
in general, one shouldn't use <section> unless the purpose is to get the outline algorithm effects that come with <section>

[01:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
id="banner" could be <header>

[01:10:04.0000] <othermaciej>
id="navigation" could be <nav>

[01:10:05.0000] <annevk42>
JonathanNeal, body { width:700px; margin:0 auto } ?

[01:10:06.0000] <othermaciej>
id="footer" could be <footer>

[01:11:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Right, I used section because I believed the meaning of the content to be <section>.

[01:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
id="content-wrapper" should be the hypothetical "main content" element

[01:12:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
But the <section> element meets the criteria of content, if it has meaning.

[01:12:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
If it doesn't have meaning, then <div> already works perfectly.

[01:12:02.0000] <annevk42>
dude, you can style the body element :)

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm curious if the list of premises I sent to public-html turns out to be flawed

[01:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: the text about <section> says "the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline", but on the other hand it says it's a "generic document or application section", and applications don't generally have outlines

[01:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: hmm. "application section" has a bad spec smell

[01:16:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Can the header and footer elements be children of the body?

[01:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
whether applications have "sections", it's hard for me to say

[01:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
JonathanNeal: yes

[01:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
don't we have <fieldset> for application "sections"?

[01:17:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, I can be very direct with it's application, Liferay Portal.  So, at that point we're talking about multiple applications per page many times.

[01:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: <fieldset> implies some rendering behavior that is no longer considered a good idea for modern HI design

[01:17:03.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: are you developing Liferay itself or are you developing a portal based on Liferay (just curious)

[01:17:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: true

[01:20:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hsivonen, the front end of the portal, http://www.liferay.com/web/jonathan.neal/blog

[01:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: you didn't comment directly on auto-generated title=

[01:23:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I want to be as true to the intent of html5 as possible.  The move to html as the doctype is already in core, but without taking advantage of the newer, proper usage then it's not the most meaningful switch.

[01:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I assume that was an oversight

[01:23:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
move to html5*

[01:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(in your premises email)

[01:23:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: Is autogenerated @title materially different from autogenerated @alt under ATAG 2?

[01:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I don't know

[01:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: did you mean to imply that ATAG 2 has the same kind of requirement for title?

[01:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I meant to imply that to the extent @title is considered to be a text alternative, ATAG 2 restricts it the same way it restricts alt

[01:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I could be wrong, though

[01:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think in HTML5, it is considered a substitute text description in light of proper text alternative being unavailable

[01:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not saying what the spec says to do is a good idea necessarily, but I don't think you addressed it

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I sent email addressing it now

[01:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ATAG 2.0 B.2.4 seems to allow a tool to suggest an autogenerated alt, as long as the author has the opportunity to accept, modify or reject it

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so it would be superficially ATAG-compliant to pop up a dialog on every image drop suggesting some alt text with a default OK button

[01:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
although I do not think this would lead to good usability for the tool, or good accessibility in the resulting context

[01:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: yes. Hence "Most authors don't respond to prompts in a meaningful way."

[01:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would probably be completely off the table for a tool like Word where producing HTML is a side feature and not the main focus

[01:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It seems I forgot to add yet one more point

[01:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but it's such a given that I don't send more email now

[01:32:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hsivonen, what do you do?

[01:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the point being that the goal is to make average accessibility over the Web better--not just to comply with the letter of ATAG 2

[01:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
ATAG 2.0 does require allowing the author to reject, so on its terms, it has to be possible to use an authoring tool to create output with no alternative text

[01:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: I develop an HTML5 parser for Gecko, an HTML5 validator, and I read and write a lot of related email

[01:34:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hsivonen, well that's excellent!

[01:35:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Most of us are big fans of HTML5 and want to do it right, and the thumbs up has been given to make the move.

[01:35:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Minus the part where we wait for it to be final, you know, cause it's like after the second coming.

[01:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: sent reply in email

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I think the way HTML5 suggests using title does not technically run afoul of the letter ATAG2, even if a tool added it automatically, but I am not sure if it is in the spirit of ATAG2

[01:58:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
annevk42, I agree with killing the wrapper div, I think we were using it when really the css margin style could have been safely set on the body tag, and also, when anything tricky needs to be made, we can still add <div> elements, but there's no reason to add a page-wide <section> when there's nothing outside of it and the body.

[02:01:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Also, I need to fix my improper usage of the hgroup tag, I even made a graphic to remind myself that the hgroup element should not group together tree-based hierarchies, but rather group together descriptive headlines.

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk42>
JonathanNeal, because of bugs in IE5 and the somewhat special status of the body element lots of people do not realize it is just another <div>

[02:04:00.0000] <annevk42>
JonathanNeal, i.e. you can give it a width, center it, etc.

[02:04:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Right, and I was testing all of this against ie6 too.

[02:05:00.0000] <annevk42>
it should work fine in IE6 in standards mode

[02:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk42: doesn't <body> have some special behavior for backgrounds though?

[02:06:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Someone was asking if Liferay has an official "supported" list, and I'm not sure that we do, but I know that we support Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 2+, and Safari 4+.  I know that I personally test everything on IE6+, FF3, and Safari 4.

[02:07:00.0000] <annevk42>
othermaciej, only if nothing is set on html {}

[02:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: is there a reason why old safari versions get cut faster than old Firefox?

[02:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: is it hard to keep old Safari around? or is the population on Safari 3.x insignificant?

[02:08:01.0000] <annevk42>
othermaciej, but yeah, it has a somewhat special status, e.g. some event handler attributes on the body element register event handlers on the Window object

[02:08:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yes, because Safari3 was never really tested to begin with.

[02:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: I see

[02:08:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We supported it on a per-client basis, which means that most of the features probably worked fine, and I bet we took on a few tickets addressing incompatibilities.

[02:09:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, Nate is the director of UI and he works on a Mac now, which has probably made a significant impact on our Safari and Mac testing. :-)

[02:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if remaining Firefox 2 users are Mac & Windows self-installed copies or system copies on long-term-supported Linux distros

[02:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
FWIW Safari 4 is around 55% of all Safari users

[02:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe in absolute numbers, slightly more people use Safari 3.x than Firefox 2.x, though Firefox 3.0 is still above all versions of Safari

[02:11:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, a lot of our support is directed by what the corporate clients are running, and sadly they're pretty-much all running IE6.

[02:11:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Whether it's government policy or MS built them a custom chop of IE6 that couldn't reasonably be afforded an upgrade.

[02:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
IE6 has itself a solid little perch there

[02:15:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
othermaciej, you could set html { overflow-y: scroll; } *for sure triggering the scrollbar* and body { background: *whatever color and whatever image*; margin: 100px auto 0; width: 960px; } and the background will still expand from the very top and all the way from either side of the page, in IE6+, FF, Safari.

[02:16:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
However, if you set html { background: *anything* } then it will trigger the background to act like it would on a div.

[02:20:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
<nav> should go within <header>?  But is it required?

[02:22:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
e.g: http://pastie.org/585630 should I move <nav> out of <header> and make it a direct child of <body>?  Or is it proper for <nav> to reside as a direct child of <header>?

[02:27:00.0000] <annevk42>
either way is ok

[02:36:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, then here is my latest draft @ http://pastie.org/585640

[02:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
JonathanNeal: Did someone already point you toward http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/ ?

[02:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
If the output from that looks sensible you are probably using headings/sectioning elements in the right way

[02:38:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
jgraham, yes, but very early in my research.  All right, thanks.

[02:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I'm not really sure your <header> shouldn't be a <hgroup> but I didn't follow the earlier discussion of that too closely)

[02:43:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
jgraham, the idea is that hgroup is for non-tree hierarchical headings,  but instead for subheadings, alternative titles, or taglines like, in our case, company slogans, mottos, etc.

[02:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
JonathanNeal: I understand what hgroup is for

[02:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
What I'm not sure about is how you expect the document outline to look

[02:44:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, my community title is part of a larger tree.

[02:44:03.0000] <jgraham>
JonathanNeal: Oh well it might be fine then

[02:45:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
You have a multiple portal instances which can have the company title, then within a portal instance you can have any number of communities, and those communities have pages.

[02:45:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
*you have multiple

[02:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
Just make a demo page with some portal contents and see if it looks right :)

[02:45:03.0000] <annevk42>
Hmm, I proposed a solution; hopefully the problem is clear

[02:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk42: Would you only be allowed exactly one <content> element per page?

[02:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't know what the corresponding aria requirements are

[02:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
why <content>? why not <main>

[02:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
or <therealbody> :-)

[02:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
fwiw <main> sounds better to me

[02:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
because it communicates "singleton" better

[02:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what does Firefox+JAWS do if you have more than one role=main?

[02:49:01.0000] <annevk42>
hsivonen, see above about me proposing a solution

[02:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
(you can argue that anything is "content" and I imagine we would get pages with dozens of <content> elements when they meant <article>)

[02:49:03.0000] <annevk42>
:/

[02:49:04.0000] <annevk42>
maybe it is because I always used <div id=content> :)

[02:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I like <main> better

[02:50:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I think the html outliner thinks my nav needs a title.

[02:50:02.0000] <beowulf>
i use 'page', but isn't the use of an element like that presentational?

[02:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think identifying the main content is no more presentational than identifying the header or the navigation area

[02:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the situation with these elements and ARIA landmarks is a very sad case of turf wars and parsing badness

[02:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: are you suggesting one of the two should not exist?

[02:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(and if so, which?)

[02:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ideally, yes

[02:52:01.0000] <annevk42>
if we had the elements on time ARIA landmarks would not be needed

[02:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
once the elements are widely usable, ARIA landmarks will be less necessary

[02:52:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yes, the outliner wants my <nav> to have a header.  Is that even right?

[02:52:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ideally, I think we should just have the elements (in an ideal world they'd parse sanely in IE6)

[02:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
JonathanNeal: Er... this is an area of some confucion

[02:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
*confusion

[02:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
for the same reason we in general prefer to write <eltname> instead of <div role=eltname>

[02:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I agree it would be better to have just the elements

[02:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think the roles came into existence mainly due to "turf wars", more because HTML was unmaintained at W3C at the time

[02:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
_in principle_ I think it is useful if <nav> had a heading. In practice I have neverr seen anyone do it

[02:54:02.0000] <jgraham>
Or at least it is unusual

[02:54:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ok. maybe this isn't a case of turf wars, but it is a case of WGs doing their own thing instead of working on the platform holistically

[02:54:04.0000] <jgraham>
Generally as long as you don't have any more sections nested under the <nav> I doubt it is a practical issue

[02:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and also the older HTML WG seemed to think that <div role=eltname> was genuinely better than <eltname>

[02:55:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, isn't the sibling <header> element representing what the <nav>'s <h1-h6> elements be doing?

[02:55:02.0000] <jgraham>
If you do then I think you will hit badness in the current outline algorithm

[02:55:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: the older HTML WG assumed their stuff wouldn't be natively implemented in IE

[02:55:04.0000] <jgraham>
JonathanNeal: In general sibling relationships are not used

[02:55:05.0000] <jgraham>
formally

[02:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: eventually they assumed it wouldn't be natively implemented by anyone...

[02:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I think their love of role fits their design taste

[02:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
comes from the same spiritual place as allowing src= and href= on everything

[02:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it also comes from the place where stuff needs to be DTD-valid but declaring attributes to take any CDATA is OK

[02:57:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So if a page has a header with navigation, then the navigation needs to either re-specify that the navigation belongs to the header, and/or that the navigation is, in fact, navigation through use of an <h1>Navigation</h1>?

[02:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
as a side note: I'm really happy that I asked Steve Faulkner to help me understand the reasoning behind the proposal, now that he spoke up about point (7)

[02:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and I'm even more upset at Sam for criticizing me for it

[03:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
part of the sadness regarding the landmarks is that now that <div role=main> etc. exist, it's not clear that the incremental elegance of the HTML5 elements is worth the cost of having a dual system

[03:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, it seems that Firefox 2 will have expired by the time these semantics really take off (if they ever take off)

[03:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
JonathanNeal: Well I think in general you would want something like <nav><h1>Site Map</h1></nav> or whatever the actual <nav> contents are but, in practice, I think it is likely fine to leave it with no header 

[03:01:02.0000] <annevk42>
we can phase out ARIA landmarks over time

[03:01:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I want to understand this one, because <header><h1>Header</h1> ... actual header title ... </header> isn't necessary, so why would <nav><h1>Navigation</h1> ... actual navigation ... </nav> be?

[03:01:04.0000] <hsivonen>
oops. I've managed to intertwingle the conceptual parts of the Gecko HTML5 parser more that I meant to

[03:02:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
If you see my concern with this, it seems redundant to create an element to specify navigation if you're only going to force me to label it again.

[03:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
JonathanNeal: You are not forced to label it. But you might have several types of navigation on a page so it is possible to label it to distinguish them

[03:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
for example

[03:03:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I think the cost of landmark roles existing is fairly low, and if the elements take off, the roles can fade in importance over time

[03:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
Presumably a good outline generator on encountering <nav> with no heading would be sensible enough to present it as if it had some generic heading like "navigation"

[03:05:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
jgraham, I understand.  In the meantime, I'll probably add the label and fear how Google might try to parse an h1 so much earlier than the site's content.

[03:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
doh. I forget the image-as-sole-content-of-<a> case when replying to the alt="" stuff

[03:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
*forgot

[03:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk42: the sync database api is still sync, the callbacks aren't called asynchronously.

[03:07:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, Liferay let's you place any number of portlets on a page, but I was changing our div#content-wrapper to section#content, however all section's need a title so best practice would be instead to use a div?

[03:07:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
the content-wrapper wrapped any number of applications, be it blogs, wikis, forums, web content, etc.

[03:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
JonathanNeal: How would you expect it to look in outline view? If you don't expect the content-wrapper to appear then yes, you should use <div>

[03:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Got it.  We'll end up failing the outline wrapper anyway if we don't move from tables to divs.  I hate divs though, I feel like they are still not at the level of td positioning.

[03:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah some layoput effects can be hard to achieve with CSS, especially if you are supporting IE6

[03:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
I keep hoping flexbox will get implemented sometime soon but even that won't help in legacy clients

[03:13:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We have a fully div based layout system, but it will never be as flexable as td in the next 5+ years.

[03:14:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Even IE7 does not support the table/table-cell css display settings

[03:15:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
What we have going for us is the growing facination of corporations to use 960 grids and the like.

[03:16:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Anywho, it's 2:18am where I am and I should get some sleep, but I really appreciate everyone's input tonight.  I'll be back tomorrow morning.

[03:20:00.0000] <annevk42>
Hixie, ah, interesting

[03:35:00.0000] <annevk42>
ok, I can now quickly test name matching rules for ISO-8859-9 at least

[03:35:01.0000] <annevk42>
hopefully they're generic :)

[03:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: Isn't the <a href="#"><img src="delete.png" alt=""></a> assuming that @alt is being used incorrectly? Given that why would you assume that the same authour would get aria right?

[03:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me will just say that to the list

[03:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or maybe I am missing something

[03:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess people don't need more email

[03:48:01.0000] <annevk42>
so actually the rules Chromium is using for charset matching break pages too

[03:48:02.0000] <annevk42>
e.g. http://memorystick.com/en/index.html does not look good

[03:48:03.0000] <annevk42>
I think the far stricter rules Firefox uses might be better

[03:49:00.0000] <annevk42>
does anyone here have IE (any version)?

[03:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, yes

[03:50:01.0000] <annevk42>
results for http://dump.testsuite.org/2009/encoding-matching/ would be appreciated

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk42>
not the PASS/FAIL bit but what the used encoding is

[03:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, give me a few minutes before I get to it

[04:06:00.0000] <nvartolomei>
something interesting here? :-)

[04:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, results for IE8: 001 Windows-1254; 002 Windows-1252; 003 Windows-1254; 004 Windows-1252; 005 Windows-1252; 006 Windows-1254; 007 Windows-1252; 008 Windows-1252; 009 Windows-1252; 010 Windows-1254; 011 Windows-1254; 012 Windows-1252; 013 Windows-1252; 014 Windows-1252; 015 Windows-1252; 016 Windows-1252

[04:15:00.0000] <nvartolomei>
In html5 we can use <meta charset="UTF-8" /> right?

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
no need for the "/" but otherwise yes

[04:16:01.0000] <nvartolomei>
should we wait <meta description="something here" /> ? :-)

[04:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
what would it be for?

[04:17:00.0000] <nvartolomei>
now: <meta name="description" content="" />, <meta description="" /> is prettier :-)

[04:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
nvartolomei, by that logic, we should also have <meta author="...">, <meta date="..."> and attributes for whatever other metadata authors want to use. That would not be a good solution

[04:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
besides, the using <meta> for providing a description is of questionable value anyway

[04:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/the using/using/

[04:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
nvartolomei: <meta name=description> is a waste of time, i wouldn't worry about it

[04:21:01.0000] <nvartolomei>
Hixie, google shows it in description :-)

[04:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but it's better to let google figure out its own description

[04:22:01.0000] <nvartolomei>
Hixie i never used it, but today i noticed that

[04:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
nvartolomei, can you give an example where Google uses the content from a meta description in its results?

[04:23:01.0000] <nvartolomei>
http://www.google.md/search?hl=mo&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=O7e&q=w3&btnG=C%C4%83utare

[04:24:00.0000] <nvartolomei>
good example?

[04:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but I'd still advise against using it

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: IIRC, Safari+VO is already smart about <a href="..."><img alt=""></a>

[04:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm going to bed. hopefully while i'm sleeping _someone_, whether sam or steven, will deign to reply to one of my e-mails and explain what on earth the problem with the spec is that they're so eager to have me fix.

[04:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:27:03.0000] <hsivonen>
nn

[04:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: that's great, but I bet it wouldn't be if we had to follow a requirement to never expose <img alt=""> to accessibility APIs...

[04:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: agreed though that it works better as an actual and not a mere hypothetical :-)

[04:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fwiw, what I want is software-developer-readable (i.e. not lawyerly) explanation of what GUI HTML editors should/must do under certain plausible sequences of user actions

[04:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so that the explanation is blessed by WAI

[04:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
without consensus on what the HTML-generating software must do, discussing the rest is rather pointless

[04:31:00.0000] <annevk5>
thanks Lachy!

[04:32:00.0000] <annevk5>
so IE has rather strict matching rules too

[04:33:00.0000] <annevk5>
and I guess they have ISO_8859-1 and ISO-8859-1 as alias but not ISO_8859_9

[04:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fun

[04:34:01.0000] <annevk5>
only ISO_8859-9 is IANA endorsed

[04:35:00.0000] <annevk5>
(that they treat ISO-8859-9 as Windows-1254 is not IANA endorsed, but I guess all browsers should just copy that)

[04:36:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, btw, you should really talk to hyatt about <menu>; afaik he's the only implementor that let his opinion known so far and he doesn't like it at all

[04:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
who asked for <menu>?

[04:38:00.0000] <annevk5>
it's part of the feature set needed for apps

[04:38:01.0000] <annevk5>
but the way we solved it is not optimal for the vast majority of menu systems in use on the Web

[04:38:02.0000] <annevk5>
dhyatt wants something that can replace all the DHTML stuff with something cleaner

[04:40:00.0000] <adactio>
Sorry to butt in but I have a quick question about <article>...

[04:40:01.0000] <adactio>
Can <article> be used for the *synopsis* of an article e.g. an index page that lists the "latest news" stories—they each have a header, a footer and content in-between but the content is a description or synopsis of the linked article rather than the entire article.

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I recall criticizing an HTML5-based blog design using <article> like that

[04:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: because the idea is that <article> stands alone

[04:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
While doing charset research I also found http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/icu38/eucjp.patch.txt?revision=4634&view=markup which suggests encodings themselves are not always implemented accorded to the standard...

[04:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
I know pretty much every layer of the Web is a mess, but when I actually encounter it it still surprises me...

[04:52:00.0000] <nvartolomei>
hm

[04:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the comment has a new metaphor: aluminum foil around a pig

[05:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
The bullet list in section 4.3.1 just before the "runnjing a script" algorithm kind of implies that doing something like var a = document.createElement("script"); a.src="foo.js" will cause foo.js to run

[05:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
which is not the case. Even if a thorough reading of the spec would give the right behaviour here it would be nice to make it obvious upfront

[05:34:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: do you mind if I ask a quick question about your validator?

[05:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: go ahead

[05:35:00.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: it seems to be choking on the aria role="search" on a form element but all the other aria roles I'm using are passing fine. Have I misunderstood something about this particular role?

[05:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: looks like a bug in the schema. thanks

[05:37:01.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: phew! I was hoping you'd say that. ;-)

[06:04:00.0000] <virtuelv>
whee

[06:04:01.0000] <virtuelv>
javascript:alert(window.frames)

[06:04:02.0000] <virtuelv>
three browser engines, three different results

[06:06:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Webkit (Chromium): [object global], Opera: [object WindowCollection], Gecko: [object Window]

[06:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
virtuelv: gecko is right

[06:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
zcorpan: according to some spec written post-facto, yes

[06:09:01.0000] <virtuelv>
there's so much about the frames interface that doesn't make sense, though

[06:09:02.0000] <virtuelv>
window.frames.location

[06:09:03.0000] <virtuelv>
location of what, exactly

[06:09:04.0000] <zcorpan>
window.frames is the same as window.window

[06:09:05.0000] <zcorpan>
and window.self

[06:10:00.0000] <virtuelv>
zcorpan: yes, but by that logic, I should be able to address frames in a document as

[06:10:01.0000] <virtuelv>
window[0..n]

[06:10:02.0000] <zcorpan>
you can

[06:10:03.0000] <virtuelv>
and I'm saying this still doesn't make the slightest bit of sense

[06:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me points at topic :)

[06:11:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me wonders how much of HTML and its related APIs makes sense

[06:12:00.0000] <virtuelv>
zcorpan: and to answer your question: at least up to firefox-3, you can't

[06:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: do you have plans to change lookupNamespaceURI in Web DOM Core? I see you have Lachy's email on file.

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: see comments at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505178

[06:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: did you see othermaciej's suggestion to add markupAsXML to Document and Element?

[06:15:00.0000] <virtuelv>
(apologies, you can)

[06:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/211 is interesting in Opera

[06:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does Opera not implement lookupNamespaceURI per spec?

[06:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. it seems that Opera implements things like Gecko

[06:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so we have Opera and Gecko on one hand and the spec an WebKit on the other

[06:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oops sorry. I mistested

[06:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I misdiagnosed Opera

[06:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i hadn't given lookupNamespaceURI much thought yet, or even tested it

[06:30:00.0000] <Lachy_>
WTF?! http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0882.html

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/lookupNamespaceURI.xhtml

[06:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for interop

[06:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: upon examining William's recent list contributions, that message is not outside expectations

[06:31:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Gecko treats null and "" equally

[06:31:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Opera understands "" but not null

[06:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
WebKit understands null but not ""

[06:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
for the values they do understand, WebKit and Opera work per spec but Gecko does not

[06:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and one might argue that the spec sucks and Gecko sucks less

[06:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think it makes sense to treat null and "" equally

[06:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, I found that one reached a new level of incomprhensibility.

[06:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: As far as I can tell William Loughborough is pure troll. I have never noticed him make any constructive sontribution to a discussion on public-html

[06:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the question I'm interested in is this: will we make the spec suck less or are we sticking to the current spec

[06:34:03.0000] <jgraham>
s/son/con/

[06:34:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
make it suck more!

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the spec is kinda nice for new world text/html 

[06:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I believe he's saying that the conversation thread in question is crazy and will contribute to HTML5 taking a really long time to complete

[06:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I didn't understand the issue from the bug comments

[06:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: if you convince webkit to implement the gecko behavior then that's what it will be

[06:37:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: if you implement the spec behavior then that'

[06:37:02.0000] <zcorpan>
s  what it will be

[06:37:03.0000] <zcorpan>
or s/webkit/opera/

[06:37:04.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see how that thread is crazy. In comparison with previous threads on the topic, it seems to be at least on the positive side

[06:37:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: indeed

[06:37:06.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: OK

[06:37:07.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: If no one is willing to budge?

[06:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I didn't say I agreed with him - it seemed like a constructive thread to me

[06:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: the issue is that the spec allows the immutable prefixes on element nodes participate in the lookup

[06:38:02.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: then we don't have interop and writing the spec is a waste of time

[06:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: but after reading over his other recent emails, I decided not to apply

[06:38:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: so even if you mutate xmlns:* attrs in script, the immutable prefixes in node names still interfere with the lookup

[06:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I guess I don't understand the use cases for lookupNamespaceURI enough to understand why that's a problem

[06:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
the html5 spec uses lookupNamespaceURI for defining innerHTML in XML

[06:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
that's the only use case i'm aware of

[06:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
isDefaultNamespace in Gecko is implemented so that it agrees with lookupNamespaceURI(null)

[06:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
which is sane

[06:40:03.0000] <zcorpan>
so i guess lookupNamespaceURI should make things serialize sanely in innerHTML

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: the use cases are basically anti-patterny to begin with

[06:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: isn't that putting the cart before the horse? it seems like step 1 is to determine how an XML DOM in this state should serialize for innerHTML, and step 2 is to determine whether lookupNamespaceURI is useful for specifying that behavior

[06:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: since lookupNamespaceURI makes sense for qnames-in-content

[06:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: so the spec sucks when you try to create synthetic DOMs with qnames-in-content and the same prefixes in parser-created pre-mutation parts

[06:44:01.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: true

[06:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: Hixie just took the easy course and made it my problem when i asked questions about namespace declarations in innerHTML

[06:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: hearing the problem statement just names me hate Namespaces in XML more

[06:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
is there any kind of protection against the abuse of role="presentation" by authors who don't really know what they're doing? Given that it's supposed to be to inform UAs not to report the element to accessibility APIs, what if an author does <body role="presentation">?

[06:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: I guess the specific question raised by hsivonen's mutated DOM scenario is - let's say you have a node with prefix "foo", local name "bar", namespace URI "http://foo.com/" created by the parser, then using DOM manipulation you give it an xmlns:foo="http://something-else" attribute

[06:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
how should innerHTML serialize that?

[06:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: that's what i asked Hixie

[06:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I'm not only hearing the problem. I'm on hook for implementing it!

[06:47:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
You're allowed to change namespace prefixes to serialize the DOM, so however you want, provided the element has the same local anme and namespace URI, no?

[06:48:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
s/anme/name/

[06:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: I assume qnames-in-content is the issue

[06:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: mutating a DOM to rebind parser-created prefixes, so that you can use lookupNamespaceURI to process QNames in content, sounds like a giant pile of bad

[06:48:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: changing specs to make that marginally less terrible doesn't seem very useful

[06:48:04.0000] <jgraham>
s/ mutating a DOM to rebind parser-created 

[06:48:05.0000] <jgraham>
                     prefixes, so that you can use lookupNamespaceURI to 

[06:48:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Where guarantees that that can roundtrip?

[06:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
as far as i'm concerned i would be happy to drop lookupNamespaceURI

[06:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
                     process QNames in content/namespaces in XML/

[06:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: if you want a synthetic DOM to be isolated from parser artifacts, you can always make a new document, or a detached DOM subtree, for your namespace processing

[06:49:03.0000] <jgraham>
(sorry)

[06:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: no protection. ARIA provides all the rope to shoot your users in the foot

[06:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders|work: I suspect if browsers don't serialize that weirdo case in the same way, there will be interop problems down the road

[06:50:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: I don't think they exist. But nevertheless some stuff depend on qnames in content roundtripping

[06:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: what kind of rope can you use to shoot people in the foot? <rope role="bullet">?

[06:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: yeah

[06:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I think elementree ha[s|d] problems with this since it didn't preserve namespace prefixes by default

[06:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
)

[06:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I suspect we'll have to put in some kind of heuristics in WebKit to not always respect role="presentation" if it starts getting used in bad ways

[06:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
my guess is that some people using HTML for presentation slides will misuse role=presentation in their pages

[07:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Opera and WebKit are so compliant they don't even hard-wire "xml" and "xmlns"

[07:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I'm surprised any editor would output this: <img src="file:///Volumes/koti/hsivonen/Pictures/koli/2009-07-21T14-48-54.jpg" alt="">

jgraham: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-canvas-api/2009JulSep/0000.html

[08:56:00.0000] <smedero>
was canvas API discussion always suppose to be directed over there? if so I missed the memo.

[08:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
smedero: I think it was a failed experiment

[09:00:00.0000] <smedero>
ahh MikeSmith created it back in March 2008: "The list was created to facilitate focused discussion on the canvas API and to encourage participation in that discussion from graphics experts and others who may not be members of the HTML working group (and may not want to be)."

[09:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
This weekend was a great crash course in HTML5.

[09:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hey, it made me learn something too.

[09:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I went and reviewed the <article> semantics again, which was useful, and will also be adding a "skip nav" link to my sites today.

[09:07:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, and don't forget to label your <nav> with some type of heading.

[09:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I prefer to do that anyway, so that's good.

[09:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm still not sure where to place certain h2 elements.  We have company name -> community name -> page name, I know where to put company name and page title, but i don't know where to put the community name.  Also, I'll have to look into how Google would parse my site with all these newly introduced h1s.

[09:15:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
othermaciej: ping

[09:18:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://pastebin.org/9738 --- after many discussions.

[09:19:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And I still haven't added the accessibility links, since I think they're not supposed to go in the actual nav.

[09:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Do you mean the skipnav links?

[09:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, they should just be the very first focusable thing in the page.

[09:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I really like the idea of the link that hides until it's focused, but is positioned off-screen so that pointing devices *can't* focus it even accidentally.

I think so.

/me was trying to experiment with meeting WCAG2 requirements with figure and details, but was getting stuck on the bad support for "legend" in just about everything.

JonathanNeal: http://www.xanthir.com/etc/html5-example.html

[09:37:01.0000] <nvartolomei>
why we need to close script tag if he has src? :-) why not if script tag has src specified we can close it as img tag

[09:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I *think* all of my uses are right.

[09:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
nvartolomei: Because changing it would make your page disappear in legacy browsers, as they vainly search for a closing tag and instead just treat the entire page as the contents of the <script> block.

[09:39:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, your outline shows a few untitled sections but you validate.

[09:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, not quite.  I'm exposing <style> in the <body>.

[09:41:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
You still validated.

[09:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Using what validator?

[09:43:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://html5.validator.nu/

[09:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I get an error there - it's complaining about my second <style> block

[09:45:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's funny 'cause it reports validity to me :-P

[09:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
How... strange.

[09:47:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm still miffed about the recommended usage of h1-6 tags within all articles / sections, especially when the h# resets itself.  You end up with http://pastie.org/585996

[09:48:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, ha, it was reporting validity because I was giving it the outerliner page outling your url

[09:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hehe.

[09:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, what do you mean about the recommend h1-6 usage?

[09:49:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well @ http://pastie.org/585999 I have three h1 tags.

[09:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah?

[09:50:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Because I was told that <section> elements should reset the # on h#.

[09:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Essentially, yeah.  They 'scope' <hn> elements, at least, so you can use <h1> without fear of it clobbering your outline.

[09:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is there a problem with that?

[09:52:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Is there documentation specifically on how h elements are scoped?

[09:52:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
They seem to be scoped on article, nav, and section elements.

[09:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
They're scoped on "sectioning elements".

[09:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which is precisely those that you mentioned, I believe.

[09:54:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Docs that describe this?

[09:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
One sec...

[09:54:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
particularly how to use this

[09:54:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
In my drafts I try to back everything up with docs.

[09:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dom.html#sectioning-content

[09:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<aside> is also on the list.

[10:02:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So --- "article", "aside", "nav", (and) "section" (elements may have) a heading and an outline (and redefine) the scope of headings and footers.

[10:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[10:03:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
However, look @ http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#sectioning-root

[10:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, right, good catch.  Those four elements also scope headings, they just don't contribute to their parent's outline.

[10:05:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And they do say "Sections may contain headings of any rank, but   authors are strongly encouraged to either use only h1   elements, or to use elements of the appropriate rank   for the section's nesting level."

[10:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[10:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just because it's confusing to mix them up, even if technically produces a correct outline.

[10:06:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, while that first example is okay, it would have been better to use an h1 element inside the section element?

[10:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>

Does anyone know if / how this affects Google's page crawling?

[10:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I dunno.  :/

[10:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses Hixie does, and he probably can't say

[10:10:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Got it.  Well, I'll be back after I make the drive to work.

[10:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's one of those things that really *does* need to be made public, though.  There's SEO folk wisdom that using too many <h1>s causes google to downrank you.

[10:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Do you know anything about the effects on Google ranking of switching to using only <h1>s?  And can you say anything about it?

[10:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Details aren't all that important, just a yes/no to "Does that hurt us?"

[10:16:00.0000] <miketaylr>
TabAtkins: I recall seeing this video from the Google Webmaster Central Channel...http://www.viget.com/inspire/ending-the-great-h1-debate/

[10:16:01.0000] <miketaylr>
but I find the answer somewhat ambiguous

[10:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that's useful, but not useful *enough*.

[10:17:01.0000] <miketaylr>
I agree.

[10:17:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
'cause the html5 advice *is* to use <h1> all over the page.

[10:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thanks for that, though.  It didn't show up in my search.

Yo.

[11:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
How do you folks feel about this?  Is this proper HTML5 usage?

[11:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: Did you mean to post a link?

where can i find discussion of nesting <form> elements in html5 vs html4?

[12:08:01.0000] <jablko>
am having trouble finding a link...

[12:14:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
jablko, I wouldn't know for sure, but perhaps @ http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/ ?

[12:15:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And then also @ http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html

[12:20:00.0000] <jablko>
JonathanNeal: thanks - i looked in those places without success

[12:52:00.0000] <smedero>
jablko: do you mean nesting a <form> inside another <form> element? or do you mean nesting elements like <input>, <select>, <textarea>, <button>, etc inside a <form>?

[12:53:00.0000] <jablko>
smedero: nesting a <form> inside another <form> element

[12:56:00.0000] <smedero>

[12:56:01.0000] <smedero>
Content model:

[12:56:02.0000] <smedero>
Flow content, but with no form element descendants.

[12:57:00.0000] <smedero>
HTML 3, 4 and XHTML 1 I think also explicitly said something about such constructions not being valid. I have _zero_ idea about UA support.

[12:58:00.0000] <jablko>
huh - i thought a difference between html 4 and 5 was 5 allowed nested <form> elements...

[12:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not <form> elements, but you can have form element elements (heh) outside the form element they belong to

[12:59:01.0000] <smedero>
I suppose you could use the new @form 

[12:59:02.0000] <smedero>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#attr-fae-form

[13:01:00.0000] <jablko>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#association-of-controls-and-forms

[13:01:01.0000] <jablko>
A form-associated element is, by default, associated with its nearest ancestor form element (as described below), but may have a form attribute specified to override this.

[13:02:00.0000] <jablko>
mistook that to mean there could be multiple ancestor form elments

[13:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
shepazu, why not focus on DOM3Events? isn't that in much more need of maintenance than <canvas>?

[13:24:02.0000] <annevk2>
shepazu, I mean, of the things that delay HTML5 I think DOM3Events would come first

ojan: ok my plan is to remove UndoManager, leave everything else that's in the spec in the spec, and add no new features for now regarding editing

[13:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: if julie sends me info, i'll integrate it when i get it

[13:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, made a little bit progress on figuring out something better btw

[13:53:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, for encodings

[13:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[13:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: My advice, FWIW, in the short term, would be to revert the change to UTS22

[13:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
what did it say before?

[13:55:00.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: yeah, UndoManager would need some work. the info from julie will likely include recommended new execcommands, but otherwise will just be a documentation of what current word processors do with recommendations for what should be done.

[13:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, no, what it said before is wrong too

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: But is it not closer?

[13:57:01.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, no

[13:57:02.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, it's more or less the same

[13:57:03.0000] <annevk2>
it said to ignore all whitespace and punctuation characters in ASCII

[13:57:04.0000] <annevk2>
which is wrong

[13:58:00.0000] <annevk2>
likely, only whitespace needs to be trimmed at the start and end, and it needs to be compared in an ASCII case-insensitive manner

[14:00:00.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: I think what's there now is fine. Eventually, I don't think the behavior of the execCommands should be UA dependent though, at least not as much as is currently UA dependent.

[14:00:01.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, it's nearly useless :(

[14:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>

Sex, drugs, rock and roll.

pretty dominant "culture" in general actually

annevk2: still people confuse pilgrim with something like pigrim :)

[15:01:00.0000] <krijnh>
Perhaps due to those movies, but still

[15:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Not quite.  I found "anne" confusing, precisely *because* it's a common name over here, but pretty much solely for females.

[15:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: It's rare as a male name, though… which means it is a rare name :P

Bah, okay.

You'd be amazed how many people misspell "Geoffrey"

krijnh, hmm, I'd like to compete

[15:03:01.0000] <jcranmer>

Also, apparently, a gender symbol.

For humans

I see no such restriction.

It's like using 'he' as a gender neutral pronoun.

No such thing.  Those gender symbols are all perfectly fine for other lifeforms.

[16:45:00.0000] <vvv>
So there's no difference?

[16:45:01.0000] <annevk2>
"add examples here" haha

[16:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
vvv: there is a minor difference, but since you're asking which it is, i was wondering what you thought the difference was :-)

[16:46:00.0000] <vvv>
Hixie: no, I just noticed the inconsistence

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
vvv: (the minor difference is related to what is allowed in the query component of the string in documents whose character encoding is not UTF-8)

[16:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
vvv: the one that says "IRI" is non-normative, so it's trying to explain what's expected

[16:47:00.0000] <annevk2>
is that really a difference? for an absolute URL I would assume that would be normalized to percent-encoded stuff which makes it a valid IRI

[16:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
vvv: the one that says "valid absolute URL" is normative, and it has to handle the weird edge cases

[16:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: URL in HTML5 currently is a superset of IRI

[16:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: i'm waiting for the IRI spec to fix the definition of IRI so i can just use "IRI"

[16:47:04.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, but input type=url is about submission

[16:47:05.0000] <annevk2>
hmm

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes?

[16:48:01.0000] <annevk2>
so a) what is submitted can always be a valid IRI and b) we could even make it always UTF-8

[16:48:02.0000] <annevk2>
b) would make a lot of sense for an IRI value to be honest

[16:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
though supposedly it might get mangled by the form encoding hmm

[16:49:01.0000] <annevk2>
rather than the document encoding

[16:49:02.0000] <annevk2>
maybe URI would be simpler :)

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
no doubt it would be simpler

[16:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's a "valid absolute URL" because that's what it has to be for the value="" attribute

[16:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
and i don't want to end up in the very confusing situation of what is allowed in value="" and what is allowed in .value being different

[16:52:00.0000] <annevk2>
but you could force the encoding flag

[16:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mena?

[16:52:02.0000] <annevk2>
that value is always parsed with HREF-charset set to UTF-8

[16:52:03.0000] <annevk2>
though if accept-charset is not some Unicode thingie it might get lost anyway

[16:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
the value is parsed by the html parser, unless i'm very confused

[16:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i really don't understand what you're proposing

[16:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
if you set href dynamically it isn't, but I suppose it doesn't really matter

[16:54:01.0000] <annevk2>
people should just use UTF-8

[16:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
what is href in this context?

[16:55:00.0000] <annevk2>
s/href/the value attribute/

[16:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
k... i guess if you think something should change, file a bug :-)

[16:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
and explain why it should change

[16:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[16:57:00.0000] <annevk2>
i thought there was an issue for a while if you have accept-charset set to iso-8859-1 or something, but then realized that it wouldn't be a new problem

[16:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[16:58:00.0000] <annevk2>
but clearly, I should get some sleep :)

[17:17:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Do some of you folks work on the whatwg project?

[17:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
this _is_ the whatwg project

[17:20:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Nice.

[17:23:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Now we're moving to the second portion of the HTML5 adoption, which is applying it to our latest out-of-the-box theme.  I have an example @ http://madison.thewikies.com/html5/liferay/

[17:24:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm still working on getting the code for our div based columns.  So I know I'm losing everything inside the tables.

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
o_O

[17:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
now leif is suggesting ARIA should be used by non-ATs

[17:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
going directly contrary to the point of ARIA...

[18:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
well this is dumb

[18:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
the way i designed the database API, you can't know whether you need to create the tables or not

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
<-- dumb

[18:49:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, does [6.11.9 History Traversal] occur on all page loads, even if I type straight into the URL bar?

[18:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[18:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
it is invoked as part of the navigation algorithm

[18:49:03.0000] <jlebar>
So is popstate fired on all loads?

[18:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
no

[18:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
only if there is state to pop

[18:50:00.0000] <jlebar>
Only if the state to pop is non-null?

[18:50:01.0000] <jlebar>
I could set the document pending object to null as part of the algorithm.

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
hold on

[18:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: ok, here now. looking...

[18:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: popstate only fires when an entry in the session history is activated

[18:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: which only occurs if the specified entry is a state object or the first entry for a Document

[18:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: but yes, it fires at least once per Document load

[18:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/but/so/

[18:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
my statement earlier was incorrect

[18:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: sorry about that!

[19:01:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, sorry, was afk for a sec.  I'm not totally clear on this: If we load index.html and then go to index.html#foo, do we get one or two popstates?

[19:02:00.0000] <jlebar>
Once for the initial document load...

[19:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
one

[19:02:02.0000] <jlebar>
I see.

[19:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
you get one for the page load

[19:02:04.0000] <jlebar>
And if we go back to index.html, we also don't get a popstate, because index.html doesn't have an associated state object.

[19:02:05.0000] <Hixie>
right

[19:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
er

[19:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
well actually...

[19:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks closer

[19:03:03.0000] <jlebar>
:)

[19:03:04.0000] <Hixie>
actually yes, you do

[19:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
you always get a popstate when traversing to the first entry in the history for a Document

[19:03:06.0000] <jlebar>
/me is relieved.

[19:03:07.0000] <jlebar>
Oh...interesting.

[19:03:08.0000] <Hixie>
not sure that's entirely sane

[19:03:09.0000] <Hixie>
but it's what it says

[19:03:10.0000] <jlebar>
Me either.

[19:04:00.0000] <jlebar>
I've been dispatching popstate whenever we dispatch onload, and also when you go back/forwards to any history entry.

[19:05:00.0000] <jlebar>
That might be easier for developers to deal with, since it's somewhat consistent.

[19:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
the original intent was to only dispatch it when hitting an entry that has been pushState()d

[19:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
i am not sure why we dispatch for the initial page load

[19:05:03.0000] <jlebar>
I think because you want to know when you go back to it?

[19:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
i guess, yeah

[19:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that makes sense

[19:06:01.0000] <jlebar>
So it treats the first history entry for a document as one which was pushState()ed to.

[19:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
right

[19:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
that makes sense i guess

[19:06:04.0000] <jlebar>
maybe?  :)

[19:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[19:06:06.0000] <Hixie>
so the only entries for which you don't fire a popstate per spec are those that were added due to the hash changing

[19:06:07.0000] <Hixie>
(they get a hashchange)

[19:07:00.0000] <jlebar>
I see.  That might be a little confusing, because clearstate does clear those.

[19:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that was a recent change

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
iirc

[19:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
or at least, that wasn't my original intent

[19:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
thing is, if we do fire popstate for everything

[19:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
then authors are going to have to distinguish the state=null-because-first case from the state=null-because-hashchange-will-fire-next case

[19:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
and that's probably harder than just dealing with those two cases

[19:10:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hm...  I'm not yet convinced that matters.  Wouldn't they listen to popstate alone in that case?

[19:11:00.0000] <jlebar>
* rephrased: If they just ignore hashchanges, do they care about differentiating between them?

[19:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
if they don't distinguish them, then each time the user changes the hash manually, the page is going to reset to the initial state

[19:11:02.0000] <jlebar>
Hmm

[19:13:00.0000] <jlebar>
/me wonders how this would change if we had a setState() function.  Then you *could* associate state with the initial entry.

[19:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
true

[19:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it's easy enough to remember the state for the initial state

[19:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, what they _should_ do is if state is null, or if hashchange is called, just base the state on the url

[19:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess we could call popstate always

[19:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
do any other UAs implement this yet?

[19:15:03.0000] <jlebar>
That's how I've been imagining it working.  That way you can bookmark the page and it'll do the right thing.

[19:15:04.0000] <jlebar>
I'm not aware of any other UAs working on this.

[19:15:05.0000] <Hixie>
try e-mailing the list and seeing what others think of it

[19:16:00.0000] <jlebar>
Will do.

[19:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
if it's not too late for shipped implementations, i can change it to just always fire popstate

[19:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
my contribution to the web: events firing all the damn time. :-/

[19:16:03.0000] <jlebar>
Okay.  I'll try and send out an e-mail soon.  I have a few other things in there, but they don't require the Author to parse the spec for me.  :)

[19:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
i guess nothing i've done with events is as bad as mutation events, still

[19:16:05.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: k :-)

[19:17:00.0000] <jlebar>
Thanks, Hixie.

/me wonders why adding features to the web platform feels like a continuous exercise in damage mitigation

[19:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's like trying to build a sandcastle under a waterfall

[19:18:00.0000] <jlebar>
lol.  And you have four large, powerful groups of people all telling you that they don't like the shape of your crenelations.

[19:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
fan more than four

[19:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
far, even

[19:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's the IETF people, the accessibility people, microsoft, google, apple, mozilla, opera, the TAG, the RDFa people...

[19:19:02.0000] <jlebar>
Yeah.  I'm only just beginning to get into this, but...I don't envy that.

[19:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
eh, the sad thing is i enjoy it

[19:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm a sucker i guess :-P

[19:20:02.0000] <jlebar>

shepazu: xhr was part of html5

[22:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
it was the first spec to be spun off

[23:13:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hello all.

[23:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know how focus and blur events work on Window objects?

[23:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think they fire based on the window gaining or losing focus

[23:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
more detail than that, I don't know

[23:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll look into it on wednesday

[23:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
bed now

[23:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[23:37:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Night, Hixie.

[23:39:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
focus is when a particular element is active, like when a link is selected and has that little dotted outline in firefox, or when your mouse is pressed inside an input element and the text cursor is flashing, when you "enter" that element, that is focus.

[23:39:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Blur is the opposite and occurs only when you leave a particular element.

[23:40:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
oh geez, you asked about window objects, not elements.

[23:40:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
If you're talking about the window that shows you the body of the page, then it works the same as the elements.

[23:41:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
when the window is active and when you're on the tab of that particular page, it's active.  

[23:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
you have to actively leave the tab by switching to another one or minimizing the window to trigger blur.

[00:39:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: XHR came to W3C long before HTML5 did... with regards to the Rec track, it's not a "spin-off" in that sense

[00:41:00.0000] <annevk2>
not that long

[00:41:01.0000] <annevk2>
less than a year

[00:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
and it did came out of what became known as HTML5 later

[00:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
it's even part of the acknowledgments

[00:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thinks the maturity level req for normative references is entirely unhelpful

[00:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
XMLHttpRequest is not moving that fast at the moment

[00:53:01.0000] <annevk2>
mostly awaiting more impl feedback

[00:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: it was spun off before WHATWG Web Apps 1.0 was officially adopted as W3C HTML5

[00:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: it somewhat makes sense to me that, if you normatively depend on an unstable spec, it's dubious to declare yourself frozen

[00:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: but since Web technology has turned out to be a web of specs and not a hierarchy, it does seem like it could impede progress

[01:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: implementations aren't going to stabilize at a point where they are only implementing RECs

[01:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: that tends to undermine the idea of RECs at all

[01:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: instead, any particular piece of the platform may advance ahead of components that rely on the service the piece provides

[01:02:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure what the right process is for Web standards

[01:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I'm not a believer in RECs, either.

[01:02:04.0000] <othermaciej>
implementations move too fast

[01:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for the traditional standards process

[01:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but never stabilizing anything also seems like a bad idea

[01:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it makes sense to stabilize stuff, but making spec division as granular as actual stability would be prohibitively bureaucratic

[01:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
we'd have on W3C doc per DOM method

[01:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
s/on/one/

[01:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
even the WHATWG section-level stability isn't quite granular enough to annotate real implementation stability

[01:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I rather like the analogy Hixie made with U.S. Code

[01:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
probably still more practical than doing it per-method

[01:08:00.0000] <annevk2>
shepazu, please...

[01:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
(re latest email)

[01:16:00.0000] <shepazu>
annevk2: what? you raised a totally pedantic point that wasn't even correct, nor was it pertinent to the subject at hand... you expected a serious reply?

[01:18:00.0000] <annevk2>
dream on

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
shepazu: what was annevk2's pedantic point?

[01:20:00.0000] <shepazu>
the same as hixie's, naturally... to which I'd already replied in this channel

[01:27:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm

[01:27:01.0000] <annevk2>
the WHATWG twitter account is no longer updated?

[01:28:00.0000] <annevk2>
probably a problem with twitter I suppose :/

[01:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: the original contents of the W3C XHR spec were once in "Web Apps 1.0", which at the time was known unofficially as HTML5 and now is known officially as HTML5

[01:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: I'm not sure what your goal is in casting doubt on that record

[02:16:00.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: "casting doubt on that record"? I laid it out explicitly... you might as well ask what anne's point was in claiming XHR originated with the HTML5 spec... it's totally irrelevant to the explanation I was making for Shelley about what the relationship of specs on the Rec-track are

[02:17:00.0000] <annevk5>
I was just making a small nit about your statement being the editor of XMLHttpRequest and all

[02:17:01.0000] <shepazu>
why is it always a political debate when someone gets off the party line?

[02:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: the part of your email he quoted said "XmlHttpRequest (XHR) spec, which was never part of HTML5"

[02:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think he just gave a simple factual correction, from his perspective

[02:17:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't believe anyone but you is making it political

[02:17:05.0000] <shepazu>
pft.

[02:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it was a side point which I don't think invalidates the rest of your comments

[02:19:00.0000] <aho>
void save(); // push state on state stack

[02:19:01.0000] <aho>
void restore(); // pop state stack and restore state

[02:19:02.0000] <aho>
why aren't these called push and pop?

[02:19:03.0000] <aho>
save and restore makes it sound like there can be only one state

[02:19:04.0000] <shepazu>

jgraham, Philip`: did either of you happen to implement the DOM APIs for microdata for your demos? I'm wanting to do a microdata experiment but am too lazy to implement the API myself

[02:23:01.0000] <annevk5>
sicking, I think another important reason for alt= has been search engines

[02:24:00.0000] <shepazu>
 <META NAME="generator" CONTENT="Web Studio, Version 4.0 for Windows">

[02:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: No, mine is python based

[02:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
so it doesn't really have a concept of DOM

[02:38:01.0000] <foolip>
too bad

[02:38:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`'s was js based though. I don't know if he tried implementing the DOM APIs 

[02:39:00.0000] <foolip>
I'll have a look then

[02:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: do search engines read alt?

annevk2: I wonder why it has not become a search engine spam vector (or maybe it has)

[02:46:00.0000] <annevk5>
othermaciej, I think it's in every SEO text book (not that I ever read one)

[02:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on the codec topic: did VLC regress or remove Dirac support?

[03:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
so Firefox does support ISO88599 unlike IE but like Chromium and Opera

[03:41:01.0000] <annevk5>
but it does not support ISO-8859_9 unlike IE, Chromium and Opera

[03:50:00.0000] <aho>
how about ISO-8859-9? :>

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk5>
including the question mark? </smart-ass>

[03:51:01.0000] <aho>
wouldnt be a question then, would it? :P

[03:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
you win :)

[05:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What are the non-aria uses of role now that xhtml2 is going away?

[05:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: none

[05:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses Hixie is sleeping

[05:52:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Then what's up with the role vs aria-role thread?

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
I don't think everyone is in agreement that role="" is just for WAI-ARIA

[05:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: role is an inconsistent name when everything else in ARIA has the aria-* prefix

[05:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: it sucks, but it's too late. not too serious to worry about, IMO.

[05:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: who disagrees except the XHTML2 WG?

[05:55:01.0000] <annevk5>
The people who brought it up I assume

[05:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But nobody knows here what other uses are being considered?

[05:59:00.0000] <annevk5>
I don't fully understand what they want

[06:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand that thread at all. Jim stated in his e-mail about it that "ARIA roles are not the *only* use of the role attribute", and regardless of whether that's true or not, it refutes his own argument for making it aria specific

[06:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
non-ARIA uses of role are handled by class :-)

[06:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
<element element-role="div">

[06:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think he wants aria-role and role so that you can have <input type=checkbox aria-role=radio role=url>

[09:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.w3.org/mid/op.uyupstgqidj3kv⊙sl

[09:14:00.0000] <annevk2>
back to ABNF?

[09:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
or XML BNF or whatever it is

[09:15:01.0000] <zcorpan>
it's XML 1.0 EBNF

[09:16:00.0000] <annevk2>
so the new rule is not matching the EBNF is ignoring the entire PI?

[09:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[09:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
plus duplicate pseudo-attribute and &#x0;

[09:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
XML infoset? :/

[09:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the wg doesn't like having it defined in terms of the dom, because not all impl use a dom...

[09:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
but they were fine with infoset

[09:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, it also doesn't define impl requirements anymore it seems

[09:21:01.0000] <annevk2>
e.g. section 5 seems more like a description for authors than implementors

[09:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://simon.html5.org/specs/xml-stylesheet5 is nicer :)

[09:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me is somewhat positively surprised with http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/http-state/current/msg00191.html

[09:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8206280.stm

[09:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith in particular should take note of the guy's name

[09:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
"Professor Robert Smith? (the question mark is part of his surname and not a typographical mistake) ..." - That guy must have had some weird parents to have given him a question mark in his name

[09:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Given that it is to distinguish him from the more famous Robert Smith I guess he got his name changed

[09:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
Kinda like Mike(TM)Smith but moreso

[09:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
I hadn't read that far through the article to see that yet

[09:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
So I guess he added it himself

[09:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
n00b

[09:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: It's a shame the study uses such a flawed model

[09:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Pretty basic mistake, too, I wonder how they missed it

[09:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: fixed the charref issue

[10:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: I assume the study was designed to give the publicity-happy result

[10:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although that may be unduly cynical, it is worth noting that it is by someone who thought that doing a study on disease propogation using zombies was a good idea and who appended a question mark to their name

[10:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So you believe that in a model where zombies can't re-reanimate, humans and zombies could coexist peacefully?

[10:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, good enough to make BBC News

[10:08:01.0000] <annevk5>
apparently :)

[10:08:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Props to BBC for finding a guy smart enough to point out the obvious flaw in the study :)

[10:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: "silly season"

[10:11:01.0000] <annevk5>
which reminds me, where is RB?

[10:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk2: don't summon him please

[10:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
I have to say that every time Dmitry Titov posts I have a momentary panic that it is Dmitry Turin

[10:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
foolip, gonna blog about http://twitter.com/foolip/status/3384463111 ?

[10:19:00.0000] <foolip>
annevk5: maybe after a finish an experiment with the Microdata DOM API (which I have to implement first)

[10:19:01.0000] <foolip>
s/a/I/

[10:20:00.0000] <foolip>
(in JS that is, not in browser)

[10:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"If current node is a pre, textarea, or listing element, append a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character." — does anything do that?

[10:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
As far as I can tell nothing does that

[10:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Doesn't seem worth worrying about unless it causes compat issues

[10:25:01.0000] <annevk5>
but things probably should because otherwise we lose a \n each time it's parsed and then serialized

[10:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
and then parsed again, doh

[10:26:01.0000] <annevk5>
foolip, k

[10:41:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Goodmorning!

[10:41:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: a difference with parsing into the element itself when setting innerHTML (instead of doing what the spec says): <pre>.innerHTML = '\nx'

[10:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Good evening JonathanNeal

[10:52:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hello all.

[10:52:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I mean, goodevening Lachy.

[10:56:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Where are you based?

[11:01:00.0000] <miketaylr>
it's lunch time over here, so good afternoon JonathanNeal 

[11:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Goodevening Lachy and goodafternoon miketaylr.

[11:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
i18n('greeting')

[11:12:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Thanks for all of your guys help so far, I'm making good progress with http://madison.thewikies.com/html5/liferay/ and I'll be working on the core of the portal to have the default unstyled theme be an HTML5 semantic document. 

[11:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
JonathanNeal, I'm in Norway

[11:50:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Groovy.

[13:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hi everyone

[13:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yo, Maciej

[15:26:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hi othermaciej, delayed.

[15:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: I tried starting to implement the microdata DOM stuff, before deciding it required more effort and knowledge than I wanted to bother with

[16:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries to work out how to change Google from its silly geolocated Spanish default into English

[16:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me fails, since he doesn't know the Spanish for "English"

[16:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Aha, got it now, by going through Hebrew and Pirate

[16:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
Dashiva, took a few minutes to hack this together before going to bed: http://dump.testsuite.org/2009/encoding-matching/runtests.htm

[16:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me wonders if contentDocument works in IE8

[16:21:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
FAIL

[16:21:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
annevk5 doesn't like me.

[16:21:02.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk5: The iframe is so tiny!

[16:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip: Hahaha.  It's "ingles", by the way (there's an accent in there, but irrelevant here).

[16:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
Dashiva, the frame is not really relevant

[16:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wishes you could tell what you failed/passed

[16:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk5: You might have to use contentWindow.document

[16:24:02.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, I thought of adding titles

[16:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Ah, right - I had no chance if it didn't begin with "E"

[16:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
now it reports the title and uses contentWindow

[16:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Hmm, or no

[16:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh, as long as you can read the alphabet, most languages translate English relatively understandably.  It *does* mean you may have to read through a whole list of unknown foreign words, though.

[16:26:03.0000] <Dashiva>
That wasn't the problem, it's the onload that doesn't fire

[16:27:00.0000] <annevk5>
ok, I'll change some things

[16:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Apparently it doesn't support onload, only attachEvent with load?

[16:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Or you can use the onload attribute

[16:31:00.0000] <annevk5>
try it now?

[16:33:00.0000] <annevk5>
can't believe this is taking more than 30 minutes

[16:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, it's running now

[16:35:00.0000] <annevk5>
cool

[16:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Could you include a \n in the output? :)

[16:35:02.0000] <annevk5>
you mean \r then?

[16:35:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, right. Yeah.

[16:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
God, the /r/n debacle is one of the most nonsensical interop failures ever.

[16:36:01.0000] <annevk5>
done

[16:36:02.0000] <annevk5>
can't believe IE still hasn't fixed that

[16:36:03.0000] <annevk5>
well I can

[16:36:04.0000] <annevk5>
it just annoys me

[16:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
WTf... it's still all on one line

[16:38:00.0000] <annevk5>
ok, i'll fix that too before I go to sleep

[16:38:01.0000] <annevk5>
hold on

[16:38:02.0000] <Dashiva>
They don't appear if I alert document.body.innerHTML either

[16:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
reload

[16:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
works

[16:41:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Now it just needs color coding in the list and you're done ;P

[16:41:02.0000] <annevk5>
mwaha, guess what finger I'm holding up :p

[16:41:03.0000] <annevk5>
anyway, thanks for the help, much appreciated :)

[16:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
25-27 all fail, by the way

[16:42:01.0000] <annevk5>
ah interesting

[16:42:02.0000] <annevk5>
I wonder why the other browsers recognize those aliases

[16:42:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, there's a bug

[16:42:04.0000] <Dashiva>
...

[16:42:05.0000] <annevk5>
...

[16:42:06.0000] <Dashiva>
No, that's just me needing sleep

[16:42:07.0000] <annevk5>
profit

[16:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I get a fail on 25 and 27 on FF 3.5.2

[16:43:01.0000] <annevk5>
me too

[16:43:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Opera fails 001... wtf

[16:43:03.0000] <annevk5>
TabAtkins, yeah me too, not entirely unexpected, with the last few I was just playing around

[16:43:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Plenty of others, too.  But just saying that "the other browsers" don't recognize those.

[16:43:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, kk.

[16:43:06.0000] <annevk5>
Dashiva, we don't alias ISO-8859-9 to Windows-1254 yet

[16:43:07.0000] <annevk5>
filed a bug on it today

[16:43:08.0000] <Dashiva>
Opera passes 25-27, though. Heh.

[16:44:00.0000] <annevk5>
Firefox doesn't do that either, hence it failing tests

[16:44:01.0000] <annevk5>
if it did that it would pass mosts

[16:45:00.0000] <annevk5>
anyway, nn

[16:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
nn

[16:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
nn = nighty night, right?

[16:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
never normalize

[16:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, makes sense.

[16:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
wtf, php.  It's telling me that it's max int is 2^31, as expected, and that is uses 4-bit ints.  But it's also storing and showing me the number 11billion, which should require 34 bits to store.

[16:49:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
annevk5: are you looking for results of those encoding tests?

[16:49:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
if so, which browsers?

[16:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I think he has all he needs for now

[16:50:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
ok

[16:50:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
what do they test?

[16:50:03.0000] <Dashiva>
charset parsing and aliasing, as far as I know

[16:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's what it looks like, yah.

[16:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
mpilgrim: When will the first chapter of your new book be ready? :)

[16:51:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
TabAtkins: It implicitly converts from ints to floats as needed

[16:51:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
as soon as i finish the last book

[16:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me chuckles at 4-bit ints

[16:52:01.0000] <gsnedders_>
/me noticed that too :)

[16:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  Then how is it keeping accuracy?  Just checked against my lisp implementation the value of a 7-digit number in base 32 (relevant to what I'm doing), and PHP and Lisp agree.

[16:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And I know Lisp uses bigints.

[16:54:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
(the max 7-digit value, that is)

[16:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think my PHP is secretly using 8B ints and lying to me.

[16:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me just got what Dashiva and gsnedders were chuckling at.

[16:55:02.0000] <Dashiva>
mpilgrim: You note that Opera doesn't support text in ch4, but one of the examples earlier in the chapter uses text (and thus doesn't match the text in Opera)

[16:55:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
yes

[16:55:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
the print edition will obviously use static images

[16:56:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i tried to be up-front about it in each section

[16:56:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
if your browser has an "x", the section examples may not make sense

[16:56:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
might end up using static images for the online edition too, and having separate example pages

[16:56:03.0000] <Dashiva>
*nod*

[16:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Just thought this might be confusing since the x for text won't appear for another few scrolls

[17:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, I always forget that people on the list are actually the bloggers I read regularly.

[17:17:00.0000] <hober>
how do you delete a page on the wiki?

[17:17:01.0000] <hober>
specifically, http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Different_Types_of_Ugg_Boots

[17:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Only sysops can delete

[17:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
hober, I can make you a sysop. What's you're wiki username?

[17:31:00.0000] <hober>
EdwardOConnor

[17:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
hober, done

[17:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
I already deleted that page and blocked the user, though

[17:40:00.0000] <hober>
thanks, and thanks

[18:13:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Oi, I'm switching our layouts to divs, it's madness.

[18:13:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Esp. when we should have a 960 grid available.

[18:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm, JonathanNeal?

[18:59:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'll show you in a bit.

[20:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's kind of wrong that the HTML5 Cheat Sheet is a PDF

[20:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That... is kind of wrong.

[20:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But then again, isn't it designed to be printed?  PDF is an output format.

[23:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
quiet day here today

[00:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
are there any processing requirements for <article pubdate="..."> other than reflecting the markup attribute in the DOM as a string?

[00:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is this for real: http://diveintohtml5.org/ ?

[00:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if so, yay!

[01:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I believe it is real

[01:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I was wondering who'd be the one to write the O'Reilly book

[01:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
great to see it's mpilgrim_ 

[01:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I kinda love the old timey typesetting features

[01:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: have you had a chance to read the PFWG's comments on ARIA vs host semantics?

[01:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: not yet

[01:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I thought it looked pretty good - now reading <http://hsivonen.iki.fi/aria-html5-bis/> to see how well it aligns

[01:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I believe I developed my draft so that it addresses concerns form Michael Cooper's 4th paragraph

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I've now read http://www.w3.org/mid/4A8ADCA2.2000803⊙wo

[01:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: looks good to me

[01:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: it's not 100% aligned with your old proposal from what I can see, but generally pretty good

[01:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: the differences I see are that you suggested disallowing some role values and some states and properties completely

[01:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I can see why someone might argue the native vs. @role precedence to go the other way, but I can "live with it" either way

[01:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: for validation

[01:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: as far as I can tell, http://www.w3.org/mid/4A8ADCA2.2000803⊙wo allows making those cases non-conforming

[01:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I think the idea there is that ARIA states/properties can only be rendered nonconforming if in conflict with some native semantics

[01:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[01:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should read the email again

[01:15:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: so for example, it would be in line with what they suggest to say you can't specify aria-level on an <h1>

[01:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: but probably not in line to say it's not conforming on a <div>

[01:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: aria-hidden seems logical to me since hidden is a global attribute with conflicting semantics

[01:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
aria-datatype seems to be gone

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
@aria-hidden conflicts globally with @hidden by I imagine the idea is still to allow it everywhere

[01:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah, aria-datatype is gone, thankfully

[01:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/by/but/

[01:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
@aria-owns seems like bad mojo now that I read about it

[01:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hi MikeSmith 

[01:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but probably @aria-owns should be removed in ARIA if it is to be removed, and not by HTML5 conformance requirements

[01:20:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I agree

[01:20:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: hey

[01:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
@aria-templateid also seems to be gone

[01:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I guess aria-html5-bis is a good enough proposal until Hixie is ready to take a cut at it, despite being slightly dated now

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: the more up-to-date expression of it only exists in RELAX NG

[01:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I didn't re-express the update in prose/table form

[01:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
do you have a link to the RELAX NG version? (not that I can read RELAX NG but maybe others with an interest can)

[01:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: http://syntax.whattf.org/relaxng/aria.rnc

[01:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have confirmed that I don't understand Relax NG

[01:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: btw is it intentional that you haven't implemented the current draft alt requirements in validator.nu yet (as far as I can tell anyway)?

[01:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(it doesn't complain about missing alt even if you don't do any of the HTML5 alternative things)

[01:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: it's intentional

[01:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the latest alt thread has just made me feel more uncertain what the right thing to do with alt is

[01:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: how so?

[01:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(me too, btw)

[01:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: on the one hand, your argument that HTML5 as drafted seems at least somewhat against the spirit of ATAG2, and on the other hand, Jonas's point that alt is one of the few pieces of bolt-on accessibility that really works

[01:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: for a tool like Dreamweaver, I can accept that if the author fails to add a text alternative, it's their fault the result is nonconforming

[01:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: but that doesn't seem reasonable for something like Word's HTML converter, or the ever-popular Flickr example

[01:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for a tool like iWeb, I think it's very clear-cut that there's an error in abstraction layers if user actions cause a syntax error on the HTML level

[01:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
however, I think iWeb should still do more to badger users into creating WCAG 2-compliant content

[01:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
although there's no way for iWeb to force it

[01:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
iWeb does try to hide the underlying HTML from you

[01:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
right now it seems to put alt="" on everything

[01:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
:-(

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think it's the user's fault if the tool offered sane UI for creating accessible pages and the user didn't care

[01:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
however, I also understand why tool developers feel it's their fault if the output has syntax errors

[01:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
actually, there seem to be cases where it omits alt instead

[01:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, I'm willing to try the "missing" marker route from WAI consensus unless someone manages to point out fatal flaws with it

[01:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: what cases?

[01:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know, I'm just looking at some iWeb output, not trying to use it

[01:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.hmsbeekeeper.com/HMSB/Blog/Blog.html is made with iWeb

[01:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems to put alt="" on presentational images and no alt on actual content images

[01:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I tested iWeb 2.0.4

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the main objection to the idea of a missing marker was that it makes it more work to say the same thing as just omitting alt

[01:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: whoa! Apple shipped jsmin.c with sentence that IBM had an issue with!

[01:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me goes check if the iWeb EULA probits use for Evil

[01:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the requirement isn't carried forward to the EULA

[01:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
on the other hand, it does seem like a missing marker would make validation more effective at pestering you about alt

[01:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
by distinguishing forgotten from omitted because unavailable

[01:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. iWeb seems to incorporate Tidy Lib

[01:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
although the current HTML5 draft also sort of distinguishes that, though I'm not sure if the way it does it is better than a "missing" attribute

[01:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: various parts of Mac OS X use libtidy

[01:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
how can you tell that iWeb uses jsmin.c? distinctive output?

[01:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I clicked "Acknowledgments" in the about box

[01:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I see

[01:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, I know Apple Legal usually carefully reviews licenses of any third party code we incorporate

[02:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: does http://oreilly.com/css-html/dive-into-html5/call-it-a-drawing-surface.html use <mark> correctly in your opinion?

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie usually uses <strong> or <em> iirc...

[02:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
it's also not something you'd want to appear on the scrollbar as a tickmark

[02:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, in the code samples, it looks right to me

[02:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: even considering what annevk5 said about tickmarks?

[02:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it's also not the kind of thing where you would want native browser UI to jump from one <mark> to the next, afaict

[02:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
indeed

[02:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd also expect command-g to cycle between <mark> elements when there's no user-entered command-f search string

[02:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
right

[02:05:03.0000] <hsivonen>
mpilgrim_: ^

[02:05:04.0000] <Lachy>
it's one of the use cases <mark> was designed for, and there's even an example of it in the spec

[02:05:05.0000] <annevk5>
no it's not

[02:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
this example from the spec:

[02:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
<pre><code>var i: Integer;

[02:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
begin

[02:06:03.0000] <Lachy>
   i := <mark>1.1</mark>;

[02:06:04.0000] <Lachy>
end.</code></pre>

[02:06:05.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: interesting idea for what the <mark>-cycling UI should be

[02:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I've been stuck on thinking of one - I don't think the HI team will approve of previous/next buttons for it that are always present in the browser chrome

[02:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
Lachy, indeed, and the description of the mark element doesn't really give you the impression what the UI in UAs will be either

[02:08:01.0000] <annevk5>
Lachy, but the suggested UI does not make much sense for examples like that

[02:08:02.0000] <annevk5>
at all

[02:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but I'm not convinced of the need for a UI like that anyway

[02:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
from the UI, it seems like the purpose of <mark> is for something like Google search term highlighting

[02:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or for highlighting lines with your nick in an IRC log

[02:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
at least, a UI that shows tick marks in the scroll bar all the time would be aweful. Maybe if they were turned on at user request, it might be acceptable.

[02:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I understood the use case to be that user searches on google, user follows link to a site, site grabs google search term from referer and highlights occurrences of the term using <mark>

[02:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I will probably initially implement it without any of the extra UI, just the style rules

[02:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, yeah, it's for that, as well as highlighting stuff in code samples, quotes, etc. that is relevant to the reader in context

[02:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
do we need a way to distinguish the two cases?

[02:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: well for those things, the cycling UI would be pointless, and tick marks in the scroll bars would be terrible

[02:11:03.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, me too

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, or a cached page with search results highlighted, etc.

[02:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I kinda thought the cases you just described were meant to be served by <b> (with possible custom style rules on b)

[02:12:02.0000] <annevk5>
no, you'd want <strong> as the lines are slightly more important in the context then the surrounding lines

[02:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
fair enough

[02:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, mark was introduced so strong wouldn't be abused for that.

[02:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But strong means important

[02:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
the definition of mark actually does make a distinction between the two cases:

[02:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
"When used in a quotation or other block of text referred to from the prose, it indicates a highlight that was not originally present but which has been added to bring the reader's attention to a part of the text"

[02:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's a mess and badly definedm IMO

[02:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
and "When used in the main prose of a document, it indicates a part of the document that has been highlighted due to its likely relevance to the user's current activity."

[02:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the suggested UI for <mark> seems out of line with the defined semantics and examples

[02:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe <mark> used within <pre>, <code> and <blockquote> wouldn't be indicated by the UI (like scroll bar tick marks), but other uses outside of those elements would.

[02:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
Lachy, I think you're wrong and I think "activity" refers to something like searching not reading

[02:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: that sounds kind of arbitrary

[02:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk5, I think your wrong, because I remember the discussions from when this was being defined

[02:19:02.0000] <annevk5>
Lachy, I also do not think it is abuse of <strong> as usage of <em>/<strong> etc. is very context-dependent and that is exactly what is happening here

[02:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: the spec and examples seem to be in line with what Lachy is saying

[02:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: although the suggested UI for <mark> is kind of not...

[02:19:05.0000] <annevk5>
maybe we should fix the spec :)

[02:20:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me files a bug

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7368

[02:30:00.0000] <jgraham>

http://funkyimg.com/u2/203/307/qbfyh2b466kg22q3pym.jpg

[02:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
funny, but not really appropriate for this channel

[02:55:00.0000] <annevk5>
shepazu, btw, changing the interface of <canvas> would break some simple painting application I wrote and have used in a lot of my HTML5 presentations

[02:56:00.0000] <annevk5>
shepazu, I prototype HTMLCanvasElement; I suspect I'm not the only one

[02:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa! did shepazu's draft suggest changing the name of the interface?

[02:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
can't have that

[02:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen, annevk5: I was going to mention that as one of the reasons breaking out the IDL interface doesn't work

[02:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yeah, but it does explicitly say that "The interface name itself may be host-language dependent, as may any additional attributes, methods, and objects supported by the element."

[02:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[02:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
there's also the fact that reflection between width/height IDL attributes and the relevant canvas markup attributes needs to be defined

[02:59:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: Then what is the purpose of separating out the interface?

[02:59:04.0000] <Lachy>
so I believe shepazu is intending that we would keep HTMLCanvasElement in HTML5, but say that it implements/inherits the CanvasElement interface

[02:59:05.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, I don't know

[02:59:06.0000] <Lachy>
That's why I told shepazu I didn't think it was a good idea

[03:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: inheriting might work

[03:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(and you can't define it in the canvas API spec because it doesn't work for <svg:image>, since that already has width and height attributes with a different meaning)

[03:00:02.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, not really

[03:00:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I think inheriting might not work quite right for the various types of prototype hacking people do

[03:00:04.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, unless you have multiple inheritance

[03:00:05.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[03:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know enough about the patterns here

[03:01:01.0000] <annevk5>
for HTML it needs to inherit from HTMLElement at some point

[03:01:02.0000] <annevk5>
for SVG probably not

[03:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in fact, I think SVGImageElement already has width and height IDL attributes with different semantics and different types

[03:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(mind you, I'm not sure SVGImageElement is the right SVG element to expose the canvas interface at all, but let's assume it is plausible)

[03:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, you should point that out in the thread where I said to be cautious about overloading <image> in SVG with the canvas API

[03:03:02.0000] <annevk5>
I don't quite understand why <foreignObject> is not good enough

[03:03:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and a third reason is, RenderingContext2D is desirable in some cases where it's not bound to an element at all, as with WebKits canvas background extension

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
that extension is dubious imo :)

[03:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so it should be spec'd in a way where it can work with a backing store that is not necessarily owned by an element, to make it truly maximally reusable

[03:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: I don't know if it's great as-is, but there might be things like it that do make sense

[03:04:03.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, how does webkit's canvas background extension work?

[03:04:04.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: like custom-rendered datagrid cells

[03:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, that one was interesting

[03:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: if I recall correctly, it's like a background image in that multiple elements can reference it via style rules, but there's only a single backing store to paint to

[03:05:02.0000] <annevk5>
it's something like background:-webkit-canvas(ident)

[03:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://webkit.org/blog/176/css-canvas-drawing/

[03:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, we are not sure of this extension ourselves, this being one reason we have not tried to standardize it

[03:07:01.0000] <annevk5>
oh look, my memory is pretty decent :)

[03:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know what the use cases would be for a dynamic background like that

[03:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: let's say you wanted to highlight lines of text with a semi-randomized generated appearance that sort of looks like a real highlighter mark

[03:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: although that would need text metrics...

[03:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but basically any case where you want a purely presentational image, but there's reason to dynamically generate it client side

[03:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
but even that doesn't require the element interface to be abstracted at all. It just uses the 2D context interface which doesn't strictly need to be attached to an element (except it's not clear what the ctx.canvas property would return)

[03:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: that's what I'm saying - the 2D context needs to be spec'd purely in terms of a backing store, with ways to define its size and such independent of a specific IDL interface for an element

[03:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and indeed, svg:image already has width and height IDL attributes of type SVGAnimatedLength

[03:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so it would need separate IDL and markup attributes to control backing store size, if it is to be used as a canvas

[03:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, will try to lay all this out in an email soon

[03:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah, that's acceptable use of <mark>

[03:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm surprised.

[03:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: well, i didn't originally think of it as being used in pre

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was only really thinking of blockquote

[03:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i should probably do some tweaks

[03:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
but that's the basic idea of what i had in mind

[03:36:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: seems to make <mark> too broad to be useful 

[03:36:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the use in dive into html5  and some of the spec examples don't really line up with the suggested browser UI for it

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah the browser ui may be pie in the sky

[03:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe the highlight effect is more interesting than the scrollbar highlights

[03:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean, I can see cases where scroll bar tick marks and a "jump to next" UI would be really useful

[03:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[03:37:04.0000] <othermaciej>
it's just that not all the use cases for <mark> as currently defined fit the bill

[03:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(highlighting a referrer's search terms, or the user's nick in an IRC log, seem like valid uses for the proposed UI to me)

[03:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if browsers don't become UI-sensitive to <mark>, <mark> will be just another <em>

[03:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in which case we might as well get rid of the whole thing

[03:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
In general if browsers aren't sensitive to x x becomes another y where y is the element with the closest formatting to x

[03:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think having a highlight element is very different than having a stress emphasis element

[03:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it would be nice to have both a highlight element and a way to highlight content for the scrollbar

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i can add an attribute or something

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
someone file a bug or something about it so i don't forget

[03:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: Anne filed a bug

[03:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[03:43:02.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, <strong> is not emphasis

[03:43:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(not exactly suggesting an attribute but pointing out that the suggested UI doesn't seem in line with all the examples)

[03:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: strong is importance, which is different than highlighting the relevant part

[03:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: but anyway i'll look at it at some later point

[03:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i've been up some 20 hours so far

[03:44:03.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, fair enough, but imo the difference is too subtle

[03:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
one's yellow, the other is bold

[03:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not that subtle

[03:45:01.0000] <annevk2>
I usually have some rule code > strong { color:purple }

[03:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the visual difference of highlighting vs bolding I think will convey a different sense to people who are used to print

[03:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but the semantic difference seems subtle

[03:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway i should sleep

[03:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

good night

[04:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
The semantic difference isn't that subtle. One is denoting relevance, the other importance.

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
and the more relevant line is more important to the user

[04:07:01.0000] <annevk2>
bwah

[04:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that strong is about importance borders on angels on the head of a pin

[04:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Are there some canonical examples of important non-relevant, relevant non-important and important-and-relevant?

[05:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
A: Yes. The default font is 10px sans-serif. Sizes in em or percentages are measured against the default font." -- http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html

[05:08:00.0000] <virtuelv>
isn't exposing the BarProp properties a security issue?

[05:08:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: see? now change the spec :)

[05:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what zcorpan wants changed

[05:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, what was the question? I don't see it in the backlog

[05:16:02.0000] <jgraham>
hint: I don't remember much about canvas text

[05:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me points at public-html

[05:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Honestly, don't you read it?

[05:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Actually it turns out that that was one of the 2505 messages I haven't read on public0html

[05:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, which mail specifically?

[05:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
this one from about 18 days ago seems to be the only relevant one http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0007.html

[05:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ow. I just hiccuped and bit my tongue. The poor little boy is in pain.

[05:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: the spec says em and % in canvas text is relative to the canvas element's computed style (if it has one, or 10px sans-serif otherwise) instead of being relative to the default (10px sans-serif)

[05:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: i want it to always be relative to the default (10px sans-serif)

[05:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Yeah I read your mail. I agree that sizes should always be relative to the same thing

[05:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: i would appreciate if you said so on the list :)

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://twitter.com/inboxzero heh

[07:56:01.0000] <annevk2>
(via daringfireball)

[08:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, did you also get "MTV News is now following you on Twitter!"?

[08:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: I've turned those off

[08:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: let's see if they are following me

[08:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: it seems they aren't following me

[08:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lucky you, Anne.

[08:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sigh, still can't sleep

[08:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The biggest problem with a dungeon is the ventilation.

[08:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
TabAtkins, I still haven't quite figured out what the big benefit of a big follower count is

[08:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Big follower count = big penis.

[08:22:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: You talking D&D-style dungeons?

[08:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
No, http://twitter.com/diveintomark/status/3399044637

[08:23:01.0000] <annevk2>
TabAtkins, so Oprah has 2M followers...

[08:23:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk2: Oprah's penis is roughly 3 meters long.

[08:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Ah, kk

[08:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that is a disturbing image

[08:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, take *that* to sleep with you.

[08:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
My bed is only 2 meters, it wouldn't fit

[08:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me needs to go get his daily Sonic fix.

[08:29:00.0000] <miketaylr>
man, i wish we had sonic in new york

[08:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, a lot of the encoding tests just fail in Firefox 3.7a on Windows 7...

[08:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: with html5.enable = true?

[08:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
i hadn't changed prefs yet

[08:37:01.0000] <annevk2>
i'll enable that

[08:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
reboot?

[08:38:01.0000] <annevk2>
s/reboot/restart/ ?

[08:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: no need to restart the browser after setting it

[08:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
seems to run better with it enabled...

[08:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
cool

[08:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
html5.enable isn't in the shipping 3.5, right?

[08:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: right

[08:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
miketaylr: Yeah, you're missing out.  I'm pretty sure I'm physically addicted to 44oz double-vanilla Dr. Peppers.

[08:55:01.0000] <inimino>
TabAtkins: right

[08:57:00.0000] <miketaylr>
TabAtkins: every now and then i get a fix when i go back to my parents home in oklahoma... ;)

[09:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: There's a bug in html5 enabled Fx giving the wrong tree through DOM unless there's an alert first

[09:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: test case?

[09:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me was expecting that

[09:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: with which parser?

[09:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: HTML 5

[09:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: known issue in the old one

[09:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
that's bad

[09:08:04.0000] <gsnedders>
This particular bug doesn't exist in the old one as far as I can tell

[09:08:05.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: does it involve object, applet, video or the like?

[09:08:06.0000] <gsnedders>
No

[09:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting

[09:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Just the last node in the document being a text node

[09:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: oh do you mean you can't see document.written trailing text via DOM?

[09:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: yeah

[09:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, it is only document.written text

[09:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me only just found that out

[09:10:03.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: an alert shouldn't help with that

[09:10:04.0000] <hsivonen>
but yeah, known issue

[09:10:05.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Got a bug for that?

[09:10:06.0000] <hsivonen>
basically, I aligned with WebKit

[09:10:07.0000] <hsivonen>
than Hixie said aligment with IE was right

[09:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: I think there's no bug. I'll file one

[09:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: Opera has the same bug/design, IIRC

[09:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
We match HTML 5 as far as I can tell

[09:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://html5.org/parsing-tests/testrunner.htm fails a lot in Fx because of it

[09:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Why does it depend upon the presence of an alert though?

[09:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511405 filed

[09:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: it shouldn't!

[09:13:03.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: that's very odd

[09:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Using an alert seems to flush the buffer

[09:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Also, shouldn't document.close() flush it?

[09:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: yes.

[09:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, my minimal TC is too minimal :)

[09:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: ooh. you use document.close!

[09:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
it doesn't flush synchronously

[09:15:04.0000] <gsnedders>
s/you/zcorpan/ :)

[09:15:05.0000] <hsivonen>
alert spins the event loop, so it gets flushed

[09:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
alert doesn't affect document.write AFAIK but does affect document.close

[09:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
You got any got idea of how to fix that script?

[09:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(or should it just be fixed in fx?)

[09:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
document.write a comment after the text

[09:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it'll take a while before I get to fixing it

[09:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Then magic is needed to avoid that causing all tests to fail

[09:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Can't you use a data url rather than document.write, or something?

[09:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: can you use setTimeout for the continuation ofter document.close?

[09:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
*after

[09:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: it fails in WebKit, too, right?

[09:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Weird stuff happens in WebKit with that script :)

[09:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Like throwing when writing <script><div><script> into the iframe in the specific case, but not when doing it outside of that script

[09:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Woo!  Bert just invited me to be part of the CSS WG!

[09:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
grats!

[09:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(I guess?)

[09:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, this is a good thing.

[09:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've been interested in this sort of thing for a long time.  ^_^

[09:56:00.0000] <sgalineau>
Cool, I was going to remind him to send that mail :)

[09:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
^_^  Thanks, Sylvain.

[10:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: how did you first get into standards stuff?

[10:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie's and Hakon's blogs, when I first started picking up web projects here at work.

[10:01:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sorry, Tantek, not Hakon.

[10:01:03.0000] <othermaciej>
good places to start I guess :-)

[10:02:00.0000] <sgalineau>
I didn't even know Hakon and Tantek had blogs (feeling clueless)

[10:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I only *started* doing webdesign like two years ago, and when I was first teaching myself through googling, they were referenced a lot.

[10:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hakon might not, I dunno.

[10:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Posts like the "levels of HTML knowledge" and "bed and <br>eakfast markup" were real eye-openers for my virgin self.

[10:03:01.0000] <sgalineau>
whoa. talk of tab virginity early in the morning.

[10:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
web virginity only.

[10:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And, um, I guess only a very specific *kind* of web virginity.

[10:04:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Webdevirginity?

[10:04:03.0000] <sgalineau>
found the levels of HTML knowledge, can't place the other one

[10:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://tantek.com/log/2002/10.html#L20021022t1432

[10:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And Hixie's deconstructions of popular sites, ripping them apart for their nonsemantic structure, were very helpful in shaping me.

[10:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then I just joined the css and whatwg lists, and started participating from there.

[10:06:02.0000] <sgalineau>
I definitely need to design more. only way to be good at this.

[10:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[10:07:01.0000] <sgalineau>
...could make me hate my employer though....:)

[10:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That or tip you over into the "Everything MS does is *GOLD*, I tell you!" camp.

[10:08:01.0000] <sgalineau>
that is quite the unlikely scenario

[10:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
^_^

[10:09:00.0000] <sgalineau>
I've used Opera Show for CSS presentations and wore a Firefox 1.0 t-shirt on my first day. and that was the least offensive stuff.

[10:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If more computers at my college had Opera installed, I would have used that a lot.  Instead I just designed a basic slideshow thinger in PHP.

[10:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Tell me: how did the IE team react to that shirt?

[10:11:00.0000] <sgalineau>
told me to upgrade :)

[10:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hahaha

[10:11:02.0000] <sgalineau>
as in, Firefox 1.0 is too old

[10:12:00.0000] <sgalineau>
at the last WG meeting, I had a microsoft t-shirt that says 'I am the empire'

[10:12:01.0000] <sgalineau>
Hakon had to take a picture of that

[10:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I approve.

[10:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Now I just need to get my company to start funding my travels around the globe for the FtFs.

[10:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Alternately: convince my wife that we're going on vacation a lot.

[10:15:00.0000] <sgalineau>
next two are in the US

[10:15:01.0000] <sgalineau>
west coast

[10:15:02.0000] <sgalineau>
bay area

[10:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is bar area near SF, or LA?

[10:16:01.0000] <sgalineau>
sf

[10:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Damsn.  I've got family near LA.

[10:16:03.0000] <sgalineau>
next meeting is at the W3C TPAC in Santa Clara

[10:16:04.0000] <sgalineau>
following one at Apple I think

[10:16:05.0000] <sgalineau>
then in August in Oslo at Opera. I'd save us for that and make it a vacation

[10:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ooh, going to Norway would we awesome.  August next year?

[10:18:00.0000] <sgalineau>
yup

[10:18:01.0000] <sgalineau>
Oslo in August is supposed to be really lovely

[10:19:00.0000] <sgalineau>
I should be paying attention to the CSS WG telcon. I'm not smart enough to be an invited expert....

[10:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  5th anniversary would be next June.  Maybe keep that small and take an august trip...

[10:20:00.0000] <sgalineau>
we'll drink red stripe in champagne flutes.

[10:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's a date.

[10:20:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
A, um, three-way date.  With my wife.

[10:20:03.0000] <sgalineau>
you realize that you're suggesting a three-way date to a frenchman...right ?

[10:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[10:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't know how to make that dirty french laugh thing in words.

[10:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I'd do it if I could.

[10:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: apparently your picture on Facebook reminds my wife of an old boyfriend.

[10:23:01.0000] <sgalineau>
lol

[10:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wow, tantek's use on his blog of <p> as an inline element with a marker at the beginning to separate it from surrounding <p>s is... weird.

[10:32:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
/me is not looking forward to the "here's all the new semantic markup you can use in html 5" chapter of diveintohtml5

[10:32:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
given the level of discussion over the <mark> element

[10:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
most of the other new semantic markup is pretty clear-cut in its usage

[10:33:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
maybe i should just call the chapter "what color is your bikeshed?" and be done with it

[10:33:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
hahaha

[10:33:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
it's cute that you think that

[10:33:04.0000] <othermaciej>
easy for me to say, I don't have to write web pages for a living

[10:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
We need an interoperability test for semantic markup. Unless we can prove that a majority of authours are using markup in accordance with the specified semantic the spec shouldn't be allowed to go to Rec.

[10:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think <article> is still a bit confusing.  The example usage seems to conflict with what I want to use it for, which is something to wrap the main content of a page.

[10:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: it's not really suitable for that in the general case, although a <main> or <content> element for that has been proposed

[10:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, saw that discussion a few days ago.

[10:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
I am quite concerned at the difficulty people have with the sectioning elements in general. I mean people couldn't use headings in HTML 4 either but I sort of hoped we could do better

[10:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the only one I find somewhat confusing is <section> itself

[10:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think a focus on "this shit generates entries in outlines" might help?

[10:36:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
/me sits back and waits for everyone to prove his point

[10:36:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But then you'd have people saying "wtf use are outlines?"

[10:36:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
mpilgrim: hahaha

[10:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, the section elements are supposed to be for web applications to, and an outline of an app is at the very least hard to think about, if not outright incoherent

[10:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I guess.

[10:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Indeed. But it depends if you can get good results  (x-epsilon)% of authors who don't get the outline thing

[10:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think the "it resets your <h1-6> nesting" is the primary take-away use I get from <section>.

[10:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: I think of them as being basically document constructs by analogy with LaTeX. But it makes some sense for applications too

[10:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
also most people will never actually be exposed to the outline, so we can expect the same quality as for other invisible metadata

[10:38:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
/me waits for the accessibility experts to magically become semantics experts and highlight this entire conversation in the irc logs

[10:38:04.0000] <jgraham>
If there is a use case for jumping between parts of the application UI

[10:38:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I love reading commentary on IRC conversations in email

[10:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me hopes that hsivonen will put the outline on validator.nu so it gets the same exposure as other authoring errors

[10:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That would be nice.

[10:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've got an outlining tool in Web Developer FF add-on, but it doesn't understand the html5 algorithm so it just assumes everything is a top-level entry.  >_<

[10:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Plus: it's pretty well-hidden.

[10:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean, Google Calendar clearly has separate "sections" in the layout but I'm not sure an outline of them is a sensible idea

[10:41:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
TabAtkins: i like the framing of "it resets your <h*> nesting"

[10:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess it's easier to understand elements that actually do stuff

[10:42:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i think i'll name the chapter "two headers are better than one"

[10:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
no one wonders when to use <canvas> or <video>

[10:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I ran into really annoying issues with <h*> nesting (I like <h*> best of all!) when designing the template for my site.

[10:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: As far as I can tell that is basically the "semantics failed" position

[10:43:01.0000] <sgalineau>
Tab, where's your site ?

[10:43:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I ended up having to start the content at like <h4>, which was confusing as hell because you never see the <h1> - <h3> elements because they're in the template.

[10:43:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I do all of the sites for my company, http://www.igofigure.com

[10:43:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Plus several intranet apps for same, all hidden behind password walls.

[10:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
My personal site is just a dumping ground of random stuff, plus my silent evangelism for Internet Time, www.xanthir.com

[10:44:01.0000] <sgalineau>
love the comments : "Yes, this is a table-based layout.  Yes, I am ashamed of myself."

[10:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hahaha, yeah.

[10:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I really don't get what's so hard about the sectioning elements, especially considering how many people kept asking us to add XHTML2-style sectioning/headings despite already having it

[10:48:00.0000] <sgalineau>
they may have been vocal, but clearly they were not representative

[10:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not really clear to me when to use <section> and when to use <div> in something that's not a traditional document structure

[10:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
mpilgrim, I think the easiest way to illustrate the sectioning element's function is to use a diagram showing how a document is structured.

[10:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: If it has a header it is likely a <section> if not probably a <div> probably works in many cases

[10:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
s/header/heading/

[10:49:03.0000] <Lachy>
first get people thinking about documents in terms of their outline structure, and then it's much easier to get them to use the markup correctly

[10:49:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
as you may have noticed, i'm trying to explain things more visually in diveintohtml5 than in my previous books

[10:49:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Yeah, that's my take. Combined with the "resets <h*>" focus, it's relatively clear.

[10:50:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
so yeah, a diagram is probably a good solution

[10:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Use it when you have headings, *because* it resets your headings.

[10:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
mpilgrim: I haven't read your previous books (for shame) but I love the old timey typesetting elements in this one

[10:51:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
thanks

[10:51:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
my O'Reilly editor likes it too

[10:51:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Honestly, since the first chapter I saw was for <canvas>, I thought the giant ornate dropcap was a <canvas>.

[10:51:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
not sure how much of it will translate into print form

[10:52:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
they're pretty strict about their brand, and typography is a big part of their brand for obvious reasons

[10:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah the typography is nice. It feels (perhaps wrongly) somewhat _why influenced

[10:53:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
that was one of my influences, yes

[10:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
_why is the ruby dude, right?

[10:53:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
along with o'reilly's head-first series

[10:53:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
(this is not a head-first book, but i like some of the design elements)

[10:55:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
the typography was created using Philip`'s font subsetting scripts

[10:55:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
including the IE-compatible .eot files

[10:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dang, Philip` does everything.

[10:55:03.0000] <sylvaing2>
/me reflexively dodges at the mention of EOT

[10:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
I hope you didn't use my scripts on OFL-licensed fonts, because that would violate their licence

[10:56:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
that's upsetting news

[10:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
License proliferation for the lose. ;_;

[10:56:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
linux libertine is OFL-licensed IIRC

[10:56:04.0000] <Philip`>
...because of the Reserved Name stuff which I haven't got around to fixing yet

[10:57:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
is there a url explaining this problem?

[10:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
(You're not allowed to use the original font's name in a modified version, but my scripts keep the old name and prefix it with "subset of")

[10:57:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
i see

[10:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
See the OFL licence, I think it's fairly clear about it

[10:57:04.0000] <jgraham>
mpilgrim: Libertine seems to be GPL/OFL dual licensed

[10:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could always use my font-name altering script to alter the font's name so it's no longer in violation :-)

[10:58:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
jgraham: hooray for dual-licensing!

[10:58:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
(man, how many times do you get to say that?)

[10:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
or wait until next week or something when I'll probably fix my code

[10:58:04.0000] <Dashiva>
mpilgrim: Every time you're a user and not a developer? :)

[10:58:05.0000] <mpilgrim>
i've been a developer since i was 11

[10:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, whenever you're not wearing your dev hat

[10:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
Your ten-year-old self would surely have appreciated dual-licensing

[10:59:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
jgraham: you are correct, it's dual-licensed under OFL and GPL-with-font-exception

[10:59:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
i shall update my about page to mention which license i'm using

[10:59:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
and call it a day

[11:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you distribute a GPL font, do you have to distribute the original FontForge (or whatever) editable source version?

[11:00:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Surely you only have to have it available on request?

[11:01:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i don't know, but i would be happy to do so

[11:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Well, that too

[11:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(as in, you don't actually bother until someone sends an email and asks)

[11:04:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i aim to be maximally license-compliant, so i will add the font sources to my repository and link them from the about page

[11:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
I hope you don't care too much if your fonts aren't spec-compliant

[11:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is there any reason to ever have a document with multiple <articles> that *aren't* wrapped by an overall <article>?

[11:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm thinking that maybe blogs using <article> for comments (as suggested by the spec) might not want to wrap a big <article> around the whole thing.

[11:18:00.0000] <miketaylr>
by 'the whole thing', you mean the entire document, or just the article people are commenting on?

[11:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The whole actual content area of the document (that is, not the site header or sidebars or anything).

[11:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, most of the time, you don't need an <article> around the whole lot

[11:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
Use <div> for that, or maybe the proposed <content> element if that gets added to the spec

[11:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yah, I was wondering about explicitly blessing <article> for the proposed purpose of <content>/<main>.

[11:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
no

[11:21:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
done. http://diveintohtml5.org/about.html

[11:22:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
Philip`: what spec are they violating?

[11:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
nested <article> elements need to be related to the parent article; the canonical example is reader comments

[11:22:02.0000] <miketaylr>
TabAtkins: I just looked at the source of html5doctor.com, and they're wrapping the main content in <section>, and the comments in <article>

[11:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: So in that case, you'd wrap the blog post and the comments in an <article>, so the comments can be wrapped in <article>s and relate properly?

[11:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[11:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
I thought there was an example in the spec illustrating that, but I can't see it. Anyway, read the element definition. it explain it sufficiently

[11:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
miketaylr: Thanks.  I think my mental model is broken; I tend to think of <section> as automatically subordinate to <article>.

[11:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me checks what html5doctor is doing...

[11:25:01.0000] <miketaylr>
TabAtkins: my mental model changes every other day. :S

[11:25:02.0000] <Lachy>
damn. I will get that fixed. The use of <section id="content"> is wrong.

[11:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me makes a note to contact Bruce about it

[11:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Can you explain why it's wrong, Lachy?

[11:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, because it affects the outline, so basically if a section doesn't have a heading (or at least, couldn't have one), then it generally shouldn't be using <section>

[11:27:01.0000] <miketaylr>
*lightbulbs turn on*

[11:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
I can't think of any cases where a <section> wouldn't have a heading, but I'm not confident enough to say that it never happens. But it would be rare if it did.

[11:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
miketaylr, does that mean my explanation helped you understand it?

[11:28:01.0000] <tantek>
in print, sometimes sections are simply delineated with horizontal rules, no heading

[11:28:02.0000] <miketaylr>
yes, .

[11:28:03.0000] <miketaylr>
sorry, should be more explicit. it's helpful, Lachy 

[11:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  That still seems like a significant and semantic 'section' of the page, though, even if it doesn't have a heading.  It *could* have one, say, "Articles".

[11:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
tantek, in the cases I've seen, where a book has chapters, which are themselves divided by horizontal rules, I'd expect the chapter to be one <section> and then simply divide it with <hr>

[11:31:00.0000] <tantek>
the remaining separator markup  (e.g. <hr>) in HTML is a bit of an anachronism

[11:31:01.0000] <tantek>
originally <p> was just a separator as well

[11:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
IIRC, I think Hitchhiker's Guide is an example of a book that does that (though I don't have it here to check, and I could be thinking of another book)

[11:31:03.0000] <Lachy>
I know, but that was fixed long ago

[11:31:04.0000] <tantek>
but now people use <p>...</p> <p>...</p>

[11:31:05.0000] <tantek>
similarly, <hr> is archaic

[11:32:00.0000] <tantek>
it will be better to use <section>...</section> <section>...</section>

[11:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
<hr> is simple and practical

[11:32:02.0000] <tantek>
and CSS for styling/border effects

[11:32:03.0000] <tantek>
Lachy, so was the <p> separator

[11:32:04.0000] <tantek>
no different conceptually

[11:32:05.0000] <tantek>
it will eventually go the same way

[11:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  If <hr> does mark an implicit section break, how should it play with the outline algorithm whene using implicit sectioning via <h*>?  Just close the latest implicit section?

[11:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, it doesn't close a section. It just divides two parts of it

[11:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Same question, then - does it divide the lowest section only?

[11:37:00.0000] <sylvaing2>
/me humbly wonders how the masses of web authors will get <section> straight if this audience cannot

[11:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
I understand where you're coming from, as I once argued the same thing many years ago for XHTML2, before HTML5 started, but I've since come around and become more pragmatic about it

[11:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm just nitpicking, really.

[11:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, I don't really understand the question. It's a thematic break between two parts of the section.

[11:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The implicit sectioning algorithm is supposed to be only for legacy content anyway.

[11:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
the implicit sectioning algorithm isn't affected by <hr> at all, but no, it's not only for legacy content

[11:39:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
econhelp/sbo

[11:39:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Given "<h1>foo</h1>content<h2>bar</h2>content<hr>content", does the <hr> divide the implicit section started by the <h1>, or the section started by the <h2>?

[11:39:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
grr

[11:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
Eventually, people will relise how impractical it is to have to surround every little section with a <section> element, and begin to use the numbered heading elements more wisely within sections.

[11:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: I agree and use my headings and sections that way now.

[11:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, the "content<hr>content" is all part of the implied section, since <hr> doesn't affect the algorithm at all. It's just treated the same as <p> or <div> or whatever else as far as the algorithm is concerned

[11:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
K, that's what I was thinking.

[11:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's actually one of the benefits of retaining the mixed model sectioing system, rather than going the pure-sectioning-based XHTML2 model

[11:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, HTML5 doctor is totally misusing lots of markup :-(

[11:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
looks like we really do need to have a <content> element, if only to stop the misuse of <section>

[11:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
RT: Hrm. That still seems like a significant and semantic 'section' of the page, though, even if it doesn't have a heading. It *could* have one, say, "Articles".

[11:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That it doesn't seems to be more of a stylistic choice than a semantic one.

[11:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So I'm still not sure why html5doctor shouldn't be using a <section> theree.

[11:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, possibly, if the section were just containing the articles, and it did have an "Articles" heading, it would be right. But in html5doctor's case, it also contains the sidebar

[11:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
so it's being used as a general purpose container element

[11:54:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh it does?  Sorry, didn't notice that.  That *is* an abuse then.

[11:54:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Carry on.

[11:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's unfortunate that <section> is becoming the new <div> :-(

[11:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Agreed.

[11:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
I think I need to write an article about this to clear up the issues.

[11:55:03.0000] <Lachy>
and tell people not to be afraid of <div>!

[11:56:00.0000] <krijnh>
But <div> kills kittens!

[11:56:01.0000] <miketaylr>
I'm allergic to cats, so I don't mind.

[11:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think it's the general "semantics are awesome, and <section> is more semantic than <div>, thus it is more awesome, thus I will use it everywhere" idea.

[11:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Same thing that makes people use <em> when they *really* mean <i>.

[11:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
krijnh, if that were true, it must be the least efficient killing method ever. I still see cats around every so often

[11:58:01.0000] <krijnh>
Then people don't use div enough :)

[11:59:00.0000] <krijnh>
So your article is extra welcome

[11:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
what a great campaign that would be: Use <div>, Help Kill the Kittens!

[11:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I'd welcome an article, Lachy.  Would be good to point people to.

[11:59:03.0000] <Darxus>
Does HTML5 have ways for me to make it easier for a speech browser to skip the text to speech conversion by providing the speech for it?

[12:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Darxus, what do you mean?

[12:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
You mean like saying "this audio file is a speech version of this element on the page"?

[12:00:02.0000] <Darxus>
TabAtkins: Exactly.

[12:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
Darxus, no, you shouldn't do that. text-to-speech has many navigational advantages over a pre-recorded audio file

[12:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That sounds like a wonderful way to confuse the crap out of speech browsers the moment the content changes and the audio isn't updated.

[12:01:02.0000] <gsnedders_>
Can anyone think of anything where the narrator is the antagonist?

[12:01:03.0000] <Darxus>
I was thinking about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia - they just record a single ogg of the entire page.  And I was thinking that might be less useful than TTS due to ability to navigate.

[12:01:04.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders_, do you mean, like in a play?

[12:01:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I expect that aural browsers would quickly ignore such a feature.

[12:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: In any sort of literature

[12:02:01.0000] <Darxus>
TabAtkins: Then what is the point of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia ?

[12:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: I know I've read a book or short story like that, but the title isn't coming to me.

[12:02:03.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I think there are some cartoons that do that sometimes.

[12:02:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Darxus: People like doing dumb things?  Spoken *wikipedia* is *extra* dumb, because Wikipedia is likely to change underneath you constantly.

[12:02:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: cartoons aren't proper lit. :P

[12:03:00.0000] <Darxus>
Hehe.

[12:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I don't know of any books that have a narrator in the story itself

[12:04:00.0000] <Darxus>
Anybody know the best way for me to access a web page via text to speech under ubuntu?

[12:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
Darxus, there are some advantages to providing a recorded version of a relatively stable page, so people can listen to it on their MP3 players

[12:04:02.0000] <Lachy>
much like an Audiobook

[12:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
but it shouldn't be presented as an accessible version intended for the blind. It should be an option for everyone, and the text version needs to remain accessible

[12:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: it's decently common to have a protagonist also be the narrator.

[12:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, I don't read many books

[12:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, k.  I do.  ^_^

[12:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: I think what I was thinking of was a story where the narrator was *presenting* themselves as the protagonist, even though they filled a more traditional villain role when you stepped away.

[12:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
In fact, the last set of Novels I've read in a long time is the Harry Potter series, and a few years before that, I'd read The Hobbit.

[12:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: How were they not the protagonist? The protagonist is merely the primary character…

[12:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(The protagonist isn't inherently the hero, they can be the evil demon)

[12:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sorry, using the terms as hero/villain proxies.

[12:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sends TabAtkins back to school

[12:10:00.0000] <tantek>
/me catches up on a bit of scrollback.

[12:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, whatev.

[12:10:02.0000] <tantek>
Yes, divitis will simply give way to sectionitis in HTML5, as <section> is the "new shiny" that authors will adopt.

[12:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
tantek: Short version: we were discussing useful stuff, then I came in.

[12:11:00.0000] <tantek>
Lachy, I agree with you that <hr> represents a thematic break. That's practical and simple. I disagree that it has anything to do with a break in a section - that just confuses the matter.

[12:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand the distinction you're trying to make

[12:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Possibly Vernon God Little, but I didn't actually finish reading it

[12:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: I think he's referring to something like my confusion, that saying it "breaks a section" seems to imply that an <hr> implies subsections before and after it.

[12:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, yeah, that was wrong

[12:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
I always wondered why SVG was such a mess: http://www.w3.org/mid/1039235648.20090819175847⊙wo

[12:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
Not that HTML is much better in this regard...

[12:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I sort of laughed about that too.  Seems like it would have been easier/better to set a single convention, then alias the other convention if necessary.

[12:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
MathML did a pretty good job at staying consistent with HTML

[12:49:01.0000] <annevk2>
until they got definitionURL

[12:49:02.0000] <annevk2>
not sure how that happened

[12:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
probably the same way HTML managed to stay consistent with HTML until, sy, http-equiv

[12:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
s/sy/say/

[12:51:00.0000] <annevk2>
or <img> vs <video>?

[12:52:00.0000] <annevk2>
though in text/html you could use <image> I suppose at the cost of a validation error :)

[12:52:01.0000] <annevk2>
not sure if that speaks in favor of the HTML format

[12:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what you mean about img vs video

[12:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
abbreviation

[12:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
html had different ways of naming elements from the begining

[12:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
imagine you'd introduce elements for images, video, and audio today

[12:54:01.0000] <annevk2>
though maybe you don't think they belong to the same set

[13:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
mpilgrim_: "The default font is 10px sans-serif. Sizes in em or percentages are measured against the default font." is wrong

[13:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's relative to the computed value of the font on the <canvas> element

[13:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
mpilgrim_, are you planning on updating it online or will we have to wait until early 2010?

[13:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, you should include this comic in the Web Database introduction section: http://xkcd.com/327/

[13:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[14:18:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
is this text correct now? http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html#relative-font-size

[14:18:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
(annevk2 or annevk3 or whomever)

[14:19:00.0000] <ttepasse>
mpilgrim, something different: <div id=body>?

[14:19:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
damn, i was hoping no one would notice that

[14:19:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
styling the body element is... difficult

[14:19:03.0000] <ttepasse>
Next on my list: the <dl>s

[14:20:00.0000] <ttepasse>
hihi

[14:20:01.0000] <annevk2>
mpilgrim, I think so

(c.f. http://www.propylon.com/news/ctoarticles/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Manuals_20020822.html )

[14:20:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
ok, thanks

[14:21:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
the answer to your other question is that i'll be updating diveintohtml5.org, but i'm not sure about the version on oreilly.com

[14:21:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
i should probably ask them to republish just with this change, since it's a technical error

[14:21:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
they will not be updating their excerpt for new content

[14:22:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
the rest of the chapter will discuss transformations, animation, and using the explorercanvas library for IE compatibility

[14:22:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
oh, and toDataURL or whatever it's called

[14:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
that's the name

[14:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
in other news, if people could help out fill out tables for the other browsers: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Web_Encodings

[14:24:01.0000] <annevk2>
I got the slightly overambitious goal of solving the encoding problem

[14:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk2: Is there simple test to run?

[14:26:01.0000] <annevk2>
I wish

[14:27:00.0000] <annevk2>
sgalineau, any chance you could help out with http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Web_Encodings for Internet Explorer?

[14:28:00.0000] <krijnh>
Is there a problem then? :)

[14:28:01.0000] <ttepasse>
Is there a reason, why <mark> is just phrasing content?

[14:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
ttepasse: because its primary purpose is to mark frex search terms in a page.

[14:33:00.0000] <ttepasse>
I was thinking more about the usage in blockquotes.

[14:37:00.0000] <shepazu>
TabAtkins: "frex"?

[14:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
frex = for example

[14:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
ttepasse: Oh, so you wanna <mark> a block of markup within a <blockquote>?

[14:40:00.0000] <ttepasse>
The concrete use case were two paragraphs, yes.

[14:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  FF respects styling when printing to the point of cutting off ordinary text in a fixed-width container that is wider than the page.

[14:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's a little annoying.

[14:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Probably required, but still.

[14:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk2: Was there a point to the email you just sent, or is just a summary of things?

[14:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk2: Not trying to be rude, just wondering.  ^_^

[14:50:01.0000] <annevk2>
i hit the wrong button?

[14:50:02.0000] <annevk2>
oh and it arrived two times? sweet

[14:50:03.0000] <annevk2>
wtf

[14:50:04.0000] <krijnh>
You prutser you

[14:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, makes a lot more sense now.

[14:51:01.0000] <shepazu>
"Due to the cheer volume of e-mails on this list"... either Hixie thinks the HTML list is a happy place, or it's full of cheerleaders, or he made a slight typo... possibly all 3

[14:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm going with the second explanation.

[14:55:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
annevk2: you should integrate the information/tests from http://coq.no/character-tables/mime/iso-2022/en , http://coq.no/character-tables/mime/euc/en , and http://coq.no/character-tables/mime/locale-specific/en

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
where's the spec that defines how implementations implement ARIA again?

[15:02:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-implementation/

[15:02:01.0000] <annevk2>
not sure where the editor's draft is

[15:02:02.0000] <annevk2>
thanks mpilgrim

[15:03:00.0000] <poe>

[15:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
wait that can't be it

[15:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
the link to the editor's draft is quite wrong

[15:49:00.0000] <krijnh>
Shitty connection day :/

[15:50:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It's not even using of the new HTML5 elements, for starters.  I guess this would be best shared with a cross compatibility or css channel.  Sorry.

[15:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What should we be scrutinizing about it, JonathanNeal?

[15:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: did the document pointer stuff change in xhr?

[15:57:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, what was previously defined did not work for when the interface object was moved around

[15:58:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, I just fouled up where I should have posted it.  I've been writing my own normalize.css that I *think* is better than any of the major ones out there.

[15:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, okay.

[15:58:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
They're always trying to re-globalize what everything means instead of actually normalize between the browsers.

[15:59:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm hoping we can switch to that from the yui one.  However, I ended up removing all of the html5 elements from the document, so it killed the point of having you folks scrutinize my use of any specific html5 elements.

[15:59:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, I'm not totally clear on whether all the details are correct now to be honest; I have attempted to test it, but some of the details of how document/window interact and "fully active document" make it a bit hard

[15:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: if you could comment on http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7373 regarding what the new text for XHR documents should be, that'd be great

[16:00:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, there's a XMLHttpRequest origin concept

[16:00:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, "Each XMLHttpRequest object has an associated XMLHttpRequest origin and an XMLHttpRequest base URL."

[16:00:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We're working on making our layouts more robust and outline friendly @ http://madison.thewikies.com/alloy/960_grid.html

[16:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: Eh, all of the html5 elements default to margin-less inline elements anyway, so just put whatever you want in your file.

[16:01:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, no they should be block elements in my document, IF they were there.

[16:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: if you could mention that on the bug that'd be awesome

[16:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
i gotta run

[16:01:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Those layouts in that last grid are cross browser compatible, but still give us a lot of flexability in layouts.

[16:01:05.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[16:02:00.0000] <annevk2>
done, nn

[16:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but you have to set them like that in current parsers.

[16:03:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, of course, but we'll be supporting ie8 for a while, I suspect, so might as well declare the elements and give them the proper style.

[16:04:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Firefox needs them too, I know, but just the css.


2009-08-20
[17:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: so i asked around and the conclusion is that using <section><h1> may have some minor effect on SEO, but nothing serious, and we'll adapt the algorithms once we see how people are using it anyway

[17:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Awesome.  Need to file that away in case our idiot SEO company complains.

[17:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: Yo, dude, got an answer to the <h1> question.

[17:25:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Reading.

[18:11:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It takes me a long time to read a single paragraph :-D

[00:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I distribute the source code for the GPL fonts I use via @font-face.

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
little Bobby Tables reminds me of Robert Smith?

[00:26:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I've made good progress on my normalize css @ http://madison.thewikies.com/html5/normalize.html and the fn() for adding support for those html5 elements in ie is pretty small now.

[00:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: what does the NE keyword mean?

[00:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I see, Non-Editorial

[01:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: do the bugzilla bugs I filed about encodings seem sensible?

[01:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I've just been using that NE keyword thing as a way to cause new bug notifications to get sent to the public-html list

[01:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I see - I thought the bugmail was just automatic

[01:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it was previously, but I turned it off after we got some spammy comments from the spec-commenting form 

[01:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[01:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess these were useful bugs for the list to see

[01:45:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The overflow of body is completely different in ie6/7.

[01:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think I'm going to have the time/energy to send more suggested issue closings before tomorrow's telecon

[01:46:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It can't be set visible and behave in the same way as firefox / safari

[01:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so the next round of closings will have to target Sept 3 as the date I guess

[01:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
JonathanNeal: quirks or standards mode?

[01:46:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
the only solution where all browsers look the same seems to be to either remove the margin on the body as the default, or set overflow to hidden.

[01:46:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
standards mode.

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think this might be too rarefied for my level of CSS understanding

[01:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: btw, I just checked in a version of my markup draft that includes the ARIA attributes -- based the html5+aria schema that hsivonen put together for validator.nu

[01:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/aria/

[01:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: cool - I don't find chapter 10 very easy to understand still, but it seems better than the raw RNG

[01:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: yeah, slightly, at least

[01:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
fwiw, the per-element documentation there also shows where the aria attributes integrate in

[01:51:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/aria/address.html

[01:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I see - still kinda requires following the RelaxNG links to see what is actually allowed though

[01:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[01:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would really like to see a modernized prose / matrix version

[01:54:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
othermaciej, it's fine :-) I think this channel doesn't assume anyone is a css cross-browser-compatible guru, although, you never know.

[01:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
good night folks

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk2>
nn

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: yeah, the bugs make sense. thanks

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa! badness in the DOM spec: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280692

[02:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, I thought the idea was to fix the DOM spec for that case

[02:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: it seems that zcorpan's draft fixed it already.

[02:36:01.0000] <annevk2>
I wish someone would make that a standards track draft

[02:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
we should definitely get more visibility for zcorpan's spec and remove DevMo links to bogus W3C specs

[02:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is editing DevMo DOM documentation for HTML5 truthiness

[03:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. apparently Firefox 2 had cross-browser compatible getElementsByTagName behavior but was fixed to comply with the W3C spec

[03:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
<flamewar>Damn people who save code using the tab character for indentation

[03:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
you mean that as in they took your code, made a change, and now everything uses tabs?

[03:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, using tabs is superior to spaces!

[03:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
(well, actually, using an appropriate mix of both so that indentation levels aren't adversely affected by different tab widths)

[03:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk2: No they just used tabs in their file

[03:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
And now I have to edit it

[03:35:02.0000] <jgraham>
But changing my code would be even more annoying

[03:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, is that in some Python code?

[03:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
for that, I agree, spaces are the only sensible option

[03:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: It's javascript

[03:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
(when I said "changing my code" I actually meant the hypothetical situation where someone did change my code. In this case I could probably have learnt to reconfigure emacs to insert tabs rather than spacews but given that I will never share my changes I just replaced all the tabs)

[03:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
mpilgrim: The fonts don't strictly follow all the requirements of OpenType, e.g. they don't bother updating the global font bounding box stuff, and sometimes (rarely) they do nasty things like using invalid glyph IDs to disable bits of the font

[03:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I think Apple has some font validator tool which is useful, and finds a few problems)

[03:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
But they seem to work in all browsers/OSes I've tried, so I've not yet bothered with those minor details

[03:52:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, do you know where the Gecko details of handling encodings are? http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/intl/uconv/src/charsetalias.properties lists aliases, are those all? Where is it specified that us-ascii is treated as windows-1252?

[03:52:01.0000] <annevk2>
(if anyone else involved in Mozilla/Gecko knows feel free to answer :) )

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, also, when you handle the parsing of <meta charset> do you perform any normalization on the value?

[03:57:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm moderately tempted to change /topic for this channel: http://translationparty.com/tp/#2157154

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
"Whatever suits you." -> "Wrong suit."

[04:09:00.0000] <Rik`_>
annevk2: strange, without the dot, "Whatever suits you" -> "Accident litigation"

http://translationparty.com/tp/#2159339

[04:12:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Peh. You guys are too distracting.

[04:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
I am quite disappointed I can't seem to cause an infinite loop; Google translate has a thing where it sometimes translates proper nouns incorrectly e.g. the word "Swedish" gets translated to "English" in a Swedish->English translation

[04:20:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Also: it appears giving it lyrics from The Fly js quite effective.)

[04:21:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
"Every artist is a cannibal, every poet a thief, all kill their inspiration and sing about the grief." -> "All thieves, poets, artists of the sad song of all meals."

[04:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: the alias file applies, but there are also other alias-like behaviors that aren't implemented as aliases

[04:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: the HTML5 parser in Gecko defers to the underlying APIs for name normalization

[04:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, any chance you can give me pointers to the relevant bits?

[04:24:01.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, then I can create some documentation out of it on the wiki

[04:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: it seems hard to find the relevant bits :-(

[04:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: it might be that certain decoders simply magically implement behavior that happens to match a superset

[04:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
superset encoding, that is

[04:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: Simon Montagu or Jungshik Shin might be able to give better pointers

[05:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
this is the funniest one I've seen, mentioned in our #staff channel yesterday http://www.translationparty.com/#1728383

[05:26:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, could you pm their email addresses maybe?

[05:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://www.translationparty.com/#2168787 is also fun

[05:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me will give up trying to break translationparty now

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: did I PM the right nick?

[09:37:00.0000] <paul_irish>
Philip`: can i PM? bug report about the web font optimizer.

[09:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, seems that Simon was on it already :)

[09:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: on what?

[09:42:02.0000] <annevk2>
documenting encoding stuff of Mozilla

[09:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nice

[09:43:01.0000] <annevk2>
https://wiki.mozilla.org/I18n:Charset_Aliases he'll integrate it in the WHATWG wiki later

[09:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ah. smontagu. not zcorpan.

[09:45:00.0000] <annevk2>
aah, I see the confusion :)

[09:50:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: html5lib parser tests have #document-fragment — in that case, should it be standards or quirks?

[09:50:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(I guess we ought to make it possible to choose either)

[09:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: Standars, I suppose, but strictly speaking, there needs to be a flag to test quirks

[09:50:03.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for the single quirk!

[09:51:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: yay for acid2!

[09:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Huh.  Google just now changed the url for their search results.  Yesterday it was google.com/search.  Now it's just google.com, with all the query params stored in the hash.

Random Python question: Anyone got any idea why proc = subprocess.Popen(args, stdout=subprocess.PIPE); stdout, stderr = proc.communicate() would only get the first 64kb of output

[10:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
?

[10:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
(replacing stdout=subprocess.PIPE with a temp. file works so the program is producing the correct output)

[10:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: (sorry to disturb you but you seem like the most likely person to know)

[10:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm http://bugs.python.org/issue1256 seems relevant

[11:34:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Does an iframe set to a data URI not fire load in Fx 3.6+html5?

[11:35:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
It does, just not in the case I'm trying. WTF?

[13:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know what "Assistive technologies must treat an article like a document in that the article must be processed like an application." means?

[13:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
context?

[13:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(the text itself I find baffling)

[13:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/#article

[13:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would assume "like a document" means "same as the document role"

[13:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
however, "processed like an application" seems to directly contradict that

[13:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because the "document" role seems to be defined mainly be contrasting its behavior with the "application" role

[13:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me fails to figure out what role="" <title> should have by default

[13:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen suggested that it should have no role and not allow a role

[13:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(along with other special elements like <script> and <meta> that are really part of the document's content presentation)

[13:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in VoiceOver, the title is read when reading the whole window, in the order in which it appears in the chrome, and not read at all when browsing the content area, which would in fact correspond to no role

[13:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
wait, things without roles aren't read out?

[13:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
that can't be right

[13:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
title doesn't fail to be read out because it has no role

[13:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
what happens if head,title{display:block} ?

[13:50:05.0000] <othermaciej>
it fails to be read out because it's not rendered

[13:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if title was visible, Safari would read it

[13:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
is there a role appropriate to normal prose content?

[13:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess no role means normal prose content, for things that are rendered

[13:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
seem that way

[13:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I could see the argument for giving title a role of heading instead, but the case where it is made visible seems pretty unusual

[14:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
this aria thing is going to be a lot of work, sigh

[14:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
time for lunch

[15:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs at the suckiness that is British trains

[15:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what role="" i should use for <input type=file>

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how to make radio buttons work in aria

[15:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ergh. £130 on three train tickets.

[15:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Inevitably, being Britain, the trains _will_ be late.)

[15:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders how much more he'll spend on trains in Sept

[15:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Hrm, I don't see anything appropriate, at least in http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/

[15:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
For files, at least.

[15:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
How the hell does it take 7 hours to get from Coventry to Leuchars?

[15:38:02.0000] <othermaciej_>
I think <input type="file"> can't be accurately represented by any existing ARIA role

[15:38:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(I <3 British trains)

[15:38:04.0000] <othermaciej_>
but you also can't fake a file input with anything else, by design

[15:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not sure how to represent <input type=radio> properly, as there's no requirement to have a "radiogroup" element.

[15:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gnedders: wtf?  Travelling across Britain north-south seems about twice as far as the distance between Houston and Dallas, which can be *driven* in just over 3 hours.

[15:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And that 'seems' is with the misrepresentative Mercator projection I'm looking at.

[15:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML radio button groups are implicit and don't have an element, which I guess doesn't quite match the ARIA "radio" role semantics

[15:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: British trains suck.

[15:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Though they suck less than American trains, as far as I can tell.

[15:42:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Our trains do suck, I must admit.

[15:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: The East Coast Main Line is decent, though, taking around 4.5 hours to get from London to Edinburgh

[15:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: As well as the Channel Tunnel Train Link, from London to the Channel Tunnel… but that's the only high speed line in Britain :\

[15:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: (Also: having a driving license helps at times.)

[15:43:02.0000] <annodomini>
In many cases, the American trains simply don't exist.

[15:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, Dr Beaching tried to make that true in Britain

[15:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  That still blows.  London to Edinburgh is 400 miles.  Houston to Dallas is 230 miles.  It takes about 3.5 hours to drive between houston and dallas.  It shoudl take about 6 to drive between london and edinburgh.

[15:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*Beeching

[15:44:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
trains *should* go faster than cars.

[15:44:04.0000] <gsnedders>
"More than 4,000 miles of railway and 3,000 stations closed in the decade following the report, a reduction of 25 per cent of route miles and 50 per cent of stations. To this day in railway circles and among older people, particularly in parts of the country that suffered most from cuts, Beeching's name is still synonymous with mass closure of railways and loss of many local services."

[15:44:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wait.  My brain just went crzy.

[15:44:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
4.5 hours is fine.

[15:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It's not, at all.

[15:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
This is Europe. It should have an average speed of at least 200 km/h on such a major route.

[15:45:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah.  Looks like it's average... about 90 mph.  150 km/h or so?

[15:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It's 632km (393 miles), with top speed of 200km/h (125mph).

[15:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It's also completely over capacity.

[15:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Bear in mind that most other countries in Europe have at least 300 km/h high speed lines)

[15:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, that sucks.

[15:53:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hey TabAtkins, how are you doin'?

[15:53:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Don't let it get'cha down! :-D

[15:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Doing good, JonathanNeal.

[15:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rewriting part of an intranet CMS because it's sucky and hard to navigate now that we have a lot of items in it.

[15:55:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Oh that's no fun, just rewriting the frontend or the backend or both?

[15:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just the front-end.  That back-end is just fine.  A touch crufty, but not enough to worry about.

[15:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And it is fun!  I get to stretch my information architect muscles.  ^_^

[15:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also, now, fixing a bug that I just discovered in my permissions manager.

[15:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Damn namespaces.

[16:07:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, most of the chatty folks here seem to be devs of one kind or another, that include you?

[16:08:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
of w3 or whatwg, I mean.

[16:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, I'm just webmaster for my company, and general webdev on the side.

[16:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't do any work on browsers or anything like that.

[16:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I do like participating in the evolution of the languages that I use.

[16:17:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, http://bugzilla.validator.nu/ is broken

[16:28:00.0000] <nessy>
midnight there ....

[16:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
same timezone then :)


2009-08-21
[17:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is there a reliable standard way to tell if a document is an HTML document or an XML document

[17:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
?

[17:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, with javascript?

[17:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
I've done that before. There's a technique that involves something like (document.createElement("html").tagName == "HTML") returns true for HTML, false for XHTML

[17:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I was hoping for something more elegant (and more importantly more efficient)

[17:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
this is another function I've used before:

[17:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
 var isHTML = (function() {

[17:29:02.0000] <Lachy>
  var htmlElement = document.getElementsByTagName("html").item(0);

[17:29:03.0000] <Lachy>
  if (htmlElement) {

[17:29:04.0000] <Lachy>
   return (htmlElement.tagName == "HTML");

[17:29:05.0000] <Lachy>
  } else {

[17:29:06.0000] <Lachy>
   return false;

[17:29:07.0000] <Lachy>
  }

[17:29:08.0000] <Lachy>
 })();

[17:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
document.documentElement.tagName == 'HTML'

[17:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Shouldn't that do the job?

[17:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, yeah

[17:32:02.0000] <jwalden_>
/me marvels at the complexities being proposed as an alternative to websocket

[17:32:03.0000] <Lachy>
I think there was a reason I did the more complicated method, but I can't remember what it was

[17:32:04.0000] <Rik`_>
Dashiva: XHTML documents would return true ?

[17:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
Rik`_, no because it's a case sensitive comparison

[17:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I'll see if making a local variable is viable - I'm not sure, because I think the code in question is processing nodes from other documents

[17:33:02.0000] <Rik`_>
Lachy: ok, I can create a document with HTML as the root node

[17:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
Rik`_, oh, yeah, that was the reason. By doing getElementsByTagName("html"); it ensures that no <HTML> elements in XML would be returned

[17:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
but the shorthand that Dashiva used would be reliable enough for most cases

[17:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Ah, right

[17:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You never know what some crazed XML user might decide to do

[17:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But I'd then prefer maciej's way, I think

[17:36:02.0000] <Dashiva>
document.createElement('html').tagName == 'HTML'

[17:36:03.0000] <Lachy>
that was also mine!

[17:36:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh

[17:36:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Right

[17:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You win again!

[17:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
but it's less efficient since it needs to create a whole new element

[17:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
in fact, the code above isn't very efficient either since it has to invoke a function

[17:37:03.0000] <Dashiva>
That seems like an exceedingly premature optimization, given that it's done once per page

[17:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I settled with the function since it was designed to execute only once, so the efficiency problem wasn't too bad

[17:39:01.0000] <heycam>
othermaciej, how about:  var isHTML = true; try { document.write('') } catch (e) { isHTML = false; }

[17:39:02.0000] <Lachy>
there were a whole lot more less efficient things in that old script

[17:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: HTML5 will allow document.write in XML documents, also that will erase the document

[17:40:00.0000] <heycam>
won't work if the document's finished parsing i suppose

[17:40:01.0000] <heycam>
yeah

[17:40:02.0000] <heycam>
othermaciej, oh will it?

[17:40:03.0000] <heycam>
but not currently right

[17:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
if the document has finished parsing, document.write() will implicitly document.open()

[17:41:00.0000] <heycam>
"oh will it?" => will html5 allow document.write in XML documents?

[17:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
The document.write(...)  method must act as follows:

[17:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
   1.

[17:41:03.0000] <Lachy>
      If the method was invoked on an XML document, throw an INVALID_ACCESS_ERR exception and abort these steps.

[17:41:04.0000] <heycam>
wonder how easy that is to do with a standard sax parser

[17:41:05.0000] <Lachy>
so, no. document.write() cannot be used in XML

[17:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: ah, I thought it was going to be allowed

[17:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I must be confused or out of date

[17:42:02.0000] <Dashiva>
innerHTML and friends will, though

[17:42:03.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, you're out of date. There was a time it was considered, but it turned out to be unworkable

[17:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
which is good, IMHO. document.write() needs to die

[17:43:01.0000] <heycam>
Lachy, we should replace it with document.ungetc() instead :)

[17:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
brilliant! Just what we need, more functions that mess directly with the input stream

[17:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if we're going to expose all the wonders of stdio, we can't forget gets()

[17:46:00.0000] <heycam>
heh yes that's a must

[17:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
let's just let authors write their own javascript based parsers that can handle the whole input stream themselves

[22:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
good evening everyone

[22:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so what's the deal with http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/48 (quotes and <q>)?

[23:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: did that not got resolved by the spec changing to say that UAs should generate quotation marks for <q> ?

[23:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: yes, it did

[23:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems like that issue can be closed

[23:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: yes, I'm going to propose that

[23:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure what the status on http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/63 is

[23:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess it's not complete

[23:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I think issue 63 can be closed out as being no longer an issue for the HTML5 spec itself.

[23:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: the HTML5 spec currently specifically says to send an Origin header and what its exact contents should be - it doesn't defer to Adam Barth's draft afaict

[23:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I seem to remember that the HTML5 spec sorta defined the contents of the Origin header inline

[23:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to look

[23:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: yes, I think maybe it still does

[23:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I think Hixie plans to update it for the Sec-From draft or something

[23:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, it's not a gimme like the others I'm gonna suggest

[23:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, maybe not

[23:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
for Origin/Sec-From I'm waiting for instructions from abarth

[23:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as that goes, it seems to me that since the HTTPbis WG and others at IETF have made it clear that it's not welcome at the IETF, the most viable option remaining seems to be spec'ing it in the WebApps WG

[23:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
did they object to Sec-From?

[23:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I know they didn't like Origin

[23:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway

[23:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am about to suggest closing the following (one per email, yay): http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/48 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/51 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/53 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/54 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/56

[23:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/60 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/61 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/64 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/66 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/75

[23:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hi all!

[23:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hi

[23:43:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
How are you doing, othermaciej?

[23:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
JonathanNeal: not bad

[23:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
just sent another round of proposed issue closures

[23:44:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Are you another developer, or another type-of html5 spec writer?

[23:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I don't know if there was ever any discussion about sec-from with the HTTP Wg or IETF

[23:45:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Cool, I admit, I'm very new to html5 elements, aria, all the new stuff, which is why I'm hanging around here, hoping to learn and get feedback as I figure it out (hopefully).

[23:45:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: but I would expect it would meet pretty much the same reception

[23:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
JonathanNeal: I'm a browser engine developer (on WebKit), and W3C HTML WG self-appointed petty bureaucrat

[23:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: one complaint about Origin was that it just replicated Referer, but Sec-From carries more information

[23:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: yeah, but another complaint was the whole "CSRF is not a problem for the Web" thing, so it's very hard to imagine getting support for them if they can't even agree about the importance of the problem that it's meant to address

[23:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: anyway, I agree we will have to go forum shopping if the HTTPbis WG is not enthusiastic about it

[23:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[23:48:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
othermaciej, that's awesome.  I'm a lacky developer for Liferay who got a voice in moving our new site and a lot of our core product (which is a web-based portal) to the HTML5 doctype.  I'm hoping to make it much more than just a doctype change, but to take advantage of some of the new elements and recommended semantics.

[23:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: is Liferay the opposite of a death ray?

[23:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
(I bet you get asked that question a lot)

[23:52:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
MikeSmith, yes, actually, we are the opposite of a Deathray.

[23:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: excellent. you guys should commission a sci-fi movie where a mad scientist builds a liferay instead of a deathray.

[23:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
except I guess it would have to then be a perfectly-sane scientist building it

[23:55:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Don't let the wikipedia entry fool you.  We may specialize in professional open-source portals, but that's just a front for our giant Liferay, intended to create entire planets!

[23:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[23:57:01.0000] <annevk2>
MikeSmith, i'll make the draft ready for pub on monday, just so you know

[23:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: yeah, I assumed you were on top of it already

[23:58:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Then we will shot the draft with our Liferay, and that's what we call "adoption"

[23:59:00.0000] <annevk2>
MikeSmith, I'm going MIA for a few days :)

[23:59:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
annevk2, you work on the html5 document?

[23:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk2: oh, OK. I hope it's something fun

[00:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
can somebody remind me how to get web-apps-tracker to show more revisions than just what it shows by default?

[00:05:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
May I ask, MikeSmith, what is a web-apps-tracker?

[00:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker

[00:06:01.0000] <annevk2>
MikeSmith, should be :)

[00:06:02.0000] <annevk2>
JonathanNeal, not really, I edit html5-diff

[00:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I'm befuddled as to why some revisions don't have the Validators flag set

[00:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=3626&to=3627

[00:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
"Drop cite= from <section> and <article>"

[00:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
the annotations are about 80% accurate

[00:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
i often write the commit messages without paying much attention

[00:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: OK, that's less befuddling

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
here's some irony

[00:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i recently discovered that a bunch of my whatwg mail has been caught in my spam filters

[00:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's almost all mail from googlers...

[00:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
(and gmail is my spam filter)

[00:11:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
MikeSmith, okay I get it, it helps you track the progress of html5?

[00:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: yeah

[00:11:02.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, presumably goog spams a lot :)

[00:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: sounds like it's time you considered another mail provider

[00:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe hotmail

[00:12:02.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, the job hunter email from google also carried "THIS IS NOT SPAM" or some such in the subject line...

[00:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
(not sure job hunter is the right word here, oh well, I should leave)

[00:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: what's up with http://bugzilla.validator.nu/ ?

[00:14:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
What's the difference between bugzilla validator and html5 validator?

[00:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: hmm. looks like some Ubuntu unsmoothness

[00:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I wanted to file a bug for http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7265

[00:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
plus some other stuff

[00:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yeah, I'll put my sysadmin hat on right now

[00:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sorry about the trouble

[00:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[00:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
no problem man. I know you got a lot on your plate

[00:16:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: one is a bug-tracking system for the validator, and the other is the actual validator

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so, I have a backup of the bug database. no problem there

[00:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but the Ubuntu packages have managed to break the Bugzilla cgis

[00:21:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
MikeSmith, okay I get it.  And that validator always says valid html5 + aria something, does that have to do with the new role attributes, for accessibility?

[00:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: yes

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: it says "HTML5 + ARIA" as opposed to just "HTML5", because the HTML5 spec doesn't quite yet import ARIA officially

[00:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm actually working on that right now

[00:28:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The role IDs as attributes themselves seem pretty backwards compatible with IE, from what I saw in the docs, am I right?

[00:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: in the sense that they are gracefully ignored by old IE, yes

[00:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: the aria-foo properties hit the ariaFoo bug in IE < 8, IIRC

[00:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: also, due to selector limitations in old IE, you can't trigger styles on states and properties the way envisioned

[00:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
huh. Ubuntu has uninstalled the bugzilla package!

[00:30:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Not without some js hacks, but when it comes to those tags, are they intended to be read by old ie, or the accessibility reader?

[00:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
argh. packages.ubuntu.com is down

[00:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
grr

[00:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. there's a separate bugzilla3 package now

[00:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if it can pick up the DB

[00:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone happen to know if the Right Thing happens if I have config files for package 'bugzilla' in place and install package 'bugzilla3'?

[00:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe I should just stick to the ancient version...

[00:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yt?

[01:00:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I've been using <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" />, but someone said it could be shorter.  When I tried the shorter one that they gave me, it failed validation.  Do you guys know anything about this?

[01:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
<meta charset="utf-8"> should validate. does it not?

[01:01:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'll try it right now.

[01:02:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hsivonen, thanks that worked!

[01:03:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It gave me a warning about it though, it said "No Character Encoding Found!            Falling back to           UTF-8."

[01:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: which validator?

[01:04:00.0000] <foolip>
Has anyone managed to use the spec annotation system in Gnome? Alt+double left click is supposed to be the shortcut, but alt+left click drags the window...

[01:04:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
validator.w3.org, does that make me bad?

[01:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: validator.w3.org has a bit legacy Perl layer between your stuff and the HTML5 validator

[01:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: what you are seeing is the Perl layer being HTML5-unaware

[01:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=5992

[01:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And how long does something like that usually take to get ammended or fixed?

[01:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: unpredictable

[01:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: MikeSmith would have better guesses

[01:07:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I liked what someone just wrote in another channel: "The nice thing about the web is you can use technologies that aren't standard yet, and the chances of future browsers breaking it is the same as if they were standardized."

[01:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: the maintainer of the Perl layer of the W3C validator has a fix in the works for the issue

[01:11:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So MikeSmith, did I already ask what you do too?

[01:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe

[01:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I couple people have reported that problem

[01:12:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, if neither of us remember for certain, what is it that you do then?

[01:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I made a patch for it but my patch just makes the Perl layer completely skip doing any encoding check for HTML5 documents

[01:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: what is it that I do?

[01:15:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yea, like "I work on the html5 project", or for whatwg, or you know, you tell me.

[01:16:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
For instance, I make the thing that stops the Deathray.

[01:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: what was the problem with your patch? failing with UTF-16?

[01:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
betting pool: will the HTML WG issue tracker have more than 30 issues 2 weeks from now, or fewer?

[01:20:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
According to google, you might write the html5 markup language.  Hmm, see that's fun.

[01:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh joy. It seems bugzilla doesn't upgrade its database schema automatically: http://bugzilla.validator.nu/

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's alive! (but CSS-naked)

[01:25:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, anyway, sorry if I offended you.

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: bugzilla is back. thanks for the heads-up

[01:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: no problem with my patch except that it worked around the problem by having the perl layer not do any encoding check at all for HTML5 docs. But Ville told me he has a fix in the works for the perl layer such that it actually parses <meta charset="foo"> as expected

[01:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I see

[01:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: big thanks for fixing the bugzilla

[01:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me prepares to embark on a bug-filing frenzy

[01:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: UI looks fancier

[01:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I don't look forward to having to encourage Larry to update IRIbis

[01:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(maybe Sam can do that)

[01:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: Ubuntu pulled the 'bugzilla' package. this is 'bugzilla3'

[01:38:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[01:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
would have been nice of them to have some apt hook automate the upgrade...

[01:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm surprised it doesn't

[01:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: my official title is "Special Missions Subsection Junior Interim Floor Manager"

[01:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: well until he does, i'm pointing to danc's doc, and if that doesn't progress either, i'm stuffing it all back into html5.

[01:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I don't personally have a problem with that

[01:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm surprised Micah Dubinko's Distributed Extensibility proposal hasn't made it to public-html

[01:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: do you remember what the subject line may have been on your last comments to Larry? I'm having trouble finding the email

[01:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: did Micah respond yet to your xml-dev message?

[01:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: no

[01:42:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I got warnocked

[01:42:04.0000] <hsivonen>
and the whole thread died there

[01:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think Micah was away at the Balisage conference

[01:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
along with other XML folk

[01:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Balisage ended on Aug 14

[01:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I chat with Micah sometimes. So I'll bug him about it

[01:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me assumes the proceedings of Balisage are in English

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: http://www.w3.org/mid/Pine.LNX.4.62.0907281952410.3189⊙hdc

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: thanks!

[01:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's a couple of other issues that have come up, too

[01:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
it seems the \ handling was dropped in larry's draft

[01:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
and we need to make sure that IRIs can be absolute URLs (right now the algorithm as defined makes only ASCII strings "absolute")

[01:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the latter of those is in your email

[01:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't remember if \ was

[01:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
do you have emails for any other issues that have come up? I'm composing a nag email to Larry.

[01:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: is it appropriate to obsolete a full media type registration in favor of a provisional registration?

[01:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I would think that's only appropriate once HTML5's registration becomes a final registration, which I believe happens at the PR transition or something like that

[01:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: right, but if we need a one-sentence RFC at that time, it might be a good idea to put it on whatever IETF track it needs to be on as a draft

[01:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: makes sense to me - I don't know how these things work

[01:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: apparently an RFC can be declared "Historic" without there being a superseding RFC: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt

[01:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(section 4.2.4)

[01:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ok. I guess that solves the problem

[01:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: 6.4 describes the procedure - it requires an IESG action apparently

[02:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I sent a nag note to Larry - feel free to follow up linking emails with other critical feedback, or if you point me to them I can do so

[02:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: would some term like "HTML URL" be acceptable, to disambiguate from the standard-official flavor of URL? (I agree URI/IRI/LEIRI are full of fail and confusion)

[02:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: there's nothing HTML-specific about these

[02:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I could suggest "Web URL" but I am not sure that would make anyone happy

[02:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not saying "bla bla Web URL" every time i need to refer to a URL

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
these "URLs" have the same relationship to the URI/IRI specs as HTML5 does to HTML4

[02:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hopefully few enough people care about this that the terminology issue can just go away

[02:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
they're not some sort of browser thing or whatever

[02:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
hopefully

[02:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, bed time

[02:16:05.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:16:06.0000] <othermaciej>
good night!

[02:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm off to bed myself, goodnight folks

[02:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://camp.woothemes.com/2009/08/29-designers-developers-have-their-say-on-html5-css3/ is interesting

[02:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm surprised how much they like the new structural elements

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Despite the dislike on ALA

[02:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: It doesn't seem that surprising (ALA notwithstanding). They are people who work at the markup level a lot. Things that help make their markup more understandable/easier to maintain have tangible benefits for them

[02:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Not to mention the "Now with Extra Semantic Goodness (TM)" factor

[02:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: please take a look at http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/status.html and let me know if that's what you had in mind

[03:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: I don't see any change...

[03:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: I think you might to to force-reload to bypass your cache

[03:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me tries the gambit of switching browser

[03:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh yeah, that looks perfect

[03:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
Thanks!

[03:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
(does it work for anyone else in Opera? Maybe we have an xslt bug...)

[03:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: I think I had the same problem with it in other browsers

[03:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
the code readability improvements with the new structural elements was one of the many reasons we went with those, instead of using <div role="..."> for everthing. It's good to see we were right about that.

[05:09:00.0000] <foolip>
does anyone have a good resource or test cases for how xmlns:prefix is handled in text/html?

[05:10:00.0000] <foolip>
am I correct to assume that it doesn't affect rendering but only some subtleties about the namespace in which that attribute ends up in?

[05:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: there are some demos in http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/

[05:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: look for "xmlns"

[05:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: it doesn't affect anything outside SVG and MathML subtrees

[05:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: xmlns:link is special in SVG and MathML subtrees

[05:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but otherwise, xmlns:prefix becomes a no-namespace attribute with local name "xmlns:prefix" and that's it

[05:12:01.0000] <foolip>
doesn't sound like a serious issue

[05:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: issue for what?

[05:13:00.0000] <foolip>
so from a scripts point of view the only difference is getAttribute("xmlns:prefix") or getAttributeNS("http://that/xmlns/namespace", "xmlns:prefix") depending on text/html or application/xhtml+xml namespace?

[05:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: no.

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if you use stuff like lookupNamespaceURI, xmlns:prefix attributes in text/html don't participate

[05:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but in application/xhtml+xml they do

[05:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
basically, in text/html xmlns:prefix is garbage and isn't senstive to anything that http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace attributes are sensitive to

[05:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
furthermore, no-namespace attribute with colons in them can't be serialized as XML

[05:16:00.0000] <foolip>
ah, so for text/html you'd have to traverse parent nodes looking for "xmlns:*" attributes and emulate the behavior?

[05:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: yes

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
basically, you can't use any DOM Level 2 or Level 3 features consistently across text/html and application/xhtml+xml with xmlns:prefix

[05:17:01.0000] <foolip>
can a script know if it's in XML DOM or HTML DOM?

[05:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: yes

[05:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: createElement("div").tagName == "DIV"

[05:18:01.0000] <foolip>
as you might guess, this is all in relation to RDFa and I'm trying to understand precisely what the problems are beyond "namespace don't work"

[05:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I guessed

[05:18:03.0000] <foolip>
ah right, that would work

[05:18:04.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: the party line at the RDF-in-XHTML-TF is that you should only use DOM Level 1 when dealing with RDFa

[05:19:00.0000] <foolip>
hsivonen: but getAttribute("xmlns:prefix") wouldn't work in XML would it?

[05:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
which isn't a great way to sweep the issue under the rug in browser-internal APIs that are more like Level 2

[05:19:02.0000] <foolip>
the attribute itself isn't in the null namespace?

[05:19:03.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: IIRC, it does in browser impls

[05:20:00.0000] <foolip>
hmm, I never quite understood the gory details of getAttribute/getAttributeNS, need to experiment

[05:20:01.0000] <foolip>
gsnedders, you mentioned that IE does wonky with : in attribute names, do you have any more information on this?

[05:21:00.0000] <foolip>
+things

[05:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. looks like I don't have a demo for getAttribute in XHTML

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: anyway, this is an "here be dragons" area, and it's a terrible idea that RDFa went poking at it

[05:23:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
foolip: It's specifically xmlns:* it's whacky on. Dunno much more detail myself.

[05:23:01.0000] <foolip>
right, but I'm trying to get a more precise understanding about the nature of these dragons

[05:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus

[05:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: remember to test getAttibute with parser-inserted attributes, setAttribute-inserted and setAttributeNS-inserted

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess setAttributeNode, too if you want really evil tests

[05:32:00.0000] <foolip>
hsivonen: thanks for the tips, it'll be a fun weekend with this :)

[05:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I wonder if I've sent spec feedback about document.written charset meta

[05:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. bugzilla.validator.nu switched from English to German...

[05:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: are you using a browser that broadcasts German as the preferred language?

[05:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: nope

[05:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
though I think I have my Minefield set to Japanese as preferred

[05:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok. then it's picking it from your browser

[05:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, that's weird

[05:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's not showing me anything in German

[05:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nor Japanese

[05:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: it seems it thinks that "Site Default" email language is now German

[06:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, maybe it's picking it up from my KDE environment

[06:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
some secret KDE feature to promote the German language more widely

[06:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I fixed it

[06:00:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[06:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I think it was because de sorts to the top of the list in de, en, fr

[06:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[06:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: oops. look like I omitted a "not" when I meant to say it is not picking the default from your browser

[06:01:03.0000] <hsivonen>
sorry

[06:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I was looking forward to learning German by using bugzilla

[06:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so much for that plan..

[06:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: you can still tweak personal prefs!

[06:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, in that case I think I'll choose to use it to learn Finnish instead

[06:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sorry, only de, en, fr available

[06:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: where's v.nu checking the format of the <time> element? in the htmlparser and xmlparser code?

[06:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: attribute is in datatype lib

[06:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I knew the attribute was

[06:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: element content is under non-schema somewhere implemented as a SAX holder for a datatype

[06:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[06:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so, as far I can tell, it doesn't allow any element content, e.g., <time><i>2008</i></time> -- it only allows character data.

[06:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
right?

[06:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: hmm. that's not how I read the spec back when I implemented checking

[06:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe the spec changed since

[06:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: if <time><i>2008</i></time> weren't allowed, the holder thing would be unnecessary

[06:32:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, the spec currently says that it's the textContent of the element

[06:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
erp

[06:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe my mistake

[06:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
damn

[06:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: sorry for the noise

[06:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
my mistake

[07:23:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: I guess you know that HTML 5 parser sometimes gives adjacent text nodes?

[07:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: by design based on Philip`'s spec feedback, right?

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like the xmlns:prefix discussion triggered a flurry of tweets...

[07:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://twitter.com/shelleypowers

[07:25:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: Uh, no idea

[07:28:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
hsivonen: <b>Test</i>Test should still give one text node, no?

[07:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: why?

[07:29:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Or am I missing which feedback you meant?)

[07:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. that one might be a bug per spec

[07:30:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That is a bug per spec, as there is no node inserted by the parser between those two character tokens

[07:31:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
FWIW: http://gsnedders.html5.org/html5lib-tests/runner.html

[07:32:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Which works more cross-browser than http://html5.org/parsing-tests/testrunner.htm for me)

[07:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<audio style=display:inline>hello</audio>

[07:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe audio should be display:none !important in the ua style sheet (like noscript)?

[07:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
audio:not([controls]) that is

[08:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
what's the use case for createImageData(imagedata) again?

[08:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
afaict it's just convenience for createImageData(imagedata.width, imagedata.height)

[08:06:00.0000] <foolip>
with some added confusion (hey this might a copy constructor!)

[08:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wonder if these are the sorts of rules that make the guys building CSS engines wince for their performance:

[08:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
#faqs-by-section input.lang-chooser.en-US:checked ~ dl ul.entries > li:not(.en-us)

[08:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
could have been worse; at least you used a child selector

[08:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
True.

[08:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
So there are rumors of a document containg all the IDL from all web specs. Does anyone know where it is? Or is there some other way of finding out a comprehensive list of all objects that should implement a given interface

[08:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think I asked about this before, but I'll ask again - I got a request for a German-speaking presenter to speak at an event in Berlin on September 14

[08:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
presentation about HTML5

[08:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
any recommendations?

[08:56:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Coincidently, I may happen to be in Berlin then. I do not, however, speak German. (Nor, for that matter, am I any good at presenting in any language.)

[08:56:01.0000] <myakura>
I got a request, too. On Oct 29 in Tokyo, though.

[08:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders|work: just wing it

[08:58:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
MikeSmith: No

[08:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
you can learn german by setting your bugzilla locale preferences to "de"

[08:58:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's that simple

[08:58:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have it on good authority that if you just sound like a monster screaming into a staticky walkietalkie while underwater, German people will understand you.

[08:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
That's Danish

[09:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if WebIDL will be updated to use ES5 terminology

[09:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Interesting.

[09:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you ever get a chance to hear a Norwegian person imitating a Danish person, I recommend grabbing that chance

[09:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hehe, k.

[09:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Why wait?

[09:04:01.0000] <Dashiva>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-mOy8VUEBk

[09:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: hahaha

[09:09:01.0000] <jcranmer>
knowing neither Danish nor Norwegian

[09:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
myakura: what is the October event?

[09:09:03.0000] <jcranmer>
I can honestly say that what I got out of it was "Norwegians poking fun at Danes"

[09:09:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I also got "people over there talk funny".

[09:10:00.0000] <myakura>
@MikeSmith: the one in Ginza, CSS Nite

[09:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[09:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I said it to myself in a thick Texan drawl, so I don't think I really get much from that.

[09:10:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
myakura: so you going to do it?

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: You can't disturb me much when I'm not actually looking at IRC for 23 hours

[09:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I could hunt you down and disturb you

[09:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
I just chose not to

[09:13:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I guess a good US analogue is Southerners poking fun at Harvard graduates

[09:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I guess there's some buffering and you'd need to flush it, perhaps by closing the thingy, or something, I don't know really

[09:13:03.0000] <jcranmer>
"I go to Hahvahd, so I can't say an ah'

[09:13:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me goes away again

[09:13:05.0000] <myakura>
MikeSmith: yeah

[09:13:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me wonders where away is, in case he needs to track Philip`down

[09:13:07.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, if paul_irish reads IRC logs then he should probably email comments to me

[09:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: Spain

[09:14:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dammit, jgraham was right!

[09:14:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(I have secret communication channels with jgraham, obviously.)

[09:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jcranmer: Yeah, that's probably right.

[09:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
jcranmer: It seems quite common in scandinavia to be bemused by Danish pronounciation. It seems like it is actually quite odd and not _just_ people taking the piss for other people taking differntley

[09:15:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
jcranmer: Though we like making fun of people from Minnesota more.  They talk *really* funny.

[09:15:03.0000] <jcranmer>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahvahd... that actually redirects to Harvard

[09:15:04.0000] <jgraham>
e.g. apparently the language is changing so fast that you can identify when expats left denmark from their voice alone

[09:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jcranmer: *awesome*

[09:17:00.0000] <jcranmer>
the biggest thing I know about those people is that they call soda "pop"

[09:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
They have an "ae"/"ah" swap somewhat ("I'll get a baeg of bahgels"), and stretch their "o" into a long "oo".  "I'm from Minnesooota."

[09:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I spent a few weeks touring Europe with a group of minnesotans.  Much hilarity ensued.

[09:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Unfortunately for them I'm from Houston, which homogenizes my accent into basically American Standard with a touch of drawl.

[10:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anybody having trouble now getting the whatwg version of the spec to load

[10:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yes. 

[10:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
did Acid3 get slashdotted again or something?

[10:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
More like dreamhost is up to their old tricks, I'd guess

[10:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: I think it's Loki taking revenge. He got PO'ed because we were making fun of Norskis who make fun of Danes

[10:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Is Loki from Iceland? or from Denmark? or just generally Scandinavian?

[10:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
does Finland have gods?

[10:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yes. Ukko and Akka at least

[10:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me searches

[10:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukko

[10:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akka_%28Spirit%29

[10:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: Ilmarinen sounds cooler

[10:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yeah, ukko means an old man these days

[10:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and akka an old woman (with a derogatory connotation)

[10:46:00.0000] <foolip>
hmm, whatwg.org down?

[10:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: Scandinavia was more or less one culture back then, yeah

[10:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Finland always has to be different, though

[13:16:00.0000] <abarth>
is whatwg.org down?

[13:16:01.0000] <abarth>
i can't seem to load the web site

[13:17:00.0000] <tantek>
I can't load it either but this site claims whatwg.org is up: http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/whatwg.com

[13:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
tantek: That's .com

[13:19:01.0000] <gavin_>
down for me too

[13:19:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It claims whatwg.org is down :)

[13:19:03.0000] <abarth>
ha

[13:19:04.0000] <abarth>
that site is great!

[13:20:00.0000] <abarth>
i like how it defaults to google.com

[13:20:01.0000] <annodomini>
I can ping it, but can't get it to respond to HTTP

http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2009/08/21/some-unexpected-private-server-downtime/

[13:21:01.0000] <annodomini>
Possibly relevant?

[13:23:00.0000] <tantek>
ah, good catch Dashiva

[14:25:00.0000] <nikola_tesla>
I've got a question relating to <canvas>: Essentially, is there any clever trick to use that can allow click events to pass through transparent portions of a canvas element? Similar to the way SVG works?

[14:27:00.0000] <nikola_tesla>
I have a project that uses <canvas> to draw some overlay elements on screen that are absolutely positioned, many on top of each other. The canvas dimensinos overlay on areas that are transparent, leaving the user to think they can access the underlying overlay. This doesn't happen obviously.

[14:28:00.0000] <nikola_tesla>
I was thinking about maybe creating some kind of transparent event layer over the entire screen to simulate this, but that sounds kind of dumb. Alternatively I guess my only last option is to move to SVG.

[14:28:01.0000] <nikola_tesla>
any thoughts would be appreciated.

[14:42:00.0000] <nikola_tesla>
Sorry if this is the wrong forum, I was directed here. But if this is the proper place for such discussion and you have an idea, please email me at robotsu⊙gc

[15:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how the yahoo/bing thing affects searchmonkey

[15:30:00.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, I was speaking to a collegue today who had an interesting, though not entirely convincing, proposal for a <pdf> element...

[15:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy_: can you stick a google2569a0eb653e4cf1.html file at the root of the blog.whatwg.org domain?

[15:30:02.0000] <Lachy_>
His use case was for being able to embed PDF documents in web pages, and having native support in the browsers.

[15:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to register the site in the google webmaster tools console

[15:31:00.0000] <Lachy_>
like what http://www.scribd.com/ is doing, but without flash

[15:31:01.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, ok, will do it now

[15:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
isn't "iframe" enough to do that?

[15:31:03.0000] <Lachy_>
just an empty file with that name?

[15:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[15:31:05.0000] <Lachy_>
that's what I told him

[15:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, safari seems to do it fine...

[15:31:07.0000] <Lachy_>
yeah, I know, that was also mentioned. I was just passing along the discussion, in case he decides to present it anyway

[15:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[15:32:01.0000] <Lachy_>
http://blog.whatwg.org/google2569a0eb653e4cf1.html

[15:33:00.0000] <Lachy_>
I also questioned him about whether or not an API for controlling the PDF was essential, similar to <video>, but he just seemed to say yes without being able to explain why

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[15:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks Lachy_ 

[15:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, iframes never occur to me for things like embedding PDFs.

[15:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, I think the problem with using iframes now is that most browsers lack native support for PDF

[15:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
and, IIRC, results in a save as dialog as soon as the page tries to load

[15:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but most people have an acceptable plugin already installed (in a crazy world where the adobe plugin is 'acceptable').

[15:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok i resubmitted the blog for the index

[15:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, most Mac users wouldn't have the Adobe viewer installed, since Preview.app works just fine for most needs

[15:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
how do mac users handle a normal pdf link?

[15:40:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Does Preview.app intercept those or something?

[15:40:03.0000] <Lachy>
depends on the browser

[15:40:04.0000] <Lachy>
Safari just opens it within the browser itself,

[15:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Firefox and Opera offer to download the file or open with the default app

[15:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
K.

[16:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
gotta love how aria's role=img isn't the same as <img>

[16:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's funny

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
also <marquee> is not a role=marquee

[16:12:00.0000] <tlsa>
Hixie: i dunno if this is of any interest http://wiki.netsurf-browser.org/Spec/HTML5_Alignment

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that would be good to send to the list

[16:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm always happy to make the language clearer where it's opaque

[16:14:00.0000] <tlsa>
also, it doesn't mention how html aligment does not propagate into TABLE descendants

[16:16:00.0000] <tlsa>
also, we have test cases:

[16:16:01.0000] <tlsa>
http://source.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/netsurftest/other/aligntests/index.html

[16:16:02.0000] <tlsa>
for determining how other browsers handled html alignment & css propertys

[16:16:03.0000] <tlsa>
results here: http://source.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/netsurftest/other/aligntests/AlignTestResults.txt

[16:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, definitely send that feedback to the list

[16:17:01.0000] <tlsa>
ok, which list?

[16:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg⊙wo, or public-html⊙wo, or any of the other feedback mechanisms mentioned at the top of the spec

[16:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
easiest to subscribe to is the first of those

[16:21:01.0000] <tlsa>
right, i'll post tomorrow

[16:21:02.0000] <tlsa>
/me --> bed

[16:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
thanks!

[16:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
ARIA is confusing

[16:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
listitem is defined as "A single item in a list, listbox, or directory"

[16:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
but is not allows as a child of a "listbox"

[16:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
s/allows/allowed

[16:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: That looks like a mistake on listitem.  Listbox is only supposed to contain option as children.

[16:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
does <section> map to role=region?

[16:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
role=section is abstract...

[16:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  The listbox is actually really confusing.  It has both list and select as parents.  List has to have listitem or group children, but selects have option children generally.

[16:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: role=region seems to be appropriate only if the <section> doesn't map to any of the landmark roles.

[16:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
what other landmark roles might apply?

[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
main and search?

[16:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
application, main, search

[16:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
contentinfo maybe

[16:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
not application, surely

[16:30:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
maybe contentinfo if <footer> isn't appropriate

[16:30:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
oh hrm, you're right.  application should be reserved for <article>

[16:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it should be reserved for <html>

[16:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me laughs at how well people manage to agree on this

[16:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
A single page can have a document and application section, though.

[16:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
it can?

[16:31:03.0000] <othermaciej>
couldn't a page have multiple "applications" if it embeds widgets?

[16:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
i guess

[16:31:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
that's what I'm getting out of the section, at least.

[16:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
the definition of "application" is "A region declared as a web application, as opposed to a web document."

[16:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
conversely, couldn't an "application" contain a "document", like GMail's content view showing a mail message?

[16:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah they have that as an example

[16:32:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
possible example of document containing an application: blog with a comment form?

[16:32:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
rich comment form, that is.

[16:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
a blog with sidebar widgets

[16:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
would be a document containing an application

[16:34:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: I would bring up the listitem/listbox thing as a bug.  There's no way to reconcile those two.

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
the draft i'm looking at doesnt

[16:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
say where to send comments

[16:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/ says to send it to the pfwg list

Woo, I like <audio>.  Much easier to work with than my flashplayer thing.

[18:02:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, has anyone written a script that checks for audio tags, support for audio tags, and swaps them out with flash players for incompatible versions?

[18:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm certain they have.

[18:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I can't point you to any.

[18:04:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Should be basically the same as the many scripts that do so for <video>.

[18:07:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Oh they've done video, you have an example of that one?

[18:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, a beautiful girl is waiting for me in Fullerton and I gotta go.  Have a great weekend, TabAtkins.

[19:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll have to review later

[19:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
looks like a good start

[19:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, you sure you want <div> to default to role=presentation?

[19:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
pretty sure

[19:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[19:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That seems to imply that the content has *no* semantics, rather than just that the content doesn't have defined semantics.

[19:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
isn't that exactly what <div> means?

[19:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It means the latter, not the former.

[19:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand the distinction

[19:15:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
presentation means that the content is *entirely* decorative, without any hope of semantics being applied.

[19:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
role=presentation just means "skip the element when mapping it to the accessibility API"

[19:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
as I understand it, role=presentation means that even things inside the element are considered to have no semantics

[19:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
<div>, on the other hand, just has no semantics - it's a default for when the language fails, not an active declaration that something is inherently void of semantics.

[19:16:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
::points to othermaciej::

[19:16:04.0000] <othermaciej>
i.e. skips the element and its contents

[19:16:05.0000] <othermaciej>
but my understanding could be wrong

[19:16:06.0000] <Hixie>
your understandings both seem to contradict the spec

[19:16:07.0000] <Hixie>
i can't see where it says anything abotu descendants

[19:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
and (notwithstanding that i've made the example invalid in html5) they have an example showing this: http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/#presentation

[19:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm, you're right.  The spec does allow accessibility APIs to still read the contents.

[19:17:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Never mind, then.  That seems appropriate.

[19:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hiyou are right

[19:17:04.0000] <othermaciej>
er

[19:17:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you are right

[19:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dur, they even have a good example right there, with an <li role=presentation> containing an <a role=listitem>.

[19:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it's a moderately good example, since as i said, i just made that example invalid in html5

[19:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, because you've constained <li> to be either listitem or treeitem

[19:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
(<li role=presentation> and <a role=treeitem> both violate the "strong native semantics")

[19:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if i should make all the inline elements have No Role, instead of leaving them open like now

[19:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: why don't you allow lists as menus?

[19:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  At the very least, make <span> role=presentation with an override, same as <div>

[19:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: lists as menus?

[19:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<ul>/<ol> as role=menu

[19:24:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
presumably

[19:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
<li> with a menuitem role for instance

[19:24:04.0000] <othermaciej>
and <ul> with role=menu

[19:24:05.0000] <othermaciej>
since people commonly use list markup for things that are in fact menus (but not either context menus or toolbars)

[19:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i meant to allow that with <menu> <li>

[19:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm, I wonder if that works anywhere yet?

[19:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i appear to have forgotten to allow the <li> part of that

[19:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
<menu><li> works in everything back to like netscape 1

[19:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the <li> part was the aspect I noticed

[19:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, right, isn't that just a reclaiming of an old element?

[19:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
<menu><li> seems reasonable

[19:26:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Agreed.

[19:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: yeah

[19:26:05.0000] <othermaciej>
and I forgot about <menu>'s no-type state

[19:26:06.0000] <othermaciej>
all right, I'm off

[19:26:07.0000] <othermaciej>
later folks

[19:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
later

[19:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually, turns out i don't have to do anything for <menu><li>

[19:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
well, i suppose i should make it role=presentaitonal

[19:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[19:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
actuall making <div> and <span> vanish is going to cause issues with the many global attributes

[19:29:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm.  Is the only difference between dialog and alertdialog that the latter should act modal?

[19:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll remove the role=presentation after all

[19:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: something to do with focus, it seems

[19:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
nah, that's between alert and dialog (dialog should have focus).

[19:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
i think alertdialog is just dialog but modal

[19:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The aria spec I'm reading recommends that, when the entire document is itself a role=document, that should be placed on <body>, not <html>

[19:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
same with role=application

[19:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
it says "root note for content"

[19:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
root node, rather

[19:32:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
But then explicitly gives <body> as an example

[19:32:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#document

[19:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i see the example

[19:32:06.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what to make of it

[19:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
the <head> is content too

[19:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
the root node is <html>

[19:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me shrugs

[19:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
also, that should is not bold and capitalised...

[19:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if it is meant to be a SHOULD or not

[19:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, <title>, <meta>, <style> all have strong semantic of "no role"

[19:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
presumably <script> and <link> would be similar?

[19:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh did i not add <script>?

[19:34:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
So what content would remain in <head> that would be meaningful?

[19:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
<link> is not no-role, it's link

[19:34:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, duh.

[19:34:06.0000] <Hixie>
i'm gonna remove the no role ones, i think

[19:34:07.0000] <Hixie>
at least some of them

[19:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Add that too, then.

[19:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<link>, that is

[19:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
<link> is a link, i'm not removing that

[19:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
why would we remove it?

[19:35:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know, but it's not in the document right now at all.

[19:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
how so?

[19:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's the first entry in the table

[19:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
a, area, link

[19:36:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Gah, of course, the *one* entry with multiple elements.

[19:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'll split them into three

[19:36:05.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[19:36:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, the <h1>-<h6> block made me expect one element per line

[19:36:07.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[19:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was originally going to just have "elements that are hyperlinks"

[19:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
and added the element names explicitly, not sure why

[19:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd keep <style> and <script> as No role, but either remove <title> or give it heading.

[19:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
why keep them as no role?

[19:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
i've removed title

[19:40:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can't think of any reason to ever have any accessibility guide on them.

[19:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or wait, does No Role mean they're read as part of the text or something?

[19:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
No role means that you're not allowd to set role="" on them

[19:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think we should set no role on <script> if we set it on, say, <var>, but otherwise, I don't see much point

[19:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
For ATs that pay attention, how does a lack of role affect them?

[19:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
not 100% sure

[19:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If they then treat it like normal content, then I don't think <script> should be No Role.  You don't want to know the contents of script when using a page - they're not relevant except through their effects.

[19:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
well "treat as normal content" can mean several things

[19:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
it can mean "hide things display:none"

[19:45:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, suppose that's true.

[19:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, assuming that's true, I don't think I have any problems.  Looks good, Ian.

[19:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[19:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok well i should go get dinner

[19:46:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Now we just need ARIA to provide better semantics so it can catch up html's native stuff.

[19:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Later.

[19:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'll reply to more mail later

[19:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
heh yeah

[19:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
later

[21:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In light of the recent Sears and Kmart category-changing debacle (which was awesome), I have temporarily added a similar facility to my own company's website.

[21:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I am struck by extreme giggles at seeing familiar pages advertising "Baby Launchers" and "Big Ass Tools, Fuck Yeah".

[22:39:00.0000] <heycam>
jgraham, yeah at the current rate of progress on web idl maybe i should just update it to es5 and not bother having an es3 version :)

[22:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, have you had any thoughts about the proposed <content> element?  I'm writing an article explaining everything authors need to know about sectioning, and if that is to be added, it would change how I need to write a fairly significant part of it

[23:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i haven't read the thread, but off-hand i don't understand what problem it's solving

[23:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i haven't read the thread so maybe the problem was described there)

[23:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, the problem was described in the thread

[23:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
basically, authors are misusing <section> as a generic wrapper to group content together, and the idea is that <content> would map to role=main (when its nearest setioning element ancestor is the body element)

[23:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
isn't <body> the relevant element for wrapping the contents of the page?

[23:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. authors do stuff like this: <article><header>...</header><section>...</section><footer>...</footer></article> where the <section> itself is just a wrapper around the content area, and doesn't actually have a heading of its own

[23:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
it seems like a better solution than a new element would be to point out they can just remove the element altogether

[23:11:00.0000] <gavin_>
it was proposed as an alternative to <div id="main">/<div id="content">

[23:11:01.0000] <gavin_>
which is a pretty common pattern

[23:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
isn't no element at all a suitable alternative to that?

[23:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
i really don't understand what this is for

[23:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. This is a better example: <body><header>...</header><section id="content">...</section><aside id="sidebar">...</aside><footer>...</footer></body>

[23:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
why is this not enough: <body><header>...</header>...<aside id="sidebar">...</aside><footer>...</footer></body>

[23:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, generally, the element can be omitted, but authors have expectations that aren't being met by the current model, and in this case it seems better to meet those expectations, rather than fight against them which is proving only to lead to the abuse of other elements

[23:13:01.0000] <gavin_>
I don't know why it's a common pattern

[23:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not just going to add features to fill cargo cult expectations without understanding why

[23:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's a dumb way to design a language

[23:13:04.0000] <gavin_>
easy styling would be one reason, I guess

[23:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
if the only semantic is as a styling hook, that's what <div> is for.

[23:14:01.0000] <aho>
which browsers support the audio tag already? ff seems to work, opera (9.x) says it doesn't know about it... chrome says it does support it, but it doesnt want to play my ogg

[23:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
(personally, I have recommended using <div> for those purposes, but the implied semantics of role=main make it slightly more useful

[23:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really understand the semantic of role=main either

[23:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
from ARIA: "The main role is a non-obtrusive alternative for "skip to main content" links"

[23:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's what <nav> is for

[23:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
so that's already handled

[23:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
(in an imho better way)

[23:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
nav identifies the navigation, and the main content is currently just assumed to be the content after <header> (if present) that isn't either <aside> or <nav>. (I'm not entirely sure why some people don't find that adequate)

[23:19:01.0000] <aho>
"ff seems to work" <- ehm... or not... it's pretty buggy there :/

[23:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I'm fine with just recommending the use of <div> or nothing in the article. I'm not really decided either way on whether <content> is a good idea

[23:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
aho: it's early days yet

[23:21:01.0000] <aho>
yo Hixie... well, the specs for play() are troublesome either way

[23:21:02.0000] <gavin_>
how is ff buggy?

[23:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: off hand i think no element (or <div> for those who need a comfort blanket here) is the way to go, but i'll have to study the thread

[23:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
aho: the spec for play()?

[23:22:01.0000] <aho>
the way it's written there means that it wouldn't be possible to play the same thing several times simultaneously... you'd have to create some cyclic buffer thing on the js side for that to work

[23:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[23:22:03.0000] <aho>
gavin_, first time play is called it works fine... after that the sound is played twice each time

[23:23:00.0000] <gavin_>
do you have a testcase?

[23:23:01.0000] <aho>
media . play()

[23:23:02.0000] <aho>
    Sets the paused attribute to false, loading the media resource and beginning playback if necessary. If the playback had ended, will restart it from the start.

[23:23:03.0000] <aho>
if it's done like that each audio thingy can be only played once... then you gotta wait till it's done... and then you can play it again

[23:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
aho: are you using this for soundeffects or for, like, a podcast player?

[23:24:01.0000] <aho>
so, right now... if you want to play the same thing several times at the same time you'd have to check if it ".ended"... if not use a new one and play that

[23:24:02.0000] <aho>
sfx

[23:25:00.0000] <aho>
otherwise it wouldnt matter, would it? ;)

[23:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
aah, yeah, you need to have one Audio per instance of the sound you want to play at once

[23:25:02.0000] <aho>
gavin_, i can upload it

[23:26:00.0000] <aho>
http://kaioa.com/k/ct/audio1.html

[23:27:00.0000] <aho>
hover one of those rects... hear how it sounds... wait till it's done... hover the next and then you get something like 30% of the sample and then the complete sample

[23:27:01.0000] <aho>
it sorta stutters

[23:27:02.0000] <aho>
(on winxp at least)

[23:28:00.0000] <aho>
it will continue to behave like that until you reload... then it works fine again... well... once :>

[23:29:00.0000] <gavin_>
aho: thanks, I'll file a bug

[23:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, are the terms "strong native semantics" and "implicit ARIA semantics" meant to be defined somewhere?

[23:29:02.0000] <aho>
if you put some console.log thingies there you'll see that the in function (first thingy in hover) is indeed only called once

[23:29:03.0000] <aho>
gavin_, thanks

[23:30:00.0000] <aho>
i actually wanted to write some cyclic buffer thing... but it's sorta hard if the sound is broken :)

[23:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i'm told ARIA is going to make them magic

[23:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i was going to wait until the ARIA spec was ready so that i could make sure i used these magic terms properly

[23:30:03.0000] <aho>
maybe i should try a longer stereo sample (the used one is mono)

[23:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: as one would, if one were writing a spec responsibly

[23:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: but various people decided that i should just make shit up instead, so that's what i did

[23:32:00.0000] <aho>
since chrome claims it knows about the audio tag... which formats does it support? is there any way to query this stuff?

[23:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok.

[23:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
I was wondering why ARIA suddenly got added despite you waiting for the ARIA spec to be adjusted

[23:33:01.0000] <gavin_>
aho: oh, turns out it's already fixed

[23:33:02.0000] <aho>
:o

[23:33:03.0000] <aho>
any eta for when it will be in stable?

[23:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i realised i was wasting significantly more time explaining to people why it was stupid to do it prematurely than i would waste from fixing the resulting mess from doing it prematurely

[23:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
can you explain what the difference between the two terms are?

[23:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
the spec says "The following table defines the strong native semantics and corresponding implicit ARIA semantics that apply to HTML elements."

[23:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
but the table below that only contains 2 columns: one for the elements and the other for the "Implied ARIA semantics". Where are the strong native semantics defined?

[23:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i was basing it on http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0962.html

[23:37:02.0000] <gavin_>
aho: in firefox 3.6 at the very least

[23:37:03.0000] <aho>
aw

[23:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: everything in that table is both an implied aria semantic and a strong native semantic

[23:38:00.0000] <gavin_>
note: "at least" - could potentially be in a 3.5.x release as well

[23:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
of course then we have http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/1001.html

[23:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
so who the heck knows

[23:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
but worry not! for aria is ready! even though they haven't actually figured out what it should be yet

[23:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
(i may be bitter :-P)

[23:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
so are the roles in the first of the two tables meant to be the strong native semantic roles that aren't allowed to be overridden, and those in the second table are just the implied roles that can be, subject to the listed restrictions?

[23:40:00.0000] <aho>
ah meh... chrome wants mp3 :f

[23:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: isn't the paragraph above the first table clear enough about that? i thought i'd said that in at least three different ways just to be sure it was crystal clear...

[23:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
if so, I would change "The following table defines the strong native semantics and corresponding implicit ARIA semantics that apply to HTML elements." to "The following table defines the strong native semantics that apply to HTML elements." and change the table's second column heading to "Strong native semantics"

[23:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
the term "strong native semantics" can't be the column header because it's an "impl"-only term

[23:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
turn on the highlight mode

[23:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
you'll see what i mean

[23:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
I have highlighting turned on, and it's not impl only

[23:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, it's the other way around

[23:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
man i'm confused

[23:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
this is exactly why i didn't want to do this before i had some spec to refer to

[23:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
wait so you're proposing just not mentioning that these are implicit aria semantics?

[23:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
wouldn't that, like, fail at what we're trying to do here

[23:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
reload, tell me if that's better

[23:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
I thought "strong native semantics" and "implicit aria semantics" were two different, mutually exclusive types of semantics. I'm proposing you clarify which is which

[23:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
"strong native semantics" is the authoring criteria side, "implicit aria semantics" is the UA conformance criteria side.

[23:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
at least according to the fictional spec text that i'm assuming will one day be written

[23:48:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh? That wasn't at all clear from the spec

[23:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
which spec?

[23:48:04.0000] <Lachy>
your spec

[23:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
the spec defining these terms doesn't exist yet

[23:48:06.0000] <Lachy>
I know

[23:48:07.0000] <Hixie>
i don't define the terms

[23:48:08.0000] <Hixie>
i just use them

[23:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
but still, the way in which you used them didn't make it clear that one only applied to implementors

[23:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it was pretty clear though since one of the terms is only used in UA-only text

[23:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
alright, that's slightly better. I guess I'll wait for those terms to be defined properly before I can understand this better

[23:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
you and me both

[03:44:00.0000] <aho>
so... for mp3... "audio/mpeg; codecs=???"

[03:44:01.0000] <aho>
google yields a whopping 5 non-helpful hits

[04:05:00.0000] <foolip>
aho: no codecs parameter for mp3

[04:07:00.0000] <aho>
in chrome 'audio/mpeg' (the right mime) returns an empty string. whereas 'audio/mp3' returns a 'maybe'

[04:07:01.0000] <aho>
should i resort to agent sniffing like everyone else? :f

[04:13:00.0000] <foolip>
file a bug on chrome I guess

[04:14:00.0000] <foolip>
but can chrome in fact play mp3?

[04:14:01.0000] <aho>
ye, works if i just do it

[04:14:02.0000] <aho>
(i.e. w/o any checking)

[04:15:00.0000] <foolip>
do you have several formats?

[04:16:00.0000] <foolip>
otherwise just use it without checking

[04:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
this is a few days old, but it was just pointed out to me that Google Image Search is encouraging the use of RDFa :-( http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/08/specifying-images-license-using-rdfa.html

[04:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't think Lachy would like what he's playing with now

[04:23:00.0000] <aho>
foolip, i *need* several formats. firefox does ogg but doesn't mp3. chrome does mp3, but doesn't ogg.

[04:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I have no idea what toys you kids play with these days.

[04:28:00.0000] <foolip>
aho: chrome plays ogg vorbis

[04:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: RDF data exchange

[04:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
why?

[04:28:03.0000] <foolip>
gsnedders: I'm also having a blast with RDF!

[04:29:00.0000] <aho>
doesnt work here... mp3 works fine tho

[04:29:01.0000] <foolip>
aho: strange, sounds like you need to file 2 bugs at chrome

[04:30:00.0000] <foolip>
aho: chrome claims "maybe" for "audio/ogg"

[04:31:00.0000] <foolip>
I'd just do <audio><source src="audio.ogg"><source src="audio.mp3"></audio> and let the browser figure it out if canPlayType is too broken still

[04:32:00.0000] <aho>
http://kaioa.com/k/ct/audio4.html

[04:32:01.0000] <aho>
firefox and chrome behave differently

[04:32:02.0000] <aho>
not sure which one is right

[04:32:03.0000] <aho>
(ff's behavior makes sense to me though)

[04:33:00.0000] <foolip>
in which way are they different except for supporting different formats?

[04:33:01.0000] <foolip>
I've filed bugs on Chrome's canPlayType before and they fixed it

[04:33:02.0000] <aho>
chrome wont restart the sound and will throw an error

[04:33:03.0000] <foolip>
what, if you call play() after playback has ended?

[04:34:00.0000] <aho>
it doesnt play it again

[04:34:01.0000] <foolip>
that would be a bug in chrome, the spec says it should seek to the beginning

[04:35:00.0000] <aho>
eg the second one got 5 sounds... so, i can play a sound 5 times there... but then it's dead

[04:35:01.0000] <foolip>
you can always hack it by creating a new audio element for each time: new Audio("audio.mp3").play()

[04:37:00.0000] <aho>
i fear that might clutter up the ram

[04:37:01.0000] <foolip>
chrome should have a good enough garbage collector, try it

[04:38:00.0000] <foolip>
or you could try calling load() after each time, although that should be pretty much equivalent to creating a new element

[04:39:00.0000] <aho>
using load works for a little bit... then it dies... mh... cant even reload my (local) test page anymore

[04:39:01.0000] <aho>
tab died

[04:39:02.0000] <aho>
:>

[04:40:00.0000] <foolip>
well, that's 3 bugs you need to report

[05:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is this ietf-honest thing just a storm in a teacup?

[06:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>

[06:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's somewhat disturbing.

[08:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Sure hope role=presentation doesn't end up as another content-type-and-we-really-mean-it-this-time

[09:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, what do you mean?

[09:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Used because alt="" isn't a reliable indicator of presentational images. Then it itself becomes misused, and a few years down the road we'll need yet another way to really mark an image presentational

[09:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wow, just noticed that whether or not a checkbox is checked is referred to as its "checkedness state".  Awesome.  ^_^

[22:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me ponders various better extension mechanisms for microdata

[23:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose we could have a first-come-first-served list of identifiers

[23:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
but that wouldn't work well with the vcard vocabulary...

[23:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we should make each item only have one type?

[23:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
then the identifiers can be scoped to the type...

[23:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[23:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if there are good use cases for giving an item two types

[01:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what problem Hixie is trying to solve

[01:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: making the extension mechanism better than com.example.bar

[01:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Define "beter"

[01:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
Like, what qualities are you tring to optimize?

[01:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
usability.

[01:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
so probably shortness of identifiers

[01:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
we're going to experiment and see if com.example.bar is simple enough

[01:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
(See my e-mail to the whatwg list recently)

[01:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
but to do that i need a variety of syntaxes

[01:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
Is that the specific thing that you are testing? Or is there more? Will you test prefix-based solutions (the disadvantages in that case might not come out in a short test)

[02:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think prefix-based systems have been shown to be unusable pretty convincingly already

[02:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me is reading Jeni's blog post

[02:13:00.0000] <gavin_>
that's a good post

[02:14:00.0000] <gavin_>
he reply to shelley's comment, in particular

[02:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
odd, why did a bunch of IDs just change when i regenned?

[02:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: any changes to anolis i should know about?

[02:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Er, I have been poking it a bit but nothing should have changed the ids

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
how about this: we restrict items to one type per item, and then allow items to be one word long

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
and those names are automatically scoped to the type

[02:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
kinda like what we do now with predefined vocabularies

[02:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I did not realize there was so much discussion of microdata at public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf

[03:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't sure what Hixie means

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Did you mean "allow *itemprops* to be one word long" or something?

[03:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
er yes

[03:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
<section item=org.example.animal.cat><h1 itemprop=name>... etc, and anyone processing the document should detect 'name' properties in 'org.example.animal.cat' items, rather than detecting 'org.example.animal.cat' properties in 'org.example.animal.cat' items

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
What happens when you want the equivalent of <section item=org.example.animal.cat><div item=vcard><h1 itemprop='org.example.animal.cat.name fn'>... with nested items?

[03:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: do you mean there to be an itemprop on your vcard?

[03:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: if you want to extend items whose type is vcard with other properties that aren't from vcard, then you use rev-dns or uris

[03:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
(for any value of "vcard")

[03:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:12:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: gsnedders has been telling me that you did some testing of IEs "special" treatment of prefixed elements/attributes (xmlns-style), are those tests available somewhere?

[04:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me points out the "nn" to foolip 

[04:12:02.0000] <foolip>
gsnedders: "nn"?

[04:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
night night

[04:13:01.0000] <foolip>
ah, right

[04:13:02.0000] <foolip>
so I finished my giant post on the microdata stuff, wonder when is the best time to publish...

[04:13:03.0000] <foolip>
silly americans are sleeping now

[04:13:04.0000] <gsnedders>
When digg and /. have fallen quiet?

[04:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[04:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Um, I probably do mean that

[04:15:00.0000] <foolip>
meh, there's a reason I didn't go into marketing: http://blog.foolip.org/2009/08/23/microformats-vs-rdfa-vs-microdata/

[04:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I forget how microdata works

[04:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
foolip: It's called "sanity".

[04:15:03.0000] <foolip>
haha, right you are

[05:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: If you had waited untill the best time we wouldn't have got to see it until Tuesday or so. So being no good at amrketing is nice for the rest of us

[05:15:00.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: Is that so? I'll just have to write something else for Tuesday then :)

[05:16:00.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: I'm thinking that converting the microdata tree to a DOM tree or JavaScript object might be a better way of visualizing/testing markup than the full JSON/RDF

[05:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Someone should remister mantics.se for use in reverse DNS identifiers

[05:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
*register

[05:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: I'm not sure what context you have in mind

[05:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or what type of tree/object you would like

[05:26:02.0000] <foolip>
did you read my post?

[05:27:00.0000] <foolip>
the microdata example could be made into this XML:

[05:27:01.0000] <foolip>
<vcard fn="Philip Jägenstedt" url="http://foolip.org/">

[05:28:00.0000] <foolip>
I didn't bother to mention that because it would probably be confusing though

[05:31:00.0000] <foolip>
both of mantic.se and mantics.se are free :)

[06:04:00.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: I just registered mantic.se :) Just 99 SEK for so much fun!

[06:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
Heh I would probably have done it for that price :)

[06:09:00.0000] <foolip>
too bad many TLDs require at least 3 characters in a domain name, so many nice ideas failed because of that

[06:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what a SEK is in real money

[06:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me looks it up

[06:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, right, that's not much :-)

[06:11:02.0000] <foolip>
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=99+SEK+in+USD :P

[06:11:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me was confused by the "99" which sounded like a lot

[06:12:00.0000] <foolip>
meh, I'm too slow

[06:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose it still seems like an incredibly expensive mechanism for supplying globally unique identifiers (which is all that's needed for microdata)

[06:15:00.0000] <foolip>
well, there aren't that many unique things to choose from. you have DNS and UUIDs and... then what?

[06:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's loads of ways

[06:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
TinyURL has been supplying unique identifiers for free for lots of years

[06:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me makes the pedantic note that only DNS+a date is really globally unique

[06:17:01.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: true

[06:17:02.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: tinyurl is DNS though

[06:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
You just need a server and a CGI script and a database, so people can register names without collisions

[06:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: Um... How so?

[06:18:02.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: because it relies on "tinyurl.com" for uniqueness

[06:18:03.0000] <jgraham>
tinyurl seems to combine the disadvantages of uuids with the disadvantages of dns

[06:18:04.0000] <foolip>
hehe

[06:19:00.0000] <foolip>
I'm not a fan of URL shortening services, completely opaque URLs isn't a lot of fun

[06:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: The identifier space provided by TinyURL is completely independent of DNS, and a spec could just say item=xxx refers to the identifier xxx as registered with TinyURL and there's no need for DNS

[06:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
just like lots of RFCs reference IANA registries, which has nothing to do with DNS (even though you typically use DNS if you want to read the registries)

[06:22:01.0000] <foolip>
well, you're right

[06:22:02.0000] <foolip>
but how would that work with microdata

[06:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I thought that tinyurl provided identifiers that were deterministic based on url

[06:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
But I guess they might not

[06:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
You can make things less opaque by letting people choose identifiers (avoiding collisions) rather than doing it randomly

[06:23:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me suggests using twitter usernames as identifiers

[06:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders how to identify jgraham then

[06:24:01.0000] <foolip>
I guess you could use DNS for the top-level item and something proprietary for the rest

[06:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham, foolip: What are you doing inside on such a lovely sunny day?

[06:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me heads out

[06:24:04.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Same as you it seems

[06:24:05.0000] <foolip>
gsnedders, out? seriously?

[06:24:06.0000] <foolip>
well, back to killing zombies for me (resident evil)

[06:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: Instead of saying "Types are identified ... As reversed DNS labels", the spec could say "As identifiers registered on the WHATWG Registry (currently located at http://registry.whatwg.org/)"

[06:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
and that registry can be a first-come-first-served collection of arbitrary Unicode strings

[06:26:01.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: meh, even I would object to that, imagine what the semwebbers would say

[06:26:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It could but it probably wouldn't satisfy anyone

[06:26:03.0000] <Philip`>
Why would it be worse than reversed DNS labels?

[06:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
because e.g. if microdata took off there would be a landgrab on all the sensible names

[06:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
(other than sys-admin issues of actually running the service)

[06:27:02.0000] <foolip>
at least DNS has (small) barrier to hogging all kinds of crufty ids without using them

[06:27:03.0000] <jgraham>
Like I could just register all strings < 10 characters

[06:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, true

[06:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What? Changing travel plans in September because you found out people you were meant to be meeting have had their plans changed under them by other organizations?

[06:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yes.

[06:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Then I guess you are doing the same.

[06:28:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me was surprised when he realised Amazon EC2 bucket names are just arbitrary strings and you can register whatever you want, but in practice people just pick long names (because they don't need to type them frequently)

[06:28:05.0000] <jgraham>
Well at least if the executive summry of that was "wasting my life away"

[06:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No.

[06:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm

[06:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
On the subject of going outdoors and killing zombies: Plants vs Zombies is quite a nice game

[06:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Speaking of zombies, I should buy a copy of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

[06:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Not speaking of zombies I recentlt discovered that Leonard Nimoy is an accomplished photographer

[07:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Did I say EC2 buckets? I meant S3 buckets)

[07:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/the_settlers_2_gold_edition and remembers gsnedders having talked about it a lot

[07:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Not the gold edition :P

[07:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Wow. It actually works on 64-bit Windows _and_ on NT!

[07:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How the hell does it require a 1GHz CPU on a game from '96?

[07:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Probably because it's emulating a machine from '96

[07:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That was my guess.

[07:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
and because you're running XP/Vista in the background

[07:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me attempts to read Dive Into HTML 5

[07:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is there some way I can disable web fonts in Opera? It's impossible to read like this because all the punctuation is wrongly positioned

[07:49:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Do you have a bug on that?

[07:49:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me ducks

[07:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It looks fine in O10 beta 3 here

[07:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me scrolls down a bit

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, great - it randomly draws the paragraph text in a monospace font, or in a serif font with the monospace font's spacing, depending on how I scroll

[07:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What platform?

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
This build 4566 on Linux

[07:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
*is

[07:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Is 4566 the beta? :P

[07:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(Honestly, I can't remember build numbers.)

[07:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, it was just the latest one that existed when I looked yesterday

[07:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah.

[07:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Then I dunno.

[07:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me switches to Firefox 3.0, which works much better because it doesn't support web fonts

[11:55:00.0000] <Lachy_>
what's the point? http://doctype.be/402.html

[11:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you love doctype-based validators?

[11:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/doctype/DTD/

[11:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
(since something that has hard-coded doctype-dependent modes could still be considered a doctype-based validator, but wouldn't be helped by this)

[11:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
(i.e. I'm not being entirely pedantic, just largely)

[11:58:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I agree

[11:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose this is one of those DTDs where you're meant to ignore the validator's complaints about xmlns:* attributes

[12:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Validators always complain

[12:00:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Can't they say something nice for once?

[12:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
They do, they give you cute little tick-mark buttons when you've been good

[12:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Only if you're good

[12:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Would it hurt to say something like "Okay, you have two errors, but you clearly tried very hard and I appreciate that"

[12:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
We should remove the pass/fail distinction, and have validators report "congratulations, your page is in the top $n percent of pages for correctness!" where $n ranges from 0 to 100

[12:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Then nobody will be disheartened by rejection, and they will be rewarded for incremental improvements

[12:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
(To calculate $n, just find the percentage rank of the page's number of errors vs a precomputed random sample of the web, and then divide by 2 and add 50)

[12:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
(...then subtract from 100, obviously)

[12:09:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Great idea

[12:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
Thank you

[12:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
I consider it to be in the top 50 percent of ideas for greatness

[12:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And then when people are used to it, you can slowly bias the random sample towards higher quality

[12:10:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And people will think everyone else is improving, so they'll try to improve too

[12:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Why base it upon a random sample? Why not just choose an algorithm to create the number?

[12:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That would be lying

[12:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
The point is to distort the truth, not to just make something up

[12:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
You've got to base the decisions on data, so you can simply hide your biases in your analysis of the data

[12:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Ssh, you're giving away the secrets

[12:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What DOM does http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0D%0A%3Cscript%3E%0D%0Avar%20title%20%3D%20document.getElementsByTagName(%22title%22)%5B0%5D%0D%0Atitle.parentElement.removeChild(title)%0D%0A%3C%2Fscript%3E give in IE?

[12:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Internet Explorer has modified this page to help prevent cross-site scripting"

[12:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If you manually set the src to that?

[12:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
If I paste it in manually, html > head, body; head > script

[12:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
k

[12:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And if you remove the script there is a title?

[12:52:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes. Before the script.

[12:52:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Does w(title.firstChild == null) give true?

[12:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Then?

[12:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or with script

[12:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Without the second line of script

[12:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(without the first title isn't set)

[12:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
w() doesn't seem to work

[12:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
At all?

[12:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It should output it in the log

[12:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Just use alert then

[12:56:01.0000] <Dashiva>
There seems to be a comment in the source about it not working too

[12:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
true both before and after removing the title

[12:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And if you add <title>foo</title> false?

[12:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(That's the final question, I promise)

[12:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Before the script tag?

[13:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Actually, it doesn't matter

[13:00:01.0000] <Dashiva>
firstChild is null still

[13:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
WTF?

[13:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
outerHTML is <TITLE>foo</TITLE>

[13:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Ergh.

[13:01:03.0000] <gsnedders>
and innerHTML?

[13:01:04.0000] <Dashiva>
childNodes has length 0, for consistency

[13:01:05.0000] <Dashiva>
innerHTML is foo

[14:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"I concluded the W3C has ceded the development of HTML to a cartel of browser vendors with no interest in the needs of authors and users (not even their own users)"

[14:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a cabal, not a cartel

[14:39:00.0000] <takkaria>
Rob is really good at writing rhetoric

[14:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The overuse of "ignoring users" kinda grates for me

[14:40:01.0000] <takkaria>
rhetoric always grates on the people it's not aimed at

[14:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Fair enough

[14:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Question: is Rob Burns on crack?

[14:44:00.0000] <takkaria>
if he was I'm not sure he'd bother with the htmlwg

[14:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All right, then assume a crack-like drug that still produces a compulsion to comment on technical mailing-lists.

[14:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is he on this theoretical drug?

[14:45:02.0000] <Dashiva>
He's just himelf

[14:45:03.0000] <Dashiva>
*himself

[14:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's not a very fun self to be, filled with constant paranoia that the browser vendors hate everyone and presumably want to kill blind people.

[14:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
As far as behavior goes, posting on a mailing list is greatly preferable to other activities society may frown upon

[14:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
While true, that doesn't make it any easier to read his email without facing the hard decision of whether to laugh my coke through my nose or dissolve into furious apoplexy.

[14:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you find yourself in that situation, there is a third way: not reading it

[14:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I took that third way after two paragraphs.

[14:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I think it's good that he posts, really

[14:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Better to get the controversy out in the open so it can be resolved

[14:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I dunno if that sort of post is useful, though.  I mean, yeah, when no one's disagreeing you're either a genius or no one around you cares.

[14:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But how do you *respond* to something like "I like your draft because the other guy is part of a shadowy conspiracy with browser vendors to make the internet suck."

[14:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Might as well just blame interop issues on aliens for all the good it does.

[14:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Like, okay, I dislike Shelley Power.  I *really* dislike her.  But she performs a very valuable service by strongly disagreeing with stuff, and offering reasons why she disagrees that you can actually address.  I rarely agree with her reasons, but I can *understand* them, and that's really useful to have.

[14:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bah, back to writing spec proposals.

Hixie: Any plans to make CSS4 at some point that actually makes things easy to position?

[17:49:00.0000] <takkaria>
you should look at CSS3's layout module, it uses ASCII art for that

[17:49:01.0000] <takkaria>
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-layout/

[18:12:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
takkaria: Hah. I figured there was some CSS3 thing "in the works".

[20:24:00.0000] <Simetrical>
Hixie, aww.  Are you not going to tell him?  I've been staying up late to see the end of this.

[20:25:00.0000] <Simetrical>
You're insanely more diplomatic than me, though, props for that.  :P

[20:31:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
?

[20:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
tell who what?

[20:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I am also confused, Simetrical.

[20:32:02.0000] <Simetrical>
Some guy in #chromium was arguing with Hixie about HTML 5.  More or less telling him he didn't know what he was talking about.

[20:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh

[20:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
does #chromium have logs?

[20:33:02.0000] <Simetrical>
He apparently had no idea who Hixie is.  I was waiting for a line like "<markybob> Hixie, you don't know anything about HTML 5" so I could put it on my page of quotes, but he's fallen silent now.

[20:34:00.0000] <Simetrical>
http://echelog.matzon.dk/logs/browse/chromium/1251064800  Scroll back to 2:51:48 for the start of the discussion.

[20:35:00.0000] <Simetrical>
/me has been wondering lately if he should change his IRC nick to AryehGregor so people can more easily match him up with his mailing list posts

[20:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
fwiw I did not realize you were the same person until you just said so

[20:37:01.0000] <Simetrical>
Yeah, that's what I figured.

[20:37:02.0000] <Simetrical>
I send mail as "Aryeh Gregor <Simetrical+xxx⊙gc>" these days, but people usually don't look at the address.

[20:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That... that log is glorious.

[20:40:01.0000] <Simetrical>
No great soundbites, though.  :(

[20:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Simetrical: I suggest changing it.  I recognize it only because when you switched your email address name over mid-conversation in www-style I noticed.

[20:42:00.0000] <Simetrical>
I used to always use Simetrical everywhere, but a while back I switched to my real name for things that I'd want a potential employer to find when searching for my name.  Since the top Google hit for me was my grandfather's New York Times obituary.  :)

[20:42:01.0000] <Simetrical>
Since I use freenode pretty much only for programming- and math-related stuff, it would make sense.

[20:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I sorta wanna tell markybob he was talking to Hixie.

[20:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I wouldn't want to deprive you of the pleasure, AryehGregor.

[20:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Since Hixie doesn't seem to want to do it himself.  ^_^

[20:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, maybe I should use just Aryeh instead, or aryeh.  It's a pretty distinctive name, after all.

[20:45:00.0000] <aryeh>
Oh, that's registered.

[20:45:01.0000] <aryeh>
Rats.

[20:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's how I ended up "othermaciej"

[20:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
all the good choices wer etaken

[20:46:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I should probably register my nick

[20:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess your name is like mine, distinctive to your average netizen but common enough in absolute terms that someone else has already taken it.

[20:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, what's the command for that?

[20:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/ns help

[20:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'll leave #chromium up and check in in a little while, AryehGregor, to see what's happened.  ^_^

[21:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, well, looks like he's not responding.  I'll go to bed now, then.

[23:46:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Well, that was entertaining... about two hours later.... ^_^

[23:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>

[02:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html-wg/20090823#l-101

[02:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
thx

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
that contains the issue tracker data too?

[02:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The long url is the url for the service that gives annotations + issue data -> extended annotations format file

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
what should i search for in its output to see an example of a tracker annotation?

[02:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
ISSUE-

[02:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
Wait

[02:47:03.0000] <jgraham>
Which output?

[02:47:04.0000] <jgraham>
The XML file or the spec?

[02:47:05.0000] <jgraham>
/me feels he is not being very clear

[02:47:06.0000] <Hixie>
XML file

[02:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
In the xml file the issues are <issue> elements

[02:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i find none

[02:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
in http://pimpmyspec.net/aquarium.py/annotations/output?spec_status=WD&annotations_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatwg.org%2Fspecs%2Fweb-apps%2Fcurrent-work%2Fstatus.cgi%3Faction%3Dget-all-annotations&tracker_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2Fhtml%2Fwg%2Ftracker%2F

[02:48:03.0000] <jgraham>
Oh well something is broken then

[02:48:04.0000] <jgraham>
This worked for me yesterday...

[02:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah I must have broken something :(

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
could you set the class of the elements you output to "XXX annotation" or some such?

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
so i can style it separately?

[02:51:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Sure

[02:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
(I just wanted some style so I picked an existing classname)

[02:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
is it always just one <p>?

[02:51:05.0000] <jgraham>
iirc yes

[02:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
only after an <hx>? or wherever a matching ID is found?

[02:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
found the answer!

[02:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
"<p><dfn id="the-body-element">The body element</dfn><p class="XXX"><b>Status: </b>"

[02:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's not gonna work

[02:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, it just looks for an ID

[02:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although I thought we only had annotations after headings

[02:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
we have annotations all over the place

[02:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
annotations just need an ID

[02:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Interesting

[02:58:00.0000] <virtuelv>
holy mother of god

[02:59:00.0000] <virtuelv>
(Yes, I'm looking at skillsmatter)

[03:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i meant to post this here: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/temp

[03:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
instead i twittered it

[03:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
but we won't worry about that!

[03:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The problems with the issue annotation thing may or may not be fixed

[03:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
How unexpected

[03:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: ?

[03:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: testing...

[03:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The expected result is one of all the possible results

[03:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: you just dropping annotations that aren't on headers?

[03:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: For now. Other strageties are welcome

[03:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[03:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
seems reasonable

[03:36:00.0000] <virtuelv>
What's the reasoning behind this wording for window.open?

[03:37:00.0000] <virtuelv>
"The third argument, features, has no effect and is supported for historical reasons only."

[03:38:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I know that, for purity and all that is good, it should never have been done that way in the first place

[03:39:00.0000] <virtuelv>
but are browsers in reality going to drop support for this on the floor?

[03:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
the only effects it has are UI-based and thus out of scope, i think

[03:41:00.0000] <virtuelv>
it allows you to set innerHeight/Width

[03:41:01.0000] <annevk2>
sweet, people worked on the encoding stuff :)

[03:41:02.0000] <virtuelv>
(although that never seemed to be supported in IE)

[03:42:00.0000] <adactio>
virtuelv: all of the values in "features" affect the browser window, rather than the document.

[03:42:01.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: Am I right in thinking that HTML5 defines DOM APIs but steers away from BOM APIs by design.

[03:42:02.0000] <virtuelv>
adactio: you're right about that

[03:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
adactio: what are BOM APIs?

[03:43:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(affecting the browser Window)

[03:43:02.0000] <adactio>
othermaciej: Browser Object Model

[03:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: not sure what a Browser Object Model API is

[03:43:04.0000] <othermaciej>
me neither

[03:44:00.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: it's an ad-hoc term for anything to do with browser chrome: width, height, etc.

[03:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: innerHeight/Width is a UI issue (e.g. on my work machine, i don't have windows at all, so it won't do anything)

[03:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: ah. then no.

[03:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: html5 has lots of "BOM" things

[03:44:04.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: can you give me a quick example?

[03:45:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: I understand that, but I think I would like to see this documented still

[03:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: window.open(), for example

[03:45:02.0000] <virtuelv>
it's being used on the web, virtually any day

[03:45:03.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: Oh, yeah. True.

[03:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: it doesn't matter how the browsers implement it, so there's not anything to define

[03:45:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I see you also don't have window.move{To,By} or the resize or scroll methods

[03:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
that should be in CSSOM, iirc

[03:46:01.0000] <annevk2>
I haven't specced move or resize

[03:46:02.0000] <annevk2>
some of scroll is though

[03:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
i would specify them as not doing anything, if i did spec them

[03:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we have wndow.scrollTo(), scrollBy() and scroll()

[03:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not sure what the difference is

[03:47:02.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: why are the barprop properties still in, then?

[03:47:03.0000] <annevk2>
i have those othermaciej

[03:47:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me would like author.stopRearragingMyDesktopAlready()

[03:47:05.0000] <annevk2>
i don't have scrollByLines and other esoteric stuff

[03:47:06.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: because they affect the DOM (you can access them) -- note that they are specced as basically doing nothing useful

[03:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: we don't have scrollByLines on Window but we do on Element (which seems odd)

[03:48:01.0000] <virtuelv>
/me is confuzzled

[03:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I think the definition of "Form elements's labelled control" isn't clear about cases like <label><input id=a><input id=b></label>

[03:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
file a bug

[03:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
using the little bug filer bar

[03:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's easier to do that than to tell me on irc :-)

[03:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
irc sometime gives instant feedback of the form "no you idiot…"

[03:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
Plus I don't like the little comment box

[03:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wish I could hide the comment box

[03:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
you can

[03:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
hit the button on the left

[03:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
the arrow pointing to the right indicating that clicking it will close the box

[03:57:00.0000] <annevk2>
hey, RB is back; I think I joked about that last week

[03:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
ah, the one that's only visible if I make my window really really wide

[03:57:02.0000] <annevk2>
something in relation to "silly season"

[03:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
thanks, done

[03:57:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: checked in your annotations, thanks

[03:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
Great

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, it ruins the styles of the element sections

[04:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[04:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
you know

[04:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
with the new definitions of microdata

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
we don't even really need to have predefined types anymore

[04:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
i could just change item=vcard to item=org.w3.vcard

[04:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll sleep on it and will consider doing that tomorrow

[04:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:06:00.0000] <annevk2>
nn

[04:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
gn

[04:28:00.0000] <foolip_>
doesn't the new microdata spec suffer from the same problems as prefix solutions?

[04:29:00.0000] <foolip_>
if you only need to specify a fully qualified identifier on the item type, people might copy just the itemprops and imagine that should somehow work

[04:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
some of the same, maybe

[04:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I managed to be involved in a conversation put on lastweek without being part of the quote. That's a first.

[04:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip_: In the old system, if you just copy the itemprops and no item then you won't get any parser output either, so it doesn't seem any more fragile

[04:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: But suppose you paste it inside another item. Then you'd get an net.something item with a org.whatever property, which is likely to be harmless

[04:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Whereas a net.something item with a generic property name is easy to get overlap with

[04:46:01.0000] <foolip_>
Dashiva: harmless if they don't share any keywords

[04:47:00.0000] <foolip_>
Philip`: But the same is also true of prefixes. I happen to not have a big problem with either prefixes or this "from org.w3c.vcard import *", but I'm not sure why they are different and how we can plausibly claim that prefixes are bad while this isn't

[04:48:00.0000] <foolip_>
but I'm sure this criticism will come (with a vengeance) from others, I don't need to do it for them

[04:55:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me finds TabAtkins writing LOLSPEAK to public-html

[04:56:00.0000] <foolip_>
standards bodies aren't what they used to...

[04:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So is HTML5 the authority on aria now?

[04:57:01.0000] <annevk2>
foolip_, they're not?

[04:58:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
annevk2: If they were, we'd've done everything WAI said blindingly as if their puppets

[04:58:01.0000] <foolip_>
annevk2: jk, I wasn't around back then :-/

[05:04:00.0000] <annevk2>
foolip_, me neither, so I was interested in knowing :)

[05:05:00.0000] <foolip_>
I imagine that before there were people from Sun in suits and things like that

[05:05:01.0000] <foolip_>
maybe even briefcases

[05:05:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And ties?

[05:06:00.0000] <mpt>
/me tries to use the HTML5 spec to work out how browsers are supposed to handle "<span />", and fails utterly

[05:07:00.0000] <foolip_>
mpt: for that kind of thing using the HTML5 live dom viewer is nice

[05:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
mpt: Handle it how?

[05:07:02.0000] <mpt>
Dashiva, exactly

[05:07:03.0000] <foolip_>
http://livedom.validator.nu/

[05:07:04.0000] <Dashiva>
No, like, rendering or parsing or what?

[05:08:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mpt: As an open span tag. The / has no effect.

[05:08:01.0000] <foolip_>
yep, livedom agrees

[05:08:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Start at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#tokenization and just follow the steps

[05:08:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(And it'll throw a parse error as the self-closing flag is not acknowledged by the tree builder)

[05:08:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Then throw another as it isn't closed upon EOF)

[05:08:05.0000] <mpt>
thanks foolip_ 

[05:09:00.0000] <mpt>
Dashiva, I tried that, and got as far as <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#close-tag-open-state>

[05:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How did you get there?

[05:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Tag open state -> Tag name state -> Before attribute name state -> Self-closing start tag state -> back to data state

[05:10:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
You start in the data state, you consume the <, then move to the tag open state

[05:11:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
From there, you consume the "s" and move to the tag name state

[05:11:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Stay in tag name state for "p", "a", and "n", then consume the space and switch to before attribute name state

[05:11:02.0000] <mpt>
oh, I see

[05:11:03.0000] <mpt>
I missed the tag name state part

[05:11:04.0000] <mpt>
I guess I was trying to skip ahead too quickly

[05:11:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Consume the "/", switch to self-closing start tag state

[05:12:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Consume the ">", set the self-closing flag, then emit the token, and change back to the data state

[05:12:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(The self-closing flag is then ignored in the tree builder)

[05:12:02.0000] <Dashiva>
(Which is a parse error)

[05:13:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(And then if there's no more data, it hits EOF and throws a parse error because span is still open)

[05:13:01.0000] <mpt>
I see

[05:13:02.0000] <mpt>
Thanks very much gsnedders|work and Dashiva 

[05:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: prefixes are different because people think prefixes have meaning and write code that acts upon the prefix instead of resolving it, and Selectors interact badly with prefixes

[05:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
Selectors act badly with unprtefixed things unless handled with care

[05:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
Unless I am misunderstanding the proposal

[05:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
*unprefixed

[05:22:00.0000] <ray>
i wonder if there will be a public awareness campaign about the death of <a name> in html5

[05:22:01.0000] <ray>
i only learned that something else was possible a few months ago

[05:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip_: xmlns:prefix is having to write import module as prefix

[05:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip_: while microdata doesn't let you import away the burned-in prefixes

[05:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip_: and Java doesn't let you rename the prefix--it lets you only hide it

[05:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ray: something else has been possible ever since Netscape 4 died

[05:26:01.0000] <annevk2>
ray, it's being advocated since XHTML was popular

[05:27:00.0000] <ray>
yeah, i'm speaking from the amateur sometime web developer fog of confusion here

[05:27:01.0000] <Lachy_>
ray, the number of sites I've seen using <a name=""> seems very low compared with those using id=""

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mpt: the cursor styling of <abbr> on your blog is confusing

[05:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mpt: I get the help cursor when you don't have a title attribute

[05:29:01.0000] <mpt>
hsivonen, yes, sorry, I've been meaning to fix that

[05:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for a moment, I thought tooltips had regressed on Firefox trunk

[05:30:01.0000] <annevk2>
ray, any suggestions for such a campaign?

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
ray, there's a bunch of little things that changed; I guess what's needed in the end is a bunch of tutorials that are spread through blogs/twitter/etc.

[05:31:01.0000] <annevk2>
s/needed/will do it/

[05:31:02.0000] <ray>
i do think a unified "html5 changes" tutorial would be nice

[05:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mpt: regarding the actual content, I think GTK+ and Qt should be like Carbon and Cocoa, and this whole Gnome/KDE divide is harmful to desktop Linux

[05:32:01.0000] <foolip_>
hsivonen: Good points, but it'd be very enlightening to have a prefix solution tested by Google just to see if users really are more confused. I doubt they're willing to waste time on hypothetical solutions though...

[05:32:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
So one should be deprecated, hsivonen? :P

[05:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: true, it won't work when you have nested items with different types where the different types have properties with the same names

[05:36:00.0000] <foolip_>
zcorpan: presumably the nested item can't use itemprops from the outer item. you can composite items into bigger items, but not merge them

[05:36:01.0000] <foolip_>
at least that's what I'd hope

[05:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: right

[05:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: I want to avoid getting into that debate

[05:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip_: so if you have <span item=org.w3.vcard><span itemprop=fn>foo</span><span item=org.example.bar><span itemprop=fn>bar</span></span></span>

[05:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders|work: I'll leave at this: having to choose between Gnome and KDE is silly and it sucks that Qt apps have wrong-looking widgets on Ubuntu by default

[05:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: you can't get the vcard "fn" without the other without knowing the structure beforehand

[05:40:01.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe the other item should have an itemprop too

[05:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
that allows a nested item

[05:41:01.0000] <foolip_>
zcorpan: it already works like that

[05:41:02.0000] <foolip_>
I missed that you hadn't written that in the example

[05:41:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me is confused

[05:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<span item=org.w3.vcard><span itemprop=fn>foo</span><span itemprop=somethingthatallowsanesteditem item=org.example.bar><span itemprop=fn>bar</span></span></span>

[05:42:01.0000] <foolip_>
zcorpan: exactly

[05:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
I don't like the idea of having to explicitly mark "this piece of microdata lives inside another, unrel;ated piece of microdata"

[05:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
this seems like a reason to prefer the previous proposal

[05:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
Imagine something like planet where each article could be a com.example.blog item and within each article there could be any arbitary author-supplied microdata

[05:48:00.0000] <foolip_>
so perhaps the parent-item should have some anonymous child-items

[05:49:00.0000] <foolip_>
but if they're actually unrelated, perhaps they should be separate items.

[05:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
foolip_: They are seperate items. But it is convuluted to ensure that they always appear in a seperate subtree

[05:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
*convoluted

[05:51:02.0000] <foolip_>
jgraham: you could replace "top-level item" with something that doesn't only have to do with the tree

[05:52:00.0000] <foolip_>
e.g. any item that doesn't have an itemprop attribute.

[05:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
foolip_: I'm not sure how that helps with the problem of identifying an item by a selector

[05:59:00.0000] <foolip_>
jgraham: selectors eh?

[06:17:00.0000] <annevk2>
foolip_, fwiw, the theory is that implementations have a high-res backend for <canvas>

[06:17:01.0000] <annevk2>
foolip_, it has been suggested multiple times to do away with this

[06:20:00.0000] <foolip_>
annevk2: even if they did, why should that leak through the interface (as opposed to just given crisper rendering)?

[06:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
foolip_, I think the idea is that you want to do filters on the high-res data and not on the premultiplied data

[06:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
I'm not convinced personally. If people want high-res they should just use a larger <canvas> imo.

[06:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
certainly that would be easier to understand

[06:25:00.0000] <foolip_>
let's hope Hixie sees the light :)

[06:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: That's no good for browser developers who develop browsers for high-DPI displays and want canvases to automatically look nice, without requiring every author to manually make it high-res

[06:56:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Like in cases where 1 CSS pixel != 1 device pixel

[06:58:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, they already have compat issues anyway (and also, tough luck)

[07:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
are hardware devs already a the point where they could double the ppi of a 24" screen?

[07:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
aside: what's up with Apple Store? Looks like their product info DB has fallen off

[07:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
user ratings, titles and prices show

[07:03:03.0000] <hsivonen>
pictures and product info doesn't

[07:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders|work, I find LOLSPEAK to be the most efficient way to communicate things sometimes.  ^_^

[08:26:00.0000] <annevk3>
/me somewhat disagrees with <em> and <i> being "veeeeery different"

[08:26:01.0000] <annevk3>
in practice, anyway

[08:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Semantic Web is just around the corner

[08:28:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me sticks his head around

[08:28:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I don't see it. Maybe it's just very small?

[08:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
No, it's just invisible to the naked eye

[08:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It permeates everything

[08:41:00.0000] <GPHemsley>

[11:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
no I didn't

[11:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
it might have been Hixie, since he responded to a couple of them with messages to be more specific

[11:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
It was Hixie

[11:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, yeah. just got to this one http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7323

[11:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That damned spammer!

[12:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
i added the example ones cos i needed to get "add examples" off my list of things to do and into a more specific actionable location

[13:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hey Hixie, I got some feedback today from our dev relations team about how web developers really want to be able to be able style the form control validation error messages, without having to use scripts to create their own custom messages

[14:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
apparently some developers really don't want to use the validation stuff because the error messages are so ugly, at least in Opera.

[14:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
I know that's one of our implementation issues, but the desire to style the stuff is understandable

[14:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yo, JohnResig.

[14:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, I said it would probably require the CSSWG to address the issue, perhaps providing some kind of pseudo-element to select the error message content.

[14:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Hmm.  We may also need assurances on the internal structure of the error message.  Is it just a simple text string right now?

[14:03:00.0000] <takkaria>
hsivonen: snow leopard release was announced

[14:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, in Opera's implementation, I believe it is just a simple text string in a box with a red border. 

[14:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
s/takkaria/TabAtkins/

[14:07:01.0000] <takkaria>
good to know :)

[14:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: k.  Then yeah, a pseudoelement would work well.  We'd just set border, font, color, etc.

[14:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
::error?

[14:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
we should ban people from this channel who's nick names start with the same first two letters as someone else's, so that it doesn't mess with tab completion!

[14:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:invalid

[14:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(or maybe ::invalid)

[14:08:04.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, ::invalid (it has to be a pseudo-element)

[14:08:05.0000] <Lachy>
alternatively, it might be possible to do something with XBL. Not sure how exactly, I'd have to think about it

[14:08:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Does anybody implement XBL?

[14:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
not yet

[14:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, not XBL2. (Mozilla has XBL1) I once heard that WebKit had someone working on it a little. Not sure what the progress is.

[14:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  Not sure how you'd use XBL anyway here.  It's still a browser-generated element.  You'd have to somehow expose it in CSS anyway.  Might as well do it with a pseudoelement.

[14:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but XBL will give you a lot more flexibility

[14:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
but it would still require a selector for it

[14:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But how would you target it?  It's not like, say, <input type=slider>, where you can just point to it with the class or id or whatever you gave it in your html.

[14:10:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[14:10:04.0000] <Lachy>
what do you mean?

[14:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, the error box doesn't appear in your html.  So you don't have any hooks to use to target it, whether with CSS or XBL

[14:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, the XBL method would need to bind an event listener for the "invalid" event to the control, and provide custom validation. So it's probably around the same amount of complexity as an ordinary script based approach

[14:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
but in principle, you'd set up your binding with a template that has markup for the control and error message, and have a script in there listening for the event that then controls the whole thing

[14:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The form errors in Opera do look rather garish, it's true.  That isn't stopping me, though, since I have no aesthetic taste.  :)

[14:15:00.0000] <krijn>
We authors want to do all sorts of crazy stuff with error messages

[14:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's also not much control over the wording of the messages, while we're at it.  That might annoy some people as well.

[14:15:02.0000] <krijn>
Fade them in, have them have little icons and shadows, tee hee

[14:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Hmm.  That's seems annoyingly complex.  And it requires scripting, which is annoying.

[14:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, you could use XBL hooked to :invalid to both generate and style the message.

[14:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
(I suspect the problem with the design of our error messages is that they were done by a programmer in core who also possessed no asthetic taste, and were never touched by anyone in desktop)

[14:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The problem comes when you automatically generate the message with some method other than XBL, because then you can't interface with it through XBL.  I think.

[14:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Placeholder possibly also needs styling.

[14:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Possibly.  It's certainly a way to round out the set.  But placeholders are styled very similarly across sites currently, which says that the need for styling is lesser than for error messages.

[14:20:01.0000] <krijn>
How do you specify the text for the error message?

[14:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, agreed.

[14:20:03.0000] <Lachy>
placeholder should use the system's native style for placeholders

[14:20:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
krijn, for pattern you can use the title attribute.  For the others you don't, AFAIK.

[14:20:05.0000] <krijn>
Hmm

[14:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It might be kind of weird if you get a mix of languages that way or such.

[14:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[14:21:02.0000] <krijn>
Yeah, marketing people don't like that :)

[14:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
krijn, if we were to provide a way for authors to specify custom error messages, we would need a way for them to specify errors for all possible errors for each control

[14:21:04.0000] <krijn>
That's what we already do now

[14:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Another thing about Opera's implementation is that if the control that has the error isn't currently visible, the error will appear randomly in the middle of nowhere.  Not much way to fix that, though, I guess.

[14:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(It comes up in MediaWiki's Special:Preferences, which uses JS-based tabs.)

[14:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
doing so currently requires authors to use a script to provide their own complete custom error message, not simply replace the text

[14:22:03.0000] <krijn>
How I normally do it nowadays: <label>Foo <em>(required)</em> <input> <strong>Error message</strong></label>

[14:23:00.0000] <krijn>
So that the strong element can be put there with JS

[14:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
krijn, try out Opera's implementation.  It's a little pop-up box.

[14:23:02.0000] <krijn>
Yeah, I know

[14:23:03.0000] <krijn>
If there's no way to style it, I won't ever use it

[14:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yet another issue I noticed with Opera is it only gives the error for the first input.  Which might be necessary to stop them from overlapping, but still isn't as nice as you could do manually.

[14:24:01.0000] <krijn>
(Well, I would, but designers wouldn't)

[14:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Same here.  Probably MediaWiki would use it because we don't really have design people.  :D

[14:24:03.0000] <krijn>
Heh :)

[14:25:00.0000] <krijn>
Slightly related: how to markup 'this is a required' input in HTML5?

[14:25:01.0000] <krijn>
<input required> of course

[14:25:02.0000] <krijn>
But how's that presented to the user?

[14:25:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
You can do :required, if the browser's implementing things correctly.

[14:25:04.0000] <krijn>
Most designs have some kind of asterisk next to or inside the label

[14:25:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
You have to use CSS.

[14:25:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then use either direct styling, or ::before/::after

[14:26:00.0000] <krijn>
Then you will target the input

[14:26:01.0000] <krijn>
Hmm

[14:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Every browser that supports required also supports generated content, so you're good.  ;)

[14:26:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've used class=required on my inputs before, and used ::before{ content: "* " };

[14:26:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Don't care much for IE users?

[14:26:05.0000] <Lachy>
krijn, just use <label>Name (required) <input type=text required></label> (or use a * instead of (required))

[14:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
No.  No I don't.  Screw them.

[14:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
They can just deal with the error messages when they try to submit.

[14:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, even IE8 users?

[14:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's my attitude too!

[14:27:04.0000] <krijn>
Lachy: that's what I do now, yes

[14:27:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: ::before doesn't work in IE8

[14:27:06.0000] <krijn>
It doesn't?

[14:27:07.0000] <gsnedders>
:before doe

[14:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
*does

[14:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Crap, ::before *still* doesn't work there?  I haven't tested yet.

[14:28:02.0000] <krijn>
Ah :)

[14:28:03.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, :before works

[14:28:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
We don't bother with client-side form validation at all now, so if browsers don't implement HTML 5 forms, no loss.  :)

[14:28:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's dumb.

[14:28:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, it was originally :before, wasn't it?

[14:28:07.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, it's one of those things that the IE team failed to add because they were focussing on implementing just CSS2.1 and no-one thought to add support for the ::before/::after ones as well

[14:28:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
I actually forgot that it's supposed to be ::before these days.

[14:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I learned the pseudoelement/pseudoclass distinction immediately, so it's *always* been wrong when I see :before

[14:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
When I asked cwilso about it before IE8 shipped, he said it was too late to get it in on time :-(

[14:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
...It's too hard to put in an extra :.  Ok, whatever.

[14:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, there's such a thing as feature freeze.

[14:31:00.0000] <krijn>
They were too busy breaking other stuff ;o)

[14:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
damn, I'm getting 47% packet loss on my connection today. No wonder things are slow and keep dropping off :-(

[14:31:02.0000] <krijn>
Like button:active and background-position

[14:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you start doing stuff like that, then you're starting to add lots of little new features when you're supposed to be fixing bugs.

[14:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but that's a syntax bug.

[14:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not in CSS 2.1 . . .

[14:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#before-after-content

[14:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: You should run a script that sends dummy UDP packets to fill up that 47% of your connection, so you can use the remaining 53% for uninterrupted loss-free connections

[14:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor, when was it fixed then?

[14:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#pseudo-elements

[14:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
"This :: notation is introduced by the current document in order to establish a discrimination between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. For compatibility with existing style sheets, user agents must also accept the previous one-colon notation for pseudo-elements introduced in CSS levels 1 and 2 (namely, :first-line, :first-letter, :before and :after). This compatibility is not allowed for the new pseudo-elements introduced in this specific

[14:35:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
ation."

[14:35:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's not a syntax error, it's explicitly allowed.

[14:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, I got messed up.

[14:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was referring to the bug being *not* recognizing the :: syntax.

[14:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I just use :before and :after, personally.

[14:36:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, IE8 recognizes (almost?) no CSS 3.

[14:36:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[14:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, pseudoelement for error messages?  Then we can use content: to control the text.

[14:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
How would you know what the error was in CSS?

[14:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
A pseudoclass, obviously.  ^_^

[14:41:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Um, I guess that could work.

[14:41:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
input[type=number]:out-of-range::error { content: "You're out of range."; }

[14:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably better to use functional notation for the pseudoclass to avoid creating twenty of them . . .

[14:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Was just about to suggest that.

[14:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
input:invalid("out-of-range")?

[14:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe.

[14:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You'd want to have access to the title of the element, for pattern mismatches.

[14:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, yeah, I had that a similar idea ealier, but wasn't sure what could be put in as identifiers for each error

[14:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It sounds doable.

[14:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor, yeah, you can do that in content with the attr() function.

[14:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, but this is a pseudoelement.  Does attr() make any sense for pseudoelements?

[14:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, yes

[14:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems so.

[14:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm, you're right.  It may.  After all, pseudoelements *can't* have attributes, so it may make sense to say that the function draws from the superior parent (using Hixie's terminology in Generated content)

[14:47:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That works fine, then.

[14:47:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, Generated Content already says that, it seems.

[14:47:05.0000] <Lachy>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0D%0A%3Cstyle%3E%0D%0Ap%3A%3Abefore%20%7B%20content%3A%20attr(title)%20%22%20%22%3B%20%7D%0D%0A%3C%2Fstyle%3E%0D%0A%3Cp%20title%3D%22attr%22%3Etest

[14:47:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Example: [href]::after::alternate { content: attr(href); }

[14:47:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Excelelnt.

[14:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ignoring the ::alternate, doesn't that already work actually?

[14:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, what's the ::alternate pseduo element?

[14:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have no idea.

[14:48:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was just searching the spec for attr().  :)

[14:48:04.0000] <Lachy>
also, you're only allowed to use one pseudo-element per selector

[14:48:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/#inserting1

[14:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
::alternate is a magic element in Generated Content used for some of the magic algorithms, like footnotes.

[14:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And Generated Content relaxes that one-pseudoelement restriction.

[14:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, they must have changed that syntax rule

[14:49:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was quoting an example from the spec.  I think its editor hangs out here, you could ask him.  :)

[14:49:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Note: Generated Content is several years idle, I believe.

[14:49:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Probably since Hixie took up html5.

[14:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Undoubtedly.

[14:50:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
YeahTML 5!

[14:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah, yeah, I remember now. That has been in there a while. I don't think such chaining is supported by any browsers though, which is why I'd forgotted about it

[14:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And yes, a::after {content: attr(href);} works as expected, by drawing from the superior parent (the a).

[14:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#the-constraint-validation-api

[14:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
For source of values for the :invalid() pseudoclass

[14:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
We'd probably want to switch it to using css-dashes rather than camelCase.

[14:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or else go like currentColor and introduce inconsistent to match other specifications.

[14:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
inconsistency

[14:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, screw that.  There's a well-defined and unambiguous mapping, so we should use it to maintain internal consistency.

[14:56:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's my attitude too.  currentColor is ugly.

[14:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You'll never see a dash appear in those, because it's not allowed in an identifier name in js if you want to use the . syntax to access it.

[14:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And since that's way more convenient, nobody ever puts dashes in their identifiers.

[15:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  If I'm doing a simple page with a single section, do I need <article>?  Or am I fine with just making <header> a child of <body>?

[15:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, body is a sectioning element. No need for an extra <section> or <article>

[15:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
in fact, using a redundant section within body is technically wrong

[15:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thought so, but didn't want to check the spec.

[15:05:02.0000] <Lachy>
no worries. Asking in here is often a good enough substitute for checking the spec

[15:07:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Lachy, that's my favorite thing about this channel.

[15:07:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I've been able to understand the spec so much easier and so much faster thanks to the input here.

[15:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Think I should ping the CSS list with suggestion about :invalid()?

[15:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, go ahead

[15:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, I guess :invalid() would be useful even without ::error.

[15:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, is the idea to replace all those new pseudo-classes in HTML5 with a single :invalid(...); pseudo-class?

[15:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Possibly.  I need to go check the html5 pseudoclasses again.  I know I saw them just a few days ago.

[15:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All right, found them.

[15:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.  There's only one of them so far - :out-of-range - plus its converse.

[15:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So I'd replace that with :invalid(range-underflow) and :invalid(range-overflow), and add all the other types of invalidity.

[15:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is there a good use for :valid()?  Hixie has :valid and :invalid, plus :in-range and :out-of-range.

[15:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I guess it's equivalent to :not(:invalid(range-overflow)).

[15:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
What would :valid() even mean?

[15:15:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
But that's a mouthful.

[15:15:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, I see.

[15:15:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't how it would be used

[15:15:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
.

[15:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Presumably however Hixie is imagining :in-range would be used, I dunno.

[15:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, without ::error I'm not totally sure how :invalid() would be used.  Unless you want to fake up your own inline error messages pre-submit?

[15:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
For now, yeah, faking up your own messages.  Hopefully Opera would implement ::error at the same time, so we could display:none it for now, and use it properly once more browsers support ::error

[15:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's the logic in display: noneing it if it's styleable?

[15:21:01.0000] <fantasai>
Is there a way to indicate the target medium/media for a particular page?

[15:21:02.0000] <fantasai>
e.g. "This should be rendered in presentation mode if you have one"

[15:21:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's what we were just discussing on www-style, isn't it?  Apparently there's not.

[15:22:00.0000] <fantasai>
was just wondering if the discussion had already happened for HTML5

[15:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't remember it happening.

[15:24:00.0000] <fantasai>
ok, somebody should forward it there, then

[15:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess you couldn't even do anything with pure CSS to do that…

[15:24:02.0000] <fantasai>
we could

[15:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is hundreds of emails behind on www-style :D

[15:24:04.0000] <fantasai>
I'm not convinced we should

[15:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(I meant currently)

[15:25:01.0000] <fantasai>
/me wonders if that's just the gradient syntax discussion ;)

[15:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
fantasai: I saw that thread was long, but no, a lot more than that :)

[15:25:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I just archive those as fast as they come in.  :P

[15:25:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Relevant thread: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Aug/0338.html

[15:25:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, I obviously did "mark all as read" in www-style a few days ago, so I'm only 30 behind :P

[15:26:00.0000] <fantasai>
I never do that. I just have folders that are mostly unread. Like the whatwg folder....

[15:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
If we do want to do that, I'd say I'd prefer it to be in CSS

[15:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
fantasai: Well, I skim the subject lines at least

[15:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But I generally don't do much with layout anyway

[15:29:00.0000] <fantasai>
gsnedders: Like, an @target-media rule?

[15:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
fantasai: I dunno. I write so little CSS I can speak neither as an author or implementer. :P

[15:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But yeah, an at-rule seems about as sane as you could get

[15:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: You'd display:none the ::error because otherwise you get *both* faked up error messages and the real ::error messages.

[15:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Once enough browsers support ::error, you stop doing that and just style ::error

[15:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
::error is only going to show up when the user submits the form, right?

[15:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Now, I need to sleep and stop claiming I have any idea about CSS :P

[15:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you'd be having the full error message displayed always, even when the user first loads the empty form?

[15:31:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, really?  I read *every single* www-style and whatwg email.  I'll occasionally skim the htmlwg ones, but I still open them up.

[15:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I read everything on whatwg and public-html

[15:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: no, just when they're invalid, and thus matching the :invalid() class.

[15:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I used to read www-style when I did more layout stuff

[15:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also, if any of you are using mail clients that don't group threads, I apologize for the gradient discussion.  ^_^

[15:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
People use mail clients that don't? :P

[15:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, which will mean, e.g., every required field in a newly-loaded blank form.  Or a field that's not required but has a pattern/min/max/etc., and it isn't met when the user hits the first character.  Then the message will show up while the user is still typing.

[15:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: they should match using the same rules that would be used to display ::error, shouldn't they?  Or do those *only* display on form submit?

[15:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, currently Opera only displays errors on form submit.

[15:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess the spec doesn't say?

[15:34:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Let me check - not sure

[15:34:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Spec doesn't say

[15:34:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Impl. detail

[15:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
fantasai: On the whole, to give my opinion, I don't think we really should have target-media or anything like that

[15:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think good UI here would be to display the error once the user has filled out that field and moved to a different one, at least for fields where the default value is valid.  But I don't do UI.  :)

[15:35:02.0000] <fantasai>
gsnedders: How would you solve the problem Opera's using @media to hack around?

[15:35:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's what I do in my timesheet/journal app I designed for work.

[15:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't mark as invalid until they trigger a change event, but I check for validity on keypress.

[15:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Otherwise :invalid and :out-of-range as described in html5 are largely useless.

[15:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I tried using :invalid, but dropped it because it put annoying exclamation points or whatever everywhere in newly-loaded forms.

[15:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So then it *is* useless in practice.

[15:39:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That needs to be changed.

[15:39:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
But is that a spec-level thing, or a browser-bug thing?

[15:39:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's spec-level.  The spec says :invalid matches any element that's in the invalid state.

[15:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Gotcha.

[15:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(without actually double-checking to make sure)

[15:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So yeah, I don't actually see any good use for that.

[15:40:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, you're right.

[15:40:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
So html5 has to change.

[15:40:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'll file a bug!  Woo!

[15:40:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
What should it say?

[15:40:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
This stuff is more subtle than I initially thought.

[15:40:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably because I don't know anything about UI.  :)

[15:40:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
(despite writing lots of it, hurrah)

[15:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, as a first approximation, only mark as invalid on a change event, but mark as valid on keypress.

[15:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sexy that up as appropriate.

[15:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is it appropriate for the spec to dictate the exact time that the error pops up?

[15:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's only dictating when a pseudoclass applies.

[15:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And I think that *is* appropriate.

[15:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[15:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But ::error would be left vague?

[15:42:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

[15:42:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, do we even need ::error if :invalid is redefined like this?

[15:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
UAs could just use :invalid and generated content, and authors who want to override it can just put in their own CSS rules.

[15:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Depends.  ::error lets UAs do fun things like producing a popup on form submit.

[15:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
A style-able popup?

[15:43:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you have ::error, then yes.

[15:43:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least to some degree.

[15:43:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Presumably a plain text string now, XBL to wrap it in fanciness later.

[15:43:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Popups usually don't have arbitrary style.  They're part of the browser UI, not the site.

[15:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[15:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, whatever Opera does now.

[15:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me goes to investigate Opera behavior.

[15:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's just some kind of box that gets overlaid on the content.

[15:44:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's not interactive, I don't think.

[15:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I don't remember, and my Opera is kind of broken right now.)

[15:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm, I've got Opera beta 2, and I'm submitting an empty <input required>.  Is that supposed to happen?

[15:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You mean 10.00 beta 2?

[15:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, didn't happen for me.

[15:46:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, 10b2

[15:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<!DOCTYPE html><title>Test</title><form><input required><input type=submit></form>

[15:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
This is submitting without an error for me.

[15:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You don't have anyplace it's submitting to . . .

[15:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That should default to submitting to the current page.

[15:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, really?

[15:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I depend on that behavior!

[15:48:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Works in IE and FF, at least.

[15:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, it was the lack of a @name that was screwing it up

[15:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I actually always have to look up the syntax for <form>.  I practically never make a new one, I just fiddle with existing ones.  Or use various abstraction layers.

[15:49:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, right.

[15:49:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
inputs with no name are exempt from constraint validation.

[15:49:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nameless inputs aren't succeessful.

[15:49:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[15:49:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, so opera currently just has a magically positioned box with a simple text and border.

[15:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah.

[15:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That *should*, in a perfect world, be styleable with ::error

[15:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though how to reproduce the positioning I dunno.

[15:50:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What if another browser puts it in a totally different place?

[15:50:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I might be okay with leaving that up to the UA if it acts like abspos and dosn't push my design around.

[15:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This sounds like it will need a lot of thought and authoring experience.

[15:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.  To the list!

[15:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Actually, I have *got* to finish this page for work today.  I'll go to the lists in an hour.)


2009-08-25
[17:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, on reflection, I actually don't think styling of error messages is essential for HTML 5 forms.  It's not meant to totally replace script.  It lets you declare constraints in a nice, simple, standard, easy-to-use, declarative manner.  If the UA supports script, you can use the script interfaces provided to override the default error handling.

[17:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If not, or if you can't be bothered or don't care much about aesthetics, you can use the UA defaults.

[17:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But that's the two extremes - ignore it entirely, or roll a completely homebrew error message.

[17:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I believe there's a middle area that's still useful to hit.

[17:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.  Maybe.  But it sounds very complicated.

[17:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
When you start trying to work out the details, I mean.

[17:01:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, I think it ends up relatively simple.

[17:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least, if the definitions of the pseudoclasses are modified appropriately.

[17:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
input:invalid('range-underflow')::error { content: "This is too small."; border: 2px solid red; padding: 5px; background: wheat; color: red; font-weight: bold; }

[17:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or whatever.

[17:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's assuming that all the features are available.

[17:03:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
And that box gets put where?  Undefined?  How do you know if there's enough space, etc.?

[17:03:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
If ::error isn't reliably available, then use input::error { display: none; } and input:invalid('range-underflow')::after { --rules-- };

[17:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
::error box is generated in a UA-defined location.

[17:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
UA is expected to ensure that it fits on the page.

[17:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And displays when?  Also UA-defined?

[17:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.  Opera does it on submit, but it would probably also be fine to do it whenever the element matches :invalid, assuming :invalid is changed to not match immediately on pageload.

[17:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you aim for middle ground, you run the risk of hitting too high to satisfy half the authors and too low to satisfy the other half.

[17:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
True.

[17:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So I'm aiming for something that would satisfy me as an author.

[17:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The proposal is quite rigid.  If you want even slightly more control, you have to throw the whole thing out and redo it from scratch.

[17:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed, but if you give up any more control, you *explode* in complexity.

[17:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[17:07:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
To the point that doing it in script is comparable.

[17:07:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yes.  Doing it in script isn't so bad.

[17:07:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not with all the nice APIs that were added.

[17:07:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
This is true.

[17:07:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
A few lines, really.

[17:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, depending on what you want to do.

[17:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I dunno the accessibility issue, especially when compared to the native error semantics.

[17:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, I initially thought the same as you, but after speaking with our dev relations person about this, there are apparently a lot of authors who don't want all the complexities of using javascripts just to make error messages look nice

[17:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I agree that not using JavaScript would be nice.

[17:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I actually just said on the whatwg list how much I preferred this declarative stuff to even one line of JavaScript.

[17:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(in the case of autofocus)

[17:09:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[17:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
JS has its place :-)

[17:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Especially since there are so many little ways that the simple js solution is wrong.

[17:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And by the time you get it right, it's way too big and omigodwhydon'tbrowsersjustdothisformeforgodsakes

[17:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wouldn't a decent working solution just be (kind of pseudo-codey since my JS is terrible): onchange="if (!this.validity.valid) appendErrorMsg(this)" oninput="if (this.validity.valid) removeErrorMsg(this)", with appendErrorMsg() and removeErrorMsg() being a line or two?

[17:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Most of the effort seems like it would go into writing up descriptions for every possible error condition.

[17:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or combinations thereof.

[17:21:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[17:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That would work just fine.

[17:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, there's even an invalid event.

[17:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Aha.

[17:22:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just use this.validationMessage.

[17:22:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was thinking that should exist, and it does.  :)

[17:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Bah, I really don't know any JavaScript.

[17:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
can you point me to the invalid event?

[17:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I only see one reference to it, actually.

[17:24:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Perhaps it's an error.

[17:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Returns true if the element's value has no validity problems; false otherwise. Fires an invalid event at the element in the latter case."

[17:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I do know javascript, though with a jQuery accent.

[17:25:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
spec referencee?

[17:25:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#the-constraint-validation-api

[17:25:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
valid = element . checkValidity()

[17:25:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Under there.

[17:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I don't see it mentioned elsewhere in the spec.

[17:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, I see now.

[17:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's mentioned elsewhere.

[17:26:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or no, maybe it's not.

[17:26:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway.

[17:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I don't see it elsewhere.  I just see references to firing the invalid event.

[17:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I guess that's enough.  Events don't really have any properties other than a name.

[17:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me tries to figure out how to say "add some HTML right after the current element" without having to do all this document.createElement(); etc. etc. stuff

[17:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
$("some html").insertAfter(another element);

[17:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or $(element).after("some html"); if that's more convenient.

[17:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, but if I'm trying to come up with a solution that's only a few lines long, it's kind of cheating to use a multi-thousand line library.  :)

[17:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's not my fault that stuffs not part of ecma.  It should be.  ^_^

[17:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
onchange="this.checkValidity()" oninvalid="err = document.createElement('div'); err.class='error'; err.appendChild(document.createTextNode(this.validationMessage); document.insertBefore(err, this.nextSibling);" oninput="if (this.validity.valid && this.nextSibling.class == 'error') this.nextSibling.removeNode()"

[17:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's one line, technically.

[17:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Insofar as a "line" is delimited by "\n" rather than, say, ";".

[17:34:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(It's totally untested and almost certainly wrong.)

[17:34:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Your technical definition is useless and wrong.

[17:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hey, it works great for Unix utilities.

[17:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No need to make up different definitions just because it's a programming language.

[17:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
$(input).change(function(){this.checkValidity();}).invalid(function(){$("<div class='error'>").text(this.validationMessage).insertAfter(this);}).input(function(){if(this.validity.valid){$("+ .error", this).remove();});

[17:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That shoudl work.

[17:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[17:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It looks like checkValidity() in Opera fires its own custom error thingie.

[17:37:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe I need to return false?

[17:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If the invalid event isn't cancelled, it triggers the validation stuff.

[17:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So return false from oninvalid;

[17:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Doesn't seem to help.

[17:38:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
"When the checkValidity() method is invoked, if the element is a candidate for constraint validation and does not satisfy its constraints, the user agent must fire a simple event called invalid that is cancelable (but has no default action)"

[17:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll try using element.validity.valid tactic instead.

[17:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, as soon as I start writing jQuery I get screwed up on PHP.  Too much use of the $ glyph.

[17:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, rats.  I'm not sure Opera 9.6 supports validationMessage.

[17:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[17:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think I've got this working, except validationMessage seems to always be empty.

[17:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sweet.  And you got it suppressing the native Opera error display?

[17:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, not exactly.

[17:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I didn't try that.

[17:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well we need that.  ^_^  I suppose we can defer to ::error existing and letting us display:none it, but I'd rather not if possible.

[17:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Since Opera only triggers on form submit, you should be able to just stop the form submit to override, I'd assume.

[17:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, that's true.

[17:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
How can you dump all an element's attributes to alert()?  Or otherwise inspect them?

[17:54:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
A quick loop through the form, manually checking validity, and cancelling submit on fail.

[17:54:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's a method for that.

[17:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There is?  I don't know.

[17:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
form.checkValidity()

[17:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
didn't you say that checkValidity on an element triggers it to display the native messages, though?

[17:55:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[17:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The spec doesn't actually say that it does.

[17:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yah, but Opera does so, right?

[17:56:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
On inputs, yes.  Forms, dunno.

[17:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, right.  I would *assume* that form.checkValidity just does checkValidity on each element, but I'd need to test.

[17:56:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably you're right.

[18:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think I'm odd.  Given that I wasn't able to easily figure out from running JavaScript whether validationMessage is supported, my first inclination was to grep the source code for Opera for "validationMessage".  Given that's impossible, my second inclination was to grep the binary.

[18:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
$ grep validationMessage /usr/lib/opera/9.64/opera

[18:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Binary file /usr/lib/opera/9.64/opera matches

[18:00:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I guess it must have some kind of support, huh?

[18:00:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
One would think.  But perhaps it's just /* Seriously, put in something for validationMessage when I'm less drunk. */

[18:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
except maybe in swedish.

[18:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Comments don't make it into the binary.

[18:01:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But you didn't find it in the source... strange.

[18:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . in what source?

[18:01:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, you *couldn't*.

[18:01:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Opera is closed-source.

[18:01:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sorry, misread you.

[18:01:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway.

[18:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, validationMessage exists on the element, but is just the empty string.

[18:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[18:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So they just set it up to match the API, but aren't fully conforming yet.

[18:02:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or I'm doing something wrong.

[18:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe it's in 10.00.

[18:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Send me a test page, I"ll check it.

[18:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
onchange="this.checkValidity(); if (!this.validity.valid) { err = document.createElement('div'); err.class='error'; err.appendChild(document.createTextNode(this.validationMessage)); this.parentNode.insertBefore(err, this.nextSibling); } alert(this.validationMessage);" oninput="if (this.validity.valid and this.nextSibling.class == 'error') this.nextSibling.removeNode()"

[18:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The alert() is for debugging, of course.

[18:04:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
so you just popped that onto an <input>?

[18:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
A more minimal test case would just be, say: <input pattern=... name=foo onchange="alert(this.validationMessage)">

[18:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
<!doctype html><title>Test</title><form><input pattern=... name=foo onchange="alert(this.validationMessage)"><input type=submit></form>

[18:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Seems to always be the empty string.

[18:05:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(... is the actual pattern here, not a placeholder :P)

[18:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haha, interesting.

[18:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also, awesome.

[18:06:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which part?

[18:06:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyway, ys, 10b2 also gives me the empty string.

[18:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, the part where ... is a valid pattern

[18:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
even without quotes

[18:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was actually using ....* as my pattern, but ... seemed more natural.

[18:07:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh.

[18:07:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wrote an abstraction layer for MediaWiki that automatically decides whether to add quotes.

[18:07:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's crazy what you don't have to quote.

[18:07:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Minimum length of 10: pattern=.{10,}

[18:07:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
No quotes needed.

[18:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The only unintuitive character that needs quotes is =.

[18:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd probably quote that anyway.  I quote anything that goes beyond alphanums and -

[18:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, but my abstraction layer automatically doesn't quote it.  :)

[18:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(saves two bytes . . .)

[18:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's the funny part.  When I saw the HTML output I went "WTF?".

[18:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd probably quote that too if I did it by hand.

[18:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hehe

[18:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, I think my code is okay proof-of-concept.  The only reason it's so long is because DOM methods are so stupidly clumsy.

[18:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nod

[18:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I blame Java.

[18:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
err = document.createElement('div'); err.class='error'; err.appendChild(document.createTextNode(this.validationMessage)); this.parentNode.insertBefore(err, this.nextSibling);

[18:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
vs. something sane like the jQuery you gave.

[18:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
$(this).after("<div class=error>" + this.validationMessage + "</div>");

[18:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
yup

[18:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
<3 jQuery

[18:12:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I didn't program *any* js before jQuery.

[18:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So anyway, the main flexibility I think you get from this is control over the timing and location of the error message.

[18:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You're pretty limited in how you style it if you can't control where it will appear, I'd think.

[18:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You don't know what a good size is, etc.

[18:13:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
If it's abspos floating in an intelligent area determined by the UA, though, I think that'll generally be good enough.

[18:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Don't write a novel in the text, of course.

[18:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Isn't "abspos floating" an oxymoron?

[18:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bah, stupid CSS eating all the good english terms.

[18:15:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
absposed into an intelligent area.

[18:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or mysteriously made to appear there, as the case may be.

[18:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway.  What about timing?

[18:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Neither of us thinks Opera's timing is very good.

[18:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It should be onchange instead of onsubmit, where that makes sense.

[18:16:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think displaying on submit is fine.  I just disagree with the timing of :invalid

[18:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: you should make your script grab the sections from the open bugs too, since they provide IDs

[18:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All right, done with work now, only an hour and a half late.e

[18:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: would a proposal to change the selectors that match invalid form elements be best in whatwg or www-style?

[18:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
which text do you want to change, Selectors, or HTML5?

[18:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't think that Selectors has any relevant text, so HTML5.  So I guess that answers my question.

[18:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
pretty much :-)

[18:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
HTML5 is intending to do whatever selectors says

[18:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
so if you can interpret selectors in a different way than html5 does, then let me know

[18:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, do you mean :invalid?

[18:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[18:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
that might be in CSS3 UI rather than Selectors

[18:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
i forget where we drew that line

[18:35:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
:invalid, and :out-of-range (and their converses)

[18:35:05.0000] <Hixie>
i think they're in css3 ui

[18:35:06.0000] <Hixie>
so everything i said, but s/selectors/css3 ui/

[18:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh yeah, there we go.

[18:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Of course, the latest draft here is from *2004*.  Is tantek even part of www-style anymore?

[18:36:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Considering he threw a hissy fit a few months ago and claimed to be unsubscribing, perhaps not?

[18:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm, looks like I need to raise separate issues in both whatwg *and* www-style.

[18:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I already filed the whatwg issue as a spec bug today, so maybe that's okay?

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't been following css at all recently

[18:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh, that's fine.  I don't think we've been doing much relevant to html.

[18:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
i look forward to sticking my head into their wg meeting in november and seeing if they made any progress since i stopped going to the meetings

[18:40:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's the one in the bay area, right?

[18:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
yah

[18:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
you going?

[18:40:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I might be going then.  ^_^  Just got approved as an Invited Expert this morning.

[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
sweet

[18:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yus.

[18:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you're an htmlwg member, google's offering to pay the w3c's $150 fee for wed-fri

[18:41:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh man, awesome.

[18:41:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Speaking of which, does anyone know what the procedure is for becoming an Invited Expert in the HTML WG?  It seems like the bar is pretty low, so I applied, but I don't know when to expect a response.

[18:41:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
How do I get up on that.

[18:41:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Aryeh: it's described over on whatwg.org

[18:41:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or what response to expect.

[18:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It takes several days.

[18:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0937.html

[18:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: look at one of the whatwg blog entries from 2007 or so

[18:42:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, I wasn't part of htmlwg at that point.

[18:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: if i don't get up to the 20-person cap, i might be able to swing getting you the $100 for the css side of things too -- remind me in the e-mail

[18:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Aha, so I have to e-mail a couple of people in addition to filling out the Invited Expert Application Form?

[18:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: it's a whole Process

[18:43:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Any idea what the cut-off on getting in on that is, Hixie?  Whether or not I go depends on whether I can scrape up enough by November to head there.  I'll probably have enough in my vacation fund by then to get me and my wfie out there.

[18:43:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Aryeh: I didn't have to email anyone, though the Process says to.

[18:43:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I just waited, and like 10 days later was in.

[18:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's been . . . 7 days.

[18:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I'll wait a few more.

[18:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Thanks.

[18:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0363.html

[18:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: (drop me an e-mail if you think it's possible you might want to go, though, so i can reserve you a spot on my list)

[18:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Mid-September, okay.

[18:45:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'll put the question to the wife tonight, figure out our finances.

[18:45:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: It's definitely *possible* that I'd want to go.  It's just a matter of money, not will.  ^_^

[18:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[18:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if, if i get enough people to go, i can say that that gets me out of going

[18:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me hates meetings

[18:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haha

[18:46:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I want a chance to meet people face-to-facee.

[18:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, the social aspect is nice

[18:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, Hixie.  I filed a spec bug today (7411) on the selectors matching invalid elements.  Should I raise that in an actual email, or is that sufficient?

[18:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
spec bug and e-mail are equivalent to me

[18:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
the only difference is which line they affect: http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html

[18:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
k.  Should I sign up for bugzilla and add more detail?

[18:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
only if you think there's not enough detail 

[18:49:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  Eh, it probably is.  How can I get Bugzilla to email me when the bug gets its status changed?

[18:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
add yourself to the cc list

[18:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Gotcha.

[18:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All right, further detail given, and cc added.

[18:57:00.0000] <cardona507>
hixie - are there still 15 seats open? and if so are there qualifications to be involved?

[18:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's still plenty of open spots, yes

[18:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0937.html and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0363.html cover everything there is to know, i think

[18:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok, i gotta go

[18:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[19:06:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
where in teh spec are the UA conformance rules for doctype?

[19:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is this good enough? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype

[19:11:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
that seems to define the syntax for authors, but not the UA processing requirements (such as what doctypes trigger quirks mode)

[19:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: it seems the only place to define quirks behavior is in a weird implicit way in the parsing algorithm

[20:31:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hello!

[20:36:00.0000] <cardona507>
hello

[20:41:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hey cardona507

[21:11:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
<body><header></header><section><h1>Page Title</h1><p>Hello World!</p></section><footer>Copyright &copy; 2009</footer></body> is a basic html5 page, yes?

[21:12:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Doh, except that I did not put anything in the <header />

[21:16:00.0000] <cardona507>
shouldn't it be surrounded by <html></html>?

[21:16:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I meant, within the body.

[21:21:00.0000] <cardona507>
looks pretty basic to me

[21:36:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Within the header, that would be the header for the site or the page, right?

[21:45:00.0000] <cardona507>
are you asking if what goes between <header> & </header> is what you see on the page as a header?

[22:17:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
cardona, here's a very basic example of a valid html5 page.  Is this right?  http://pastebin.com/d50828caa

[22:21:00.0000] <cardona507>
It looks good to me. But I must confess that I am very new to html5 - anyone else care to weigh in?

[22:24:00.0000] <cardona507>
this might help with your header question: http://boblet.tumblr.com/post/134276674/html5-structure2

[22:26:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yea, I've heard that the <nav> does not need to be in the header, ah that part still confused me just a little.

[00:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
good evening everyone

[00:32:00.0000] <foolip>
good morning

[00:32:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
good times all

[00:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
mornings

[00:35:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Is this good, or should the nav be inside the header, http://pastebin.com/d50828caa ?

[01:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=253346 is INVALID per HTML5, right?

[01:52:00.0000] <annevk2>
yes

[01:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: ok. WONTFIXed. thanks

[01:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
in theory it's INVALID

[01:54:01.0000] <annevk2>
well, future-yet-to-be-a-real-standard-theory

[01:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm being generous and marking bugs that are valid per HTML4 as WONTFIX

[01:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me hates bugzilla resolutions

[01:55:01.0000] <annevk2>
heh

[01:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
although I guess INCOMPLETE is new, and an improvement

[01:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
does REMIND still exist in the latest bugzilla?

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: IIRC, after a decade or so, it was finally buried

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in a way, I'm glad that Netscape engineers didn't have the cycles to "fix" all the SGML stuff in the Netscape 6 cycle

[01:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Radar has resolutions including "Software changed", "Feature removed", "Documentation changed", "Duplicate", "Cannot reproduce", "Behaves correctly", "Not to be fixed" and "Insufficient information"

[01:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I always hated having to say "INVALID" for what might be either "behaves correctly" or "insufficient information"

[02:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it feels like something the Master Control Program from TRON would say, not a human mode of communication

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
spec/docs changed would be a good resolution to have indeed

[02:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yesterday I realized that Radar should have a resolution "Confusing UI"

[02:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I finally understood what the keyboard identification dialog wanted me to do

[02:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I had always misread it.

[02:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
to the point of even borrowing another keyboard to bypass it

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe I should follow up with the Radar bug I filed about it for the wrong reason the last time round

[02:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: "confusing UI" is more a category of bug than a resolution...

[02:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
specifically the "Usability" classification

[02:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
REMIND and LATER are two resolutions i argued long and hard to drop

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm amused that i use them now in the w3c bugzilla

[02:27:00.0000] <foolip_>
Hixie: if you're still confused about what microdata syntax I am proposing, I'm here.

[02:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Did you see the discussion about microdata formats from yesterday

[02:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
?

[02:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: your ideas about nested subitems don't seem to fit the use cases we have for them

[02:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Specifically about using selectors to select on an item without fully qualified names

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: microdata is modelling a nested tree

[02:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: lists of name-value pairs that can be nested

[02:29:03.0000] <jgraham>
s/about using/about not beiung able to use/

[02:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: so i don't see what an anonymous child would mean, and modelling it compared to the DOM makes no sense, imho

[02:29:05.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i did not

[02:30:00.0000] <foolip_>
Hixie: anonymous as in you don't need to give it an itemprop value

[02:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
right, that makes no sense to me

[02:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's a name-value pair list

[02:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
the "name" part is integral to what we're modelling

[02:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
look at the vcard vocabulary

[02:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
for instance

[02:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Right so the point was that if you have <span item="com.example"><span itemprop=foo></span><span item="org.example"><span itemprop="foo"></span></span></span>

[02:32:01.0000] <foolip_>
I have looked at it and don't see why named itemprops which are unnamed items is any clearer than just named items

[02:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
the current model is <div itemprop="name" item="type"> <span itemprop="subname"> subvalue </span> </div>

[02:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
dropping the itemprop="name" part is meaningless imho

[02:32:04.0000] <jgraham>
And you want to select org.example.foo but not com.example.foo you can't do it without knowing the structure in advance

[02:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: i don't understand what you mean

[02:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: org.example.foo?

[02:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
the itemprop foo of type org.example

[02:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't remember the right terms

[02:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i can't see a use case where you would want a specific _type_'s subproperty directly like that

[02:34:01.0000] <foolip_>
Hixie: I'm saying that nested name-value lists are more difficult to understand and use than a simple tree

[02:35:00.0000] <foolip_>
it makes the DOM API more confusing

[02:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Well if you want to style all the foo properties of a specific item type, for example

[02:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: oh you're suggesting changing the actual underlying data model structure as well??

[02:35:03.0000] <jgraham>
It doesn't seem unreasonable

[02:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: i wasn't even considering that

[02:36:00.0000] <foolip_>
Hixie: yes, but it seems a rather minor change

[02:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: don't style microdata. it's not intended for use with styling. things will go badly if you start relying on microdata for styling.

[02:36:02.0000] <foolip_>
the syntax is largely the same

[02:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: changing an underlying assumption is never a minor change.

[02:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: you have to revisit every design decision that was based on the previous assumption and reconsider the decisions to make sure the new design makes sense again.

[02:36:05.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: so what is the data structure you are suggesting?

[02:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I'm not sure authors will feel the same way

[02:37:01.0000] <foolip_>
Hixie: simply a tree where each node has string properties and subnodes

[02:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: that doesn't seem to be a good fit for the use cases we have.

[02:37:03.0000] <jgraham>
Also many JS libraries are heavily selector based and people are likely to try using selectors to access microdata items through js

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: and we already have that data model anyway -- the DOM itself

[02:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: for example, imagine the microdata for a book, which has four vcards associated with it, two for authors, and two for editors.

[02:38:02.0000] <foolip_>
Hixie: there are no examples where both the itemprop and item would have a type

[02:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: how would you express that in your model?

[02:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
itemprop doesn't ever have a type

[02:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
it has a name

[02:41:00.0000] <foolip_>
Hixie: I would make author/editor part of the subitem or I would add intermediary "authors" and "editors" items

[02:42:00.0000] <foolip_>
if someone is both an author and an editor I would do the former

[02:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
could you show the syntax for this?

[02:44:00.0000] <foolip_>
if you'll allow me to use the DOM-isomorphism for brevity: <book><person type="author"/><person type="editor"/></book> or <book><authors><person/></authors><editors>...</editors></book>

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can see how to do it in the DOM

[02:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
but how would you do it in your microdata syntax?

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think your sample markup shows a misunderstanding, btw. "author" is a type of "person", but "person" is the type of that object.

[02:46:00.0000] <foolip_>
the first case: <span item="book"><span item="person"><span itemprop="type">author</span></span></span>

[02:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i don't understand how in your syntax you would say that one "list-of-vcards" is named "authors" and another is named "editors" given that you don't have names for subitems)

[02:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
wait, you're saying that you'd add fields to the vcard vocabulary just to be able to integrate vcard into other vocabularies?

[02:47:00.0000] <foolip_>
you'll have to be more specific, this isn't a vcard example

[02:47:01.0000] <foolip_>
well, we should use <span item="vcard"> instead of person above

[02:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
you'd add fields to the "person" vocabulary just to be able to integrate it into other vocabularies

[02:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: regarding the Google usability study: are you going to test hCalendar vs. vCal-RDF-in-RDFa vs. vCal-in-microdata?

[02:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: for expressing an event

[02:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: no, we don't really have the resources to do any more than just a straight forward comparison of maybe three microdata variants at most

[02:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok.

[02:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway i really should go to bed

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: i don't think your proposals are sound, to be honest

[02:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: i think they confuse "type" and "name" in a way that would seriously compromise the mechanism

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: maybe we should drop "type" for subitems, though

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip_: i'll think about it

[02:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:51:03.0000] <foolip_>
Hixie: if you're unwilling to test the syntax I can't force you, of course, I'm saying that the DOM API etc are very confusing now and this seems to help

[02:51:04.0000] <foolip_>
let's see what others say

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. 10 billion page views per month through Opera Mini

[03:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if the default search and bookmark placements pay for all that 

[03:59:00.0000] <jaket>
does opera use that usage data for anything else

[04:52:00.0000] <ray>
opera is big brother, they use it for everything else

[06:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets-vm/Overview.src.html new stuff or a spec for existing behaviors?

[06:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does e.g. Mobile Safari already support the events when the user turns an iPhone sideways?

[06:29:00.0000] <Rik|work>
hsivonen: http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006511-SW16

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: should we have onorientationchange as an attribute in HTML5?

[06:57:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me throws a dog at Hixie

[07:27:00.0000] <annevk3>
http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/124 and comments is quite a good read

[07:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
yeah

[07:34:00.0000] <takkaria>
it's interesting because the author appears to actually like RDFa yet it still saying useful, constructive things

[07:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess there is no special reason that some of the RDFa community behaving in unproductive ways means that no one else from the RDFa community is capable of rational discourse

[07:52:00.0000] <adactio>
I could do with some help with some examples I've made for the outline algorithm. If anybody has five minutes to run a sanity check, 'twould be much appreciated.

Can anyone confirm/deny?

[07:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
did you check with the outline checker?

[07:58:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That's the fourth time or so today people have said to bug me for new features in public web services…

[07:58:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: I asked for a textarea months ago

[07:58:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: So did zcorpan, and he did it first.

[07:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
You can't claim you don't have time whilst simultanously wanting to play minigolf

[07:59:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Obviously, you can tell from the fact I haven't done it that I don't like zcorpan

[07:59:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: But minigolf is more fun than sitting around coding, and I can pretend to like zcorpan then :P

[08:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is reasonably sure that gsnedders|work is overestimating the amusment of trying to get a small ball into a distant hole that is situatued atop a minature windmill

jgraham: You obviously haven't been to the Himalayas!

on those kinds of courses

[08:06:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I prefer the strong powerful lob

[08:07:00.0000] <jcranmer>
the last time I played minigolf, my ball flew out of the course, hit a lamppost, and landed in the green right next to the hole

[08:07:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I wondered whether or not that should be considered an out-of-bounds penalty

[08:07:02.0000] <jcranmer>
as it didn't *stop* out of bounds

[08:07:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Well, from memory, it is only where it comes to rest that matters

[13:45:00.0000] <hallvors>
who broke the wonderful http://www.whatwg.org/HTML5 shortcut? :-p

[13:45:01.0000] <hallvors>
..or did I just make it up?

[13:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: Lowercase html5

[13:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And you can skip the www. for a shortercut

[13:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And most browsers let you omit the http://

[13:49:00.0000] <hallvors>
LOL. thanks, gsnedders. the site added www and the browser added http:// indeed

[13:49:01.0000] <hallvors>
(looking at the textarea maxlength issue btw)

[13:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah

[13:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: I dunno if there are still sites broken by that, as the one in the URL field had gone when I tried it earlier.

[13:50:02.0000] <hallvors>
it's funny how jQuery.validate explicitly detects some presumably bogus values 

[13:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jQuery.validate works now

[13:51:00.0000] <hallvors>
hm, IRC isn't JavaScript-friendly..

[13:51:01.0000] <hallvors>
maxlength may be returned as -1, 2147483647 (IE) and 524288 (safari) for text inputs

[13:51:02.0000] <hallvors>
it says

[13:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I saw

[13:51:04.0000] <gsnedders>
We return -1

[13:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Which is interesting, as I'd expect it is undefined

[13:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(whereas maxLength is 0)

[13:52:02.0000] <annevk3>
they support maxlength in addition to maxLength?

[13:52:03.0000] <gsnedders>
No, they only use maxlength now

[13:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
They used to use maxLength, which breaks Opera 9+

[13:53:01.0000] <annevk3>
I was replying to what hallvors was suggesting

[13:53:02.0000] <annevk3>
if it returns something in those browsers...

[13:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't think it's that simple :)

[13:57:00.0000] <hallvors>
as far as I can see, the spec doesn't say what the browser should return for element.maxLength if there is no maxlength attribute

[13:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: 0

[13:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: Follow xref for 'reflects'

[13:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(This is one horrible bit of how HTML5 is spec'd)

[13:58:02.0000] <hallvors>
it also doesn't say what the implementation should do if the value attribute contains too many characters (more than maxlength allows) - or?

[13:59:00.0000] <hallvors>
gsnedders: thanks but I don't even find the "reflects" link . Looking here: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#the-maxlength-attribute

[13:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hopes he doesn't hit the crashing bug

[14:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: That's the HTML attribute

[14:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: You want #dom-textarea-maxlength

[14:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: And that's the dfn for input anyway

[14:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: "…if the attribute is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or 0 if there is no default value."

[14:03:00.0000] <hallvors>
found it now, thanks. Also found the fix in jQuery's code I think.

[14:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: jQuery.validate gets maxlength from DOM not maxLength (note case)

[14:04:01.0000] <hallvors>
gsnedders: you could be a bit more detailed in your BTS comments :)

[14:04:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Did I not explain this all, just concisely? :P

[14:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Which issue is it anyway?)

[14:05:01.0000] <hallvors>
CORE-23563

[14:06:00.0000] <hallvors>
and I think the spec should make the default return value for maxLength -1 when the attribute isn't specified

[14:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
If it changes, it'd need to change for all things using unsigned long

[14:06:02.0000] <hallvors>
otherwise we break all sites using jQuery.validate 1.3

[14:07:00.0000] <hallvors>
why can't it just be added as a special case in #dom-textarea-maxlength rather than it pointing to reflect?

[14:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: If seems ugly to change it in one place

[14:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: http://www.theplace.org.uk/codelib/js/jquery/jquery.validate.js uses maxLength and maxlength, the maxLength case is gone now

[14:07:03.0000] <hallvors>
gsnedders: compatibility is all about being ugly :-o

[14:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: I want to try and get an idea of how much breaks with it as zero, if it's one site…

[14:08:01.0000] <annevk2>
or generalizing things into a new datatype :-o

[14:08:02.0000] <hallvors>
if we follow the spec, we'll have to do it for <input>.maxLength too 

[14:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, we've been shipping it since Opera 9, and AFAIK that's the only site we ever got the issue reported on

[14:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
h everybody

[14:09:01.0000] <hallvors>
so it would break on all <input> validation too

[14:09:02.0000] <annevk2>
hey othermaciej

[14:10:00.0000] <hallvors>
even a few sites using 1.3 (+ other versions?) would cause some trouble there

[14:10:01.0000] <annevk2>
hallvors, so when the attribute is not specified you want it to return -1 rather than 0?

[14:10:02.0000] <annevk2>
hallvors, and this is what other browsers are already doing?

[14:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: Nothing else already does. Only we support WF2, remember? :P

[14:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: (They all return undefined, therefore)

[14:11:01.0000] <hallvors>
annevk2: exactly. We're still shipping <input>.maxLength = -1, seems to be the default for other browsers too. textarea.maxLength should be consistent

[14:11:02.0000] <annevk2>
I thought we were talking about <input>.maxLength as well gsnedders

[14:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Is that not WF2?

[14:11:04.0000] <annevk2>
no

[14:11:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, duh, true

[14:11:06.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is half asleep

[14:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
well me too, but I'm right :p

[14:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hi annevk2 

[14:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, spec says input.maxLength should give 0, I guess if everything gives -1 the spec needs changing

[14:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
And then it'd be nice for textarea.maxLength to be consistent with that

[14:13:03.0000] <hallvors>
Certainly. Changing <input>.maxLength to 0 by default might break stuff.

[14:13:04.0000] <gsnedders>
It will, almost certainly

[14:13:05.0000] <hallvors>
- *will* break jQuery.validate version 1.3

[14:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Because there's far more deployed content using input.maxLength than textarea.maxLength

[14:14:01.0000] <annevk2>
so Opera and Firefox are -1

[14:14:02.0000] <annevk2>
WebKit defaults to maxvalue

[14:14:03.0000] <annevk2>
I'll file a bug on HTML5

[14:14:04.0000] <hallvors>
(I need a quick course in how the HTML5 spec is structured by the way #-) )

[14:14:05.0000] <gsnedders>
hallvors: That's a dark art :)

[14:14:06.0000] <hallvors>
it keeps confusing me :-p

[14:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
hallvors, maybe I should do one of those for QA when I'm in Oslo...

[14:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or maybe Engineering Seminar?

[14:15:02.0000] <hallvors>
/me thinks Google should pay Hixie for hitting the road with a spec-reading course

[14:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe Hixie should give "Enterprise" spec-reading courses and charge $1500+ per person

[14:19:00.0000] <annevk2>

[15:08:00.0000] <foolip>

[15:08:01.0000] <Dashiva>

[15:08:02.0000] <foolip>
but fun domain names are still fun :)

[15:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
foolip: Well, that proposal seems to be flirting with prefixes

[15:10:00.0000] <foolip>
some kind of namespaces or scoping anyway

[15:10:01.0000] <foolip>
no prefix though, more like a C++ using statement

[15:11:00.0000] <foolip>
or the with keyword in visual basic (I think)

[15:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[15:17:00.0000] <annevk2>

Steve Faulkner published a transcript on his blog when we interviewed him, hopefully Bruce Lawson does the same

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think roy and i live on different planets

[16:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
or we speak a different language

[16:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
or something

[16:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
i so utterly don't understand what he's saying

[16:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
of course he refuses to explain himself

[16:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
so...

[16:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I did not find his link to the dictionary edifying

[16:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Damn, maciej beat me to it.  I was just drafting a nearly identical response.

[16:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
well my position is that a prerequisite for me to respond to roy's feedback be that i understand wtf he's talking about, but he refuses to continue responding to the thread in which we were making progress towards me understanding that

[16:38:00.0000] <vvv>
Is there support of ARGB in HTML 5?

[16:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
what do you mean by ARGB?

[16:39:00.0000] <vvv>
RGB with an alpha channel

[16:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
<canvas> supports RGBA, yes

[16:40:01.0000] <vvv>
And <input type=color>?

[16:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's UA-specific, I believe.

[16:46:00.0000] <vvv>
Spec says it's "simple color". Is there a reason why there can't be an "alpha" attribute to specify whether alpha channel is needed?

[16:48:00.0000] <Lachy_>
vvv, alpha channel can be specified with a separate control, if it's needed

[16:48:01.0000] <vvv>
Lachy_: then it would be impossible to include it in color well

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
vvv: no, <input type=color> doesn't do alpha currently

[16:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
vvv: maybe in a future version

[16:51:00.0000] <vvv>
Where should I post a request?

[16:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
vvv, whatwg⊙wo or public-html⊙wo

[16:53:01.0000] <vvv>
Thanks

[16:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
vvv, which applications are you aware of that include an alpha channel in the same control as the colour picker?

[16:56:01.0000] <vvv>
Lachy: GTK has such feature

[16:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
any windows or mac apps?

[16:57:01.0000] <vvv>
Haven't seen such thing in Windows

[16:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
or can you find a screenshot of such a control somewhere and post a link?

[16:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
vvv, if common native apps rarely, if ever, include an alpha channel in the colour picker, I'm trying to understand why a web app would need to?


2009-08-26
[17:00:00.0000] <vvv>
Lachy: graphics editors would need it

[17:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know that GIMP exposes alpha through an opacity control, which is separate from the color-picker.

[17:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
vvv, I'm not questioning the need for an alpha channel itself, just whether it needs to be integrated in the same control, rather than a separate control.

[17:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it's common for the colour control on Mac OS X to have an alpha slider

[17:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I don't appear to have any graphics apps on my mac to be able to check that.

[17:05:01.0000] <vvv>
Lachy: http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/9418/rgbacolorpicker.png - that's a GTK one

[17:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[17:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: keynote and pages, e.g.

[17:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok. I have those apps and have now seen it

[17:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
vvv, in the mean time, this should be a suitable substitue <input type=number min=0 max=1 step=0.01 name=alpha>

[17:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
or input type=range instead

[17:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: looks like Roy identified some specific things he thinks are lacking in the HTML5 definition, his latest message and my response to him

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, already fixing the spec

[17:30:00.0000] <Rik`>
vvv: you can add a input type=range for ask the user to specify the alpha channel ?

[17:31:00.0000] <vvv>
Rik`: color pickers do it nicer usually

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, that was the first time roy said something that actually resulted in changes to the spec

[17:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am hoping this experience will help him appreciate the merits of being specific

[17:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you still don't have a requirement that two <a>s can't have the same name, afaict

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
oops

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
fixing

[17:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also would it kill you to change " In earlier versions of the language, this attribute served a similar role as the id attribute." to something like " In earlier versions of the language, this attribute served a similar role as the id attribute, including defining targets for fragment identifiers."?

[17:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Not that it's a hugely meaningful difference, but it might brighten Roy's day

[17:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is that possible?

[17:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, he deserves a prize for finding a material error in the spec (one I myself overlooked despite looking at the two definitions side by side just recently)

[17:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
whether that would in fact brighten his day, I can't say

[17:57:01.0000] <heycam>
does <a name> not define a target for a fragid in html5?

[17:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it does

[17:57:03.0000] <heycam>
ok, then the "in earlier languages" sounds misleading

[17:57:04.0000] <othermaciej>
true

[17:57:05.0000] <heycam>
sounds like in this version that's not the case

[17:57:06.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i have no opinion on that particular change, but i have to go afk for a while. if you want it, post on that thread.

[17:57:07.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[17:57:08.0000] <Dashiva>
Is Roy basically writing a multi-version validator?

[17:58:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
/me reads  http://blog.foolip.org/2009/08/23/microformats-vs-rdfa-vs-microdata/ too, and has no idea what he is trying to represent - scope fail

[17:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: I believe he has a tool that's not a validator per se, it just wants to check link targets

[17:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: so for links with a fragid, it would want to check that the fragment target exists in the target file

[17:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: any wordsmithing advice?

[17:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: it would be nice to mention the purpose in establishing a fragid, without making it sound like it doesn't actually do that, but while still recommending id instead

[18:00:00.0000] <heycam>
othermaciej, yeah it might be good to have a section dedicated to that in fact

[18:00:01.0000] <heycam>
which says that id and name both establish such names

[18:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: there is a section dedicated to the algorithm for the target of fragid

[18:01:00.0000] <heycam>
which already mentions name?

[18:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-indicated-part-of-the-document

[18:02:00.0000] <heycam>
ok it does

[18:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
is it worth mentioning this again in the description of "name" or no?

[18:02:02.0000] <heycam>
yes i think so

[18:02:03.0000] <heycam>
linking to that alg

[18:02:04.0000] <heycam>
otherwise it might not be easy to find

[18:03:00.0000] <heycam>
i think people may start by looking up the definition of the name attribute

[18:03:01.0000] <heycam>
and if they don't find the mention of the fragid stuff there then they might assume that that is it

[18:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: the definition of the id attribute mentions the fragment use, so that's fair

[18:04:01.0000] <heycam>
sounds good then

[18:04:02.0000] <heycam>
is there a tendency in the spec not to define the meaning of obsolete features?

[18:05:00.0000] <heycam>
(and only to define the behavior of the UA for them?)

[18:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it depends on what you mean by meaning

[18:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in some cases, it's pretty vague about the former intended purpose of the obsolete feature, but it does give author conformance requirements and implementation conformance requirements

[18:06:01.0000] <heycam>
yeah

[18:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
for obsolete but conforming, it should probably give the semantics in the same way as they are given for fully conforming, to the degree applicable

[18:06:03.0000] <heycam>
i was wondering if that was deliberate, to dissuade people from using them

[18:06:04.0000] <othermaciej>
because even though you SHOULD NOT use the feature, it ought to still be the case that you MUST use it in accordance with its semantics

[18:06:05.0000] <heycam>
right

[18:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's the point of obsolete but conforming?  Isn't that like HTML 4 Strict, which HTML 5 wanted to avoid?

[18:07:01.0000] <heycam>
but if we're going down the road of "html 5 is replacing all previous versions and therefore must define all previously allowed features", then we might need them for obsolete and non-conforming too

[18:08:00.0000] <heycam>
unless we consider it acceptable to change previously conforming documents to be non-conforming, of course

[18:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it is considered acceptable to change previously conforming documents to be nonconforming

[18:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
older versions of HTML have done that too

[18:09:01.0000] <heycam>
but it's a bit different with older versions of HTML

[18:09:02.0000] <heycam>
since you had version identifiers in the documents themselves

[18:10:00.0000] <heycam>
so you're just changing what is conforming for documents with the newer version identifier

[18:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: I'm going to suggest adding a note like:

[18:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
"An a element's name attribute can be used for a variety of purposes, most notably as a way to link to specific parts of a document using fragment identifiers."

[18:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
or "An a element's name attribute can be as a way to link to specific parts of a document using fragment identifiers. The id attribute is recommended instead for this purpose." 

[18:10:04.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: does that sound sane?

[18:10:05.0000] <heycam>
prefer the second one

[18:10:06.0000] <heycam>
yep, sounds good

[18:10:07.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm including both suggestions

[18:11:00.0000] <heycam>
ok

[18:11:01.0000] <heycam>
/me should respond to the issue-37 thread at some point he supposes

[18:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: that would be nice - sorry for giving you such a long-winded and multifaceted reply

[18:11:03.0000] <heycam>
no that's fine

[18:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ooh, I have a cut off sentence in what I wrote

[18:13:01.0000] <heycam>
the svg wg is having a f2f in late september, so i'm planning to discuss svg-in-text/html then, and get any remaining issues sent to the htmlwg by the end of that meeting

[18:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
replied to self

[18:14:01.0000] <heycam>
/me wonders whether the planned LC is early or late october :)

[18:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
heycam: "planned" is such a strong word

[18:14:03.0000] <heycam>
heh

[18:15:00.0000] <heycam>
desired then

[18:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
looks like I had 5 open questions for you (in addition to filing 2 bugs based on the feedback)

[20:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
howdy folks

[20:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I like how you worded it

[20:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
assuming you mean the edit to the spec, cool

[20:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i really have no idea what roy wants though

[20:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
how can we define a DOM-based language without reference to the DOM?

[20:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
i thought HTML4 had shown that idea was a complete failure

[20:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, turns out onhashchange is actually synchronous in IE

[20:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
i thought we tested that and found it async

[21:02:00.0000] <dimich>
I have an XHR question. I'm reading the XHR spec, it has a sentence on failed TLS negotiation, but it'd be nice to get a clarification: in case XHR is over SSL and encounters bad certificate error, and user already accepted bad cert for the page that runs the script - should XHR fail or succeed? 

[21:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's probably either a TLS spec question, or a UI question

[21:04:00.0000] <dimich>
Hixie: The XHR spec says do NETWORK_ERR silently. That's clear except the case where user already agreed with the bad cert... 

[21:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
sounds like a UI issue to me -- depends on whether the UI says "accept this one time" or "accept forever" or "accept for this page and anything this page does" etc

[21:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
same answer as if you asked the same thing but with <img> pointing to a resource on that server

[21:05:01.0000] <dimich>
Hixie: so basically it's up to UA. I see. Do you think loading from Workers is any different? I woudl assume not since they are part of the page, sort of. 

[21:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i would say that if the user has said to temporarily accept a bogus cert, then it should be accepted until the session closes

[21:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
of course personally i would just treat bogus certs as the same as no cert and pretend that it was an http: connection

[21:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
and not show any (modal) UI

[21:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
(maybe have an infobar warning)

[21:08:00.0000] <dimich>
Hixie: thanks! 

[21:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, that means there's no protection against MITM unless you can rely on the user to realize something is wrong if the URL bar is the wrong color or such.

[21:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Currently you only get to do that if the user initially tries an HTTP connection and only later switches to HTTPS, e.g., if they type "amazon.com" in the URL bar.

[21:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
On the other hand, the warning that browsers usually present these days is obviously ridiculously too scary, given that in probably >99.9% of cases it will just be innocuous misconfiguration.

[21:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTTPS is unreasonably easy to misconfigure in practice.

[21:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: hence the infobar warning.

[21:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: then again, that warning should probabl appear for all HTTP accesses too

[21:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's kind of a pain when there's a 99.9% chance that it's totally innocuous, and a <0.1% chance that someone is stealing your credit card numbers and will spend $5000 of your money on gambling or something.

[21:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not easy to make good UI for that.

[21:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
https://google.com at one point gave a mismatched cert, it was serving a cert for www.google.com.  :/

[21:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
the current practice of prompting the user and then, if the user hits the right sequence of buttons, just pretending that all is ok, is clearly not the answer

[21:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
They don't pretend it's okay, they color the address bar red and such, AFAIK.

[21:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, exactly

[21:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
they do it differently than port 80

[21:29:05.0000] <Hixie>
which i think is worse

[21:29:06.0000] <Hixie>
people go "ok, there's a lock, and it's the special color, i must be ok"

[21:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do people even look at the URL bar color in practice?

[21:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mentioned it once to my mother, and she insisted she had never seen the URL bar turn different colors.

[21:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even though she uses Gmail continuously, over HTTPS.

[21:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
i saw research saying 25% of people only trust the content inside the rendering area

[21:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
and ignore UA UI

[21:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
so...

[21:30:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's horribly backwards.

[21:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Too bad Tim Berners-Lee didn't think to make it all encrypted from day one.  :/

[21:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
DNSSEC will hopefully allow easier deployment of certificates, at least.  It should theoretically remove most or all of the self-signing and mismatch problems we get today, if I understand correctly.

[21:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I haven't looked at the details, though.  I'd hope you could set up your DNS to just serve the same (uncertified) key for all your domains, and then just dump the same key on all your servers, and have it work.

[21:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right now you have headaches with the wrong key being served, and people not being willing to shell out for a certificate.

[21:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well we're not doing websockets all encrypted either :-)

[21:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
encryption has high overhead and makes debugging a pain in the ass

[21:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd also hope you could add a DNS entry (with DNSSEC) saying "don't ever connect to this site unencrypted".

[21:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
High overhead, maybe.  Hopefully the Moore's law fairy will solve that one soon.  For debugging, do you often look at actual network packets using a packet sniffer?  I've only done that rarely.

[21:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
the overhead will always be more than no encryption

[21:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
i do network sniffing all the time

[21:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, just because it's more doesn't mean it's significantly more.  Web servers usually aren't CPU-bound anyway (assuming "web server" is different from "application server").  I've also heard that the i7 works very well for efficient crypto.

[21:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
the issue isn't cpu usage, it's latency

[21:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: yt?

[21:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey kevin

kevinmarks - is leos new room like a spaceship?

[01:26:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie, why is using microdata for styling a bad idea? because it is prone to change?

[01:26:01.0000] <erlehmann>
after all, i use semantics in styling all the time

[02:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mantic.se is a great idea. I wish I had thought about it.

[03:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I bet there's still mantics.se, and miotic.se/miotics.se

[03:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>

jacobolus, wait "ian.hickson" has the highscore

[04:04:02.0000] <erlehmann>
unfair ^^

[04:04:03.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: no, I don't think it's Hixie's site. he just has the high score

[04:05:04.0000] <erlehmann>
jacobolus, so this is not a tetris game but a scripting game ?

[04:06:00.0000] <erlehmann>
wow, cool

[04:06:01.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: I made a multiplayer iphone game w/ some friends, and I was going to ask Hixie if we released a bot API, and let people's bots compete, w/ games visible in real time using Web Sockets, if he'd port his bot to our API, etc. :)

[04:09:00.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: "Mino"

[04:09:01.0000] <erlehmann>
mino?

[04:10:00.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: did that other message all make it through?

[04:10:01.0000] <erlehmann>
<jacobolus> erlehmann: I made a multiplayer iphone game w/ some friends, and I was going to ask Hixie if we released a bot API, and let people's bots compete, w/ games visible in real time using Web Sockets, if he'd port his bot to our API, etc. :)

[04:10:02.0000] <erlehmann>
jacobolus, this?

[04:10:03.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: right, so the multiplayer iphone game is called Mino :)

[04:10:04.0000] <erlehmann>
i see

[04:10:05.0000] <erlehmann>
iphones suck :p

[04:10:06.0000] <erlehmann>
<-- android user

[04:13:00.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: well, I don't have a judgement, because I haven't used one.  I just made the graphics for this game :)

[04:13:01.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: but I find the ipod touch kind of neat

[04:14:00.0000] <jacobolus>
then again, it's the first mp3 player I've had, and the whole thing is a bit mind-bending :)

[04:15:00.0000] <erlehmann>
jacobolus, its just … as an app developer i dont want maintainers to take month

[04:15:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me ought to get a new phone sometime, but can't decide what

[04:15:02.0000] <erlehmann>
and then reject my app.

[04:15:03.0000] <erlehmann>
so i would never develop for the iphone.

[04:25:00.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: that's fair; we've been somewhat frustrated with the approval process, etc.

[04:25:01.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: still, the game is pretty fun :)

[05:40:00.0000] <remysharp>
I'm reading the specs for offline, and trying to work out if there's a way to programatically expire the cache - is this possible? 

[05:41:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
The HTTP cache control headers?

[05:41:01.0000] <remysharp>
no - via the manifest

[05:41:02.0000] <remysharp>
or, sorry, are you saying you do it via the http cache control headers?

[05:42:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oh, I don't know about manifest

[05:42:01.0000] <remysharp>
okay, cheers :)

[05:43:00.0000] <remysharp>
if anyone else has any idea, happy to hear - currently my browser won't give up it's cache of the manifest!

[05:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
remysharp, point the manifest attribute to a new file

[05:45:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Should the browser not obey the HTTP headers of the manifest cache file?

[05:46:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(But yeah, there's no way with HTTP to then invalidate a file's cache for all clients)

[05:47:00.0000] <remysharp>
cheers, that worked. Seems a bit of a shame I have to point it to a dead manifest to get it flip out, rather than just removing the manifest (which didn't seem to work)

[05:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
changing the manifest file should also work in theory

[05:48:01.0000] <annevk2>
having said that I haven't studied that stuff recently

[05:48:02.0000] <remysharp>
changing the manifest did work - so cheers :)

[07:33:00.0000] <miketaylr>
would someone mind looking at a test page, and tell me if i'm abusing <article> headings (nested in a <section>)?

[07:33:01.0000] <miketaylr>
test page is here: http://miketaylr.com/pres/html5/index.html

[07:33:02.0000] <miketaylr>
i'm interested in the 'Openings and Closings' section in the bottom right of the page...

[07:35:00.0000] <erlehmann>
miketaylr, looks nice. where are you unsure spec-wise?

[07:35:01.0000] <miketaylr>
erlehmann: i suppose i just feel a little wary of wrapping the whole message content in an <h2>, within each 'opening and closing' <article>

[07:35:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
miketaylr: See http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmiketaylr.com%2Fpres%2Fhtml5%2Findex.html FWIW

[07:36:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
If that looks sane, you're probably doing it right

[07:36:01.0000] <miketaylr>
gsnedders|work: yeah, thanks. i've got that open as well. ;)

[07:36:02.0000] <miketaylr>
thanks

[07:36:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Honestly, there's more than vanity at pimpin' that link)

[07:36:04.0000] <miketaylr>
haha

[07:37:00.0000] <miketaylr>
the outline is super helpful

[07:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
miketaylr: maybe it could be argued that it's more of a list than separate sections

[07:38:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Like using up other people's CPU time and bandwidth, that's the real reason)

[07:38:02.0000] <miketaylr>
zcorpan: i see what you mean

[07:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
miketaylr: if you were a user and picked a section from the outline, you'd be disappointed to find no further content in the section :)

[07:39:01.0000] <miketaylr>
zcorpan: yeah, that's a good point. i think that's why i feel unsure having the whole content appear as a section.

[07:40:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me should add links to the outline

[07:41:00.0000] <miketaylr>
those 'openings and closings' are actually categorized by city (london, ny, sf). so perhaps it would make more sense for the city to appear in the outline, that leads to the actual restaurant blurb

[07:42:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders|work, your dom magic is superiour :D

[07:42:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
erlehmann: How so?

[07:42:02.0000] <erlehmann>
superior to my judgement - it reveals that i am doing it wrong http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http://blog.dieweltistgarnichtso.net

[07:43:00.0000] <erlehmann>
only the first five subheaders are articles, i forgot a section

[07:43:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Also the encoding is going wrong somewhere :P

[07:44:00.0000] <miketaylr>
heh

[07:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oooh, I'll be using that outliner in the future.

[07:44:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I'll probably rewrite it from something thrown together in around ten minutes :P

[07:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I need to learn Python.  And get it running on a server.

[07:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or maybe I already have it on my server...?

[07:45:02.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders|work, i only see an article where someone submitted a bad URI (wordpresses fault)

[07:45:03.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders|work, sure you are using unicode internally ?

[07:46:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
erlehmann: I think I ignore content-type :P

[07:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, only Python 2.5.4 is available.  No Python3 goodness for me.

[07:46:02.0000] <Rik|work>
gsnedders|work: http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=google.com

[07:46:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
TabAtkins: You don't want Python 3 yet

[07:46:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ok.

[07:46:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Rik|work: Yeah, my code is awesome.

[07:47:00.0000] <Rik|work>
a little check on "http://" might help

[07:47:01.0000] <miketaylr>
the real outline is less interesting than the error:http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http://www.google.com/

[07:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders|work, can you share code?  I'd like something fun to learn from.

[07:47:03.0000] <miketaylr>
oops

[07:47:04.0000] <miketaylr>
http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http://www.google.com/

[07:47:05.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders|work, i am using perfectly save XHTML5. if i ever get around to it, i'll even make sure even bad input results in XHTML5 via re-serializing. also, you can use the unicode in python via the u"" thingy.

[07:48:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
TabAtkins: Just take a look at http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/ — it the same outlining algorithm as there

[07:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[07:48:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(and the output is based upon the TOC module)

[07:49:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
erlehmann: Yeah, I use Unicode fine, it's just detecting the charset is wrong :)

[07:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/file/e75817a809b8/anolislib/processes/outliner.py <-- this is not code that you want to learn python from

[07:49:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Probably not.

[07:49:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, remove the comments and it'd be readable.

[07:50:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
TabAtkins: It'd take ten times longer whenever I wanted to check that it matched the spec

[07:50:01.0000] <erlehmann>
jgraham, jeah, but you can learn commenting from it :p

[07:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suppose this is true.

[07:51:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(It also blindly follows the spec and uses Hixie-goto all over the place)

[07:51:01.0000] <erlehmann>
i hate this whole microdata issue. i had a plugin ready for deployment, then suddenly the spec turns around :(

[07:51:02.0000] <jgraham>
erlehmann: It sucks to be an early implementor. 

[07:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me sympathises

[07:52:00.0000] <erlehmann>
jgraham, well, if everything else fails, RDFa. its not urgent, but unfortunate nevertheless.

[07:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
erlehmann: It can't be that bad, surely? ;) What are you doing with microdata

[07:53:00.0000] <erlehmann>
creative commons markup :D

[07:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me has managed to put "Inner City Pressure" in his head simply by using the word "Sympathises"

[07:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I really wish I could eliminate links from the internet.  Two years later and I'm still dealing with horrifying urls showing in my 404 emails from when the Dev team decided to take a crack at web dev.

[07:54:00.0000] <erlehmann>
jgraham, this was an early version of it, http://daten.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/src/cc-license-markup/generator2.xhtml

[07:54:01.0000] <miketaylr>
heh, chromium just barfed on the outline page: http://skitch.com/miketaylr/bh22u/chromium

[07:54:02.0000] <jgraham>
erlehmann: Oh nice. I was just thinking this morning I could use microdata for marking up license bits

[07:54:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
The only time IE creates non-tree DOMs is with misnested formatting elements, right?

[07:54:04.0000] <erlehmann>
jgraham, you are welcome to spawn more stylesheets.

[07:56:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Do browsers use HTMLDocument for XHTML?

[07:56:01.0000] <annevk2>
some

[07:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: which ones don't?

[07:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: apart from ancient Gecko versions

[08:00:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, I don't think Gecko does if the media type is text/xml

[08:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: ah, OK.

[08:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that's non-compliant with HTML5

[08:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if we have a bug about it

[08:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker#event-beforeShowDay <-- I use this event in several places in my apps, and would find it difficult to switch to <input type=date> without something like it.  Anyone think it's got a chance (presumably in v2)?

[08:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. looks like a bug is missing

[08:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
TabAtkins, yeah, things like that have already been raised

[08:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
K, cool.  Couldn't remember seeing anything like that.

[08:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Was just going through stuff yesterday and seeing how I would replace bits with HTML5.

[08:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
TabAtkins, might be 2004/2005 discussions

[08:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, yeah, I definitely wasn't around then.  Had just graduated high-school the year before.  ^_^

[08:11:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
TabAtkins: Peh! Some of us only graduated high-school in June! :P

[08:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Whatev.

[08:12:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
TabAtkins: You're old, man.

[08:12:01.0000] <jcranmer>
dang

[08:12:02.0000] <jcranmer>
I only graduated in 2008

[08:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Craps, I am old.  I know Anne's a few months younger than me too.

[08:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm the class of 2005 for high school.

[08:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Whoa, I never realized how young everyone was.

[08:13:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I thought I was young.

[08:13:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Seems not.  :)

[08:13:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Is there a reason to believe that it's Web-compatible to make text/xml documents implement HTMLDocument and SVGDocument?

[08:13:06.0000] <jcranmer>
I think gsnedders|work wins for youth, though

[08:13:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
I would agree.

[08:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Congrats are in order!  ::pops the cork on some champagne::

[08:16:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I have a feeling display: run-in was specced mostly with dl's in mind

[08:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
They are difficult to style without it sometimes.

[08:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least, without a <di> or ::di to hang things on.

[08:16:03.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, Opera does it

[08:16:04.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, iirc

[08:16:05.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, also, who is using text/xml anyway?

[08:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
You people make me feel so old :(

[08:17:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I hope bz gets it into FF sometime relatively soon

[08:17:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
You are old, oldie.

[08:17:03.0000] <jcranmer>
although the 1.9.2 branch has already been cut IIRC

[08:17:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Yeah, well, serves you right for having a birthday cake.

[08:17:05.0000] <jgraham>
I don't think foregoing the cake would have allowed me to do the Dorian Grey thing

[08:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dont' knock it til you try it.

[08:18:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Well, maybe

[08:18:02.0000] <Creap>
what is the difference between code and samp and why should I use code for file names? in particular, file extensions

[08:18:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
samp is a silly tag that we only have because there's no active reason to get rid of it.

[08:18:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me shakes his head at jgraham and his b'day cake with its "special ingredient"

[08:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I just use code all the time, personally.

[08:19:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Creap: In general, don't.

[08:19:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Crap, this whole time I've been working around javascript's stupid use of milliseconds for its timestamp.  I could have just trimmed the last three digits off at the js level and never had to deal with it leaking into my php code.  ;_;

[08:19:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Creap: (Unless you really care.)

[08:19:04.0000] <Creap>
I'd say a filename is more often output from a program than "input" or "computer code"

[08:19:05.0000] <Creap>
gsnedders|work: don't what?

[08:19:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Creap: Use either, and ignore it :P

[08:20:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Creap: It avoids the entire debate :)

[08:20:01.0000] <Creap>
heh..

[08:20:02.0000] <Creap>
the specs say I should use code for filenames though

[08:20:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(The elements exist basically just for the people who really care about marking up such things semantically. Nobody in the real world does.)

[08:20:04.0000] <jgraham>
Creap: Just use <code>. Seriously. No one uses <samp> for anything useful anyway

[08:20:05.0000] <Creap>
or well, it says code CAN be a filename, but that example is nto included in samp

[08:20:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Easy resolution, then: use <code> for filenames.  ^_^

[08:21:00.0000] <Creap>
ok

[08:21:01.0000] <Creap>
:P

[08:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But really, just use <code> everywhere.  That's a relic from the time when people thought that someone might actually care about the distinction.

[08:21:03.0000] <jcranmer>
just byte the bullet

[08:21:04.0000] <jcranmer>
use <tt>

[08:21:05.0000] <Creap>
hehe

[08:21:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me punkills jcranmer.

[08:21:07.0000] <jcranmer>
and screw over people who want everything to be semantic

[08:22:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
w00t! microdata!

[08:22:01.0000] <Creap>
I think the distinction between kbd and code for instance can be useful, I could do something like <kbd title="aka Windows / Apple button bla bla">Super</kbd> and kbd[title] { border-bottom:..

[08:23:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I think half of the semantic tags won't be used anyways

[08:23:01.0000] <takkaria>
how is that useful? ^_^

[08:23:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
jcranmer: Nah, they'll be used, just for the wrong things.

[08:23:03.0000] <jcranmer>
since the distinction between several are a bit fine to easily put into WYSIWYG editors

[08:23:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
<nav><i> is an annoying fairy.</i></nav>

[08:24:00.0000] <jcranmer>
and people writing HTML by hand won't bother trying to edit each and every single attribute properly

[08:24:01.0000] <Creap>
takkaria: to add a hint?

[08:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: filed https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=512688

[08:25:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I'd rather spend my time worrying about what my content should actually be as opposed to the fiddly semantic meanings of all of these titles, code snippets, etc.

[08:26:00.0000] <Creap>
Ok, have fun with that and I'll have fun with doing it my way

[08:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, cool, setting window.search does force a refresh.

[08:28:01.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, hopefully someone fixes it :)

[08:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7434 is about what to expose for <h2>

[09:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: oh ok

[09:11:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Random programming question time: why would perl -i.bak -npe 's/\n{2,}/\n/' foo.txt not work?

[09:12:00.0000] <jcranmer>
wrong phase of moon

[09:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think I'm a bad person for making an <input> look like a button just so I don't have to muck about with getting my datepicker to show/hide manually.

[09:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
To be fair, intranet app.

[09:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me feels his conscious gnawing at him.

[09:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me notes s/conscious/conscience/

[09:25:00.0000] <webben>
gsnedders|work: I have a feeling that might be processing it line by line, and you wouldn't have two new lines on one line ...

[09:25:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
webben: Ah

[09:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, I feel much better now.  Now I'm styling the <label> as a button, and making the <input> invisible.  That feels less disgusting.

[09:35:00.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders|work: try tacking 'g' on the end?

[09:35:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
takkaria: That doesn't fix it

[09:35:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, you need the multiline switch.

[09:35:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I forget what it is.

[09:36:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
No, multiline just makes ^ and $ match start and end of line

[09:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I thought it did the opposite.

[09:36:02.0000] <Dashiva>
-i.bak?

[09:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's been a while since I've had to use regexps for anything serious.

[09:37:01.0000] <takkaria>
Dashiva: writes the original file out to $ORIGINAL_NAME.bak

[09:37:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Typical perl, everyone knows -i is for input

[09:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders|work: I'd think you need /g in any case. Does the file contain \r\n maybe?

[09:39:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dashiva: No

[09:39:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Fuck it, I'll just use Brianfuck. That's simpler.

[09:39:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Why not use sed? :)

[09:40:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(to understand, that is)

[09:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sounds reasonable.

[09:40:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Dashiva: You can't read from one file then write back to it

[09:40:03.0000] <beowulf>
gsnedders|work: /s perhaps

[09:40:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Newlines are magical.

[10:35:00.0000] <jacobolus>
some people may find this useful: http://pastie.textmate.org/595605

[10:36:00.0000] <jacobolus>
most javascript implementations of utf-8 encoders/decoders are slow, and also can't incrementally parse, just throwing an error if they get a partial multi-byte character at the end

[10:37:00.0000] <jacobolus>
this one mostly relies on native functions

[10:37:01.0000] <jacobolus>
(the idea for which was taken from this awesome observation http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/2006/07/encoding-decoding-utf8-in-javascript.html )

[10:40:00.0000] <jacobolus>
oops, minor fix: http://pastie.textmate.org/595615

[10:47:00.0000] <jacobolus>
oh, extra oops; I mixed up encode/decode, like apparently about 25% of the other implementations of this

[10:47:01.0000] <jacobolus>
better: http://pastie.textmate.org/595629

[10:48:00.0000] <hallvors>
love that blogger's user name - ecmanaut :)

[11:07:00.0000] <webben>
jacobolus: Is the ; at the start to prevent borking when minified JS is concatenated?

[11:07:01.0000] <jacobolus>
webben: yeah, just being defensive

[11:08:00.0000] <jacobolus>
webben: I also religiously add semicolons to the end of each statement, even when it would end in a }

[11:10:00.0000] <jacobolus>
for comparison, here's the almost unspeakably bad piece of code that Orbited was using before to accomplish the same thing: http://pastie.textmate.org/595659

[11:10:01.0000] <webben>
/me prefers jacobolus's approach ;)

[11:11:00.0000] <jacobolus>
I'm going to benchmark all the javascript implementations of this I can find in a google search, and write up a blog post

[12:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
morning, folks

[12:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
morning, chair

[12:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
*sigh*

[12:08:01.0000] <annevk3>
you were not planning on being co-chair?

[12:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well obviously they asked me first, so I was expecting it, but it's going to be a lot of work and probably not entirely fun

[12:19:00.0000] <tantek>
congrats othermaciej on your chairship! wishing you the best of luck.

[12:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: thanks!

[12:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
i am amused that the html wg now has more chairs than most wgs have active members

[12:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we also have more active members than 10 WGs

[12:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So there are 64 WGs with more active members? :\

[12:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me bops gsnedders on the head

[12:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me falls down into his whole

[12:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*hole

[12:23:02.0000] <jcranmer>
whole hole?

[12:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: I'm not wholly sure

[12:24:00.0000] <jcranmer>
is that a holy whole hole?

[12:24:01.0000] <jcranmer>
(mole!)

[12:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me places the holy hand grenade of archigoch in the centre of the channel and walk away

[12:24:03.0000] <jcranmer>
/me leaves

[12:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So him?

[12:25:01.0000] <jcranmer|NOT_HER>
damn nick length on freenode

[12:25:02.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: oh, you're awake. did you see my comments from the middle of the night? :)

[12:26:00.0000] <jacobolus>
(vaguely off topic for this channel maybe... or maybe Tetris bots are always on topic)

[12:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: no, i had some problems with my irc client tonight. what's up?

[12:27:01.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: I like your bot at http://tetrisapp.appspot.com/

[12:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: and don't worry, there's no "topic" for this irc channel :-)

[12:28:00.0000] <annevk3>
othermaciej, maybe you can get the HTML CG more open :)

[12:28:01.0000] <jacobolus>
I made the graphics for a multiplayer iphone game, & we've been thinking it might be fun to hook up a browser to our server & show games in real time, using some kind of web socket thinger

[12:28:02.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: and anyway, we thought it'd be fun to have a bot competition

[12:28:03.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk3: I don't even know what the HTML CG is, really

[12:28:04.0000] <jacobolus>
somewhat like that one, but with the bots competing against each other

[12:29:00.0000] <jacobolus>
and allowing anyone interested to watch the games in a browser

[12:29:01.0000] <jacobolus>
so the question is whether you'd potentially be interested in porting your bot if do such a thing, & send out the API to use, etc.

[12:29:02.0000] <jacobolus>
*if we do...

[12:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: i don't think i'll have the time to do anything like that anytime soon, to be honest

[12:30:01.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: the game is pretty fun. "Mino", & there's a free "lite" version; the idea would be that people could also watch the games via iPod/iPhone, even in the free version of the app

[12:31:00.0000] <jacobolus>
okay, no worries.

[12:31:01.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: it just looked like you have a better algo than our current bots

[12:31:02.0000] <jacobolus>
(which are, frankly, pretty stupid)

[12:32:00.0000] <jacobolus>
(we match people against bots after 60 seconds if not enough humans are playing)

[12:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: oh well you can have the code if you want

[12:32:02.0000] <jacobolus>
oh. that'd also be neat

[12:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
(it's GPLed, i think)

[12:32:04.0000] <jacobolus>
did you put it up somewhere?

[12:33:00.0000] <jacobolus>
how old is this tetrisapp thing?

[12:33:01.0000] <jacobolus>
I just saw it on news.ycombinator yesterday

[12:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
a few months, i think

[12:33:03.0000] <jacobolus>
aha

[12:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
my bots are timestamped dec 2008

[12:35:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: well if you have a copy or a link or something, I'd be happy to pass them around our team, & see if anyone is inspired to make some better bots in the next couple of days, instead of in a couple weeks :)

[12:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://damowmow.com/playground/tetrisapp/tetrisapp.tar.gz

[12:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
is a tarball of all the files in that directory

[12:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
HTH

[12:38:03.0000] <Lachy>
I don't get the new channel topic. What happened to "Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks!"?

[12:38:04.0000] <jacobolus>
thanks!

[12:38:05.0000] <Hixie>
aaah, who changed the topic!

[12:38:06.0000] <Lachy>
annevk3, did apparently

[12:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
See translationparty.com

[12:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And put the old topic in :)

[12:39:02.0000] <jacobolus>
ahahahaha

[12:39:03.0000] <gsnedders>
But now it doesn't get that any more :(

[12:41:00.0000] <jacobolus>
gsnedders: you sure you have the exact wording of the old topic the same?

[12:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: Google Translate changed. See the footer of the party.

[12:41:02.0000] <jacobolus>
boo

[12:41:03.0000] <jacobolus>
did you try babelfish?

[12:41:04.0000] <jacobolus>
:)

[12:41:05.0000] <jacobolus>
babelfish korean has always given the most amusing results, in my experience

[12:41:06.0000] <Lachy>
jacobolus, yes, the topic was the same as that used for the tag line on http://blog.whatwg.org/

[12:42:00.0000] <jacobolus>
that is, english -> korean -> english -> etc.

[12:46:00.0000] <jacobolus>
"Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks!"

[12:46:01.0000] <jacobolus>
"Logic and thanks will wind to the gate, to leave!"

[12:46:02.0000] <jacobolus>
"With logic as for thanks to the gate, in order to leave to relax!"

[12:46:03.0000] <jacobolus>
"To the gate regarding a thanks with logic, in order to relax in order to leave!"

[12:46:04.0000] <jacobolus>
"In order to leave about the thanks which had a logic to the gate, in order to relax!"

[12:46:05.0000] <jacobolus>
"In order to leave refers to the thanks which had a logic in the gate, in order to relax!"

[12:46:06.0000] <jacobolus>
"As for the Huaihe woman leaving to the thanks which had the logic which is in the gate, in order to relax refers! where"

[12:46:07.0000] <jacobolus>
"In order to relax to the thanks which had the logic which in the gate is leaves, or, like the thing and for refers Huaihe women! where To place"

[12:46:08.0000] <jacobolus>
"Or, having the logic which from the gate for is a leaf to thanks relaxing together refers to Huaihe women! where In order where"

[12:46:09.0000] <jacobolus>
"Or, rises to the thanks where the leaf relaxes together from the gate to Huaihe women and to be a logic refers! where To place as sequence to place"

[12:46:10.0000] <jacobolus>
and then it starts to get too long for the apple translation dashboard widget, I think (or at least it seems truncated)

[12:46:11.0000] <miketaylr>
^C

[12:46:12.0000] <jacobolus>
:)

[12:46:13.0000] <miketaylr>
;)

[12:46:14.0000] <jacobolus>
miketaylr: I figured this was amusing enough to be worth it ;)

[12:47:00.0000] <miketaylr>
jacobolus: i just want to know what a Huaihe woman is.

[12:47:01.0000] <jacobolus>
me too

[12:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: feel free to change the topic back btw

[12:50:00.0000] <jacobolus>
since when has blog.whatwg.org had a theme?

[12:50:01.0000] <jacobolus>
that's much nicer.

[12:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
a while now

[12:50:03.0000] <jacobolus>
I guess I just see it in a feed reader

[12:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me changes topic to 'WHATWG (HTML5) -- http://www.whatwg.org/ -- Logs: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/ -- Vennligst legg igjen din følelse av logikken ved døren, takk!'

[12:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh dear, has Lachy tried writing a language that's not English again?

[12:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, ja, jeg skrev på norsk

[13:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyhow, I need to get to the cinema.

[13:05:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i use <samp>, damn it

[13:07:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, you could consider naming it "URL decomposition DOM attributes" I suppose

[13:09:00.0000] <annevk3>
what happened to <samp>?

[13:11:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
nothing

[13:11:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
just some people dissing it earlier (check the backscroll)

[13:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I am unreasonably amused by the use of data urls for simple html/css/js examples.

[13:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: yeah, maybe.

[13:44:00.0000] <annodomini>
Anyone have any quick comments on this idea before I try writing up a more complete and detailed proposal? http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-August/022329.html

[13:45:00.0000] <annevk3>
what if the inner item is not associated with the outer item?

[13:46:00.0000] <annodomini>
Don't do that, or associate it with something else using @about? Good question, though, I'll think about that.

[13:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I like the overall idea, *especially* the simplified JSON parsed out of it.

[13:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is much closer to what I'd use to mark up the data in json

[13:48:00.0000] <annodomini>
Great, so I'm not off base there. The simplified JSON was a big motivation; I didn't like having random type information that seemed like it could conflict with the semantics of the named properties.

[13:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So nested items are automatically associated with the nearest Microdata ancestor unless @about overrides, right?

[13:49:01.0000] <annodomini>
Right.

[13:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The only appreciable difference I can see is that spec Microdata associates it with the nearest @item ancestor, rather than the nearest @itemprop.

[13:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But yeah, that seems fine.

[13:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It does make the DOM map intuitively to the data structure, even if you may need to occasionally use more @about than spec-Microdata would require.

[13:52:00.0000] <annodomini>
Yep. I think a more intuitive DOM map is important; if you're creating good, semantic HTML, that should give you the simplest map.

[13:52:01.0000] <annodomini>
And if you're doing something strange that doesn't match the HTML structure very well, then you should be explicit with @about

[13:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that just means you have to pepper things with @id, but meh.

[13:53:01.0000] <annevk3>
maybe you could allow about="" to unassociate it with the outer item

[13:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And drop immediately to beina top-level item?

[13:54:00.0000] <annodomini>
annevk3: That could work.

[13:54:01.0000] <annevk3>
or something like item="standalone org.example.bar"

[13:54:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
If we were going to do *that*, I'd probably just use another attribute.

[13:54:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
@standalone

[13:54:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
@topitem

[13:54:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
@root?

[13:55:00.0000] <annevk3>
rootitem or topitem seems clearer

[13:55:01.0000] <annevk3>
anyway, more details would be good

[13:55:02.0000] <annodomini>
What details in particular should I concentrate on for my more complete proposal? API, more use case examples, something else?

[13:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd probably take a few examples that appear in the spec, put them as-written into your proposal and contrast them with your structure and output.

[13:57:00.0000] <annodomini>
I should obviously address the un-associating question, though I think the @about="" or @rootitem ideas sound like pretty plausible solutions.

[13:57:01.0000] <annodomini>
/me nods

[13:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The major objection I anticipate is the "only leaf nodes can have content directly" bit.

[13:59:01.0000] <annevk3>
yeah, more examples that demonstrate how your proposal compares to the spec

[13:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I dunno if it'll be an issue.

[14:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annodomini: fwiw, I think annevk3 advice about providing more examples would be the best use of time, and would get you more specific response

[14:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
*responses

[14:09:00.0000] <annodomini>
Er, have I been incorrectly referring to @subject as @about this entire time? Replace all of my uses of @about with @subject in the preceding to match the existing attribute.

[14:09:01.0000] <annodomini>
MikeSmith: Yeah, I'll write up some more examples and explain how it works.

[14:09:02.0000] <annevk3>
oh it was renamed?

[14:09:03.0000] <annodomini>
That does sound like the best use of my time.

[14:09:04.0000] <annevk3>
/me is not really up to speed

[14:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh, we knew what you meant, annodomini.

[14:12:00.0000] <annodomini>
TabAtkins: Yeah, everyone here seemed to understand, but I figured I'd clarify for posterity in the logs, if anyone cares.

[14:18:00.0000] <krijn>
-_-

[14:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Aw, why is krijn sad?

[14:18:02.0000] <krijn>
Bit tired after 12 hours working

[14:18:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I would imagine.

[14:23:00.0000] <krijn>
But, very pleased with the results, this HTML5 stuff is quite handy for building sites with :)

[14:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, cool.

[14:23:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
What're you having fun with?

[14:24:00.0000] <krijn>
Basically just the doctype ;)

[14:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm pretty sure that's when I fell in love too.

[14:25:00.0000] <krijn>
Block level anchors, less silly attributes on script/link, that's about as far as I can go atm

[14:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you're willing to shim ie, you can use the new sectioning elements too.

[14:26:01.0000] <krijn>
I know, but I don't really see the advantage in that just yet

[14:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
They make my page a bit easier to read.

[14:26:03.0000] <krijn>
And then your code gets mangled by some J2EE backend

[14:27:00.0000] <krijn>
And out goes your readability :)

[14:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Luckily don't have to do crap with that.  ^_^  All hand-coded php around here.

[14:30:00.0000] <krijn>
Days like this make me like those other days better indeed, when I don't have to deal with XSLT and non-utf-8 issues

[14:30:01.0000] <krijn>
So, we're the only two authors here?

[14:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: if you love HTML5 so much, maybe the two of you should get married

[14:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or you should send a love note

[14:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dear HTML5, I like you. Do you like me?

[14:33:01.0000] <Dashiva>
TabAtkins: What uses HTML that isn't a user agent?

[14:33:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Apparently link-checkers.

[14:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: I'm already married, unfortunately. ;_;  (Don't tell my wife.)

[14:35:00.0000] <krijn>
TabAtkins: she doesn't know you're already married?

[14:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
krijn: The circumstances were honestly confusing for all involved, and I'd rather not upset her.

[14:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
^_^

[14:36:02.0000] <krijn>
Heh

[14:36:03.0000] <Dashiva>
TabAtkins: I'd say a link checker is a user agent. Or is user agent just a euphemism for browser now?

[14:36:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm pretty sure that's the distinction Roy is using.

[14:39:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9136919/Web_OS_Still_in_the_early_stages?taxonomyId=16&pageNumber=4

[14:40:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
fairly sure I didn't say "On top of HTML5 are REST APIs, standards such as XML and JSON, and OAuth"

[14:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
KevinMarks: aren't you now not at Google?

[14:40:02.0000] <KevinMarks>
yep, not been at google for 2 months

[14:40:03.0000] <KevinMarks>
this must be a very old conversation

[14:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
KevinMarks: that wasn't a direct quote, so maybe instead of "on top of" they meant "in addition to"

[14:42:00.0000] <billyjackass>
Dashiva: a context-sensitive editing application

[14:44:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
right, I think I was explaining how these things are composable and work together

[14:44:01.0000] <KevinMarks>
and build on previous work

[14:45:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
or maybe he paraphrased it from this: http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/12/cycling-to-new-layers-of-freedom.html

[14:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: it's an interesting idea, though it basically means removing types altogether, which makes it much harder to scope identifiers

[14:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: for example, say we define a vcard vocabulary, and someone wants to pull out all the vcards. There's no way to do it in your model, as far as I can tell.

[14:50:02.0000] <annodomini>
Hixie: The idea is that the names are the types.

[14:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
names and types are different things

[14:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
say you have an item that represents a book

[14:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
and the book has two editors and two authors

[14:51:03.0000] <annodomini>
If you want a vcard vocabulary, you use org.example.vcard or http://example.org/vcard as a type instead.

[14:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
editors and authors are both vcards

[14:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
so how would you distinguish the authors and the editors?

[14:52:00.0000] <annevk3>
<span item=authors> <vcard/> <vcard> </span> <span item=editors> ... </span> maybe?

[14:52:01.0000] <annodomini>
<div item="book"><div item="editor

[14:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's what I was about to suggest, too.

[14:53:00.0000] <annodomini>
Yeah, that's basically what I was in the middle of typing when I hit return too soon.

[14:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
in that example, "authors" and "editors" are both items whose type os "list of vcards"

[14:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes...?

[14:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
so how would you find all the objects whose type is "list of vcards"?

[14:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Are we reasoning about vocabs here, or can we assume that the tool explicitly knows the vocabs being used?

[14:54:01.0000] <annodomini>
Walk through the data structure and pull out all everything with item="vcard"?

[14:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: we're assuming a tool that doesn't know any vocabs except the ones it wants

[14:54:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then it just walks and finds <vcard>s.

[14:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
<div item=book> <div item=editors> <div item=vcard> <div item=fn>A Person</div> </div> </div> </div>

[14:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
vs

[14:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't see how saying the type is "list of vcards" is better than saying the type is "authors" and "editors".

[14:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
<div item=book> <div itemprop=editor item=vcard> <div itemprop=fn>A Person</div> </div> </div>

[14:55:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, you win a bit on terseness.

[14:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: "authors" and "editors" are names, not types

[14:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's like the difference between a variable name and a variabel type

[14:56:01.0000] <annodomini>
How about <div item=book><div item="editor vcard"><div itemprop=fn>Someone</div></div></div>

[14:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, I don't agree with your distinction, Hixie.  I'm seeing the element's @id as being more like the var name, with @item being the variable type.

[14:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The book vocabulary has "authors" and "editors" values.  These are types of values.

[14:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: id="" doesn't take part in the model we're discussing as far as i'm aware

[14:57:02.0000] <annevk3>
annodomini, I don't think that's very clear

[14:57:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Implicitly with @subject, Hixie.

[14:57:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: yeah, subject="" is a whole other ball game

[14:58:00.0000] <annevk3>
with subject it's just a linking mechanism

[14:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[14:58:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, my point is that I don't like the analogy.  ^_^

[14:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm surprised that this name vs type distinction has caused so much confusion

[14:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
i really thought it was obvious

[14:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
but almost everyone who has commented on microdata has been confused about it

[14:58:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think it *is* obvious Hixie.  But it can be obviouser.

[14:59:00.0000] <annevk3>
itemtype/itemprop maybe

[14:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, hrm.  Okay, here's the issue.  @item has a type.  But @itemprop only has a name.  That seems arbitrary.

[14:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: you disagree with me about what is a name and what is a type, so it's not _that_ obvious :-) (not saying which one of is right, of course)

[14:59:03.0000] <annodomini>
Hixie: I understand the name vs type distinction, but I think that its an extra layer of complexity that needs to be justified over just using names with types implied by whoever is consuming the data.

[14:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: the need for types comes from the need to unambiguously specify what the property names are

[14:59:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I want my properties to have types too.  The notion that they can *only* have types when they're actually a chunk of some other vocab is weird.

[15:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: so that a validator can validate vcards found within other vocabularies that it doesn't know about

[15:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: in the spec, the types are optional, the names are required.

[15:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie, a new vocab can use vcard and make this obvious by having an element named whatever it wants, with a child that is a vcard.

[15:01:01.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, what if you want a property that is named vcard?

[15:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: in the proposals that collapse name and type together, you either lose the ability to have multiple distinct properties with values that have the same type (e.g. editors and authors both being types), or you lose the ability to detect types

[15:01:03.0000] <annevk3>
I think Hixie is right and that it doesn't really work well

[15:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then we have problems, annevk3.

[15:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Are we scoping prefixes on @item?

[15:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: that doesn't work because you have no way to know if an item is a type or a name

[15:02:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least, in a general sense?

[15:02:04.0000] <annevk3>
there are no prefixes

[15:02:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie, I'm not yet convinced that's a useful distinction.

[15:02:06.0000] <annodomini>
Actually, I would propose that we use URLs or reversed domains for our "top-level" names like vcard

[15:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk3: Then how do you distinguish a vcard from anything else in the current proposal?

[15:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: in which proposal? in the spec?

[15:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[15:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: in the spec, property names and item types use separate attributes with no overlap

[15:03:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, so the type of the ancestor @item is implicitly prefixing the @itemprop, right?

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
no?

[15:04:01.0000] <annodomini>
So, you would only ever use item="http://example.com/vcard", and if you used item=vcard (or anything else), it would be assumed that this was defined relative to its ancestor.

[15:04:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
In a general sense of the word "prefixing".

[15:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
no more so than an <object> element is "prefixing

[15:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
" the <param> elements

[15:04:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's the sense I mean, I think.

[15:04:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
In that the <param> is implicitly assigned to the <object> parent.

[15:04:07.0000] <Hixie>
if you mean that itemprop="" names are scoped to their item="", then yes

[15:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
K, yes.

[15:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Now what's wrong the problem with having @itemprop names scoped to their nearest ancestor @itemprop?

[15:05:02.0000] <annevk3>
but itemprop=foo stays foo and does not become bar.foo or something for an item bar

[15:05:03.0000] <hober>
but not by string-bashing their names together

[15:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: unless we prevent names from using that syntax also, that doesn't solve the problem

[15:05:05.0000] <hober>
(what annevk3 said)

[15:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: nothing is particularly wrong with that either

[15:06:01.0000] <annodomini>
Hixie: Can you expand? Unless we prevent what names from using what syntax?

[15:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk3:  Well, doesn't it?  Multiple vocabs can use "foo" as a name, and it implicitly disambiguates between "foo" being a property of "bar" and "foo" being a property of "baz" by the nearest ancesteor @item, right?

[15:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: <div item="org.example.book"> <div item="com.example.editor"> <div item="net.example.vcard"> </div> </div> </div> -- which are types and which are property names?

[15:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
They're all both?

[15:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
names and types aren't the same thing

[15:07:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And a consumer knows what name/types to look for, and grabs its children too.

[15:07:04.0000] <annodomini>
Right. Those are all fully qualified names, with whatever types are implicit in the definition of those names.

[15:07:05.0000] <Hixie>
that's the microformats model

[15:07:06.0000] <Hixie>
that's exactly what we're trying to move away from here

[15:08:00.0000] <annodomini>
Hixie: Why are we trying to move away from that?

[15:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can't understand the difference.  What problem is solved by having two different flavors of name?

[15:08:02.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, no

[15:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
because the problem we're trying to solve here is the problem that to parse microformats, the parser needs to know the vocabularies

[15:08:04.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, afaict that's wrong

[15:08:05.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: see, i told you you were confused about types :-)

[15:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Bah, fine, you win that point.  ^_^

[15:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think i need to work out a new data model that doesn't use types at all

[15:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk3: Seriously?  So names have to be web-global?

[15:09:03.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, rtfm ;)

[15:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
though i've no idea how to do that

[15:09:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bah, I can ask you instead.

[15:10:00.0000] <annevk3>
ok, yes

[15:10:01.0000] <annodomini>
OK, I suppose I should give some more detail on my proposal, and how I envisioned the parsing and processing to work.

[15:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: What I'm seeing right now is that you have two different types of names.  One is "name of vocab" and one is "name of property".  Is this more-or-less right?

[15:11:01.0000] <annevk3>
you could I suppose have a thing where reversed DNS/URIs are the types and simple strings are the properties

[15:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: yeah

[15:11:03.0000] <annevk3>
and predefined types would have the form of w3c.vcard or something

[15:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: one is "here is what the relationship is between the parent item and this value (string, url, date/time, child item)"

[15:12:00.0000] <annevk3>
not sure it's very nice and not sure it would be shorter than Microdata

[15:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: and the other is "here is what the relationships used in this item mean"

[15:12:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: yeah, what I said.  ^_^

[15:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: the key point being that if you don't know what the parent item's vocab is, then, unless you have the type names, you can't work out what the child's vocab is.

[15:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe that's ok

[15:13:02.0000] <annodomini>
Right, I was thinking that you would use global, unambiguous names (reverse DNS or URI) at the top levels of new objects, and short names that were considered to be interpreted relative to their item below it.

[15:13:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I see your complaint - if you merge the two concepts, then a consumer can find the root of data that it wants, but it can't distinguish between legitimate properties of that data and properties that are part of some other vocab.

[15:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So compositing might be more difficult?

[15:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But if you're compositing values, the consumer really has to know what the lower vocabs that appear in its children are anyway.

[15:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you merge the two concepts, a consumer can't find all vcards without knowing all the vocabularies that are in the chain from the top of the document to the vcard

[15:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, it just finds anything with the property-name "i.am.a.vcard" or whatever.

[15:16:01.0000] <annodomini>
So, you'd have <div item="org.w3.vcard"><div item="fn">my name</div></div>, and if you wanted to embed a vcard, you'd get: <div item="org.example.book"><div item=author><div item="org.w3.vcard">author name</div></div></div>

[15:16:02.0000] <annodomini>
Yes, it's an extra level of nesting, but it still provides everything that you need for that use case.

[15:16:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
The outer vocab has to double-wrap child vocabs, once in its own property and once in the child vocab's root property.

[15:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
no, that's just wrong

[15:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
you're again mixing the relationship with the parent with the definition of the relationships of the children

[15:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Tell me how annodomini's example is ambiguous, then.

[15:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
either the value of item="" says what the relationship is to the parent, or it says what the children mean, or it always does both

[15:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
but it can't sometimes do one and sometimes do the other

[15:17:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or how a consumer would need to know about org.example.book to find the org.w3.vcard

[15:18:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, it's overloading item

[15:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
exactly

[15:18:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Exactly.

[15:18:03.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, when it contains a . it's the type and otherwise it's a name

[15:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
what is the relationship between the item with item=author, and the item with item=org.w3.vcard?

[15:18:05.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, certainly possible, not sure whether it's elegant

[15:18:06.0000] <Hixie>
it's Wrong

[15:18:07.0000] <Hixie>
capital W

[15:18:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie, that's up to the org.example.book vocab to define.

[15:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's worse than perl having variables prefixed by their type sigil

[15:19:01.0000] <hober>
TabAtkins: that's the problem

[15:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
what hober said

[15:19:03.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, I think author would be the property and vcard it's type

[15:19:04.0000] <hober>
TabAtkins: you need to know org.example.book to parse in such a case

[15:19:05.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: then we're not making things simpler

[15:19:06.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: i don't think that's what they're proposing

[15:19:07.0000] <annodomini>
No, you don't need to know org.example.book to parse it.

[15:19:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
hober: if you want to parse the book vocab, yes.

[15:19:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's not necessary if you just want to find vcards.

[15:19:10.0000] <annodomini>
You only need that to figure out how the vcard relates to the book.

[15:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me nods at annodomini

[15:20:01.0000] <hober>
... which is the problem

[15:20:02.0000] <annodomini>
No, that's not the problem.

[15:20:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
...?

[15:20:04.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, I think TabAtkins is confused and annodomini and I agree, but I could be wrong :)

[15:20:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Why do you need to know *anything* about how the vcard relates to the book, *if you're not trying to parse the book*?

[15:20:06.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, I'm not sure whether it's simpler

[15:20:07.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: if you are trying to parse the book, what is the relationship?

[15:20:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you just care about the vcard, there you go.  There's a vcard.  Go get it.

[15:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
what if you're parsing the book?

[15:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: if you're trying to parse the book, what's the relationship between "book" and "author"?

[15:21:02.0000] <hober>
the idea is to have a generic parser. this is the case where microdata and rdfa share an architectural principle and microformats don't

[15:21:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's up to the book vocab to define.

[15:21:04.0000] <annodomini>
hober: You can still have a generic parser.

[15:21:05.0000] <annodomini>
There

[15:21:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
The one failure is that you can't look at a page and say "these are the vocabs I've found".

[15:21:07.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: the book vocab would define that "author" is the item that is the author of the book

[15:21:08.0000] <annodomini>
There's nothing non-generic about what I've proposed.

[15:22:00.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, you can, you don't understand his proposal :/

[15:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And the book vocab can then define that the contents of "author" are the deteails about the author.

[15:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: but the book vocab can't define what org.w3.vcard means, if you're saying that org.w3.vcard defines its own vocab

[15:22:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: It doesn't need to define what org.w3.vcard means.  All it cares is that it has a property, and that property is the author's details.

[15:22:04.0000] <annevk3>
/me bows out of this discussion as it's way too confused to be useful

[15:22:05.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm looking into speccing this idea, and i've come across a much bigger problem, btw, which iirc was mentioned in the original e-mail on this -- to work out the value of a property, you have to examine all the descendants elements.)

[15:22:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
The fact that the author's details are encoded in a vcard are irrelevant to the book.

[15:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: what is the relationship between the item with item=org.w3.vcard and the item with item=author?

[15:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Implicit child in the data tree?

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
which vocabulary defines that? book, or vcard?

[15:24:01.0000] <annodomini>
Book would define that.

[15:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
so book is defining the meaning of vcard's own identifier?

[15:24:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Neither.  Why does either need to?  And how does the current spec resolve this?

[15:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: the current spec never mixes types and names

[15:24:05.0000] <annodomini>
It would define how a vcard relates to the author. How to interpret a vcard as an author.

[15:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There is a fundamental point that we're talking past each other on.  >_<

[15:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: so you have one attribute to specify the relationship, and another to define the type

[15:25:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
annodomini: I'm thinking more that book would say "the 'author' property is the author" and leave it at that.  You can then encode it with vcard if you wish, or use another vocab or none at all.

[15:25:03.0000] <annodomini>
Hixie: But why do you need to define the type? Why can't the type be implicit in the name of the relationship, and specified in the definition of the format that you're talking about.

[15:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you're consuming a book and don't know about vcards, you'll just say that the value of author is the dom contents of that element.

[15:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: it can, if we're willing to throw away the ability to validate the parts of unknown vocabularies that reuse known vocabularies

[15:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But having the book vocab say "the 'author' property encodes the author's details in a 'vcard'".

[15:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Why do you lose that ability, though?

[15:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know how to explain this any better than i already have

[15:27:02.0000] <annodomini>
Well, if you use item="org.w3.vcard", then everything about that vcard can be validated.

[15:27:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
You see a property named org.w3.vcard.  It's a vcard.  this is a global name.

[15:27:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is the problem that "book" can define a property named "org.w3.vcard" as well, so you're never sure if you're looking at a vocab root or just some arbitrary unknown property?

[15:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
what you're suggesting is equivalent to having typed structures defined like this:

[15:28:00.0000] <annodomini>
The only part that can't be validated is that a org.example.book's author property should be a vcard, which if you don't know anything about org.example.book, you can't really validate anyhow.

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
"person is a record. it has values "age" and "address". "age" has a value "integer". "integer" has a value 28. "address" has a value "vCard geo record". "vCard geo record" has a value "123 Any Street"."

[15:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is that last one supposed to be three different types at the same time?

[15:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/vcard geo record/address record/

[15:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
or s/.../string/

[15:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk.

[15:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
my point is that you're saying "age has a value integer, integer has a value 28"

[15:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
which is compeltely bogus

[15:30:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm?

[15:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<div item="person"><span item="age><span item="integer">28</span></span>...</div>?

[15:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
right

[15:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Why would I be defining a data model like that?

[15:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's what you're doing!

[15:31:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Only if you need to know the type of arbitrary unknown vocab properties.

[15:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
except s/age/author/ and s/integer/vcard/

[15:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
a vcard doesn't have a value

[15:31:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
In practice, "person" knows that "age" is an integer, so that gets omitted.  Consumers of "person" also know this.

[15:31:08.0000] <Hixie>
an integer doesn't have a value

[15:31:09.0000] <Hixie>
a vcard IS a value

[15:31:10.0000] <Hixie>
an integer IS a value

[15:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, I see what you're saying.

[15:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dont' think it's necessary to maintain that sort of purity, though.

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway all this is academic

[15:33:01.0000] <annodomini>
So, how about this proposal then: only have item, with a value required to name it, and itemtype as an optional value, that is implicit if it is defined in terms of the ancestor item or type?

[15:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
the problem with having to look at all descendants is a much bigger issue

[15:33:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
You mean because you can't tell when someone's scoped a new vocab so you can stop looking for the current vocab's properties?

[15:34:00.0000] <annodomini>
Hixie: Is that a big issue?

[15:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean because <div item=test> ... (23 mb of text) ... </div> should not require you to scan the entire DOM just to work out if you should be returning a string or an object

[15:34:02.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, looking at itemprop the one thing that seems a bit dangerous is allowing it to use the same space as predefined items

[15:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: yeah, i think that's a blocker, sadly

[15:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: hm?

[15:35:02.0000] <annodomini>
Hixie: Hmm. Yeah, that is a bit of a problem.

[15:35:03.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, oh sorry, predefined global property name

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: yeah, that's a danger

[15:36:01.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, that won't scale very well

[15:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: i don't know that we'll ever add any to that list, though (assuming we keep this model at all)

[15:36:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Ah, I see what you're talking about with that now.

[15:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
hm, this problem sucks

[15:36:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
When doing generic scanning, right?  So you don't know if item="test" is supposed to have an object for children or not?

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: whether it's supposed to or not doesn't really matter

[15:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
it also means you can't model a property whose value is an item with no properties

[15:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
though that's not a biggie

[15:37:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not without double-wrapping, sure.

[15:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
double wrapping?

[15:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
you can't do it whatever you do as far as i can tell

[15:38:02.0000] <annodomini>
Hixie: Wh would you want an item with no properties?

[15:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or, hrm.  If "org.example.book" says that "author" has to have a "org.w3.vcard" child, and that node has no properties...

[15:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: you wouldn't want it, necessarily, but you might run into it e.g. while filling in an incomplete page

[15:39:02.0000] <annodomini>
Can't you represent the same thing by just not having the item in the first place?

[15:39:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Blar, what I meant to say is that if the <div item="author"> *doesn't* have a <div item="org.w3.vcard"> child, then it would return a vcard with no properties.

[15:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: or e.g. in automatically generated content

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
annodomini: typically in a template generator you don't know if you have any data when you generate the outer part

[15:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: no, it would return a string

[15:40:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, yes, if processed generically with no knowledge of the org.example.book vocab.

[15:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is it wrong for a parser with knowledge of the book vocab to parse differently?

[15:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[15:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or, to move the problem to another level, for a consumer of generically-parsed data to know that a string is, in this case, an object with no properties?

[15:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
the whole point is that the result is unambiguous

[15:41:04.0000] <annodomini>
We generally want to be able to use the same parser no matter the vocab, and just leave the interpretation of the data to something that knows about the vocab.

[15:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, so is it cool for a downstream tool to interpret a string as an object with no properties?

[15:42:01.0000] <annodomini>
This is actually a bigger problem for me than the issue of not having types or using names that have implicit types.

[15:42:02.0000] <annodomini>
You could do that, but that just feels wrong to me.

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
it also makes the code to handle it much harder

[15:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
cos now instead of just saying "if it's not an item, fail", you have to explicitly look for it and handle it differently

[15:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
it also makes it much harder to detect actual errors

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
and means that you can't easily have properties that take either a string or an item

[15:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is true - you'd have to have properties be one or the other.

[15:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Unless you wanted to differentiate based on the contents of the string, which *is* horrifying.

[15:45:00.0000] <annodomini>
OK, thanks for the feedback, Hixie.

[15:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks for your feedback too

[15:45:02.0000] <annodomini>
/me goes back to the drawing board

[15:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm working on a third variant

[15:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
that uses some of your ideas

[15:46:00.0000] <annodomini>
Great! I like variants. I'm going to try and come up with another variant, too, but I'll need to work on it some more.

[15:46:01.0000] <annodomini>
But I'm going to withdraw my proposal in its current form; you're right that there are too many problems.

[15:47:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, is the second alternative online already?

[15:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/temp

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
just examples so far

[15:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok my third variant just turned into my second as i fixed problems with it

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's no good

[15:53:00.0000] <annevk3>
the first still seems the most attractive

[15:57:00.0000] <annevk3>
except for subject="" which should get a name that's more aligned with the rest or vice versa

[15:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
itemparent?

[15:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or, no, since it refers to itemprops.  itempropsubject!  Woo!

[15:58:02.0000] <hober>
masteritem=""

[15:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
itemfor=""

[15:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
...

[15:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's the one I like.

[15:59:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
@itemfor 4 life.

[15:59:04.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, ja :)

[16:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
what should it point back to, though? an id="", or the value of item=""? with item="" replacing itemprop=about?

[16:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And that's why Hixie writes the specs.

[16:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Surely it can't point back to the item type, can it?  It's meant to associate things that aren't DOM children of the @item.

[16:00:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And there may be many items of that type on the page.

[16:00:04.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, id I think, not every item has an about

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
sorry, i'm thinking out loud. In the variant I'm doing now, there's no type

[16:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ok.  Well, my vote is cast for @id anyway, just for consistency with @for.

[16:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i prefer id="" also

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
but for these variants let's try something else

[16:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
that way we can see in the studies which is better

[16:02:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me wishes *so hard* that Template Layout was ready already.  He can't bring himself to fake this into a table, and he hates rearranging data just to fit arcane display requirements.

[16:02:04.0000] <annevk3>
itemrel is also somewhat nicer than itemprop

[16:03:00.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, feel free to solve all the issues with flexbox so we can implement it and Gecko/WebKit can fix their bugs :)

[16:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk3, maybe I will.  Point me to all the issues.  ^^;

[16:04:01.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, the idea is that you figure them out on your own by writing lots of tests etc.

[16:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm, k.

[16:05:01.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, then you edit the spec based on your experience and understanding of the rest of the CSS model

[16:05:02.0000] <annevk3>
that's how e.g. Hixie wrote the parser algorithm and how I edit the XHR spec

[16:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's a lot of work :-P

[16:05:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, start recoding pages using FF/Safari's implementations, finding where they break, and where the spec simply fails my needs?

[16:06:00.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, for starters you could figure out the interaction with the box model :)

[16:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sounds like a project to start this weekend.

[16:07:00.0000] <annevk3>
TabAtkins, warning though, it's probably too complicated

[16:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
In general, or for me specifically?

[16:07:02.0000] <annevk3>
for most people, just like the CSS table model still isn't documented

[16:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[16:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
We'll just have to see if I can aspie something out of it.

[16:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
frankly for flexbox i would start with use cases and invent a new technology from scratch

[16:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think flexbox is powerful enough, and i think it's too complicated

[16:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It would be best to get with someone who's done a good bit of XUL editting.

[16:11:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, it does have two impl going for it, but I do not know enough about layout I suppose to really know

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/temp now has three variants

[16:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've had several cases where flexbox as written would have been very useful, but I won't put it out of possibility that a different design would have served equally well in those cases.

[16:12:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wait, though, how'd we get on flexbox anyway?  I was talking sexy Template Layout.

[16:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
flexbox seems powerful enough to do a lot of the kind of layout native apps like to do, but which is awkward in CSS

[16:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the interface to it is admittedly somewhat awkward

[16:15:02.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, what about <x itemrel="foo bar" item> ?

[16:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
what about it?

[16:16:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, oh, I guess that's the same as item="foo bar"

[16:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if Template Layout is still ASCII Art Layout, then I think it's kind of lame and not suitable for any application that would have to update the layout dynamically

[16:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: hm?

[16:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(you can't expect apps to do that by making new ASCII art on the fly)

[16:16:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Yeah, it's no good for dynamic layouts.  But it's ridiculously good for pre-known layouts.

[16:16:05.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, I thought item="" in 1 was restricted to a single token and that therefore in 3 a similar restriction would have to be placed on itemrel in case item was present...

[16:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: oh, yeah, i should mention that explicitly

[16:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: it would be nice to have something clean for pre-known layouts that scales naturally to the dynamic case

[16:19:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, but basically these are all the same idea, just a slightly different syntax

[16:19:01.0000] <annevk3>
I personally still like 1, but maybe with some naming inspired by 3

[16:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins, annevk3: one annoying problem with flexbox is that it requires you to do layout twice in some cases (hyatt understands the details better than me)

[16:19:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Yeah, right now you have to make a known template, then nest a different layout mode inside the cell.  Either another template, or a flexbox, or somthing else.

[16:19:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, I'll ping Hyatt about that.

[16:19:05.0000] <annevk3>
othermaciej, and there's no 2d-flexbox

[16:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, I have difficulty imagining how that would work.

[16:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
In terms of the current flexbox, at least.

[16:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: more or less, yeah

[16:20:03.0000] <annevk3>
there was this idea for table-layout:flexbox

[16:20:04.0000] <annevk3>
but we'd actually have to define table layout first :-o

[16:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk3: you can do most things that app-style layouts need with nested horizontal and vertical flexboxes

[16:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(that's basically the main thing Gtk is based on, for instance)

[16:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Cocoa has the spring/strut model instead, which may be easier to understand but which I think is less powerful for adaptive flexible layouts

[16:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but yeah, hyatt has raised the idea of enhancing table layout for 2d grid type cases

[16:22:01.0000] <annevk3>
as I understand it Gecko has some grid internals as well

[16:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
XUL has grid stuff of some kind

[16:22:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is that sort of like what I and other were talking about last time Template Layout was tossed around on the list?  I think when the dude brought up Matrix Layout?

[16:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Basically almost floating things to table cells?

[16:23:01.0000] <annevk3>
that discussion might have gone past me

[16:23:02.0000] <annevk3>
too much noise on www-style

[16:23:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sorry; I tend to generate a lot of noise when I get interested in a topic.

[16:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And almost treat the list like a chat.

[16:25:00.0000] <annevk3>
for instance I have not read the gradient email apart from a few of the initial ones by dbaron and dhyatt

[16:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
LOL @ "This Summer in HTML %"

[16:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*5

[16:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk3: You didn't miss a whole lot, unless you design with gradients a lot and find the exact syntax used for them to be of earth-shaking importance.

[16:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me was surprised at how many people did find the gradient syntax to be of earth-shaking importance

[16:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hey, it's just complex and new enough to be interesting, and just simple enough to bikeshed the hell out of.

[16:50:00.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, I really dislike the webdatabase API! The arguments parameter in the executeSql() function is too easy to accidentially omit when you have no need for passing extra arguments, but still want to have success and error callbacks

[16:51:00.0000] <hober>
makes you pine for keyword arguments à la lisp or python

[16:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jQuery usually handles that sort of thing by simply letting you omit it, when the argument types allow reliable disambiguation.

[16:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
in fact, I find the whole API to be overly complex and insane to use and wish we had thrown it out. But oh well, too late now I guess

[16:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or just folds them all into an object and names them.


2009-08-27
[17:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me eventually remembers that "object" is JavaScript-speak for "associative array"

[17:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: I'm not sure if that's a totally correct way to think about it - objects also have object-like aspects to them, besides the fact that their set of properties is open-ended

[17:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, true.  But in this context it just means "associative array", pretty much.

[17:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the buzzword "Web OS" makes me want to stab myself in the eye

[17:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not used to languages with a generic Object type that you can stick random attributes on.

[17:14:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me takes sharp objects away from othermaciej 

[17:15:00.0000] <tantek>
IMHO "Web OS" is a far more palatable (and useful) buzzword than "Object Oriented"

[17:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: isn't basically the same thing true in Python and Ruby?

[17:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: I like "Web Platform" or "Open Web Platform" or "Standards-Based Web Platform"

[17:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Python has a dedicated dict type that you'd use for this kind of thing.  (If you didn't use named parameters, that is.)

[17:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think "Web OS" means anything

[17:16:03.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - good points. "platform" is more correct

[17:16:04.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: I understand that it has a dict type, but as I understand it Python objects are also dictionaries under the covers

[17:16:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think you could do something like foo = Object(); foo.bar = "baz" and so forth, but I don't think that's possible in any way that's sensible for passing to an argument.

[17:16:06.0000] <tantek>
the "Web OS" has nothing to do with the typical definition of an "OS"

[17:17:00.0000] <tantek>
of course the term "Web App" is just as bad, for the same reasons

[17:17:01.0000] <tantek>
and belies "OS"

[17:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
My problem is I'm not used to object literals, so when you say "pass an object to a function" I think about setting a variable to the object and assigning a bunch of stuff on different lines before passing it.

[17:17:03.0000] <tantek>
if there are "Web Apps" then surely they must run on a "Web OS"

[17:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is Chrome OS a "Web OS"?  :)

[17:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: it's a "Cloud OS"

[17:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
at least, that's what I read on TechCrunch

[17:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
tantek: the way I understand it, applications run on a platform but that platform does not have to be an OS

[17:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for example, Java is a platform (though that's not necessarily the nicest comparison example)

[17:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Python plus its common extensions is arguably a platform of sorts

[17:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Many people think of "LAMP" as a platform, and while the acronym includes an OS, that's the least important bit from the point of view of the apps

[17:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd say the web server is less important than the OS.

[17:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
For LAMP.

[17:20:02.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - another good point. there are Java apps, but certainly the notion of a "Java OS" has failed pretty miserably

[17:20:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
L vs. W affects whether you, e.g., can shell out to Unix utilities and handy things like that.

[17:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
A vs. I vs. L vs. N vs. whatever doesn't really make a noticeable difference to the app author.

[17:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the Web server being Apache lets you implement parts of your app in the form of Apache config rules

[17:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(how much people do that, I dunno)

[17:21:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nobody I've heard of relies on that very heavily.

[17:21:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Generally a few rewrites at most.

[17:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Linux vs. FreeBSD vs Mac OS X probably doesn't matter hugely in terms of shell capabilities

[17:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
agreed Windows is a different world

[17:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: sure, but if there are even a few rewrites, you need to "port" that part of your web service to move to a different web server

[17:22:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Usually the rewrites are nonessential, though.

[17:22:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not aware of any app that requires them.

[17:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You just fall back to ugly URLs if the admin can't be bothered to take the extra step on installation.

[17:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, the same is normally true for use of shell utilities, but that can be a somewhat bigger deal.

[17:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Certain features of MediaWiki will just fail if diff3 isn't available, for instance.

[17:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Usually also not a huge deal, but I'd say slightly more.  :)

[17:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
P > M > L > A

[17:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why are the two parts I dislike the most, the most important and least portable ones?  :(

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: hard to miss that error in testing

morning

[01:07:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
mornin'

[01:30:00.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, Philip`, do you have any data related to encodings?

[01:31:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip` does

[01:32:00.0000] <annevk3>
ah yeah, just found http://philip.html5.org/data/meta-content-type.txt

[01:32:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
http://philip.html5.org/data/charsets.html

[01:33:00.0000] <annevk3>
sweet

[01:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk3: what kind of data?

[01:36:00.0000] <annevk3>
unique encoding labels

[01:36:01.0000] <tantek>
anybody here have a particular opinions about the microdata predefined vocabularies?

[01:48:00.0000] <annevk3>
tantek, I like the idea, but I don't feel strongly either way

[01:48:01.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, actually, I guess ARIA role=heading will influence the eventual document outline

[01:49:00.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, so I think your critique was correct

[01:50:00.0000] <tantek>
annevk3 - the major issue (with the predefined vocabs) is that they are for the most part a static fork/snapshot of microformats vocabs (hCard and hCalendar), and are very much going to have all the bugs (issues in progress) that a snapshot typically does. and frankly this group/community lacks the direct experience and day-to-day usage to keep up with and properly resolve.

[01:51:00.0000] <tantek>
(lots of outstanding issues on hCard and hCalendar that have been challenging for *me* to resolve, and I invented them and have been living/breathing them for nearly 5 years now)

[01:52:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
What was that downloadable web cache that Philip`was using?

[01:52:01.0000] <annevk3>
tantek, I thought they were snapshots of vCard and vEvent and such

[01:52:02.0000] <tantek>
anyway - I'm moving forward with producing hCard and hCalendar 1.0.1 specs which incorporate all issue resolutions, and have UA conformance requirements with similar wording to HTML5 - I can pretty much guarantee these will be both be better and better reflect the reality of web author usage than the "predefined microdata" section in HTML5

[01:53:00.0000] <tantek>
and will advocate dropping predefined microdata vocabs once hCard 1.0.1 and hCalendar 1.0.1 are published.

[01:54:00.0000] <tantek>
annevk3 - that's the problem, they were *snapshots*

[01:54:01.0000] <tantek>
and as such, rapidly went out of date

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: I like the idea of having non-dotted-token vocabs for common stuff

[01:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: I'd be OK with microformats.org managing the non-dotted-token vocabs

[02:23:00.0000] <mpt>
/me wonders why the March 2009 mailing list archives are so incomplete

[02:24:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Because completeness is overrated

[02:24:01.0000] <mpt>
Oh, because I'm looking at the archives for the wrong mailing list, durrrr

[02:36:00.0000] <tantek>
thanks hsivonen - that's good to know.

[02:36:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Am I right in reading the spec to say that <table><tbody><td>foo will throw a parse error upon the td open tag being processed in the tree constructor?

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk3>
gsnedders|work, seems like it should

[02:39:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Oh wait, I'm being stupid. Ignore me.

[02:39:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Gah. Too late.

[04:04:00.0000] <Creap>
in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tabular-data.html#attr-th-scope that example, couldn't you say that Legs and Tails are also th's, for their corresponding row?

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk3>
in the actual table they are <th>

[04:07:01.0000] <annevk3>
just not in the example markup

[05:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Is it defined somewhere what happens if I do Object.prototype.__defineGetter__("document", function() {return "foo"})?

[05:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not in a single place

[05:42:00.0000] <jcranmer>
the proton streams get crossed

[05:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But what is the alternate behavior you're wondering about, jgraham?

[05:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: OK, well afaik __defineGetter__ isn't specified anywhere. But assuming it wasw, is there any wat to tell from a spec what will happen if I do the above and access window.document?

[05:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
i.e. whether I would get "foo" or a [HTMLDocument]

[05:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, I see what you mean

[05:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
window doesn't have a regular prototype chain

[05:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And in any case, window's own properties would be checked before reaching Object

[05:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm, true

[05:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Now, if you tried doing that on e.g. Document with documentElement, I think it would depend on whether documentElement is ReadOnly or not

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders|work: http://www.dotnetdotcom.org/ ?

[05:57:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Philip`: Ah, yeah, thx

[05:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: That was what I was thinking. So I started investigating…

[05:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Now, DOM 3 Core says documentElement is ReadOnly

[08:52:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders|work: pong?

[08:52:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
eighty4: pong

[08:52:02.0000] <eighty4>
*ping

[08:52:03.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders|work: valla 18.00?

[08:53:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
eighty4: yeah

[08:54:00.0000] <eighty4>
good good

[08:55:00.0000] <eighty4>
but don't expect any wonders, I'm way to tired for that.

[08:56:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
:)

[09:34:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders|work: still there?

[09:34:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
eighty4: yes

[09:34:02.0000] <eighty4>
you're so not going to make it in time :)

[09:34:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
eighty4: I'm so getting a lift :)

[09:34:04.0000] <eighty4>
pff

[09:34:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
eighty4: You going from Ryd?

[09:34:06.0000] <eighty4>
yeah

[09:34:07.0000] <gsnedders|work>
That helps :)

[09:35:00.0000] <eighty4>
?

[09:35:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Well, it is closer :)

[09:35:02.0000] <eighty4>
right

[09:35:03.0000] <eighty4>
but you should see my bike

[09:35:04.0000] <eighty4>
or well... you'll see my bike

[09:36:00.0000] <eighty4>
/me s so hating that opera rounds % and that ie don't support display:table-row

[09:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
God, I know.  Makes it difficult as hell at times.

[09:36:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
IE8 supports display:table-row, no?

[09:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, but that's not something you can depend on for a widely-deployed page.

[09:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me really wishes for a display:table-row-start value that would make a table-cell, but in a new row.

[09:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
There's no reason I should have to wrap this stuff in a container just to make it multi-line.

[09:39:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Manipulating tables through DOM is horrible

[09:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
is there something special about tables that makes it bad, or is just dealing with the DOM?

[09:43:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Tables are just especially bad

[09:44:00.0000] <eighty4>
and now my server is playing with me :(

[09:44:01.0000] <eighty4>
http://play.broken8.se/box/index.php ffs

[09:51:00.0000] <eighty4>
there we go. I so want that to work in ie

[09:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Possibly solution: pop some jQuery in a conditional comment that fakes it.  This requires saying "screw you" to IE<8 users who have scripting turned off, but screw them.

[09:54:00.0000] <cardona507>
thats cool eighty4 - is it javascript? or php?

[09:55:00.0000] <cardona507>
ic now

[10:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
"... unless maybe the user has a terabyte of free disk space" - pfah, who *doesn't* have a terabyte of disk space these days?

[10:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have less than 200 GB free right now.  :(

[10:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
i have 40gb free.

[10:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
this laptop's old, and i regularly fill it with movies.

[10:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
One of the servers I'm root on has over a terabyte free.

[10:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But that's not really usual on home desktops yet.  :)

[10:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
nod.  500gb is fairly common for new computers, or higher-end slightly older computers.

[10:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
but 1tb or more isn't common yet unless you've added the space yourself.

[10:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
500 GB total is common, 500 GB free isn't so common.  Not after a while's use, anyway.

[10:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have over 500 GB total here.

[10:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
ok, yeah

[10:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . actually, right now it's about exactly 500 GB total, since I'm using my second disk for RAID 1.

[10:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
next birthday: new computer, so I'm not relying on a 5-year old laptop for all my personal computing.

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
1TB disks cost about 20% more than 500GB disks when I last checked

[10:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
(They were external disks, though, so I suppose they have higher fixed costs)

[10:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but assuming equal quality, you're reducing your mean time to failure by consolidating

[10:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Obviously, assuming you're RAID0ing the 500gb disks

[10:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you care about MTBF, why are you using RAID 0?

[10:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Er, MTTF, whatever.

[10:49:02.0000] <smoofles>
oy

[10:50:00.0000] <smoofles>
where can one ask about features for html 5, or rather just bounce an idea – is this channel ok?

[10:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Clearly you wouldn't, is the point.  ^_^  But if you're doing a better RAID, you're losing some disks.

[10:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
smoofles: yup

[10:51:00.0000] <smoofles>
cools, I was wondering if it would make sense to have the video tag support an alt attribute

[10:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So for a simple RAID1, you're paying a 50% premium.  More expensive than the 1tb disk, but more reliable too.

[10:51:02.0000] <smoofles>
that would hold the url for an alternatively-encoded video file

[10:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
smoofles, that's what <source> is for, surely?

[10:51:04.0000] <smoofles>
oh

[10:51:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
For that case, use <source> children elements rather than the @src attribute.

[10:52:00.0000] <smoofles>
aah, didn't know about the <source> one

[10:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
no problem

[10:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Works for <audio> too.

[10:52:03.0000] <smoofles>
coolio

[10:52:04.0000] <smoofles>
I read over the source elements stuff

[10:53:00.0000] <smoofles>
good, that basically settles the codec discussion for me, thanks :)

[10:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.  Still annoying that you have to provide two files, but at least it works.

[10:55:00.0000] <smoofles>
yeah, well, on a lot of the sites people provide more versions anyway, everything from swf, mov, avi, mp4, etc

[10:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[10:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Someday, though.  Someday...

[10:58:00.0000] <smoofles>
I guess 10 years from now it will be just a couple of thousand jpg files and an mp3, sort of like Apple's "http streaming" idea, since bandwidth will increase that much – problem solved :P

[10:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
haha, that'll work.

[11:10:00.0000] <jorlow>
oops.....one of the test shell unit tests is going to go red from 24612

[11:10:01.0000] <jorlow>
i'll have a fix in soon

[11:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . is that meant for #chromium?

[11:11:00.0000] <jorlow>
:-)  sorry

[11:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me used to have #chromium where he now has #whatwg on his screen, so was confused for a second there

[12:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
is anyone here familiar with SQL?

[12:11:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
Lachy: i am

[12:11:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
though it's been a while

[12:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, you mean like the formal standard, or some SQL-based RDBMS in practice?

[12:11:03.0000] <Lachy>
I'm need to write a test for webdatabase that inserts multiple rows, but I don't know how to construct an INSERT statement that can actually insert more than 1 row

[12:11:04.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, SQLite specifically

[12:11:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not sure that's possible in a RDBMS-independent way.

[12:11:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
In MySQL you can just do INSERT INTO foo (x,y,z) VALUES (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), ...;

[12:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't care if it's RDBMS-independent. I just need to test our implementation that uses SQLite

[12:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Couldn't you just do multiple INSERT statements?

[12:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It looks like in SQLite, the only way to do it is: INSERT INTO foo (x, y, z) SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1, 2, 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4, 5, 6 UNION ALL ...);

[12:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least according to a quick Google search.

[12:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The usual way is probably just multiple INSERTs.

[12:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The "S" part of "SQL" is kind of a misnomer.  :D

[12:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
no, because I'm trying to test the resultSet.rowsAffected API, which means I need to do it within a single executeSql statement, rather than several

[12:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then you should be able to use a subquery.  INSERT INTO foo (x, y, z) SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1, 2, 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4, 5, 6 UNION ALL ...);

[12:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Alternatively, if it's not actually possible, you don't have to test it.  :)

[12:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
I will try that soon

[12:18:00.0000] <eighty4>
TabAtkins: yeah I know. I could just rewrite it to do float:left for ie<8 since those handles % more or less correctly imo

[12:18:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me blinked at "ie<8" without actually reading the whole line

[12:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me misread it as "ie<3"

[12:19:01.0000] <eighty4>
zcorpan_: definitely not :)

[12:20:00.0000] <eighty4>
is it wrong that I'm more concerned about getting stuff to work in opera then in ie6 and 7?

[12:20:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
nope ;)

[12:20:02.0000] <eighty4>
good

[12:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe you'd get a different answer from someone who doesn't work at opera

[12:22:01.0000] <eighty4>
;)

[12:22:02.0000] <eighty4>
it's not like I have any visitors anyway :D

[12:23:00.0000] <eighty4>
but you really should fix how opera handles %

[12:23:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
i'm not sure what we do wrong with %

[12:26:00.0000] <eighty4>
you're rounding it up :)

[12:27:00.0000] <eighty4>
or if it was down

[12:27:01.0000] <eighty4>
12.456% gets 13 or if it was 12

[12:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me rounds everything down

[12:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan_: We always round down in CSS

[12:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan_: Also, foolip kept trying to find you.

[12:29:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
gsnedders: ok

[12:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i guess we have a bug already?

[12:31:00.0000] <virtuelv>
/me misread ie<8 as ie is less than boobies

[12:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Firefox I know tries to round intelligently, so frex 8 floating boxes set to 12.5% width always take up exactly 1 line.

[12:31:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/219

[12:31:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't know if they use heuristics to tell when they should round up/down or what.

[12:31:04.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan_: Dunno. What we do is fine per spec, because rounding is undefined.

[12:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
you shouldn't round

[12:32:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: I assume you should do sub-pixel positioning, then?

[12:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[12:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
possibly with render-time snap-to-grid

[12:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
but there shouldn't be any cumulative rounding error

[12:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
We fail a lot of the Mozilla rounding reftests because of rounding differences

[12:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
i filed a bug on opera needing to do subpixel layout about 3 decades ago

[12:33:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Though as far as I could tell, our behaviour is mostly fine per spec, just different.

[12:34:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
3 decades?

[12:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tries to remember if Hixie has even been alive for three decades

[12:36:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it would be slightly better if we rounded down just one pixel

[12:36:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
but now we round 0.9% to 0%

[12:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, right

[12:36:03.0000] <eighty4>
I should file that "bug" I found.... still not sure it's actually a bug

[12:36:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finds a site compat bug on the Flickr Pro "place order" page

[12:36:05.0000] <eighty4>
0.9% could be 100px

[12:36:06.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses about the cause

[12:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan_: Really?  That's, um, quite bad.

[12:37:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
indeed

[12:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: YA RLY

[12:37:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Even on standard resolutions that's 10px or more.  >_<

[12:37:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: ORLY?

[12:40:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me finds CORE-1006

[12:40:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
"CW: I still plan on being involved but probably less than in the past." <-- I honestly don't see how that's possible

[12:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me laughs at the number of duplicates

[12:41:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
(from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/1331.html )

[12:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan_: You going to be in tomorrow?

[12:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
gsnedders: yes

[12:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Then I'll speak to you about this then

[13:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: the spec gen script is hanging when doing the w3c version

[13:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
which i think means it's hanging doing the annotations

[13:08:01.0000] <eighty4>
would this be considered a bug? http://play.broken8.se/opera_bug/ watch it in ff browsers and then opera. Try to remove overflow: hidden on #content.

[13:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok that could possibly be because my server went down

[13:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
wtf

[13:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: Oh, that issue again… WebKit does what Opera does, and I think that is right

[13:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: maybe we should allow <object> to have an open-ended set of attributes, like <embed>

[13:15:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: as a shorthand for <param ...>

[13:15:02.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: yeah, I never did anything about it last time

[13:15:03.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: overflow:hidden is odd though

[13:16:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: but why would the display property change how margin and float works?

[13:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It shouldn't,.

[13:17:00.0000] <eighty4>
yet it does :)

[13:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I didn't say it did not :)

[13:18:01.0000] <eighty4>
i.e. a bug?

[13:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[13:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
W

[13:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*Which behaviour is right is debatable, I think

[13:20:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/220 another opera bug i stumbled upon yesterday

[13:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
We have quite a few bugs with button, though

[13:21:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
seems display:list-item on parent/ancestor triggers it

[13:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: why?

[13:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: regen script is indeed hanging on the w3c copy for some reason

[13:24:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: because browsers support it and it's a lot shorter in markup

[13:25:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: authors have to choose between short markup and no fallback (embed) and verbose markup with fallback (object)

[13:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: *shrug*

[13:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: they shouldn't do either

[13:26:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
because plugins are evil?

[13:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i dunno about "evil", but certainly they're not to be encouraged

[13:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
what with being media-specific, platform-specific, even browser-specific

[13:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
and proprietary

[13:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Oh

[13:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
I will have a look

[13:35:00.0000] <annevk3>
zii.com looks interesting

[13:37:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: "The id attribute represents its element's unique identifier (ID)." - not sure why <a name> is much different

[13:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk3: Huh, interesting.  An android phone with multi-touch, cool.

[13:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And a free phone with purchase of the SDK.

[13:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: woah, that's bogus.

[13:39:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me sees that lang="" uses the word "specifies" instead of "represents"

[13:40:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, represents is used all the time for various things

[13:40:01.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, e.g. also for the cookie attribute

[13:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
file bugs

[13:41:00.0000] <annevk3>
well I don't really care

[13:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
(especially if it's the hyperlinked "represents")

[13:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
(cos that makes no sense)

[13:41:03.0000] <annevk3>
it's not linked

[13:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
ok well then it's basically a meaningless statement

[13:41:05.0000] <Hixie>
just fluff

[13:41:06.0000] <Hixie>
and certainly not a definition of any kind

[13:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me filed a bug

[13:44:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe you should replace all non-normative sentences in the spec with "Fluff fluff fluff..."

[13:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
zcorpan_: Normative spec view

[13:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan_: Or, "This is filler text."

[13:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: "An error occured while submitting your comment. Please let ian⊙hc know."

[13:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me tries again

[14:01:00.0000] <sebastiandeutsch>
Don't know if I'm right here. Can I ask a technical canvas question? Is it possible to instanciate a canvas, then draw on it and the blit it (drawImage) on another canvas?

[14:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
sebastiandeutsch: You *should* be able to pull the data from the first canvas with getImageData, then blit it over with putImageData on the second.

[14:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haven't used <canvas> directly, but the spec seems to say that's how you'd do it.

[14:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Clearly the annotations script is broken but I'm not quite sure why

[14:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Goddammit, people have no patience.  Dude left after *2* minutes of me reading the spec for him.

[14:13:00.0000] <annevk3>
he prolly figured out drawImage worked fine

[14:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm maybe it is just that w3c.org is being really slow

[14:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/w3c/w3/

[14:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess I should make a cache of the data somehow and use the cached values if the requests take too long

[14:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
But not this evening

[14:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
sebastiandeutsch: I guess you'll never read this but you can just use drawImage to draw one canvas onto another

[14:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is having fun rolling his own security system (industry-standard encryption, but homebrew system for employing it), but wonders if it's sufficient.


2009-08-28
[17:36:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
hmm I got a dozen new twitter followers all of a sudden

[17:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
you got a lot of press

[18:01:00.0000] <xtothey>
html5 discussion going on now at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/standardista. It's at the NY Web Standards Meetup.

[18:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Requiring Flash rather than <video>, of course.

[18:03:00.0000] <xtothey>
Yeah, you missed a nice rant about Flash.

[18:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I did? I didn't see any press other than some people retweeting the w3c announcement itself

[18:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh crap I'm on Ars Technica

[18:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, my HTML5 google alert flagged all kinds of posts

[18:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
oddly i didn't see any headlines for paul

[18:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
(i didn't read any of the articles)

[18:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what does the word "boffin" mean?

[18:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one of these articles called me an "Apple WebKit boffin" and I am not sure whether I should be offended or flattered

[18:19:01.0000] <gavin_>
scientist/researcher, says http://www.answers.com/boffin

[18:19:02.0000] <gavin_>
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boffin

[18:20:00.0000] <gavin_>
flattered, I think :)

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: flattered, it means a competent geek

[18:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok people

[18:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
stop filing bugs already

[18:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
the graph is going in the wrong direction

[18:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you did ask people to file bugs...

[18:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This 98.248.33.53 guy is a big fan of examples.

[18:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah the examples were me

[18:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[18:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I might say something about revealing your home IP address, but I've assigned monoid.aryeh.name to point to my home IP address, so.  I won't.

[18:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(domain names make SSH to your home machine much more convenient!)

[18:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
my home machine that accepts incoming SSH is currently turned off waiting for snow leopard

[18:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I never turn off my home desktop.  I use it as an alarm clock, too.

[18:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
i have another home machine for that...

[18:46:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's really annoying when there's a hardware failure or something and it dies in the middle of the night.  :(

[18:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm hoping snow leopard fixes the kernel panics i was getting running "isightcapture")

[18:46:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Didn't I read something in your blog about how you use model trains for an alarm clock, or wanted to?

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i did, back in oslo

[18:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
that was quite effective

[18:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
my trains are all boxed up right now sadly

[18:47:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's classy.  I just use: beep -f600 -l800 -r10 -D200 -n -f620 -l800 -r10

[18:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
nowadays i use http://damowmow.com/playground/alarm.pl

[18:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I like to use "sleep 28800; open ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Music/somerandom.mp3"

[18:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ugh, why is <select multiple> implemented so poorly by most UAs?  Normal users can't figure out how to select multiple values at once.  Ctrl-click is totally undiscoverable.

[18:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They should do little checkboxes or something.

[18:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Mac users know how to use multi-select lists

[18:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But Windows users don't, or you have no opinion on them?

[18:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i used to do that (GNU sleep(1) is even better, it takes arguments like '8h'), but eventually i needed more, and that's how i ended up with that script (which does speech synthesis and all kinds of stuff)

[18:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the thing I really want from an alarm is 1-hour snooze button

[18:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
mine does that basically automatically

[18:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(although speech synthesis to remind me why I actually need to get up could be useful too)

[18:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
it says the time and a custom message, and repeats it at increasingly large intervals

[18:52:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Man, I never use snooze buttons.  I just get up.  Maybe that's because I have something I do at 8 or 8:30 every morning, though, that I always have to be up for.

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
8:30am!!!

[18:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
jesus

[18:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
4am - noon is bed time

[18:53:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sleeping in for me is waking up at 8 AM.  :P

[18:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I like to plan to be able to wake up, then sleep another hour, then actually get up and do what I need to do

[18:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's a lot easier for me to get up if I wake up twice

[18:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's morning prayers, you see.  I have to say them every morning, and it has to be in the first half of the morning or so.  Which means you have to start like 8:30 or 9:00 latest, at this latitude, if you want a consistent start time year-round.  :)

[18:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(and congregations usually keep a consistent start time year-round)

[18:55:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, why do you think Mac users know how to use multi-selects?

[18:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
because list boxes are a common idiom, even in the file manager

[18:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, but are users forced to select multiple things?

[18:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ctrl-click works in Windows and Linux too in the file manager, but that doesn't mean everyone knows how to use it.

[18:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think people know about shift-click and shift-downarrow and such

[18:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I could be wrong, it is just my subjective impression

[18:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I suspect lots don't, but I tend to make a conscious effort to assume people are way less techy than I'd have thought, and I probably overshoot sometimes.

[23:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what's the point of the creationCallback in the openDatabase() method?

[23:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see any use for it since the database is still returned by the openDatabase() method. There doesn't appear to be any need to use a callback to get it.

[00:15:00.0000] <Mrmil>
so much noise about 'cite'...

[00:45:00.0000] <annevk2>
Lachy, it's called when you do this for the first time

[00:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
Lachy, so you can have a standalone function that is just for generating all the tables that are needed for your app

[00:46:01.0000] <annevk2>
Lachy, compare with the installation steps of e.g. WordPress

[01:01:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders|work: pm?

[01:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk2, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how it's supposed to work, but I think that would mean when you open the database, you have to wait for the callback to be invoked before doing anything with the database, but since it only gets invoked when the database is first created, how are you supposed to know when it's ready to be used?

[01:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, you get the database returned from the method, but before running any additional transactions, you still need to check whether or not it was created for the first time

[01:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
and if it was, you have to wait for the callback to be executed, where you can set up the tables required.

[01:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
basically, what I'm saying, is it sucks to have a semi-asynchronous/semi-synchrounous API like this with which you have no idea whether it will need to be run synchrounously or asynchronously when you open it :-(

[01:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
Lachy, no, that callback is invoked first

[01:13:01.0000] <annevk2>
Lachy, all other transactions will be queued behind it

[01:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, right. I guess that's ok. It still sucks having so many damn callbacks in this api

[01:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: are you around?

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: Yes

[01:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: could you comment on the proposal from Jonathan Robie in <http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7059>, in light of his clarifications?

[01:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: OK.

[01:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: the XQuery/XSL folks want to talk about this at TPAC, I am hoping we can get it resolved before then

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I'm OK with the change if you guys change WebKit, too. :-)

[01:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I don't know the history of why we decided to do it this way

[01:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(i.e. whether actual sites broke or if it was just for logical reasons)

[01:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: IIRC, ap said it was just in case. (Not his exact words.)

[01:25:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I was gonna say, he's the one who would know

[01:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I can't tell if Jonathan's proposed wording is for XPath or HTML5

[01:28:01.0000] <annevk2>
what's he's proposing, how does that effect XSLT applied to HTML?

[01:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: (or for whatever spec or specs define document.evaluate or XSLTProcessor

[01:28:03.0000] <annevk2>
s/effect/affect/

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: seems like no effect, since it's scoped to document.evaluate as written

[01:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: it doesn't affect XSLT applied to an HTML DOM compared to current HTML 5 spec text unless the tree also has no-namespace nodes introduced with createElementNS or by importing from an XML tree

[01:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: did you find actual compat issues when you changed this in Gecko, or just broken test cases?

[01:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: it needs to apply to *any* DOM API that causes XPath to be evaluated against an HTML DOM

[01:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: including whatever the API is for invoking XSLT from JS

[01:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: making no-namespace name expressions match http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml nodes in HTML trees is needed for compat.

[01:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: making no-namespace name expressions also match no-namespace element nodes is in Gecko solely for uniformness with the WebKit behavior

[01:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
sorry, phrased my question wrong, I was wondering whether that'd be a problem

[01:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I see, so the WebKit change you are talking about is to *not* match no-namespace element nodes in HTML trees?

[01:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I don't see a problem with doing that

[01:32:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I misunderstood what you meant at first

[01:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: yes

[01:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we'd just have to tweak our isHTMLElement/isHTMLDocument special case slightly

[01:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: commented

[01:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
on the bug that is

[01:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: thanks!

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I like the new meta@scheme example

[02:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, which example are you referring to?

[02:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the one with ORLY

[02:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: does gmpg.org get a lot of automated profile fetches? if so, do they come from apps other than GRDDL tools?

/me wonders why a fractal is more infinitely detailed than e.g. the edge of a circle, which you can zoom in on forever and it will constantly look different

[02:39:00.0000] <poe>
it isn't, it's just more suprising

[02:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there's a well-defined way in which you can say it's "more detailed"

[02:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the edge of a circle is smooth, in a mathematically definable way

[02:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's continuously differentiable

[02:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
most fractals are nowhere differentiable - they are perfectly jagged

[02:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders|work: Trying to introduce paradoxes into the spec I see

[02:50:01.0000] <tantek>
hsivonen - good q - I'll have to check the logs

[02:50:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: Indeed. I mean, the CSS WG has already done it with CSS 3 Selectors.

[02:50:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
jgraham: We can't let the CSS WG out do us on paradoxes!

[02:51:00.0000] <tantek>
BTW FWIW I agree with having an explicit "element that goes between <header> and <footer>"

[02:51:01.0000] <tantek>
AKA <content>

[02:51:02.0000] <tantek>
people *will* make one up or (ab)use article/section

[02:51:03.0000] <tantek>
annevk3 is right

[02:52:00.0000] <tantek>
gsnedders - what paradox do you know of in the Selectors spec?

[02:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
We should make a RFC that lists all RFCs that don't refer to themselves

[02:53:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
tantek: See ::selection

[02:53:01.0000] <tantek>
yeah - that was always a tough one

[02:53:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
"This section intentionally left blank. (This section previously defined a ::selection pseudo-element.)"

[02:53:03.0000] <tantek>
thought we figured that one out though with a combination of pseudo-pseudo-elements and limited properties

[02:53:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(The paradox is the fact it says it is blank, hence making it not blank.)

[02:54:00.0000] <tantek>
"this is not a blank page"

[02:54:01.0000] <tantek>
nor a pipe for that matter

[02:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Russel's Transfer Protocol

[02:54:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(I just proposed on public-html to have explicitly blank sections in authoring view of the spec to keep section numbers the same, which is why jgraham brought it up)

[02:55:00.0000] <tantek>
gsnedders - what a waste of paper! ;)

[02:55:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
tantek: Who prints specs? :P

[02:56:00.0000] <tantek>
people that work at companies that make printers, and/or print user agents?

[02:57:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
tantek: Yes, I know some actually do. But I think the majority of people who do will be printing out the full spec, not the authoring view, so there wouldn't be the "blank" sections.

[03:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
In case people do actually print it, the spec ought to be padded with lots of blank pages to save ink

[03:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
then people should print with a really really tiny font size to reduce the total number of pages needed, counteracting the excess gained from the blank page padding

[03:04:00.0000] <beowulf>
people who want signed copies when they attend the $1000/hr HTML5 course

[03:05:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
No, it was $1500/hr! Get it right!

[03:05:01.0000] <beowulf>
pfft

[03:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
I thought it was $1500/session. Were the sessions only 1hr?

[03:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
anyone remember the link for those courses?

[03:11:02.0000] <jgraham>
http://skillsmatter.com/course/ajax-ria/enterprise-comet-ajax

[03:11:03.0000] <jgraham>
(they are 3 days which is more like $500/day or $80 per person per hour)

[03:11:04.0000] <beowulf>
whatever, you'll surely recoup all costs with a signed copy of the html5 spec

[03:11:05.0000] <beowulf>
hixie, shelly, the adobe dudes, that apache guy...

[03:11:06.0000] <beowulf>
priceless

[03:11:07.0000] <beowulf>
antiques roadshow 2050, here i come

[03:11:08.0000] <Lachy>
beowulf, would it still be priceless if Hixie just digitally signed it, and could then sell unlimited copies without wasting paper?

[03:11:09.0000] <beowulf>
:)

[03:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's only worth anything if everyone in the acknowledgements section signs it

[03:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, actually, it's worth whatever the market will pay for it, regardless of how many people have signed it

[03:15:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Hmm, that sounds like a challenge.

[03:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
it'd be interesting to put this to the test. Several of us print out and sign our own copy, and see which one fetches the most on ebay

[03:16:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I still want to try and get everyone named in the spec to sign it.

[03:16:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
I guess that means getting Hendrel and Pillar to sign it

[03:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, do you still have that TPAC cabal-attendance sheet from last year? How much do you reckon that would fetch?

[03:17:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Lachy: It's at my parent's home somewhere, I think I know where. Dunno.

[04:02:00.0000] <beowulf>
would <body><main> ... </main></body> be abuse of <main>?

[04:02:01.0000] <beowulf>
because that's what i think a lot of people would use it for

[04:03:00.0000] <annevk2>
yes

[04:03:01.0000] <annevk2>
that's easy to flag though

[04:04:00.0000] <beowulf>
cool

[04:34:00.0000] <annevk3>
quite often when I see boolean attributes in use people just stick true in there...

[04:34:01.0000] <annevk3>
e.g. loop="true"

[04:35:00.0000] <takkaria>
XML really shouldn't have got rid of boolean attributes

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: SGML didn't have boolean attributes, so one might argue XML never got rid of them

[04:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: I think it's good XML got rid of what SGML had here

[04:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, I thought it did

[04:52:01.0000] <takkaria>
anyway, boolean attributes would have been a good idea

[04:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: SGML had something crazier: if the DTD had an enumeration of possible attribute values, specifying just the value implied the attribute name

[04:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: so in SGML, <input type checked> makes checked the value of the attribute that implies the attribute name checked

[04:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so in theory <input checkbox> should imply <input type=checkbox>

[04:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in SGML

[05:02:00.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, or <input password> implied <input type=password>

[05:02:01.0000] <annevk3>
oh wait, you just mentioned that one :)

[05:02:02.0000] <annevk3>
/me confused checkbox with checked

[05:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
history navigation and media elements is interesting

[05:43:00.0000] <takkaria>
hsivonen: mildly terrifying, that

[05:44:00.0000] <annevk3>
zcorpan, "interesting", I suppose :)

[05:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: yes

[05:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
as in causing crashes if you're not careful and requiring lots of work to make events not fire

[06:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, how would <body><main>...</main></body> be an abuse?

[06:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe if the author did <body><main><header/>...<footer/></main></body> instead of <body><header/><main>...</main><footer/></body>

[06:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
(though we really should use <content> instead of <main>, if at all)

[06:23:00.0000] <beowulf>
Lachy: my question was about <body><main><header/>...<footer/></main></body>, fwiw

[06:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
beowulf, ah, ok. In that case, yes, I agree with annevk2

[06:26:00.0000] <beowulf>
http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/naming_conventions_table.html # in this, as many have main as inside the body as have it inside <header/> <footer/>

[06:26:01.0000] <beowulf>
but if like annevk3 says it's easily flagged, no worries

[06:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"must not have header or footer descendants without a sectioning element in between"

[06:43:00.0000] <beowulf>
should the div section in the spec not mention it's use in styling, it does in the example text I suppose...

[07:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: The average person does *not* know about shift+click or ctrl+click, and *especially* not shift+down arrow.  Keycombos are voodoo magic to the average person.  I was tech support; I know.

[07:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins: anyone who has used Mac vector drawing programs any time since the 1980s knows about shift-click and command-click

[07:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can assure you that Windows users do not know about this.

[07:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
How many people (Mac users or otherwise) have used Mac vector drawing programs?

[07:17:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And I'm not convinced that knowledge of keycombos for specific programs translates into knowledge of key combos in general.

[07:17:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Especially when they're completely different.  Context is lost on the average user.

[07:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins: I'm ready to believe Windows users don't know about multiple selection, but it should be pretty common knowledge among Mac users

[07:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
One of you mentioned that it was used often in the file manager or whatnot?

[07:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, you know, I think we need :changed/:unchanged.  Then you could do :invalid:changed:after { contents: " !"; color: red; font-weight: bold; } or such.  (Should :changed apply if the UA prefills the value?)

[07:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
How is it done so that it differs from the windows file system?

[07:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(haven't has experience with Macs in 10+ years)

[07:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me imagines anyone who doesn't know about shift/command-click is in the world of pain with the Finder

[07:19:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, Macs have a sort of list-box file manager.

[07:19:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Hrm, yes.  Let's work out details.  One sec, though - I just arrived at work, and need to go put on clothes.

[07:19:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, http://www.qdev.de/mac/pics/exifrenamer_folder_after_backdrop.png

[07:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins: shift-click selects the range between current selection and the click

[07:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins: command-click adds the clicked item to selection

[07:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, the same is true on Windows, but I bet most Windows users don't know about it.

[07:20:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
How often do users really *need* to select multiple files?  E.g., to delete a bunch, they can just delete them one by one.

[07:20:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
People do stuff like that.

[07:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: it's generally painful to watch Windows users struggle with their UI

[07:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, on Windows they can also select multiple files by click and drag a box, though.

[07:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems to me that when they are frustrated enough they stop learning

[07:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
but Mac users don't get demotivated and learn these shortcuts

[07:21:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems to me that most people just don't learn UI unless it's explicitly taught to them.

[07:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That kind of person is probably less likely to use a Mac, though.

[07:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(much as I suspect the large majority of Linux users know about Shift-/Ctrl-click)

[07:22:02.0000] <zcorpan>
click-drag should work with <select multiple>

[07:22:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
The least competent computer users usually wind up with Windows because they don't really know what an operating system is anyway and just get whatever the store sells, or whatever.

[07:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
hsivonen: I think your experiences with Mac users may be somewhat dated.  IMXP modern mac users have regressed to the mean.

[07:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
could be

[07:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Click-drag doesn't seem to work with <select multiple> on Chrome/Linux

[07:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
.

[07:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I'm not sure how that screenshot displays anything different from Windows.  Am I missing something?

[07:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, well, it's clearly different from the default Windows layout, but I'm not sure the difference is relevant.

[07:24:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
hsivonen: Tragedy of the commons, I guess.  ^_^

[07:24:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . Tragedy of the commons is something totally unrelated.

[07:24:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yes, slightly.

[07:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That would be the use of the ^_^.  I was being ironic in misusing the word to indicate that the common people have infiltrated the Mac.

[07:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Tragedy of the commons is if Mac users use up all the Shift-clicking in the world so that they can't Shift-click anymore after ten years.

[07:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Like Lispers using up all the parens?

[07:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or perlers using up all the linenoise, so TVs won't be able to display static anymore?

[07:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, anyway, :changed.  I like the concept.

[07:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
I would be astonished if the majority of users knew about these shortcuts, Macs or not. I would be astonished if there was ever a time since the Mac went mass-market that the majority of mac users knew about them

[07:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Me too.

[07:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's way too easy to assume most people are at least slightly techy like us.

[07:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
Frankly I have difficulty remembering which key does which thing

[07:28:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Doesn't match when you first load the page, even if @value is specified.  Does match as soon as the user causes a change event (or UA equivalent).

[07:28:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Only ambiguity (maybe) is what to do if script alters the value.

[07:28:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've read enough tech support horror stories to not be so optimistic.

[07:28:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, or what if the UA prefills it?

[07:28:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
In what manner?

[07:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like if you go to a login page and it prefills your username.

[07:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I feel like I want to classify that with scripts filling it.

[07:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though it may be okay to let the UA decide.

[07:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Depending on what they think it's closer to - them just rendering a static @value, or them typing for the user.

[07:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think scripts should probably trigger :changed just like a user filling values in.

[07:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, I'd tend to agree.

[07:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If they don't want to trigger it, they can change the default value instead of the current value.

[07:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What if the user changes it, then changes it again so it's equal to the default value?

[07:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe even without committing the first change?

[07:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I would say probably don't trigger it.

[07:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I mean, it should be :unchanged)

[07:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Don't trigger it - it wouldn't fire a change event in that case.

[07:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But what if they changed it, committed the change, and went back to change it back?

[07:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then it still matches :changed.

[07:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, I agree.

[07:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup, the user has meaningfully interacted with it, so we're good.

[07:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
:changed would match HTML's idea of dirtiness, I think.

[07:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the spec should use @font-face to supply proper fonts to all viewers

[07:38:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
How, hm, how does one change the default value of an input without changing the current value?  This may be my jQuery thinking collapsing ideas in my head.

[07:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm surprised that windows users struggle with the concept of shift-/control-clicking for selection

[07:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/windows//

[07:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, well, you could just change the "value" attribute . . .

[07:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, do you have evidence that *average* Mac users don't?

[07:39:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me is a Mac/Linux user and is tired of Mac-elitism on this topic

[07:39:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, then it's me collapsing ideas.  ^_^  I tend to think of .val() and .attr("val",) the same.

[07:39:06.0000] <Lachy>
no, I'm not commenting on mac users

[07:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bleh, .attr("value",)

[07:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
given that windows explorer has the behaviour, it seems like it should be fairly common knowledge

[07:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
and it always just seemed intuitive to me

[07:40:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: It's simply not *necessary* behavior for most people.

[07:40:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
And a goodly fraction understand the "drag a box" behavior, which is a good substitute.

[07:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, it's totally arbitrary, though, if you think about it.  It's not intuitive at all, or discoverable.  The only possible way you could figure it out is either by reading about it, being told about it, or banging your keyboard randomly while selecting stuff.

[07:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: the normal display of Windows folders is "Thumbnail" rather than "List".

[07:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The average computer user doesn't read about computers or talk to people about them, unless they have a problem they need to solve.

[07:41:03.0000] <jgraham>
The drag a box behaviour is more discoverable because it's something that novice users often do by accident

[07:41:04.0000] <Lachy>
although, IIRC, MS Office drawing functions (in Word, Powerpoint, etc.) did mess it up, and made Shift+click behave like ctrl+click should

[07:41:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham, yup.

[07:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
whereas there's no obvious reason that ctrl+click would do something different to z+click or f1+click

[07:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wouldn't go that far.  Ctrl is a modifier key, I think most users see a difference between it and Z or F1.

[07:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know how I learned about it, but I definitely didn't read about it. I guess I must have been shown at some point or seen someone else do it

[07:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it's not obvious that it would do anything special in the magical narrow case where you already have something selected and are clicking on something else of the same type in a case where you can select both of them.

[07:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, yeah, me too.  I assume at some point I saw someone do it.

[07:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I think the primary difference people see is that Ctrl doesn't do anything most of the time.  ^_^

[07:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I know that's how I figured out that you can expand and collapse tree views with the arrow keys.

[07:43:03.0000] <eighty4>
/me knows that ~50% of the mac users dosesn't know of two fingers scroll

[07:43:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm pretty sure I learned about it from a "Windows 95 for dummies" book when I was 8 or someething.

[07:43:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, hmm, true.  Shift is maybe a better example.

[07:43:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, was Windows 95 released when you were 8?

[07:43:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, I suppose I had to be at least 10 for that.

[07:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
also, I remember lots of sites that used to use <select multiple> used to say things like "Hold Ctrl to select multiple items" or similar

[07:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
though the use of <select multiple> seems to have declined in favour of checkboxes

[07:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, yeah, that's true.

[07:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
MediaWiki used to do that in some places.  Then we switched to checkboxes.  :P

[07:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<select multiple> is just *way* too user-unfriendly.  The fact that you *have* to be holding Ctrl to multi-select, and that it wipes out your selection if you forget at some point, is just evil.

[07:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've never used it in a design, and I don't intend to.

[07:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
it would be nice if the multi-select widget had check boxes of some kind beside each item in the list, that just required clicking without a modifier key

[07:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[07:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
like how many installation wizards do it in the custom install dialogs

[07:46:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's what I think.

[07:46:04.0000] <poe>
this is a pretty nice layer ontop of select multiple http://code.google.com/p/jquery-asmselect/

[07:46:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's no reason everyone has to use this cruddy UI.

[07:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I really like that redesign of <select>.  It works well, and is intuitive.

[07:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Of course, just using a bit list of checkboxes within a container with max-height and overflow:scroll set works pretty equivalently.

[07:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Aryeh: You wanna write up :changed/:unchanged on the list?

[07:57:00.0000] <mpt>
TabAtkins, browsers could make <select multiple> easy to use very simply: just add a checkbox to each item.

[07:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
mpt: I agree.  But no one has.  ;_;

[07:57:02.0000] <mpt>
TabAtkins, and I think somewhere in bugzilla.mozilla.org there's a bug report from me to that effect. :-)

[07:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And until at least IE and FF do it, I'm not willing to use <select multiple>

[07:58:01.0000] <mpt>
/me realizes Lachy just suggested the same thing

[07:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nod.  It's silly how basic the solution is, and that it still hasn't been put into practice.

[07:59:01.0000] <mpt>
What does <select multiple> look like on an iPhone?

[08:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is a good question.

[08:00:01.0000] <mpt>
(since <select> looks very different)

[08:00:02.0000] <annevk3>
does Ubuntu have them mpt? :)

[08:00:03.0000] <annevk3>
btw, the wifi donation thing worked out

[08:00:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm...

[08:00:05.0000] <mpt>
annevk3, no Web browsers currently shipping with Ubuntu do, if that's what you mean

[08:00:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me goes and checks what it looks like on his phone with Opera Mini.

[08:01:00.0000] <annevk3>
i meant the OS

[08:01:01.0000] <mpt>
annevk3, have what, specifically? Lists where you can select more than one item with the Ctrl key?

[08:01:02.0000] <mpt>
Or lists with checkbox items?

[08:01:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me assumes the latter

[08:02:00.0000] <annevk3>
mpt, presumably ubuntu has multiple select as widget; i wondered whether you had the impl fixed there

[08:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, good job Opera Mini team.

[08:03:01.0000] <mpt>
That's up to the application. I don't recall any current application that expects people to know Ctrl click, apart from the file manager.

[08:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
A <select multiple> opens to a new screen filled with checkboxes.

[08:03:03.0000] <jgraham>
I think it is more accurate to say that Gtk has multiple-select widgets and that they din't have checkboxes

[08:03:04.0000] <jgraham>
*don't

[08:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
But I don't recall actually seing a multiple-select widget

[08:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk3: Pass along my thumbs up to whoever does that.

[08:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: takkaria is more likely to know I guess

[08:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria is Opera dev?

[08:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I really only know for sure like two people who are on Opera - Anne and Hakon.

[08:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know there are lots others who hang around, but I don't know who they are.

[08:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I guess Lachy?

[08:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, takkaria doesn't work for Opera

[08:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
Yep. And me and gsnedders|work for a year and takkaria for the summer and lots of other people who are on the list but not IRC

[08:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[08:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, is takkaria a summer intern in sweden?

[08:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria is on the mini team for the summer

[08:08:02.0000] <jgraham>
in Sweden, yes

[08:08:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(That's me for a year, not jgraham also.)

[08:08:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: Pass along thumbs up for Mini's impl of <select multiple>.

[08:08:05.0000] <jgraham>
I guess commas would have helped

[08:08:06.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(Though technically from tomorrow until the 4th October I'm not an Opera guy)

[08:08:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nod.  I thought you were calling yourself an intern, jgraham.  ^_^

[08:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
No I'm trapped here

[08:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
;)

[08:09:02.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, I thought you were only going to be with us for a few weeks

[08:09:03.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me notes there's nobody standing in the doorway

[08:09:04.0000] <gsnedders|work>
/me wonders what traps jgraham

[08:09:05.0000] <gsnedders|work>
(I'm in the same room as jgraham)

[08:10:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
TabAtkins: zcorpan is Opera as well (and is really Simon Pieters)

[08:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, I never connected the two names.

[08:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh yeak, sorry I forgot

[08:10:03.0000] <jgraham>
*yeah

[08:10:04.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders|work, jgraham has a really strong electromagnet in his chair and metal implants in his legs that keep him trapped

[08:11:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Nah, doesn't look like it

[08:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
^this is true

[08:11:02.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Unless it's under the floor…

[08:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You know, I've got a ton of emails on hand in a database of mine too.

[08:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Might be fun to run AryehGregor's query against them too

[08:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, I've got 441 or so distinct email addresses harvested from our customers, and they're all valid according <input type=email> validation.

[08:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me will see if he can get access to our full email lists - these are just the emails given to one particular app he wrote.

[09:39:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
heycam: yt?

[09:41:00.0000] <gsnedders|work>
heycam: ignore me

[09:46:00.0000] <takkaria>
TabAtkins: yeah, it's quite nice, isn't it?  though we got a bug report complaining about it a couple weeks back

[09:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: Dude, how can you complain about it?

[09:46:02.0000] <takkaria>
we gave the response "it works like this on purpose" :)

[09:46:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh.

[09:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me notes that Century Gothic is a *really nice* font.

[09:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me grumbles

[09:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hey, Century Gothic. That is a cheering thought

[09:52:01.0000] <gsnedders|work>
Says the grumpy old man

[09:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
...I'm not quite sure how to respond to that.

[09:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: What the idea that nice typography cazn be cheering?

[09:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or that I can be grumpy?

[09:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: I wasn't sure how much sarcasm was in there.  ^_^

[09:53:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm just happy that Century Gothic scales so well on-screen.

[09:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Very readable down to 10px size.

[09:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dammit, FF3.5 doesn't support calc() yet.  >_<

[13:10:00.0000] <atwilson>
Hixie: Not sure why you find it valuable to allow sending "lame duck" ports via postMessage()? This seems like it's always an error and should be reflected as an exception.

[13:11:00.0000] <atwilson>
Why would we want to allow this?

[13:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
isn't that the whole point of that thread?

[13:14:00.0000] <atwilson>
Hixie: no. That thread is about *closing* ports, not sending *cloned* ports.

[13:14:01.0000] <atwilson>
A closed port != a cloned port.

[13:15:00.0000] <atwilson>
In particular:

[13:15:01.0000] <atwilson>
If I have two entangled ports, port1 and port2, and I do "port1.postmessage(); port1.postMessage(); port1.close();

[13:16:00.0000] <atwilson>
Someone should still be able to send port1/port2 around through postmessage, because there could still be queued up but undelivered messages associated with those ports.

[13:16:01.0000] <atwilson>
But once I've done this:

[13:16:02.0000] <atwilson>
port1.postmessage("msg", port2)

[13:17:00.0000] <atwilson>
Then there's no reason to allow doing port1.postMessage('msg2', port2) again, because port2 is truly defunct (is not even associated with the underlying message queue any more)

[13:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand how we're supposed to tell the difference between a closed port and the remaining part of a cloned port

[13:18:00.0000] <atwilson>
Why not? closing a port is different from cloning it.

[13:18:01.0000] <atwilson>
They are completely different actions.

[13:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
All closing does is disentangle the ports

[13:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
Cloning does that too

[13:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
unless you want me to add some flag that remembers whether the port was closed or cloned

[13:19:03.0000] <atwilson>
/me is looking at the spec again while we talk

[13:20:00.0000] <atwilson>
Yeah, I'd say that's what I'm saying. We should differentiate between the two states, because they are different.

[13:20:01.0000] <atwilson>
A cloned port is no longer a task source

[13:20:02.0000] <atwilson>
a closed port is

[13:20:03.0000] <vvv>
What's up with my <input type=color alpha> proposal?

[13:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
atwilson: k, send mail

[13:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
vvv: it's number 296 out of 379 in the e-mail queue

[13:21:02.0000] <vvv>
I see

[13:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
"So, what you are going to create an element for every ARIA role now? That is crazy." -- you know, if you reverse things in that sentence that's pretty much how I thought about ARIA in the beginning (and still do regarding some parts)

[13:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
vvv: If you bug Hixie about it enough, he'll decide that it's less effort to respond immediately rather than keeping it in the queue :-)

[13:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like the queue's quite short, though

[13:26:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, do you already feel like it's next week?

[13:26:01.0000] <vvv>
Philip`: I'm delighted he at least said where it is in queue :)

[13:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: Are you referring to something I said within the past few days?

[13:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I've spent most of that time period in bed or feeling like I'd rather be there, so I can't really remember what I may or may not have said)

[13:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, you said you'd look into doing another charset survey on a larger dataset

[13:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: Oh, okay

[13:31:02.0000] <annevk2>
I'm not feeling too well either (again)... :/

[13:31:03.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: "Next week" probably means Tuesday, in that case

[13:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
okidoki

[13:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you want to be at a lower point in the queue, you can file a bug for it

[13:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
of course, i'm not responding to bugs right now, i'm responding to e-mails

[13:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
so it's unclear which will get addressed first :-)

[13:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there any penalty for sending an email and filing an identical bug?

[13:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
nope

[13:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like a clear strategy, then

[13:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
vvv: (i haven't yet studied your e-mail, but off-hand it sounds similar to past proposals to which i responded that we would be better off waiting until we had experience with type=color before adding more features)

[13:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok, off to lunch

[13:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[13:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
holy crap I need to go to lunch too.  Nearly 3 hours overdue because I was so wrapped up in coding.  >_<

[13:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thank Resig that jQuery makes it as easy as it is to create a responsive ajax-driven UI.

[16:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me ponders buying web5.nu


2009-08-29
[17:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Is there some pun involved?  If not, then pass.

[17:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Just the new web, and web.nu is taken

[17:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me ponders dropping full support for his blog for anything that doesn't support CSS 2.1

[17:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thumbs up from me.

[17:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is finding <time> useful just as a justifiable styling hook.

[17:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though I am getting legitimate use out of it too.  Would be better if it stored a unix timestamp, but we can't all be perfect.

[17:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But some of the more eccentric things I'd like to use aren't impl in Gecko

[17:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
As long as it's still readable in gecko, it's cool.

[17:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anne's blog doesn't work right outside of Opera.

[17:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Anne's blog doesn't work right _in_ Opera

[17:25:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Really?  Heh, I assumed that he'd been using opera features.

[17:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Nah, he's just deliberately using things browsers don't support so he can make them site compat. bugs to try and get them fixed quicker than just standards bugs :)

[17:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, I see.  ^_^

[17:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(His name should appear in top left, and doesn't in Opera 10)

[17:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Gah. IE7 still makes up 50% of visitors from IE. :(

[17:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[17:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
What's your ie6 percentage?

[17:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
25% of IE

[17:29:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, what, 15% or so of total?  Or are you lucky enough to have a lower-than-normal ie %?

[17:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I am, because out of my vanity I account for a disproportionate number of hits to me site :P

[17:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bah, you don't exclude yourself?  Cheater!

[17:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I have no easy way to do so :)

[17:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
dynamic ip?

[17:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dynamic IP and I travel too much at the moment :)

[17:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That works.

[17:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
30% of hits to my site are from Opera, which is a bit out of the normal :)

[17:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(The hits from Opera aren't solely me, though, as there are some from versions I don't use.)

[17:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Basically I'm at 30/30/30 between Opera/Firefox/IE)

[17:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[17:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
SimplePie.org is far more interesting from a UA POV as it inevitably gets way more hits from way more people

[17:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(3000–5000 hits per day, 500–900 unique)

[17:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But that's heavily (67%) Firefox, then 19% Safari, 12% IE, 2% Opera

[17:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I require SimplePie now.  Must set it up tonight.

[17:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(once I get done working)

[17:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(IE8 is the biggest version of IE at 5%, which makes me somewhat tempted to drop support for anything older when we finally redo the site.)

[17:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Last time i looked at my company's stats, we were something like 20% ie6, 40% ie7, 10% ie8, 20% ff, and 10% assorted

[02:35:00.0000] <jacobolus>
is sendAsBinary a standard thing on XHR, and does it work anywhere except FF3+?

[02:35:01.0000] <jacobolus>
it seems like a great idea to me

[02:37:00.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk2, annevk3: maybe you know?

[02:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Non-standard, AFAIK

[02:39:00.0000] <jacobolus>
yeah, I don't see it in the standard

[02:39:01.0000] <jacobolus>
I wonder if anyone but FF implements it

[02:39:02.0000] <annevk2>
jacobolus, I think Firefox implemented some extensions

[02:39:03.0000] <annevk2>
too bad they didn't prefix them :/

[02:39:04.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk2: any idea if anyone else is interested in those?

[02:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, but not in that form

[02:40:01.0000] <annevk2>
and the "binary DOMString" concept is also not very attractive imo

[02:40:02.0000] <jacobolus>
because sendAsBinary is pretty useful; allows us to avoid doing base64 encoding or base85 encoding or similar for sending bytes to a server

[02:40:03.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk2: why not very attractive?

[02:41:00.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk2: it seems like a reasonable solution as long as we don't have any kind of real bytes type in javascript

[02:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
it seems better to fix the real issue imo

[02:43:01.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk2: in Orbited, we use this sort of "use the lower byte of each 16-bit code unit" thing for representing bytes

[02:43:02.0000] <jacobolus>
it's pretty much the only way to do it in current browsers, without browsers adding a new type

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk2>
sure, but if browsers are going to implement new features they should fix the actual issues imo and not implement stopgap measures

[02:45:01.0000] <jacobolus>
fair enough :)

[02:45:02.0000] <jacobolus>
annevk2: is there any chance that that will happen? :)

[02:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
i'd like to thinkso

[02:52:00.0000] <jacobolus>
well if someone convinces some browsers that they should support sending binary data around, that'd be awesome

[03:03:00.0000] <jacobolus>
actually, I'm pretty happy with this particular stop-gap though; it's actually a pretty big improvement over the alternative

jgraham: could you make the annotation script output the ISSUE- marker annotations in a stable order? it keeps flipflopping with each checkin.

[18:19:00.0000] <ttepasse>
If <blockquote> contains either a <header> or <footer> ??are these quoted content or the usual metainformational content about the quoted content?

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
quoted content

[18:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
everything in <blockquote> is quoted

[18:22:00.0000] <ttepasse>
Sad. I just fell in love with this construct:

[18:22:01.0000] <ttepasse>
<blockquote> <p> content <p> content <p> content <footer>cited from <cite>Foo Declaration of Bar Baz</cite></footer></blockquote>

[18:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
just use <blockquote> <p> content <p> content <p> content</blockquote><p>cited from <cite>Foo Declaration of Bar Baz</cite></p>

[18:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
or use <figure>, once <legend> is better supported in browsers

[18:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
<figure><blockquote> <p> content <p> content <p> content </blockquote><legend>cited from <cite>Foo Declaration of Bar Baz</cite></legend></figure>

[18:25:00.0000] <ttepasse>
I don't count on <legend> ;)

[18:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
not yet, indeed

[18:26:00.0000] <ray>
just don't make any web pages until 2022

[18:26:01.0000] <ttepasse>
That's my plan. I'm waiting von CSS 3 Template Layout.

[18:27:00.0000] <ttepasse>
Ok. There goes another class into my stylesheet.

I'm a newcomer so please forgive my blunders. I'm Lee Copeland of Software Quality Engineering (www.sqe.com). One of my roles there is managing technical editor for the Better Software magazine (www.BetterSoftware.com). I'm always looking for new articles and authors. I thought an article on HTML5 would be of interest to our readers. If you're interested in writing, or know someone who would, please contact me -- lee⊙sc Best to all.

[01:35:00.0000] <gavin__>
darn, hixie replied to my spec feedback message before it reached 2 years old :)

[01:56:00.0000] <gavin>
/me files https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28832 and https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513541

[05:21:00.0000] <annevk3>
maybe we should just drop support for the HTTP Link header

[05:22:00.0000] <annevk3>
it's not really that useful and the new proposal is making it vastly more complex

[05:23:00.0000] <annevk3>
way too complex to justify spending all the effort on it getting it right

[13:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: send comments

[13:31:00.0000] <annevk3>
yeah I should do that

[13:32:00.0000] <annevk3>
I've been tempted to make that comment a few times, but I'm not sure how to put it after I've already done a more constructive review

[13:33:00.0000] <annevk3>
overall I just get the feeling that the marginal benefit of the Link header is not worth all the effort, especially since there are alternatives

[13:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
personally i rather like the link header, it's the registry i'm not sure about

[13:41:00.0000] <annevk3>
the concept is sort of nice, but UI for most link values has failed pretty badly

[13:41:01.0000] <annevk3>
also for <link>

[13:42:00.0000] <annevk3>
and <link> had its decade and didn't really deliver apart from rel=alternate combined with some feed sniffing

[13:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh i wouldn't have many rel values, indeed

[13:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
but rel=stylesheet, for instance

[13:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
is useful in a Link header

[13:43:01.0000] <annevk3>
it's a nice gimmick :)

[13:43:02.0000] <annevk3>
and confuses the heck out of people too

[13:44:00.0000] <annevk3>
got quite a bit of email when I initially announced http://id.annevankesteren.nl/

[13:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh?

[13:45:01.0000] <annevk3>
i guess the other neat bit is styling text/plain resources thanks to their page load processing model

[13:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
i was just thinking that

[13:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
i've actually done that

[13:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
even applied XBL bindings to text/plain

[13:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i bet Mark didn't mention that in his security considerations section...

[13:46:01.0000] <annevk3>
yeah, but text/plain is quite close to proprietary formats

[13:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[13:47:00.0000] <annevk3>
there's no semantics for headings etc. they're quite visually oriented files usually

[13:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Proprietary ASCII art?

[13:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's no semantics, sure

[13:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's plain text

[13:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
that doesn't mean it proprietary :-)

[13:47:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's no semantics in PNG either.

[13:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or most formats anyone uses, actually.  HTML is an odd duck.

[13:50:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, fair enough; I guess my point was that I don't think it's a good exchange format

[13:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not especially great

[13:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's fine for some things.  Like, say, source code.

[13:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . well, you could serve that with the MIME type of the source code, really.

[13:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's widely used for e-mail.

[13:52:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I dunno, it works.  No need to be complicated if you don't need it.

[13:58:00.0000] <jcranmer>
 hmm

[13:58:01.0000] <jcranmer>
somehow, it seems to me that everyone except HTML users can get by without much formalized semantics

[14:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And HTML users do too, since HTML authors almost never actually write proper semantic HTML.

[14:11:00.0000] <jcranmer>
yet a lot of people seem to strongly desire semantic HTML

[14:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk3, why does http://id.annevankesteren.nl/ have two almost identical Link headers?

[14:33:00.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor, that's incorrect, modern web designers have been authoring semantic HTML for years.  It's been state of the art since early 2000s.  See archives of simplebits.com for example. And look for "semantic XHTML" as well as "semantic HTML".

[14:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, I didn't say modern web designers haven't been authoring semantic HTML for years.  But in practice, the large majority of HTML that gets served is not what I'd call semantic HTML.

[14:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Most HTML authors neither know nor care much about semantic HTML.

[14:34:02.0000] <tantek>
"almost never" is an incorrect characterization

[14:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
An overstatement, perhaps.  Substitute "most HTML authors don't actually write proper semantic HTML" if you like.

[14:35:01.0000] <tantek>
HTML is a very easy technology to get started with, thus it is expected that there's far more beginners. eventually the ones that do it more adopt semantic HTML.

[14:36:00.0000] <tantek>
and all the top books in the field cover semantic HTML

[14:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then why is http://www.google.com/ heavily presentational?

[14:36:02.0000] <tantek>
e.g. Jeffrey Zeldman's Designing with Web Standards etc.

[14:36:03.0000] <tantek>
google.com isn't heavily anything

[14:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
People who do stuff like write books or hang out in #whatwg know all about semantic HTML, and might care too.  That doesn't mean the average HTML author does.

[14:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I would say this is pretty presentational: <body bgcolor=#ffffff text=#000000 link=#0000cc vlink=#551a8b alink=#ff0000 onload="document.f.q.focus();if(document.images)new Image().src='/images/nav_logo6.png'" topmargin=3 marginheight=3>

[14:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That uses presentational attributes I never even knew existed.

[14:38:00.0000] <tantek>
and one example does not an average make ;)

[14:38:01.0000] <tantek>
google tends to be more backend focused

[14:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You said "eventually the ones that do it more adopt semantic HTML", without qualification.  Since the authors of the Google home page probably work with HTML a fair bit, I think it's a legitimate counterexample.

[14:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What I see in HTML is a tremendous amount of evangelism by standards cognoscenti, which is largely ignored by authors.  With, of course, notable exceptions, no dispute there.

[14:39:01.0000] <tantek>
Aryeh - google.com home page is an edgecase. to see how the authors at Google code (and parse) check out their work on Rich Snippets

[14:39:02.0000] <tantek>
it's all about semantic HTML

[14:39:03.0000] <tantek>
and microformats

[14:40:00.0000] <tantek>
so yes, even at Google, the state of the art is semantic HTML + microformats

[14:40:01.0000] <tantek>
and moving more and more in that direction

[14:40:02.0000] <tantek>
Google Maps supports hCards

[14:40:03.0000] <tantek>
etc. etc.

[14:40:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: Are you still a more-or-less active editor in the CSSWG?

[14:40:05.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - was less, moving towards becoming more again.

[14:40:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I'd put microformats in a different category from things like using <h1> instead of <font size=5><b>.

[14:40:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk.  Was wondering if UI was permanently orphaned.

[14:41:00.0000] <tantek>
focusing on wrapping up 1.0.1 versions of microformats specs that take into account numerous resolved issues and errata.

[14:41:01.0000] <tantek>
(which of course will obsolete all the "predefined vocabulary" stuff in HTML5)

[14:41:02.0000] <tantek>
(which should be dropped anyway from HTML5 anyway)

[14:41:03.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - nope, UI is in CR, steadily gaining implementations.

[14:41:04.0000] <tantek>
to exit CR there needs to be two interoperable implementations of every feature

[14:42:00.0000] <tantek>
CSS WG is pretty hard core about  real world interop requirements

[14:42:01.0000] <tantek>
bbiab

[14:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Cool.  Aryeh and I have been tossing things back and forth that would be covered by that module, so I wanted to make sure they had a possibility of being addressed.  ^_^

[14:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess new features aren't really likely in CR.

[14:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
s/\./?/

[14:43:01.0000] <tantek>
right - new features would go in a new version

[14:43:02.0000] <ttepasse>
Tantek, the german hobbyist/amateur-forum I frequent has a small core of semantic (X)HTML using regulars but a very high percentage of presentational HTML and obtrusive Javascript. There are days when I think table layouts have never died.

[14:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
They haven't . . .

[14:43:04.0000] <tantek>
definitely send CSS3 UI feedback and suggestions for future versions to www-style⊙wo

[14:43:05.0000] <tantek>
(and feel free to cc tantek at cs stanford edu) - it might take me a while to look at them, but I'm collecting.

[14:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've got two threads titled with [css3-ui], and may send another one soon.  As long as you're collecting, I'm happy.

[15:21:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hmm.... the W3C validator validates language tags...?

[15:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I idly wondered what it would be like for a HTML author to learn how to write HTML from the HTML 5 spec.  I recalled that I learned how to play Magic: the Gathering from the 80-page Comprehensive Rules, and wondered if something similar was possible.  I converted the spec to PDF to see how many pages it would be printed.

[15:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
867.

[15:31:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
yike

[15:31:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
s

[15:32:00.0000] <jcranmer>
PDF is 1300 pages or so

[15:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably depends on font size and so on.  I got 867 when I tried in Firefox just now.

[15:32:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
AryehGregor: What if you eliminated the DOM-related stuff and just stuck to the elements and attributes?

[15:32:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I didn't try the author version.

[15:32:04.0000] <jcranmer>
OOXML is a few thousand pages

[15:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . I've apparently reviewed 447 pages of the HTML 5 spec.  It totally doesn't feel like I've done that much work.

[15:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Well, I skipped some parts, like nearly all of <canvas>.  But still.)

[15:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
The PDF is 935 pages of A4 or 991 pages of letter. It is linked from the top of the WHATWG spec so you don't have to generate your own

[15:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, there's an official one.  How convenient.

[15:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, same ballpark.

[15:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Firefox only took five or ten minutes to generate mine.  :)

[15:40:02.0000] <jgraham>
Er, those numbers are out by a couple because I didn't reach the end of the acknowledgements

[15:40:03.0000] <jgraham>
iirc the official ones are made with prince which is actually pretty reasonable at typesetting PDFs from HTML

[15:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
traditionally not a browser strong point

[15:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Heh, I taught myself M:tG from the full rulebook too.  ^_^

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i might shrink the font on the official PDFs.

[15:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was looking at them earlier and the font is 16px, which i like for screen, but is a bit big for paper

[15:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
also maybe we should make the page number references superscripts or something

[15:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I just fixed the sort order of issue markers

[15:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[15:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
Should always be ascending numerical order now, anything else is a bug

[15:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[15:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm, trying to set up delegation for openid.  Looks like I might not be able to delegate to my google id.

[15:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk2: Just how does your id page work?


2009-08-31
[18:46:00.0000] <inlogic>
Hey all

[19:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk2: Never mind, got mine working anyway.  I'd still be interested in the details, though.

[19:28:00.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - re: collecting for [css3-ui] - even better is if you maintain a wiki page of all your proposals. When it comes time to go through them, wading through www-style will take a while.

[19:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: Do you prefer any particular location?  I could also just wait for you to come active again - I'm an Invited Expert now, so I'll probably see you in the telecon.

[19:44:01.0000] <tantek>
oh congrats!

[19:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
^_^

[19:45:00.0000] <tantek>
(in CSS WG I presume)

[19:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[19:45:02.0000] <tantek>
I think fantasai starated a wiki for the working group a few years ago

[19:45:03.0000] <tantek>
that would be a great place for it

[19:45:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, over there.

[19:45:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure.

[20:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like U+23CE and U+231B are missing from the fonts we're using to print the pdf versions of the spec

[11:45:00.0000] <annevk2>
gotto love how http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/UniversalCharsetDetection.html has incorrect characters

[12:50:00.0000] <markhuot>
Hey there ladies and gents. Does anyone have a minute to talk about HTML5?!

[12:51:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I always do.

[12:51:01.0000] <markhuot>
Hey Jonathan!

[12:52:00.0000] <markhuot>
I've been keeping busy reading up on the semantic uses of the FOOTER element, but was hoping someone could educate me on WHY there's a footer element.

[12:52:01.0000] <markhuot>
I can't come up with the benefit of a FOOTER over just a plain ol' DIV.

[12:56:00.0000] <Kalms>
Well, I suppose its intention is to aide in a better semantic overview of the structure. 

[12:56:01.0000] <Kalms>
Sorry for breaking in ;)

[12:56:02.0000] <markhuot>
No worries Kalms. Thanks for the reply!

[12:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
<footer> is supposed to be something like metadata about its parent section.

[12:56:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
But, eh, I dunno.

[12:57:00.0000] <markhuot>
I think my confusion is that we're walking a very gray line here and if we have a FOOTER element, then why not a SIDEBAR or VCARD element

[12:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That *is* how footers work on things like articles, but the standard use of a footer element for an entire page is different.

[12:58:01.0000] <tantek>
markhuot - no need for a VCARD element, that's solved by hCard, which works better independent of any specific element (there are people/organizations mentioned everywhere in pages, not just in a footer)

[12:58:02.0000] <tantek>
http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard

[12:59:00.0000] <markhuot>
tantek, I think that's my confusion then. Why is a hCard used for vcard type stuff but a, let's say, hFooter, isn't good?

[12:59:01.0000] <tantek>
because footers are more structural than semantic

[13:00:00.0000] <tantek>
whereas hCards (people, organizations) are more semantic than structural

[13:00:01.0000] <markhuot>
Hum, I think I'm starting to understand…

[13:00:02.0000] <tantek>
semantic = data sharing

[13:00:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I sorta like adactio's suggestion of naming it <contentinfo> better.  It's clear, it won't get misused as a site footer, and it then maps transparently to the ARIA role.

[13:01:00.0000] <tantek>
markhuot - feel free to join #microformats for more on hCard, microformats, semantics, data sharing

[13:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you've got a "fat footer" with nav and info and such in it, could that be reasonably marked up as a <header>?

[13:01:02.0000] <takkaria>
tantek: no-one will use it, though

[13:01:03.0000] <takkaria>
u

[13:01:04.0000] <takkaria>
TabAtkins* even

[13:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: Is anyone going to use <footer> for the intended purpose?

[13:02:01.0000] <takkaria>
I imagine people will just slot it in instead of <div id="footeR">

[13:02:02.0000] <tantek>
the intended purpose should reflect the emergent usage of "footer" class name and id from the markup study

[13:03:00.0000] <tantek>
rather than prescribing an a priori purpose

[13:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: Exactly.  Which isn't what <footer> is currently specced to be used for.

[13:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm really glad Zeldman & co had that meeting of theirs.  ^_^

[13:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
markhuot: There's <aside> for sidebars

[13:04:01.0000] <Kalms>
Isn't there a lot of confusing regarding the footer element right now?

[13:04:02.0000] <Kalms>
Seems so.

[13:04:03.0000] <markhuot>
Tantek, I think I'm still struggling with how a FOOTER element is helpful when you have no idea what's in the FOOTER.

[13:05:00.0000] <tantek>
markhuot - the FOOTER element isn't for everyone

[13:05:01.0000] <markhuot>
philip: technically `aside` is for related content, not the full blown out sidebar that I'm envisioning…

[13:05:02.0000] <tantek>
however, quite a few have found utility in class="footer" or id="footer" and thus the same utility would be found in an element <footer>

[13:05:03.0000] <tantek>
what utility is, requires more in depth research of the markup study data

[13:06:00.0000] <tantek>
what *that* utility is

[13:06:01.0000] <markhuot>
tantek, (thanks so much, it's great to talk this through) well then who is it for? I guess that's the trouble for me. When would I use it programatically. Google can't parse it without knowing what's in it. A screen reader couldn't really do anything different with it…

[13:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: a full sidebar should be either a <section>, if it's relevant to the document, or more likely just a <div>.

[13:06:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: I think the basic problem is that the people who use #footer and the people who use .footer are meaning different things.

[13:07:00.0000] <tantek>
markhuot - start taking a look at examples in the wild on the web of authors publishing class="footer" and id="footer" and perhaps some utility will emerge. it is difficult to discuss utility in the abstract, rarely does utility in the abstract exist.

[13:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I believe .footer is probably roughly what <footer> is.

[13:07:02.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins that may be a problem yes

[13:07:03.0000] <tantek>
I would hypothesize that id="footer" is simply people meaning *the* footer of *the* <body>

[13:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But #footer is way more common (or .footer used as #footer, since a surprising amount of people do CSS with *only* classes), and these days that includes content that's not allowed in <footer>.

[13:08:01.0000] <Kalms>
Isn't it kinda dangerous to name something "aside" there by implying it's use, in for example, a full blown sidebar?

[13:08:02.0000] <tantek>
whereas class="footer" people are using to mean *a* footer, maybe for the <body>, maybe for a main <section>, maybe for a sidebar

[13:08:03.0000] <tantek>
/me dislikes <aside> and wouldn't mind seeing it dropped. Same with <article>.

[13:08:04.0000] <Kalms>
I mean, if that's not its intended use

[13:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Kalms: Yeah, maybe.  I get what <aside> is for now, but I totally tried to use it for a sidebar at first.

[13:09:01.0000] <Kalms>
I think a lot of people did. Myself included

[13:10:00.0000] <markhuot>
tantek: thanks again, doesn't it seem like we're just muddying the waters though adding in FOOTER elements? I would think if FOOTER is in and HEADER is in then we would also need things like SEARCH (a quite common class name)

[13:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And, I mean, the proper usage of <aside> is pretty cool.  I'll be using it.  I personally think it's nice to be able to say "Here's some stuff that I'm just shoving into the middle of this page.  It's not directly relevant, but just sorta related."

[13:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: <input type=search>?

[13:12:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: but what about the containing element and the related form fields? Just like HEADER has many child elements, I would think SEARCH would too. And this isn't to say I'm in favor of a SEARCH element. It is to say that I'm worried that adding elements like HEADER and FOOTER is getting to be a bit much.

[13:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Couldn't an AT just find <input type=search>, and then assume that the containing section is relevant to it?

[13:13:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: not necessarily, what if the containing element is a P, inside a FORM, inside a DIV and the DIV is what actually defines the search experience.

[13:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
A <search> element would be defined as just "a section for putting search forms in".  That sort of thing can be done better implicitly.  <header> can't always be, nor can <footer> (however you slice the semantics of it).

[13:14:00.0000] <tantek>
markhuot - at some point you need to draw the line yes. It is my impression that that's what Hixie did with the markup study data. He used some of the top results as justification for considering new elements with what were presumed to be shared structure and/or semantics, and then did so.

[13:14:01.0000] <takkaria>
I think it certainyl simplifies markup and styling to have footer/header elements, which is what they were made for

[13:14:02.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins reasoning is good as well.

[13:14:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: There are limitations, sure.  If the author's using <section> decently, though, it would probably work fine.

[13:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Even the implicit sectioning algorithm would be good here - if you've got a complex search form, you generally have a header on it as well.

[13:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
You only omit the header, imxp, when you're being compact about things, and then you only have a simple <form><input type=search><input type=submit></form>.

[13:16:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: Ah, now we're talking. Thinking implicitly and explicitly helped a bit. I can see the difference a bit better now.

[13:18:00.0000] <markhuot>
Although I still worry that a HEADER without any clarity around what it contains won't be much more useful than a DIV with a class of HEADER.

[13:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
My own review: I think <header>, <section>, and <article> are good.  I think <aside> and <footer> fill a useful niche, but will be misused because of their name.

[13:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Well, you can at least tell that there *is* a header there.  That's usually stuff you can skip.  Possibly good for ATs.

[13:19:01.0000] <takkaria>
I intend to misuse <footer> happily. :)

[13:19:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: The only reason I haven't misused it yet is because the sites I've been using html5 elements on haven't needed a footer.  ^_^

[13:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, seriously: fat footer - is <header> appropriate?

[13:20:01.0000] <takkaria>
unless we're redefining the meaning of english words, no

[13:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
"A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like."

[13:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
"The header element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids."

[13:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
If I'm putting my nav at the bottom of my screen, that's a footer.  But it sounds like it should be using <header>.

[13:22:00.0000] <takkaria>
I think they count as links to related documents and can safely go in <footer>

[13:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
No dice.  I can't drop sectioning content into it.  No <nav>, no <h1> titling my groups of links, etc.

[13:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can't put my blogroll down there if I want to put a title on it.

[13:23:02.0000] <takkaria>
that's true

[13:23:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which means that <footer> ain't no good for being my footer.

[13:24:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, <footer> needs to be redefined then, I think

[13:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's what I'm saying.  ^_^

[13:24:02.0000] <takkaria>
:)

[13:24:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And what a goodly bunch of other people are saying too.

[13:24:04.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: that makes sense, ATs can skip that content on subsequent page loads, if requested, I guess…

[13:24:05.0000] <takkaria>
I've done a bad job of paying attention to the whole debate, really, but unintuitive language features help no-one

[13:24:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Problem, though: if <footer> allows the same content as <header>, then we're basically just repeating the element except saying that one goes at the top of the screen and one at the bottom.

[13:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: Nod.

[13:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Yeah, that's a theoretical benefit.  I like it just because I can scroll down and see the </header> telling me that I'm entering the content section of my page.  ^_^

[13:26:01.0000] <takkaria>
TabAtkins: well, even if they have the same content models, that doesn't mean the conformance criteria are the same

[13:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: Elaborate?

[13:26:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: brb, need to hit Sonic now so I can get back in time for work.

[13:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You in +1 time, takkaria?

[13:27:01.0000] <takkaria>
I'm UTC+2 atm

[13:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, right.  kk, then it's late your place.

[13:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, hope you're still around in 20min or so.  ^_^

[13:28:02.0000] <takkaria>
TabAtkins: I think you can keep the current verbal definitions ("represents a group of xxx" "typically contains information about...") and change the content models to allow the same content

[13:35:00.0000] <markhuot>
Hey guys, for anyone else who's around, a few more questions, if that's Ok?

[13:36:00.0000] <takkaria>
go for it

[13:37:00.0000] <markhuot>
So still thinking about the HEADER element… let's say I have a blog listing page, would it be correct to have a SECTION for the blog listing, a DIV for each entry, a HEADER for each title and a FOOTER for the metadata about the entry?

[13:39:00.0000] <takkaria>
<article> for each entry, I'd have thought

[13:39:01.0000] <markhuot>
takkaria: sorry, that's probably better. yes.

[13:41:00.0000] <markhuot>
takkaria: a followup: let's say the design calls for the the metadata to be right below the title, would it be Ok to have the ARTICLE set up as follows: HEADER, FOOTER, P.excerpt?

[13:41:01.0000] <takkaria>
I believe so, there's no requirement for the footer to be at the end

[13:42:00.0000] <markhuot>
takkaria: Ok, I wasn't expecting that. If that's the case then awesome!

[13:43:00.0000] <markhuot>
takkaria: and in the HEADER, would I have a H2 for the title and an H3 for the subhead?

[13:43:01.0000] <tantek>
markhuot  - exactly "wasn't expecting that" - you just captured what is perhaps the biggest problem with the <footer> definition right now

[13:43:02.0000] <tantek>
for more on this, see: http://adactio.com/journal/1604/

[13:43:03.0000] <markhuot>
:)

[13:43:04.0000] <markhuot>
tantek: yup, just read it.

[13:46:00.0000] <markhuot>
tantek: thanks again for helping my wrap my head around some of this.

[13:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: I agree.  >_<  <footer> just carries too much visual connotations with it.

[13:46:02.0000] <tantek>
np markhuot - there's definitely some non-trivial things in some of the new elements

[13:47:00.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - which is why I think class="footer" and id="footer" is used more structurally than semantically, based on the limited samples  / HTML view sources I've looked at

[13:48:00.0000] <tantek>
footer != metadata IMHO

[13:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: I'd probably agree with you.

[13:48:02.0000] <tantek>
metadata may be in the footer, or anywhere else

[13:48:03.0000] <markhuot>
tantek: hum, so metadata could go in a footer, but so could a whole lot of other things?

[13:48:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
So now we want a <metadata> element instead?  ^_^

[13:48:05.0000] <tantek>
actually, it's kind of silly to say where metadata should   or does go.

[13:48:06.0000] <tantek>
LOL

[13:48:07.0000] <tantek>
perhaps the problem is thinking about such data as "meta" in the first place

[13:49:00.0000] <takkaria>
<meta> would be fine with me

[13:49:01.0000] <tantek>
it's not meta in most cases, it's just data

[13:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That would mean changing the <meta> to a non-empty element, takkaria.

[13:49:03.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: that's my issue though, when do you stop defining elements?

[13:49:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF WORDS.

[13:50:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: seriously?

[13:50:01.0000] <hober>
for more about <footer>'s content model, see the conversation beginning at http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090716#l-1155 and continuing into the following day

[13:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
More seriously, you create new elements when data suggests that a significant number of authors are using a common semantic on their pages that can usefully be captured.  You stop when you've run out of semantics that are used widely enough.

[13:51:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: thanks, that's much more clear.

[13:51:01.0000] <takkaria>
TabAtkins: oh, yeah.  I'm not paying enough attention :)

[13:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: Don't worry, that was my first thought too.  Then I remembered that <meta> already exists.  ^_^

[13:53:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: in that respect it seems that HTML5 is simply providing meaning to what everyone is already using…

[13:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Yeah, basically.  The new elements are just the language explicitly blessing certain things.

[13:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So it's easier for machines, and for humans too.

[13:54:02.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: (this is about to get way to theoretical) is that the job of the spec?

[13:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Partly be definition, it's the job of the HTML5 spec.

[13:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because it defines that as being part of its job.

[13:56:00.0000] <Eran>
As part of an upcoming Yahoo! Developers event in NY 10/9 I will moderating a panel on Open Innovation: "Many new products and services that are only possible via the joint efforts of many individuals and corporations. The social web biggest strength is its distributed nature and the ability of individuals to share their experiences across sites. The session will look at how communities and companies collaborate to create new market

[13:56:01.0000] <Eran>
I am looking for a couple panel members from outside the valley (best from the NY metro area) to talk about their experience building products that would not be possible without collaboration with other companies and without open specifications. HTML5 has many features which enable just that. Any ideas?

[13:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, I really don't want <footer>'s content model relaxed, though.  I want to put complex stuff in my footer, but not in my <footer>.   I just want the urge to *use* <footer> to go away.

[13:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think renaming it is the best solution.

[14:00:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: I agree. I'd love to see HEADER and FOOTER go away and be replaced with a single element. But that's just me.

[14:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wonder if we could replace <footer> with <info>?  That seems reasonably self-documenting to me.

[14:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If I had no idea what the official definition of an <info> element was, I still probably wouldn't misuse it badly if it was intended for the things that <footer> is currently meant for.

[14:01:02.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: I'm wondering if that's even more ambiguous though.

[14:01:03.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: probably right.

[14:02:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: although, I'd ask if the HEADER element wasn't just another, more specific, INFO element?

[14:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's the big criteria I'm using: will it be misused by authors who don't know the official definition, and are going purely by the name + copypasta examples?

[14:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: That's possible.  But, I think, less likely.  I'm trying to articulate exactly why I think so, though.

[14:03:01.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: thanks! This has been a most enjoyable, and eyeopening, discussion.

[14:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Any time, man.

[14:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<aside> -> <rel>?  I'm not sure if this is good or not.

[14:04:01.0000] <markhuot>
So, anyway, I do think the INFO element would be a bit less prone to mis-use, but only because it's a bit more ambiguous.

[14:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You mean, because it doesn't immediately bring to mind uses that would be inappropriate?

[14:06:00.0000] <tantek>
indeed

[14:06:01.0000] <tantek>
and people could put <info> in their <footer> if that's what made sense to them

[14:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think, worst case, <info> would be used in places where <aside> should be.  And that's not that bad.

[14:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Keep <header> around, for one because virtually *every* page in the entire world has a <div> with .header, .head, .top, or similar.

[14:08:01.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins, perhaps <aside> should similarly be more structurally defined than semantic.

[14:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is, make it a sidebar?

[14:08:03.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - by the same argument, <footer> .footer

[14:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: Yeah, yeah, I know.

[14:09:01.0000] <tantek>
but IMHO aside/sidebar is already handled sufficiently well by a sub <section>

[14:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  Do you really think the average sidebar should be a section?

[14:10:01.0000] <tantek>
I think the average sidebar is *just* a section, no more.

[14:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think it's more of semanticless <div> filled with <nav>s and <sections>s.  But I may be splitting hairs too finely.

[14:10:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
You're probably right.

[14:11:00.0000] <tantek>
In fact, when I've seen MSWORD serializations of documents that are to be laid out with sidebars/asides, they are simple sub <sections> in the flow

[14:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Convincing.

[14:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The proper use of <aside> spec-wise *isn't* a sidebar in the website sense, though.

[14:11:03.0000] <tantek>
and if I'm browsing on a mobile device, I would expect to see the same (sidbars/asides as just in flow sub <section>s)

[14:11:04.0000] <tantek>
sidebars even

[14:11:05.0000] <tantek>
hah - even worse

[14:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know!

[14:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's horrible.

[14:12:02.0000] <tantek>
people will use <aside> for sidebars because it sounds like the right thing

[14:12:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[14:12:04.0000] <tantek>
this is all a repeat of the <address> mistake

[14:12:05.0000] <tantek>
(in HTML4)

[14:12:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[14:12:07.0000] <tantek>
using a common term to name an element which then does not behave as the common term would imply

[14:12:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
I misused <address> when I first started using html, for godsakes.

[14:12:09.0000] <tantek>
behave/mean etc.

[14:12:10.0000] <tantek>
bingo

[14:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And we have several anecdotes from half an hour ago or so that several of us immediately tried to misuse <aside> because of the name.

[14:14:00.0000] <tantek>
one of the most frequent FAQs in microformats as well: http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-faq#Should_I_use_ADDRESS_for_hCards

[14:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Like the current definition of <footer>, I like the current definition of <aside> and want to use it.  I just want it renamed so I don't try to use it for other things.

[14:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
"I agree that the web is a better place now than it was 20 years ago." - well, yeah, since it's only 18 years old

[14:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Man, forget you.  ^_^

[14:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: I'm not the one that used 1990 as a reference date in their email.

[14:19:00.0000] <markhuot>
Hey guys, thanks again for talking through some things with me. I'm going to step away and absorb for a while.

[14:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
No problem, markhuot.

[14:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
How about renaming footer to <about>?  I don't think it's even *possible* to misuse something named <about>.

[14:38:00.0000] <markhuot>
Well, would I use ABOUT for a speakers bio on a conference page?

[14:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, you mean like on a page listing all the talks at a conference?

[14:43:01.0000] <markhuot>
Right.

[14:43:02.0000] <markhuot>
If I had a listing of speakers and I had a heading for Speaker X, then I would assume ABOUT could be used for that person's bio…

[14:44:00.0000] <markhuot>
If that's Ok, then awesome, but I'm not sure that's the intended use of FOOTER.

[14:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, probably not.  That's the actual content of the page.

[14:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, good argument against.

[14:44:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though I want to use "meta" somewhere, the average person doesn't know what that means, so it's not good to use.

[14:45:00.0000] <markhuot>
Agreed, META is much more technical than something like FOOTER.

[14:45:01.0000] <takkaria>
<metaboutfooter>

[14:46:00.0000] <markhuot>
:)

[14:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: +1

[14:46:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
<sectioninfo>?

[14:47:00.0000] <markhuot>
If there's a SECTIONINFO then I'd argue for a SECTIONHEADER as well though. In fact those would make me much happier than HEADER and FOOTER

[14:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Here's a question: Should <footer> always refer to an <article>, or is there a good use for it to refer to a plain <section> too?

[14:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Given that <article> is just a <section> that is theoretically independent and could be viewed separately.

[14:49:00.0000] <markhuot>
The first instance I can think of refers to a blog listing page where there's several ARTICLE elements inside a SECTION. I would think you'd sometimes need a FOOTER element on each ARTICLE and on the containing SECTION.

[14:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Definitely one on the individual articles.  What would be the use on the containing <section>, though?  And would it be more appropriate to find the containing <article> (or <body>) and attach it to that?

[14:51:00.0000] <takkaria>
TabAtkins: you can use <footer> as a direct descendent of <body>, so you totally can use it outside of <article>

[14:51:01.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: looking at a specific example: http://www.zeldman.com/category/html5/ would the correct markup be an ARTICLE for each entry and a containing ARTICLE for the whole group of them?

[14:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: Yeah, but there <body> is acting as an implicit containing <article>.  By definition the <body> can be viewed as a separate page.  ^_^

[14:52:01.0000] <takkaria>
TabAtkins: hmm, ok

[14:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Yeah, I think that's appropriate.  The individual posts are certainly separate articles, but so is the listing itself.

[14:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ooh, just thought of a good metric for what should be an <article>: would it be useful if you full-screened the element?

[14:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That goes well with the metric for using <section>: Would you put a heading on the element?

[14:57:00.0000] <markhuot>
Hum, sorry TabAtkins can you explain the SECTION metric quickly?

[14:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If an element can *potentially* have a heading put on it, it should be a <section>.

[14:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If it shouldn't recieve a heading (like if it's just being used to group things for styling), then it should just be a <div>.

[15:00:00.0000] <markhuot>
Ah, Ok. Thank.s

[15:00:01.0000] <markhuot>
thanks*

[15:01:00.0000] <markhuot>
So then, by the full screen metric and the Zeldman.com example: http://www.zeldman.com/category/html5/, the entire listing of all articles would be an ARTICLE, each individual entry would be an ARTICLE, but nothing in the sidebar would be an article…

[15:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, exactly.

[15:03:01.0000] <markhuot>
Cool, that makes good sense. One place I'd see confusion would be the footer area (not the element, that's been discussed already…)

[15:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And <body> implicitly carries the same semantics, so there's no need to wrap the whole page in an <article>.

[15:04:00.0000] <markhuot>
Would each of his six cross sells need their own ARTICLE element?

[15:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
you mean the 6 things with red headings on the right?

[15:05:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: at the very bottom of the page the six images with associated blurbs. The first one is a callout to An Event Apart

[15:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's fuzzy, but I'd say no.  I wouldn't want to full-screen those.  They're definitely <section>s, though.

[15:06:00.0000] <markhuot>
Hum, so using those examples, let's say Zeldman used shorter excerpts for each blog post, would they then not be articles, and be sections?

[15:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
At what point does a collection of sand grains become a heap of sand?

[15:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And my personal answer would be yes, <section>s instead if they were just excerpts.

[15:07:02.0000] <markhuot>
Ah, ok TabAtkins. As long as you'd switch them from ARTICLEs to SECTIONs I think that makes sense then.

[15:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.  Having a clear question that you can ask yourself with real-world implications is *way* better than just circle-jerking over semantics.

[15:09:01.0000] <takkaria>
christ, there's going to be a long period where everyone writes blog articles about how the new elements should be used before it settles down and becomes part of the background, isn't there?

[15:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
takkaria: Yes.

[15:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
FWIW I believ Hixie says that a blogroll is OK in <aside>

[15:10:01.0000] <takkaria>
I'm glad I don't read blogs anymore :)

[15:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
I think he is wrong and that it should only be used for pullouts

[15:10:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think I agree with you, jgraham.  A blogroll isn't related-but-tangential content.

[15:10:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's just... *extra*.  Stuff you have on your page.

[15:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but you can argue, I guess, that the relationship between a blogroll and the overall page is the same as the relationship between some content and a pullout)

[15:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
(but it sounds quite dubious to me)

[15:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But then again, I don't know if I can come up with a good question for deciding <aside> vs <div>.

[15:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
The uses of <aside> for in-article content seem pretty straightforward to me:

[15:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
pull quotes

[15:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
something that would be labelled e.g. "Box A" in a magazine

[15:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but what rule do you use to make it *only* be used for that?

[15:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
"rule" as in "spec language formulation"? Don't know

[15:14:01.0000] <markhuot>
That's the question, because more often than not a pull quote can fit directly into the surrounding text, in which case, it's stylistic difference should be represented by a DIV…

[15:14:02.0000] <beowulf>
is the super friends thing a joke?

[15:14:03.0000] <jgraham>
markhuot: eh?

[15:14:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
beowulf: I think it's half-jokey.  ^_^

[15:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
Why has style got anything to do with <aside> v <div>?

[15:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Pull-quote in this context means *repeating* a quote that's already in an article, but styling it up special.

[15:15:02.0000] <markhuot>
Ah, sorry TabAtkins, *repeating* is certainly the difference, though, right?

[15:15:03.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Or, I think using a third-party quote

[15:15:04.0000] <beowulf>
TabAtkins: then i only half want to throw up

[15:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Yeah.  If it's a normal quote in an article, then it should certainly just be normally written up/wrapped.

[15:16:01.0000] <atwilson>
Hixie: Looking at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#concept-error-nothandled - is the implication of this section (6.5.6.5) that if someone registers an error handler for a Worker via addEventListener() that the error is always considered to be not handled?

[15:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: You mean like a commentary on the subject from a party different from the person that you're normally quoting in the article?

[15:16:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
beowulf: Is it the unicorn?

[15:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
At least I think something like the boxes on http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/8230640.stm would be fine uses of <aside>

[15:17:01.0000] <atwilson>
It explicitly says that if the value of onerror is not a Function, then it's not handled, but I'm not certain if that's meant to cover listeners with addEventListener() too.

[15:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Yeah, totally.  That fits my idea of related-but-tangential.

[15:18:01.0000] <markhuot>
Oh jgraham, the sidebar has a good use of FOOTER too, as I understand it ("The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites")

[15:18:02.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: The metric I have is "if this text were read out of order e.g. after all the rest of the content, would the article still make sense?"

[15:19:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins would the sidebar of that page be an ARTICLE? If not, then there's an example of using a FOOTER outside an ARTICLE.

[15:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgrahahm: Yeah, that'd work for me.  You have to add "or not read at all" to account for repeated quotes.

[15:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
If the answer is "yes" it probably makes sense to use <aside>

[15:19:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: That could also just be a <small>.

[15:19:04.0000] <beowulf>
TabAtkins: my nausea was rising at alarming rates until i saw the unicorn, then i was confused

[15:19:05.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway, I was going to bed some time ago

[15:19:06.0000] <jgraham>
Goodnight

[15:19:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
later

[15:20:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: then I think I see the FOOTER confusion ;-) I would have assumed that'd be a FOOTER

[15:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
beowulf: If the unicorn *lessened* your nausea, then I think you should go throw up now.  In the sense that seems to be making you nauseated, I think they're serious.

[15:20:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Man, it might be.  I'm not sure yet.  It's also possibly appropriate as both.

[15:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I sorta wanna restrict <footer>/<info> to <article> and <body>, though, which would make it clear that that bit was just a <small>.

[15:21:01.0000] <markhuot>
Hum, I think the most defined approach would be to limit it to article only. That'd prevent people from using it as a page footer like you mentioned before.

[15:23:00.0000] <beowulf>
TabAtkins: throw up or destroy with fire

[15:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Keeping it away from <body> would mean that sometimes you need a superfluous <article>, though, if you have a fairly simplistic page without a lot of UI crud surrounding.

[15:25:00.0000] <markhuot>
Yup, makes sense, but if you allow it in body then aren't you kind of double dipping your body into two roles?

[15:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, I have to say, if <header>/<footer>/<aside> aren't basically just to be used for whatever authors were using .header/.footer/.sidebar for, then I don't see the point of any of them.

[15:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I'm totally for renaming <footer> and <aside>. I agree with your point.

[15:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Explain?  What's the second role?

[15:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why even bother renaming them?  What are the use-cases?

[15:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, what are the use-cases for any of them, as compared to <div class=>?

[15:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: filling in semantics that useful common semantics - basically, metainfo about an article, and related-but-tangential stuff scattered throughout an article.

[15:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Great, but semantics per se isn't a use case as far as HTML 5 is concerned, from what I've seen.

[15:27:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That sentence didn't make a lot of sense, but I think you get what I mean.

[15:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you ignore all the new elements, sure.

[15:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Those aren't there for semantics per se.

[15:28:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But that's because that's precisely what the new elements are for.

[15:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Most of them have clearly-defined purposes.

[15:28:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Elaborate.

[15:28:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I don't need to say any more for things like <video>, <audio>, and <canvas>.  You're referring to stuff like <time> and <progress>.

[15:28:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[15:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The use-case I've seen for <time> is (IIRC) so that users can copy-paste things into address books or something.  For <progress>, well, you may recall I participated in a discussion about that, but the goal is apparently to make progress bars more accessible.

[15:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Since some types of progress bars would be invisible to screen readers and such.

[15:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.  And now the set of <header>/<section>/<mark>/etc. elements?

[15:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
<section> is supposed to be for automatic outline generation, isn't it?

[15:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
<mark> . . . I don't know, offhand.  <header> is one of the ones I'm asking about.

[15:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Partially.  We already have <h1-6> to do that with.  <section>, however, helps bless a particular way of dividing a page.

[15:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
<h1-6> can't give you a reliable outline if a section doesn't have a header, or if a section logically ends before the next header occurs (e.g., a footer begins or such).

[15:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
True.

[15:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't see how <aside> isn't appropriate for most sidebars.

[15:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would be fine for Wikipedia's infoboxes, for instance, right?

[15:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's basically the first example in the spec.

[15:34:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Probably, yeah.  But it wouldn't be appropriate for the stuff that's actually a *sidebar* on wikipedia, on the left.

[15:34:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, not quite, I guess.

[15:34:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, no.

[15:34:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I see your point.

[15:34:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would be <nav>.

[15:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But <aside> doesn't sound like I'd use it for that, to me.  It sounds like it's part of the content but tangential.

[15:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Exactly.

[15:35:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, just from the name.

[15:35:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is, in fact, the precise definition I keep espousing.  related-but-tangential.

[15:35:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd say "part of but tangential".

[15:36:00.0000] <takkaria>
you know, I thought these elements should basically go in without much debate a couple years ago.  after watching so many people debate what they should be used for, I'm starting to come to the position that some of them should be removed

[15:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But everyone keeps thinking it's for sidebars.  I just related this conversation to a friend, and he remarked that his "mind was blown" because he'd assumed it was for sidebars.

[15:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least for what I'd call an aside in English.

[15:36:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, it is, frankly, right?

[15:36:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, it's basically meant to replace class=sidebar.

[15:36:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's why it was added.

[15:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, I'm not clear on why these three (<header>/<footer>/<aside>) were added, if not to save typing.  :P

[15:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think they're cool if only because they allow you to make not-completely-trivial pages using few to no classes or ids.

[15:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Aryeh: It's meant to replace the *magazine* notion of sidebar.  Not the website notion.

[15:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I have zero classes or ids on aryeh.name.  I did have to use three spans, though.)

[15:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I never really think of stuff like Wikipedia's left column as "sidebars", I think of them as "navigation".

[15:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I guess <aside> vs. <nav> is intuitive to me.

[15:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, so that's part of the problem.

[15:42:00.0000] <markhuot>
But one thing AryehGregor said that confused me, ASIDE is _not_ meant to replace `class="sidebar"` right?

[15:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
As far as I know, the reason it was added to the spec is because someone generated a list of the top N classes used on sites in practice and said "Let's see if we can make elements for these".

[15:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's meant to replace class=sidebar, when that class is used in the magazine sense.

[15:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Same with <header> and <footer>

[15:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
.

[15:43:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Where it means "related but tangential content"

[15:43:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: That someone was Hixie.

[15:43:06.0000] <markhuot>
But, going back, again, to the Zeldman.com example, it wouldn't be used for his right column, right?

[15:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Correct.  It shouldn't be used for that.

[15:44:01.0000] <markhuot>
The URL to reference: http://www.zeldman.com/category/html5/

[15:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The BBC article that jgraham linked to shows good use of the <aside> semantic.

[15:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, that would use <nav>.

[15:44:04.0000] <markhuot>
So to me that would have a `class="sidebar"` and this is one instance where ASIDE would not replace it.

[15:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, no, theoretically.  But <nav> could be used here.

[15:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you have an element you can use anyway.

[15:45:02.0000] <markhuot>
AryehGregor: the entire right column? Including the ads and speaking engagements?

[15:45:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Right.  Sort of like how class=footer describes two fairly different things - a structural meaning, and a semantic meaning.

[15:45:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Er, maybe not.

[15:45:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[15:45:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
class=sidebar is both structural and semantic, and the two meanings are *often* connected on a single element, but often not.

[15:46:00.0000] <markhuot>
AryehGregor: I could see the here, there and elsewhere being three separate NAV elements, but not the entire column.

[15:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would be more like "not part of the content at all".  Maybe we need something like <interface>.

[15:47:00.0000] <markhuot>
And this is, to put it way too frankly, why I think the HTML5 spec is so confusing, there's far too many elements, available that have somewhat overlapping definitions.

[15:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
To mark "this is just part of the UI, move along"?  Currently that's just what <div> is for.

[15:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, no, <div> is for anything.  It can be used in content too.

[15:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
markhuot, the new semantic elements are a tiny fraction of the spec.

[15:49:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Each one takes what, a couple of paragraphs?

[15:49:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, that goes against Hixie's statement that the useful content of the page (the stuff that screenreaders want to skip to) is "anything that's not <header>, <footer>, <nav>, or <aside>".

[15:51:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: that makes sense to me and is a good example, but instead of adding HEADER, FOOTER, NAV and ASIDE elements, wouldn't it be easier to add a CONTENT element and leave everything else as DIVs?

[15:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Namely <article>?

[15:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: That's exactly the argument people are using.  ^_^  AryegGregor, that's exactly the argument *I'm* using.

[15:52:01.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtikins: I hear you and feel your pain.

[15:59:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: I think you're on the right track though. Most of my confusion and stubbornness is related to my own inability to understand concretely where I would use an ASIDE, HEADER, etc… 

[15:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that's the problem for a lot of people.  I'm planning to start a thread tonight about it, and the Superfriends are apparently going to send some too.

[16:00:00.0000] <markhuot>
That'll be helpful. One of the most helpful things for me today, was hearing your metrics for determining an element, that grounded things for me a bit.

[16:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I'm going to see if I can come up with something similar for <aside>, along with a better name.

[16:02:01.0000] <markhuot>
That'd be great TabAtkins.

[16:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
<header> is just what it sounds like, really - stuff you want to put in a page/section header rather than in the main content.  It's a structural element with relatively weak semantics.

[16:02:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
It just means that ATs might want to skip it, is all.

[16:03:00.0000] <markhuot>
Yup, that makes sense to me, and is nice because there's a real world example of the benefits of using it.

[16:03:01.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - and all that reasoning applies to <footer> as well (or should).

[16:03:02.0000] <markhuot>
FOOTER, should have the same benefits too…

[16:04:00.0000] <markhuot>
:) tantek, exactly.

[16:04:01.0000] <tantek>
:)

[16:04:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: Agreed now.  We should have a <footer> that is identical in nature to <header>.

[16:04:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And the current <footer> semantics should be given to a new element.

[16:04:04.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - I'm unsure of the need / utility of having the current <footer> info/meta semantics being given to a new element.

[16:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: I think "article metainfo" is likely commonly put in a classed div for positioning/styling.  I believe it's a common semantic, and thus at least a candidate for elementhood.

[16:07:00.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins, I'd just wonder if that "meta" stuff couldn't also go in the HEADER element. Since ATs are already skipping it (in theory), no since muddying up your source with more elements.

[16:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: but it can just as reasonably be put in the <footer>.  And in fact often is, which is why it's currently named <footer>.

[16:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
One could argue that it doesn't *need* an element, but I don't think it belongs to an *existing* element.

[16:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's just a question of if the semantic is common enough to bless.

[16:08:01.0000] <markhuot>
TabAtkins: right, but I don't think we've come up with any semantic differences between the HEADER and FOOTER other than their placement. And if that's the case couldn't they then both be the same element?

[16:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Semantically, yeah.  But in practice people don't use the same class for both.  They differentiate between <div class=header> and <div class=footer>, so if we're blessing things, we should do that too.

[16:09:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The whole point is to make things unsurprising.

[16:09:02.0000] <tantek>
principle of least surprise

[16:09:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yah.

[16:09:04.0000] <tantek>
AKA JonathanMalek - it might be better to consider defining a news item which is a special kind of hAtom entry

[16:10:00.0000] <tantek>
oops copy/paste bug - sorry

[16:10:01.0000] <tantek>
make that:

[16:10:02.0000] <tantek>
AKA http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment

[16:10:03.0000] <tantek>
(that other text was meant for / already pasted into #microformats - apologies for the noise)

[16:10:04.0000] <markhuot>
Hum, so let me ask you a question then TabAtkins. Why do people use .header and .footer?

[16:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Perfect reference, tantek.  That's why <footer>, if it exists, should just be a structural element meaning "stuff you put at the bottom of a section".

[16:11:01.0000] <tantek>
 yes!

[16:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: To separate out "stuff I put at the top/bottom of a section" from "the contents of the section".

[16:11:03.0000] <tantek>
and that's perfectly sufficient for most web devs/designers to go oh yeah, I do that already with class="footer", ok cool.

[16:11:04.0000] <markhuot>
Ah, I think I see now TabAtkins. So then there really isn't any difference between the two other than the placement.

[16:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: If they're both going to exist (and I think it has to be both or neither, really), then yeah, placement is the only difference.

[16:12:01.0000] <tantek>
and that placement is *structural*, not necessarily presentational - there is a (fine but) important difference

[16:12:02.0000] <markhuot>
So then, that goes back to a much earlier point that they should probably both have the same rules applied (re: what's allows within)

[16:12:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: Can you elaborate?  I don't understand the distinction enough to repeat it elsewhere.

[16:12:04.0000] <tantek>
really this is not so different from <thead> <tfoot>

[16:12:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
markhuot: Yes.

[16:12:06.0000] <alkarin>
greetings everybody, I hope I'll be around fr'now on  *and god - this is real internet relay chat

[16:12:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: Yes.

[16:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yo, alkarin.

[16:13:01.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - consider the structure as the document tree, where as the presentation *may* reflect the document tree, it may also be very different on different devices and modalities

[16:13:02.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins and re tbody tfoot, note that there *is* a tbody

[16:13:03.0000] <tantek>
as well

[16:14:00.0000] <markhuot>
tantek: I think the difference though is that THEAD and TFOOT are clearly defined to relate to a TABLE (and tabular data). HEADER and FOOTER are a bit more vague and can go in just about anything (unless TabAtkins has his way ;-))

[16:14:01.0000] <tantek>
we can learn many things from the structural (and semantic) elements of tables

[16:14:02.0000] <hober>
IIRC <thead> : <table> :: <header> : any sectioning element

[16:14:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm...  I guess it's sort of like the distinction between <i> and <span style="font-style:italic">.  The former doesn't carry *specific* information, just that the stuff contained within is typically italicized for *some* reason.

[16:15:00.0000] <tantek>
/me wonders if <shead> <sbody> <sfoot> would have been better, but leave that particular *shed painting problem to someone else. ;)

[16:15:01.0000] <hober>
heh

[16:15:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
hober: agreed.  which is why <footer> should map to <tfoot>, as tantek says.

[16:15:03.0000] <alkarin>
did we have to tell the machines that we're actually defining "sub-sections" inside the body, called HEADER and FOOTER?

[16:15:04.0000] <markhuot>
tantek: I like it though. TabAtkins raised this earlier and I think it makes sense.

[16:16:00.0000] <tantek>
BTW - having thought about this longer that I really wish I had, there is another very useful feature of structural tables that could use promotion to general use

[16:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
alkarin: it's not that we *have* to, it's that we *do* already with class=header and footer.

[16:16:02.0000] <tantek>
the "headers" attribute

[16:16:03.0000] <markhuot>
Alright, well it's quittin' time over here in the EDT, so I'm going to call it a day. Thanks again everyone, it's been great. I'll hop back in later tonight or tomorrow to follow along.

[16:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
alkarin: And we do it *so* frequently that having it blessed can be a good thing.

[16:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
later, markhuot.

[16:17:02.0000] <tantek>
all the benefits it provides for table cells (semantics, accessibility) would also work for any other element which implicitly (perhaps through presentational coincidence) includes semantics/heading context from other elements in the document.

[16:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: Is that really something that happens in the real world, though?  Tables are complex structures, and sometimes it *isn't* obvious just what's supposed to refer to what, especially when you have multiple levels of heading cells.

[16:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I don't know that I've ever really seen ordinary text that was moved away from the section it corresponds to for presentational reasons, except maybe to fake columns.

[16:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And we can do columns correctly now.

[16:20:00.0000] <alkarin>
let me put it in this way; did "we" - the html authors, proposal makers, researchers developers etc ..  have to define new SUB-SECTIONS to BODY element where we had none, ust like we had or we were offered sub divisions called THEAD and TBODY for the TABLE element, nonetheless we had our own ways passing around it, again matching all the semantical criteria

[16:20:01.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - it happens even *more* often outside of tables, because at least with tables you can imply columns/rows to determine some amount of context (as long as you can *see* them)

[16:20:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: I'd need to see an example.

[16:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
alkarin: I can't parse what question you're actually asking.

[16:21:01.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins in many ways it is the *inverse* of what is proposed for the "subject" attribute

[16:21:02.0000] <tantek>
"subject" says this element applies to this other element over here.

[16:22:00.0000] <tantek>
"headers" says these other elements apply to this element right here.

[16:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
You talking about the microdata @subject?

[16:23:00.0000] <tantek>
and "headers" both works well today conceptually (in HTML4.01), and reflects the more natural way to do content/link inclusion (e.g. documents link to their stylesheets, not vice versa)

[16:24:00.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins AFAIK there is no other "subject" in HTML5. So per-current spec yes, but conceptually, much more broadly.  "headers" has good accessibility benefits that could be spread to other elements. "subject" as currently defined is scoped just to microdata.

[16:24:01.0000] <tantek>
put another way, "subject" is to "rev", what "headers" is to "rel"

[16:25:00.0000] <tantek>
"headers" is a space separated list of IDREFs. more http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#adef-headers

[16:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I know @headers.  So you'd use this on <section>s placed elsewhere in the document, to point them to headings that should apply to them?

[16:26:00.0000] <alkarin>
/me nods affirmative.

[16:30:00.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - I'd like to see @headers available on *any* element to note what headings/semantics/context may apply to them.

[16:31:00.0000] <tantek>
for example a page of blog posts

[16:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
What heading would the posts refer to?

[16:31:02.0000] <tantek>
commonly lists the date only *once* for all the posts for that day

[16:31:03.0000] <tantek>
but then includes the time for each post in particular

[16:31:04.0000] <tantek>
(lots of examples, e.g. tumblr)

[16:31:05.0000] <tantek>
those individual <time> elements have to currently duplicate the date information in invisible metadata

[16:32:00.0000] <tantek>
much better if they could instead say headers="d123" pointing to the date element that has the date for the time.

[16:32:01.0000] <tantek>
the inverse, using subject on the date element to point to the time elements is both more counterintuitive (ala rev), and fragile (meta is further from the data per Ruby's Postulate)

[16:32:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Any particular reason the date can't just be expressed in the header for the listing, and thus automatically apply to the posts in the outline?

[16:34:00.0000] <alkarin>
/me name kunter ilalan

[16:34:01.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - in many cases some amount of implied hierarchicial context can solve this yes

[16:34:02.0000] <tantek>
similarly to how the implied row/column context can solve this

[16:34:03.0000] <alkarin>
good .. I call this "rust" :p

[16:35:00.0000] <tantek>
but also similarly, headers *does* help in some cases in tables, and I think it would for the same kinds of cases *outside* of tables as well

[16:35:01.0000] <Binarytales>
TabAtkins - I was about to ask the very same question

[16:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek: I'm not arguing that it could be theoretically useful.  I'm saying that I don't know that I've ever seen content where it would be useful, and thus question its *practical* usefulness.  If such content doesn't really exist in the wild, I don't want to cater to it.

[16:36:01.0000] <tantek>
basically, we've had tons of experience in the microformats community with this need for explicit content inclusion, and built the include-pattern for it, and in doing so very much felt like this needed to be a built-in language feature. http://microformats.org/wiki/include-pattern

[16:36:02.0000] <tantek>
and in fact we make use of the "headers" attribute on table cells to solve this for hCalendar

[16:37:00.0000] <tantek>
tables of events

[16:37:01.0000] <tantek>
http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar-brainstorming#Tabular_event_calendars

[16:37:02.0000] <alkarin>
tantek: if we are to follow that fashion inside BODY like we did inside TABLE, as you have suggested, then one day won't we be dealing with similar kinds of cases "outside" of the HTML ... like, TARGET of this document, CLASSIFY your purpose

[16:37:03.0000] <tantek>
and using the "headers" attribute in this fashion is *much* cleaner from a markup perspective (and easier/simpler to author) than the include-pattern.

[16:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, I've used hresume, and specifically used the <object> include pattern.  I'm not sure how that would work with @headers, though.

[16:38:01.0000] <tantek>
basically a use of "headers" *attribute* on your hCards in your job experience would replace a whole awkward <object> element workaround :)

[16:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What would you point the @headers at in that circumstance, though?

[16:39:01.0000] <tantek>
the same thing your object data points to!

[16:39:02.0000] <tantek>
that's the beauty, the structure is identical but simpler

[16:39:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's not a header, though, that's an entire section.

[16:40:00.0000] <tantek>
right, it's an entire "chunk" of content

[16:40:01.0000] <tantek>
so perhaps the name "headers" is not the best for this purpose. however it is already in use for exactly this semantic in tables, thus would make sense to re-use

[16:40:02.0000] <tantek>
as opposed to introducing a new attribute like "includes"

[16:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What part of the hresume would have the @headers, though?

[16:41:01.0000] <tantek>
(which would be fine too, however I think the principles of re-use and least vocabulary provide more benefit than creating a new name)

[16:41:02.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins the hCards for your title/org/etc. in your job experience

[16:42:00.0000] <tantek>
right before where you currently put your <object data> includes

[16:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm.  Currently I'm putting them as the first element of the .htitle inside my .hcard.

[16:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(This reminds me; I need to update my resume.)

[16:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't think I fully understand the semantic intended by pointing @headers at chunks of non-heading content.

[16:47:00.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - right, so you could take whatever element you have class="vcard" on in your job experience and add headers="idref" where idref is the same thing that you have in your <object data="#idref"> now.

[16:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But that then just means "treat the element I'm pointing to like it was one of my children".  That's not the same semantic as table @headers, is it?

[16:48:01.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - it effectively is

[16:49:00.0000] <tantek>
structurally it's the same and thus the same semantics can be applied

[16:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm, okay.  I suppose I can see that.

[16:49:02.0000] <tantek>
like I said, the "headers" attribute may itself be poorly named

[16:49:03.0000] <tantek>
another instance of the <address> problem

[16:49:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
You'd want something like @include

[16:49:05.0000] <tantek>
because if you look at what ATs can (and) do with the headers attribute, they *do* treat it structurally and semantically like an include

[16:49:06.0000] <Binarytales>
I always though of it more as "this element already told you some information that also relevant here"

[16:50:00.0000] <tantek>
Binarytales - precisely correct

[16:50:01.0000] <tantek>
and yes that is what "headers" does

[16:51:00.0000] <Binarytales>
"headers" is a poor name for it. authors might assume that in the information needs to come before where it is including which isn't true

[16:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
One nice thing about attributes is that you don't really have to worry about parsing constraints.  All attributes parse equally, and so minting a new one isn't bad unless it's already in wide use meaning something different.

[16:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(One of the best things about data-* is that it namespaces private data, preventing such collisions.)

[16:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
dude, maciej, you need to go to bed.  ^_^

[16:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or, wait, you Apple or Opera?

[16:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: wait, what?

[16:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it's 4 PM in my time zone

[16:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
k.  Sorry, that you were one of the Opera folk.

[16:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
"strange name" translates mentally to "norwegian" for me in this room.

[16:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
dude

[16:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I was all in the news with a specific mention of Apple recently

[16:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well, on Ars Technica anyway

[16:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't pay any attention to Ars Technica.

[16:56:04.0000] <othermaciej>
for the HTML WG co-chair thing

[16:56:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I do have a weird name though!

[16:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The name sounds more Eastern European to me.

[16:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would have more diereses and slashes through letters and stuff if it were Scandinavian, and fewer alarmingly long stretches of consonants.

[16:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't have enough experience to reliably distinguish.

[16:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, "Maciej Stachowiak".  Not so many stretches of consonants.

[16:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do "ch" and "w" even exist in the Scandinavian languages?
