annevk: it isn't relevant

[16:00:01.0000] <smaug___>
if I use xhtml that all just works

[16:00:02.0000] <smaug___>
in that example using <hX> was simpler

[16:00:03.0000] <annevk>
well sure

[16:00:04.0000] <annevk>
but XHTML does not work in IE

[16:01:00.0000] <annevk>
so that would be a problem

[16:01:01.0000] <annevk>
if we want to test IE

[16:01:02.0000] <smaug___>
using divs would have required id attributes or something

[16:01:03.0000] <smaug___>
that wasn't a testcase

[16:01:04.0000] <smaug___>
but just an example

[16:01:05.0000] <smaug___>
even trivial one

[16:01:06.0000] <annevk>
anyways, it seems like someone needs to define hit testing

[16:01:07.0000] <smaug___>
maybe

[16:02:00.0000] <smaug___>
though, if IE really behaves like that with mouseenter/leave

[16:02:01.0000] <smaug___>
I think those should be just dropped

[16:02:02.0000] <smaug___>
those aren't that useful

[16:02:03.0000] <annevk>
are you sure?

[16:02:04.0000] <smaug___>
well, you can emulate them using scripts

[16:02:05.0000] <annevk>
lots of developers want those events

[16:02:06.0000] <smaug___>
and mouseover/out

[16:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I would wager that a majority of all uses of mouseover/out really wants mouseenter/leave

[16:04:00.0000] <annevk>
e.g. a simple search gives http://blog.stchur.com/2007/03/15/mouseenter-and-mouseleave-events-for-firefox-and-other-non-ie-browsers/

[16:24:02.0000] <annevk>
nn

[17:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip, your microdata tool is awesome

[17:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've added it to my list of consoles on http://damowmow.com/portal/ (top right)

[17:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, new version of Requiem is out. It aparently fixes the 4GiB file size limit.

[17:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[17:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
(there was a 4GB file size limit?)

[17:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's taking me a while to download it from Tor - it's a really slow connection today - and I couldn't find it on any torrent sites yet.

[17:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[17:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
there was a limit, but since only a few of the HD movies available from iTunes are over 4GB, it probably hasn't affected you

[17:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
it hasn't affected me either, since being outside the US, there is no HD content available

[17:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[17:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
how weird

[17:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
and the Australian iTunes store (which my account is for) is unlikely to bother with HD content while our internet continues to be over priced and capped with extremely low usage caps

[17:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
don't they have an itunes datacenter?

[17:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, they do. But our ISPs count your data usage, and downloading 2GB HD TV shows frequently will send most users over their 10GB to 20GB monthly limit quite quickly. (Plans with more than that are way over priced)

[17:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
and so unless Apple does some deals with Australian ISPs to make iTunes content be unmetered, the market for HD content will be very small

[17:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
so basically unless you lose your net neutrality, you're screwed?

[17:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
what is it with english-speaking countries and being stupid

[17:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, basically. Although, to some extent, some Aussie ISPs have gone against net neutrality, and have in the past, included some major download sites (like tucows and cnet downloads) as part of the unmetered freezone.

[17:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
Telstra includes its own BigPond network in their free zone too

[17:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, maybe non-English-speaking countries are also stupid, but you don't notice it as much because it's in a foreign language?

[17:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
I've heard claims that the reason for the over priced, capped internet is because the cost of sending data across the Pacific ocean is expensive.

[17:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Bandwidth caps make more sense than "unlimited" plans where you get threatening calls from your ISP if you use too much bandwidth . . .

[17:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
i speak french and lived in swizterland, and also lived in norway, and i haven't seen the same kinds of stupidity as in the UK, US, and Australia.

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
but i'm sure each country has its own stupidity, certainly :-)

[17:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, there are plenty of non-English speaking countries that are stupid. LIke China, Iran (I think), and some other middle eastern countries.

[17:31:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unlimited plans don't make much market sense, they encourage tragedies of the commons like BitTorrent.

[17:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, what do you mean by tragedies of the commons?

[17:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, I mean that if it's unlimited, you won't care how much you use, so you'll be much more likely to use an unreasonably large amount, which in aggregate degrades service for everyone.

[17:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But every individual bears too little of the cost to care.

[17:32:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons

[17:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
I strongly disagree. Bandwidth caps place an unfair burdon on end users, and place wholly artificial limits on what people can and can't do.

[17:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How is it wholly artificial or unfair to pay for the resources you use?  Most resources you use are metered, like electricity.

[17:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But yeah, it's a pain, so people don't like it and ISPs try to avoid it.

[17:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which creates tragedies of the commons, but oh well.

[17:38:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
AryehGregor: different argument. Your electricity is metered, but it's probably unlimited

[17:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, someone upgraded the wiki to 1.15.1.

[17:39:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
(unlimited within capacity provision)

[17:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
GarethAdams|Home, well, yes.  Caps are just a coarser form of metering, though, where you have to pay in advance to upgrade to the next plan.

[17:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, should I upgrade the wiki to the latest alphas from SVN so that it's outputting HTML5 instead of XHTML1 Transitional?  :)

[17:40:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
Personally I think pre-pay vs credit is quite a fundamental difference

[17:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, bandwidth is not a limited resource in the same sense as physical resources, and bandwidth caps attempt to solve the issue the wrong way.

[17:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, it's limited every bit as much as things like electricity or water.  How would you solve it?

[17:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, it's too late for me to get into an argument, but I could set up MediaWiki 1.16alpha tonight, or not.

[17:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You gave me shell access, but I don't want to do it without at least one other person thinking it's a reasonable idea.  :)

[17:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
Bandwidth is, for the sake of simplicity, effectively a measure of how much data can be transmitted at the same time. So offering plans based on the bandwidth, or rather speed, provided to the user makes sense.

[17:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Whee, still using MySQL 4.1.  At least one user is benefiting for our support for ancient MySQL versions!

[17:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
But imposing monthly usage limits tries to treat data as a finite resource, and implies that it will somehow run out if too much is used in a month.

[17:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, what they really care about is how much you're using at peak.  If there's excess capacity, it makes no difference to them, no.  So it's a crude metric, that's true.

[17:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's not quite true, actually.

[17:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
They do pay for every bit that goes over a backbone, AFAIK.

[17:45:03.0000] <Lachy>
but that's not the case at all. If a backbone can support 1Gbps, and 50 users are connected to that, each going flat out on their ADSL2+, 20Mbps connection, they could do that all indefinitely.

[17:45:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
But anyway, are you going to answer me about upgrading the WHATWG wiki?

[17:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, but they oversell, because people don't use all their bandwidth at once.

[17:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
Although, with bandwidth caps, they would hit their artificial limit within a day

[17:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
right. But bandwidth caps do nothing to address that problem of over selling

[17:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Overselling isn't a problem, it's the only thing that makes sense.  It would be crazy to let massive bandwidth capacity lie idle because you have to reserve a fixed amount for each customer.

[17:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders why Lachy keeps on ignoring the questions about the wiki.

[17:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I missed the wiki question.

[17:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I only asked it about eight times.

[17:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
sure, do whatever you like with the wiki (as long as you don't break it).

[17:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
or if you do break it, fix it

[17:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are no hacks, are there?

[17:50:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I can overwrite the files and there will be no problems?

[17:50:04.0000] <Lachy>
no

[17:50:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
k.

[17:50:06.0000] <Lachy>
there are plugins, I believe

[17:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
can't remember which ones we have installed though

[17:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
ConfirmEdit, no problem.

[17:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, have you ever lived with an internet connection that was capped?

[17:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No.  Is that relevant?

[17:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
I was just wondering, since if you had, you might actually understand the detrimental effects that caps can have on many things, including work. I can tell you for a fact that it's no fun trying to do web development when your connection has been shaped to 64kbps for going over your monthly bandwidth limit

[18:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Did I ever say caps were fun?  I'm pretty sure I explicitly said customers don't like them.

[18:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(although, I was talking more about metering than caps)

[18:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
metering implies caps

[18:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No it doesn't.  My server's connection is metered but uncapped.

[18:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
unless you're talking about plans that charge per MB, and can get quite expensive really quickly

[18:01:02.0000] <jcranmer>
I've legitimately done about 1GiB/day

[18:01:03.0000] <jcranmer>
granted, scp'ing 100MiB files to a server is going to do that rather quickly

[18:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure, and it would be fair if you were charged more than someone who just checks their e-mail.

[18:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
if someone just wants to check their e-mail, give them a low bandwidth, but uncapped, plan. I don't mind paying extra for the extra bandwidth. But I expect to be able to make use of it, which caps don't let me do

[18:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Updating wiki, will be down for a few minutes.

[18:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Back up.

[18:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Try viewing source.  :)

[18:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyone who finds a problem should report it to me and I'll fix it.  Meanwhile, I'm going to sleep.

[18:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
<!doctype html>

[18:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr"  version="HTML+RDFa 1.0" >

[18:06:03.0000] <Lachy>
wtf?

[18:06:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, right.

[18:06:05.0000] <Lachy>
lose the version crap

[18:06:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Let me disable the RDFa.  :P

[18:06:07.0000] <Lachy>
how did RDFa shit get into mediawiki?

[18:06:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Try now.

[18:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Someone committed it.

[18:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then I said we should also allow microdata, and then I said we should allow only microdata, and a lengthy debate ensued on the mailing list.

[18:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(wikitech-l, I mean)

[18:07:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think the likely outcome is that both get disabled by default.

[18:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
you should get the RDFa removed. It's non-conforming HTML5

[18:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's conforming HTML5+RDFa!

[18:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, conformance matters less than usefulness.

[18:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The HTML5 mode means a whole truckload of non-conforming content, since we don't blacklist things like cellpadding and what have you.

[18:08:03.0000] <Lachy>
that's true. But HTML+RDFa is a completely useless spec

[18:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it also means more features, so to heck with validators.

[18:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you don't have to convince me of that.

[18:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me points out type=search in the search bar, some type=number in preferences, autofocus in lots of places, . . .

[18:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
All of which I wrote.  :P

[18:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And of course, speaking of bandwidth, look at all those saved bytes!

[18:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, now's about time to go to bed.

[18:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if Lachy would be happier with an unmetered uncapped 256Kbps connection that he could use all day every day, or with a 20Mbps one that's capped at 100GB/month for the same cost

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks at Jingle and SIP to see if either would be usable with <device> and comes out disturbed at how complicated people make their protocols

[22:25:00.0000] <NickYoung>
ping: Hixie 

[22:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey

[22:32:00.0000] <NickYoung>
hey Hixie - do you know, or know someone who knows, or know somewhere I can find out information about youtube.com/html5 ?

[22:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
what information?

[22:33:01.0000] <NickYoung>
HTTP requisites

[22:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what you mean

[22:33:03.0000] <NickYoung>
I'm getting 403 on my experimental build of webkit

[22:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
odd

[22:33:05.0000] <NickYoung>
so presumably there are requisite headers

[22:33:06.0000] <Hixie>
403 for the video file?

[22:33:07.0000] <NickYoung>
yes

[22:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
and it works for regular webkit?

[22:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
how weird

[22:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
have you dumped the two network traffic sessions and compared them?

[22:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see why there'd be anything like that

[22:34:04.0000] <NickYoung>
this is a different multimedia backend

[22:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd recommend cracking out tcpdump and comparing them

[22:35:01.0000] <NickYoung>
hmm, ok

[22:36:00.0000] <NickYoung>
my thought is it's probably either a cookie it wants, or a missing refferer header

[22:36:01.0000] <NickYoung>
my backend passes on neither at the moment

[22:37:00.0000] <NickYoung>
anyway, I just thought you might have seen some documents floating around I could consult :)

[22:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh you almost certainly need the opt-in cookie

[22:42:00.0000] <NickYoung>
yeah, unfortunately the webkit interface for media is somewhat broken in this respect. The backend is only passed a URL to the media file.

[22:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
seriously, i'd recommend using tcpdump to see what the working UA is sending

[22:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
it could be something obvious

[22:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
NickYoung: we do want to eventually fix the networking to go through WebKit's http stick - just tricky to beat both WebKit and relevant media engines into shape

[22:44:03.0000] <othermaciej>
NickYoung: I think Referer or Cookie is a likely candidate

[22:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
NickYoung: if you find the differences, one easy way to see which is making the difference could be to use curl or wget with custom headers

[22:47:00.0000] <NickYoung>
unfortunately I'm on linux atm, and HTML5 media support is in chrome (but not chromium) afaik

[22:47:01.0000] <NickYoung>
which leaves me with nothing to compare against

[22:48:00.0000] <NickYoung>
but a massive wget hack could work :P

[22:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there's no official Chrome for Linux yet?

[22:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
wait, WebKit/Gtk has video support - does that not work?

[22:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(or is that what you are working on now?)

[23:00:00.0000] <NickYoung>
I'm working on WebKit/Qt

[23:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you could check if WebKit/Gtk can handle YouTube, that might be the easiest point of reference (though of course you'd need a GStreamer module that does H.264...)

[23:01:00.0000] <NickYoung>
yeah.. I have that

[23:01:01.0000] <NickYoung>
I'll investigate :)

[23:03:00.0000] <NickYoung>
also, it looks like there is an official chrome for linux now

[23:20:00.0000] <NickYoung>
dear lord, the GTK version explicitly spoofs its user agent for movies.apple.com

[00:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
NickYoung: if you find that UA spoofing is indeed required for movies.apple.com, could you please send me the info so I can file a bug on them? mjs⊙ac

[00:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: does aria-hidden actually work in Firefox for the use case you mentioned on the list?

[00:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: does aria-hidden in Firefox cause content to be hidden from visual rendering?

[00:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: no, AFAIK

[00:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I assume not, because that would violate the ARIA spec

[00:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so I assume it does work in Firefox

[00:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: but at least at some point, it didn't really prune anything from the accessible tree, either

[00:48:04.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: that would presumably be a bug in their ARIA support...

[00:48:05.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: it depended on the author specifying *[aria-hidden="true"] { display: none; }

[00:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I'm certainly not telling authors to include that, since it subverts the intent of the ARIA spec (as far as I can tell)

[00:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I guess "the intent of the ARIA spec" is tricky thing

[00:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
my reading is that role="presentation" is supposed to skip an element (but still include its children) in the accessibility tree, and aria-hidden is supposed to hide the element *and* its children in the accessibility tree

[00:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what I've heard from the folks behind ARIA, *[aria-hidden="true"] { display: none; } in an author style sheet is very much something that is expected

[00:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: that's my understanding of the spec, too.

[00:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
having that in a UA stylesheet would definitely violate the ARIA spec

[00:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
having it in an author stylesheet does not seem like a problem per se if you definitely want to visually hide all content that's also hidden from accessibility

[00:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I said "author style sheet" intentionally. Putting it in the UA style sheet would be clearly wrong.

[00:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
however, the author should not *have* to specify that, to hide content in the accessibility tree

[00:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if the UA doesn't prune it from the accessibility tree unless the author includes "*[aria-hidden="true"] { display: none; }", that too would violate the ARIA spec (as I read it)

[00:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or at least, if the UA+AT combination still present the content in that case, then there is clearly a bug in at least one of them

[00:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I agree. Dunno what Firefox does now and what's considered a bug and what's a feature here.

[00:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but like I said, I've been advising people to use it like a recursive version of role="presentation"

[00:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(the case this has particularly come up, the content does not actually need to work in other browsers, but that doesn't seem relevant to the actual issue of use cases)

[00:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: has this been for iTunes-embedded WebKit?

[00:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
can't really talk about the specific details, but feel free to speculate

[00:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I see

[00:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and I am sure we will need something similar in the future in content that works cross-browser

[00:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
at which point I guess we will have to test in all the target browsers we care about and possibly report bugs

[01:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: aaronlev said back in 2007 that aria-hidden did nothing in firefox but display:none hid from accessibility tree

[01:06:01.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: dunno if it has changed

[01:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: in Safari on Mac with VoiceOver, it definitely hides the whole subtree from the accessibility tree

[01:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I could test in Firefox on Mac

[01:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I have n easy way to test accessibility behavior on Windows though :-/

[01:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
there's an aapi debug tool for windows

[01:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
inspect32.exe at http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=3755582a-a707-460a-bf21-1373316e13f0

[01:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
my favorite thing about voiceover is that it shows what it's speaking, so you can even test with it muted...

[01:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hmm my copy of Firefox does not seem to support VoiceOver on Mac

[01:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm running 3.5.2

[01:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
same thing with a minefiled alpha

[01:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: IIRC, Mac accessibility of Firefox got frozen, because the developers didn't get enough information out of Apple a couple of years ago

[01:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: do you know if Firefox supports accessibility at all on Mac?

[01:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I can't get VoiceOver to read anything but the title controls

[01:17:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: there at least used to be code but IIRC it has never been turned on by default

[01:17:04.0000] <othermaciej>
guess I can't test this after all

[01:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and in Chrome only the toolbar supports VoiceOver, not the content area

[01:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if anyone feels like testing on Windows, here is my test case:

[01:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
<div>First paragraph.</div>

[01:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
<div aria-hidden="true">Hidden from accessibility.</div>

[01:21:03.0000] <othermaciej>
<div>Third paragraph.</div>

[01:21:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(or on Linux)

[01:21:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Safari definitely reads the first and third paragraph, but not the second, and shows all three

[01:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: from what i can tell with inspect32.exe, firefox does not hide the paragraph from msaa

[01:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: how about IE?

[01:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
surkov: is it intentional that Firefox doesn't hide stuff from the accessible tree if aria-hidden=true?

[01:32:01.0000] <surkov>
smaug__, David Bolter tried to contact with Apple developers to get some help but no real success iirc

[01:32:02.0000] <surkov>
hsivonen: I think so, iirc this ARIA requirement

[01:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
jeez. i only got this laptop last week and i'm already nearly killing it again.

[01:32:04.0000] <surkov>
we set proper state on the accessible

[01:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
/me moves his laptop further away from the tea cup

[01:32:06.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: same as firefox

[01:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe on Windows it's the screen reader's job to hide aria-hidden stuff

[01:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(I don't actually know which of Safari or VoiceOver hides it on Mac, I tested end-to-end)

[01:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
surkov: where is the requirement in ARIA?

[01:35:00.0000] <surkov>
hsivonen: it sounds the things were changed, now ARIA impl guide sais "# has one of the WAI-ARIA  global states and properties but does not have the aria-hidden  property set to "true". Hidden elements are not exposed to assistive technology."

[01:35:01.0000] <surkov>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-implementation/

[01:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"This is not used in mapping to platform accessibility APIs. Instead, use information from the layout system to determine if the element is hidden or not. Advisory: it is incorrect use of ARIA if an element with aria-hidden="true" is visible. The aria-hidden property is exposed only so that DOM-based assistive technologies can be informed of visibility changes. However, the layout will be able to provide the most complete set of all truly hidden

[01:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
nodes."

[01:36:02.0000] <zcorpan>
(same url)

[01:36:03.0000] <zcorpan>
uh i mean https://developer.mozilla.org/En/ARIA_to_API_mapping

[01:36:04.0000] <othermaciej>
hmm, that seems to contradict what WAI-ARIA itself says

[01:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(but the other url seems to say the same thing)

[01:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: English translation: aria-hidden is only for IE7+JAWS

[01:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
"This allows http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/terms#def_at or http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/terms#def_useragent to properly skip http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/terms#def_hidden elements in the document."

[01:37:03.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for UA-specific features

[01:37:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(boy that copied oddly)

[01:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so I wonder what is the correct way to do the deep equivalent of role="presentation"

[01:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
should you just put role="presentation" on every element in the subtree? (But that still won't affect the text nodes)

[01:39:00.0000] <surkov>
hsivonen: actually it sounds aria-hidden doesn't make sense at all in the current aria impl guide edition

[01:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: maybe send feedback to public-pfwg-comments⊙wo today? today is the DL for ARIA comments.

[01:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder also why the implementor's guide apprently contradicts the spec on this

[01:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: will attempt to

[01:40:00.0000] <surkov>
hsivonen: I'll ping David Bolter about this issue since he is a member of ARIA group

[01:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
surkov: thanks

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: the correct way is "don't have presentational elements"

[01:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm posting to public-pfwg-comments but I don't necessarily expect to have a prompt reply

[01:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: we have some markup that would give bad results in a screen reader if you didn't hide part of it, but where the extra bits can't be tacked on via CSS

[01:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: sounds like a bug for css

[01:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: so maybe your answer is "redesign the UI", but that does not seem like helpful advice

[01:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is it a goal for CSS to allow generated content with arbitrarily complex internal structure and styling?

[01:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean, you can use XBL to do that

[01:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but in that case you'd still need ARIA to control how your XBL binding is presented to a screen reader

[01:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe the answer is xbl

[01:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's hard to know without examining the actual use case

[01:43:05.0000] <othermaciej>
which regrettably I am not at liberty to paste here

[01:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think we'll probably need to add something to xbl to indicate whether the accessibility apis are expected to crawl it or not

[01:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
really this should be solved by not using the same media type for screens as screen readers

[01:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
but that's another story

[01:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think you may need more control than binary "yes" or "no" over the accessibility behavior

[01:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though I suppose reading either the surface markup or the contents of the XBL binding which may internally use ARIA would cut it

[01:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but you'd still need a proper mechanism to hide parts of the XBL shadow tree from screen readers

[01:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
using a different media type would be cleaner CSS wise, but would require generating two render trees to have both visual and audio presentation at the same time

[01:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(which is the only mode VoiceOver has, so you can work with or help a blind person by looking over their shoulder)

[01:55:00.0000] <surkov>
I agree XBL markup should have a stuffs to control its accessible tree, in firefox we some basic stuffs to do this. For example, accessible for bound XBL element can provide accessible name or XBL can allow or deny accessible children in its subtree

[01:56:00.0000] <surkov>
ideally I think XBL should special markup to control all this stuffs

[02:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen, zcorpan, surkov: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pfwg-comments/2010JanMar/0038.html

[02:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.floodgap.com/software/classilla/ wow

[02:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
surkov: I think the markup to control accessible presentation of XBL should be (a possibly extended version of) ARIA, and it should also be usable outside XBL, so that it's viable to use DIV soup as fallback to XBL during the transition

[02:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would not want to see a whole second form of accessibility markup

[02:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: neat parlor trick, I guess

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, if origin is a unique identifier the result is Origin: null

[02:16:00.0000] <annevk>
and my idea was that it would support preflights as well

[02:16:01.0000] <annevk>
because that was the plan for Level 2 of their protocol anyway

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok well i've dealt with all the websocket feedback that is not on the hybi list and all the feedback on the hybi list up to the 28th of this month

[02:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
all that's left is GIANT threads of pain

[02:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i go through and delete the process ones first

[02:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: should there be a "force no preflight" flag anyway to define XDR sanely?

[02:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I guess XDR just doesn't allow sending any requests that would cause preflight, so nevermind

[02:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I tried to move discussion into the technical threads

[02:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah that helps a lot, indeed

[02:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
i like the subthread with the subject line "Process, was: Technical feedback. was:  Process"

[02:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I have some potentially bad news, which is that I came up with a way to do the handshake that is both much more secure and likely much easier to use in existing server software

[02:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh?

[02:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: is it too late to consider changes to the handshake?

[02:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
depends how much of an improvement it is

[02:20:05.0000] <Hixie>
what is the improvement?

[02:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok, so as I understand it, the security goal of the "exact binary match" requirement on the first part of the header is to reduce the risk of abusing unmodified vanilla HTTP servers,  or non-HTTP resources

[02:21:01.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: thanks

[02:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: more or less, yeah

[02:21:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so there's two problems with the current setup:

[02:21:04.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, you can prevent sending a preflight by preventing making requests that result in one

[02:22:00.0000] <annevk>
(you can force a preflight if you want)

[02:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
1) Hardcoding not just the status line, but also a few of the initial headers, is apparently a pain in the ass to work into existing HTTP stacks in servers (I'm willing to take their word for it).

[02:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't buy that at all, but i have heard it, yes

[02:22:03.0000] <othermaciej>
2) The handshake response consists exclusively of fixed contents, and literal character-for-character echoes of parts of the handshake request

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
right

[02:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
this means that if you can trick any server into echoing back exact text of choice in response to a WebSocket request, you are hosed

[02:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
a better method would be requiring something in the response that proves you saw the request, but is not predictable in advance

[02:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
yes, though i'm not aware of any case where it is possible, and i've looked

[02:23:04.0000] <othermaciej>
so here is my proposal:

[02:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
woah woah

[02:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
no

[02:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
we don't want to require that the server parse the request

[02:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
in fact in the common case the server won't parse the request at all

[02:24:04.0000] <othermaciej>
- Include a nonce in the request

[02:24:05.0000] <othermaciej>
- Server includes a hash of the nonce plus the request origin in the response status line

[02:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
- Only the status line is strictly constrained, not response headers

[02:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
This is clearly more robust against cross-protocol attacks

[02:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
unless you're aware of a web service that can be tricked into sending back the handshake, that seems unnecessarily complicated

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
right now in the most common case a websocket server will send the handshake before the client does

[02:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's actually pretty trivial

[02:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
cross-protocol attacks do happen and it's hard to predict them

[02:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's not as trivial as not doing anything :-)

[02:26:04.0000] <othermaciej>
witness recent firefox-based attack against IRC

[02:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that they happen, but as far as i've been able to tell, what we have currently is sufficient

[02:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
what I described is far more robust against cross-protocol attacks, and likely easier to do in the context of integrating with an existing Web server

[02:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
actually i don't see why it's any more secure

[02:27:03.0000] <othermaciej>
again, anything where the necessary handshake response is predictable is much more robust

[02:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
why can't you just cause the server to echo back the right hash?

[02:27:05.0000] <othermaciej>
because you can't predict the correct handshake response

[02:27:06.0000] <Hixie>
why not?

[02:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
because you (the JS-level attacker) do not know the nonce

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh the UA makes up the nonce, ok

[02:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it is generated by the UA

[02:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
that seems like a lot more complexity than what we have now

[02:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
i agree it's easy for experienced programmers

[02:28:05.0000] <othermaciej>
it doesn't even have to be a cryptographically secure hash, in fact, it might be an improvement even if you don't hash the nonce at all

[02:28:06.0000] <Hixie>
and even more non-experienced ones

[02:28:07.0000] <Hixie>
s/more/most/

[02:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
(or at least many0

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it is still more work than nothing

[02:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not aware of any protocol where you can cause the server to echo back the handshake or even get close

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
especially given how constrained the client's part of the handshake is

[02:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and putting the unpredictable part of the required handshake response in the status line makes it slightly more robust against header injection attacks on normal HTTP services

[02:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
right, the client can only control the URL part

[02:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
however, what I described is secure at a stronger level than "I'm not aware of any hackable services currently"

[02:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
agreed, but it's not enough of an improvement to throw away the half-dozen or so implementations

[02:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
(if you had suggested this six months ago, it'd be in without question)

[02:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
why don't we check if server and client implementors think it's enough of an improvement?

[02:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
go for it

[02:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
afaik the only client implementation that has actually shipped is Chrome, and they specifically said they weren't looking to prematurely lock in the protocol

[02:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm certainly happy to improve matters if people are willing to rewrite their code

[02:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
though i really don't like requiring that the server have to do work in the handshake

[02:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
isn't there some way we can get around that?

[02:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I posted a vague form of my suggestion on the hybi list

[02:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe I should pull it out of the thread and/or post it on whatwg

[02:33:02.0000] <annevk>
man, all this hybi crap in my inbox

[02:33:03.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe also get abarth's opinion

[02:33:04.0000] <annevk>
and now you guys are spamming this channel with it as well :p

[02:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually the more i think of this the less i like it... i don't like making the server have to read the client's data

[02:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
currently you can make a really simple server that completely ignores the server if you want to do something simple (similar to eventsource)

[02:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
er, ignores the client

[02:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: if a server accepts requests from multiple origins, doesn't it have to read the client's data anyway?

[02:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
yes, but that's likely to be much rarer

[02:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but the fact that it's needed in that case makes me think it is not such a huge burden

[02:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't say it was a huge burden, i said it was a burden

[02:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
right now you can literally never read a byte from the client

[02:36:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the part that the server has to read, check and echo-back isn't even in the fixed-order-and-capitalization part of the request, it's in the freeform part

[02:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is it not required for servers to check correctness of the client part of the handshake?

[02:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
no

[02:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
they can totally ignore the client

[02:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so a server could respond with WebSocket data even if you don't include Upgrade: WebSocket Connection: Upgrade?

[02:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[02:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wouldn't such a service be at risk of being exploited via XHR?

[02:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
comnnechow?

[02:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
er

[02:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
how?

[02:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
try connecting to damowmow.com:11111

[02:38:05.0000] <Hixie>
how can XHR exploit that?

[02:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
If it does not check the handshake request, I bet I can send it a GET with some preformatted messages as the body

[02:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
even if I can't get the results back, that's still an integrity violation

[02:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
?

[02:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if the service accepts commands of some kind via WebSocket that have side effects, rather than just reporting data, you could use XHR to abuse it if it does not check the handshake request

[02:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
if the server ignores the client, there's really not much to abuse

[02:40:02.0000] <surkov>
othermaciej: thanks for the link, I looked at the Firefox code and we do nothing with aria-hidden. And it sounds it goes with the spec :). However I'm agree it's not clear why ARIA hidden is at all.

[02:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
at least in a browser that supports CORS

[02:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
surkov: it doesn't sound to me like that is correct per the actual spec

[02:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
if the server ignores the client handshake but does listen to frames, then yes, you could send frames, just like you could if you just used zombies to send data there

[02:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
that doesn't seem like a particular problem

[02:41:03.0000] <annevk>
XHR cannot do GET with a body

[02:41:04.0000] <annevk>
unless the UA is broken

[02:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's a problem if the server uses Cookies from the request but does not otherwise check correctness

[02:42:01.0000] <surkov>
othermaciej: the spec sais aria-hidden="true" should be on hidden elements, aria-hidden="false" on visible elements so aria-hidden does affect on nothing

[02:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: good point - do any cross-site POSTs count as "simple requests"

[02:42:03.0000] <annevk>
yes

[02:42:04.0000] <annevk>
if the Content-Type header matches <form enctype> allowed values

[02:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yes, if you read cookies you should make sure you're getting a websocket handshake. but then we're far past "ignoring the client", and checking the handshake is not a burden any more, since you're already parsing it and everything.

[02:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so if you're not checking correctness of the handshake request you presumably don't check the method either

[02:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it seems to me that if you are completely ignoring the client, you don't really need a full duplex connection

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: *shrug*

[02:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if you listen to the messages, then you'd better check the handshake

[02:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt most servers will

[02:44:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the spec should at least mention this in security considerations, even if it does not mandate rejecting a bad handshake

[02:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if most servers will not, then we effectively have an insecure protocol

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
not much we can do about that as far as i can tell

[02:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's always possible to make a buggy server, and indeed we can't prevent that

[02:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but:

[02:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
a) the spec could require the server to check the handshake for correctness, even if we know some won't listen

[02:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure, i can add that, at least for the case where you read cookies

[02:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
b) even if it does not require it, the spec could recommend checking the handshake for correctness in the case where you look at any credentials and/or perform any side effects in response to messages

[02:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
c) my nonce proposal would actually force servers to read the handshake and process it (though it can't force them to check it is really correct, I suppose)

[02:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if a server truly ignores all input, then it could work just as well over EventSource with less trouble, so I am not sure WebSocket has to make that use case extra easy

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think requiring the non-sensitive cases to be harder just to secure the sensitive cases is making the wrong tradeoff, personally

[02:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
what i'd really like to do is throw out the HTTP compatibility altogether

[02:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
and go back to ports 81 and 815

[02:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the sensitive use cases are some of the most important

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
and then just have people use port 443 as they will anyway

[02:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
chat is clearly a case where you care about integrity, not just confidentiality

[02:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(i.e. you don't want random third parties to be able to forge chat messages as you)

[02:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think security is one area where I would be very hesitant to cut corners, even if it makes things easier for the use cases where you don't need any security

[02:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
well if we really want security to that level, we should design the handshake with that in mind and stop using HTTP

[02:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
trying to retrofit it into HTTP isn't ideal

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
and will always leave us vulnerable to the fake-websocket-via-form-post attack

[02:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
retrofitting it into HTTP makes it easier to share a host:port with a web server

[02:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
i thought so too, but apparently not

[02:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
because it makes people think they should use their HTTP output code

[02:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well it's really the input side of the handshake that matters

[02:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
i.e. the request from the client to the server

[02:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the server response could be anything, the fact that it takes the form of an HTTP 101 request is just following things to their logical conclusion

[02:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that being said, I think making the handshake response unpredictable would do more to improve security than making the handshake non-HTTP

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
making the handshake non-HTTP could solve the entire attack scenario you described

[02:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is a real attack scenario

[02:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
unlike echoing the handshake, which is theoretical at this point

[02:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
so i'd say it's the other way around

[02:56:04.0000] <othermaciej>
actually, if a non-http handshake still allowed the server to ignore the client handshake request, it would do nothing to prevent my attack scenario

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
nah, it'd be easy to design it in a way that it could... e.g. terminate the handshake with \n, so that the first frame would be corrupt

[02:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
then you would have to hard fail on a bad frame instead of ignoring it and moving on - does the protocol require that currently?

[02:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you're writing a server lazily, that's by far the easiest thing to do

[03:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
the spec does explain how you can go the extra mile and ignore unknown frames, but it's extra code, like checking the handshake

[03:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if the frame boundary is a fixed sentinel, then it's easiest to scan for the sentinel

[03:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
we could arrange for the failure to be with a length-delimited frame and for the length to be gigantic

[03:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
by flipping the meanings of the high bits in the frame typesa and the length marker

[03:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we do your nonce idea, we could put the nonce in a specific header that would only be included with websockets

[03:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
so that if you can't find it, you can't send it

[03:02:02.0000] <othermaciej>
request-wise you mean?

[03:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[03:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
that might make it more likely that the server implementors would fail if they can't find it

[03:02:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I agree that it should go in a request header that is only sent by WebSocet

[03:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
er *WebSocket

[03:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think I will ask abarth for his opinion on these issues

[03:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
both whether the attacks I described are worth worrying about, and whether a nonce mechanism would be an effective defense

[03:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
one of my concerns with requiring that authors read the handshake is that one of the advantages of them NOT reading the handshake is they won't just echo back the origin

[03:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm worried that authors will just do that instead of echoing back only their own origin

[03:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
servers that accept connections from multiple origins actually *do* have to do that, after checking the origin, but you are right that it may affect the likelihood of making a mistake in the single-origin case

[03:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
though of course you could write the server-side algorithms to say otherwise (i.e. have different ones for single-origin and multi-origin case, where the former only sends the fixed allowed origin after separately comparing it to the handshake origin)

[03:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's more or less what the spec does

[03:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
the parsing is in a separate (later) section

[03:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
people using stock tools for this (like mod_pywebsocket) might be less likely to make that mistake, if the framework asks you to declare allowed origins to it up front

[03:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
then the framework could make sure to both check against your list and echo back

[03:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess the main risk there would be if the framework has an "allow any origin" mode, authors might switch that on inadvertantly

[03:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
or indeed if they default to that :-)

[03:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
given how easy it is to write a websocket server, i don't know how much point there is to a websocket framework really

[03:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
(not having to parse the header is a big part of that)

[03:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, if you want something that operates on a large scale, you probably need some sort of framework, even if not for parsing the header

[03:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway - frameworks should probably either default to failing if you don't specify allowed origins, or default to allowing the same origin as the WEb sever they are running inside, if their purpose is to share a host:port with an existing web server

[03:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's blocking bytes in JS?

[03:26:01.0000] <annevk>
TC39

[03:26:02.0000] <annevk>
doh

[03:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: btw, re having acks in the protocol, it's relatively easy to add them at the application level, but it turns out to be much harder to add them at the websocket level. Basically all you need is to number your messages, and tell the server what the last message was you got when you reconnect.

[03:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: but if you do that at the websocket level, you've no way to know if the script _actually_ received the message

[03:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: right - I'm wondering what the practical benefit (if any) would be of doing it at the websocket level

[03:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
obviously, at the websocket level you could only generate transport-level acks, not guarantee actual end-to-end delivery to the app at either end

[03:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[03:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
one thing that would help is having a flag in the onclose event to say whether it was an orderly close or not

[03:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm wondering if a clean shutdown handshake is something that benefits from being at the protocol level

[03:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
TCP already does that for us, no?

[03:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it sounds like if you don't use one at the app level, you have to do the same kind of "lingering close" dance as HTTP servers, or you may lose mssages

[03:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
some of the content on the thread implies that the TCP close handshake is broken, and http servers have to work around it in crazy ways

[03:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I do not have enough expertise to check the accuracy of those claims

[03:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
obviously you can do a close handshake at the subprotocol level if you want, but if every subprotocol has to do it to be remotely correct, then maybe it should be in the base protocol

[03:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'd have to understand the use case better

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
to have an opinion

[03:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
apparently, if you just do a normal close of your socket when you are done sending, in some cases it can make the client drop data that it has already ACKd at the TCP level

[03:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in other words, you might lose the last few messages even if there is no actual disruption of service

[03:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Web servers do something crazy that I don't understand to work around this

[03:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be nice if protocol reliability could just rely on TCP-level acks, but besides the close issue, there's the problem that OS TCP stacks apparently don't expose how much has been ACK'd

[03:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
which seems like a waste...

[03:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TCP is supposed to provide a reliable stream, but the next level up has to reinvent reliability

[03:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
wait, back up

[03:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
who's closing?

[03:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
client or server?

[03:39:05.0000] <othermaciej>
the server

[03:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
and why?

[03:39:07.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[03:39:08.0000] <othermaciej>
the server has sent the final message it intends to

[03:39:09.0000] <othermaciej>
closes the socket

[03:39:10.0000] <othermaciej>
that can make the client lose the last few messages

[03:39:11.0000] <Hixie>
so the server thinks it's done but it wants to make sure it gets all the client's messages?

[03:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(apparently)

[03:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
well there's no way to do that except at the application layer, since you don't know what the app wants to send but hasn't sent yet

[03:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
not messages from the client

[03:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
what people claim is this:

[03:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
- the server sends some messages to the client

[03:40:05.0000] <othermaciej>
- the server gets TCP-level ACKs

[03:40:06.0000] <othermaciej>
- the server closes the socket

[03:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in this case, TCP requirements can cause the client to forcibly drop the last few messages

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh i see

[03:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and you have to do some "lingering close" trick to avoid it

[03:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
wow, really?

[03:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's, ah, stupid

[03:41:05.0000] <Hixie>
how about we fix TCP

[03:41:06.0000] <othermaciej>
it sounds like a huge bug in TCP to me

[03:41:07.0000] <othermaciej>
but I think "fix TCP" is out of the range of the practical

[03:41:08.0000] <annevk>
someone asked about TCP5 from us

[03:42:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: cool, glad you enjoyed it

[03:42:01.0000] <annevk>
jokingly maybe

[03:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
whereas "shutdown handshake" is viable

[03:42:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: did you happen to find out and document what exactly WebKit does with initial about:blank?

[03:42:04.0000] <annevk>
/me forgot who it was

[03:42:05.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: it turned out that the new RDF extraction algorithm is a bit b0rked, will send mail about that tonight hopefully

[03:42:06.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: not in any more detail than what the spec says now

[03:42:07.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: cool

[03:42:08.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if SCTP fixes this problem

[03:42:09.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok.

[03:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
clearly, what the spec says now isn't what WebKit does

[03:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/about-blank-load.html

[03:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this whole about:blank has been so sad. I reached my timeout of fixing it the right way on the critical path of HTML5 parser enablement

[03:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so I'm going to paper over it for now

[03:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but I'd still like to fix it the right way once the HTML5 parser is on by default on trunk

[03:44:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the "Reliable message delivery" subthread had the explanations of the socket close issue

[03:44:04.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg01030.html

[03:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg01044.html has more details

[03:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(that is, even what the spec says now and what the spec says plus load event are too much on the critical path)

[03:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fwiw, the above demo alerts "Different body" in Gecko, WebKit and Trident

[03:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and "Same body" in Opera

[03:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: does the spec require too much relative to what WebKit does, or too little?

[03:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: breaks enough test cases that poking at about:blank is going to be a test case whack-a-mole project on its own right

[03:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am surprised that this echoed "Different body"

[03:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
getting the HTML5 parser on by default is big enough a test case whack-a-mole project already

[03:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I figured out why it says "Different body" in WebKit

[03:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: it's not because the about:blank load is async, it's because the load event listener runs before the second script

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: does the event loop spin or do you fire a sync load event?

[03:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I don't know code-wise why it happens (either explanation is plausible), but I verified that the end() function runs before the second script by adding more alerts

[03:50:01.0000] <foolip>
http://dev.w3.org/rdfa/specs/rdfa-dom-api.html

[03:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ok. thanks

[03:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I believe we do fire a load event from the middle of parsing without spinning the event loop

[03:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
foolip: I am amused that the "Triple" interface has 6 things in it...

[03:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: eww. I really don't want to go down that road.

[03:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I just think that is how our code happens to work - no idea if this is required

[03:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I think it is actually as a result of DOM insertion, not parsing, that the load event fires

[03:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ok. I still want to avoid sync events while the parser is on the call stack

[03:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and I can see the wisdom of that

[03:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I honestly have no idea if this behavior is needed for Web compat

[03:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm just trying to describe what we do

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sure. thanks

[03:54:01.0000] <Dashiva>
So the IETF doesn't like cool URIs? Interesting

[03:54:02.0000] <annevk>
that's nothing new

[03:54:03.0000] <annevk>
though tools.ietf.org generally does

[03:54:04.0000] <annevk>
so I use that

[03:55:00.0000] <foolip>
othermaciej: well, (object, datatype, language) is really all part of the object, and children is just a bit odd. I assume this won't be the final draft.

[03:55:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
othermaciej: about the H:TML draft, I will get an announcement out to public-html shortly

[03:55:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
sorry for the delay, I made quite a lot of changes over the weekend

[03:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. the load event is sync in IE8, too

[03:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: btw, the two framing types is a result of targetting novice authors. SPDY is intended to be implemented by experts only.

[03:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: also, it's really easy to do multiplexing if your subprotocol supports it, just use a shared worker

[03:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: at this point I'm a little frightened of the thought of novice authors implementing the protocol by hand - I really hope people make good frameworks for Perl/Python/Ruby/Java/etc

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[04:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
the protocol is trivial

[04:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems like there are many opportunities for subtle mistakes, when you dig into the details

[04:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've tried to minimise those

[04:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
obviously it's impossible to make a protocol idiot-proof, but it's a lot harder to screw up than most

[04:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's easier to make an API (more) idiot-proof than a protocol, so I hope people do so

[04:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for multiplexing, yes, you could have clients coordinate via a SharedWorker or a shared iframe

[04:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it also seems to me that transparent multiplexing could be added down the line (between the UA and the server, invisible to the JS client code)

[04:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
since the handshakes allow custom headers, and since you could introduce new frame types

[04:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes, indeed

[04:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
voluntary multiplexing also doesn't work if your clients might be running from different origins

[04:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but sharing a connection in such a case is scarier security-wise

[04:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
bugs in doing framing become much more severe issues

[04:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
well, shared workers will be cross-origin capable in due course

[04:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
which would solve that issue

[04:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think transparent multiplexing would be cool, but it seems to me that it could be a 2.0 feature if deployment experience with WebSocket shows it is useful

[04:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[04:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
likewise for transparent compression

[04:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
or whatever

[04:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[04:08:00.0000] <annevk>
what's the idea with the frame types though? lots of people seem to have in mind non-browser use cases, will they fork some of the frame types?

[04:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[04:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
non-browser use cases seems tupid to me

[04:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/seems tupid/seem stupid/

[04:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, just use TCP

[04:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
websockets is a terrible protocol if you're not trying to use this with JS

[04:09:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I think the idea is to reuse existing services made for browsers in websocket

[04:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
in that case, there won't be forked frame types

[04:10:01.0000] <annevk>
well, stupid or not, the people on the hybi list wanna do it

[04:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: oh, the reason the fixed part of the handshake is more than one line long is to ensure that you have to cause the server to echo something with a newline in it (which you can't send in the request)

[04:11:01.0000] <annevk>
i'm not sure it's very productive to label them stupid

[04:11:02.0000] <annevk>
that's prolly also what part of the clash is coming from

[04:12:00.0000] <annevk>
they have completely different use cases in mind

[04:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have yet to see a good reason to use websocket rather than TCP for something where there's no browser as possible client

[04:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I see - in that case, I think a nonce would definitely remove the benefit of having a newline in the fixed part

[04:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
(indeed i've yet to see a reason at all)

[04:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yes

[04:12:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: probably

[04:12:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I could imagine using WebSocket if you have browser clients *and* other clients

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
i think the reason for these server developers is that they can provide a easy-to-use library to their customers

[04:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[04:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
but then you wouldn't invent new frame types

[04:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: can't they do that with TCP too?

[04:13:04.0000] <annevk>
they want to interoperate

[04:13:05.0000] <annevk>
with other servers and new clients

[04:14:00.0000] <annevk>
from that perspective it makes sense to have a standard protocol

[04:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
TCP is a standard protocol?

[04:14:02.0000] <annevk>
yes, but they want an abstraction

[04:14:03.0000] <annevk>
just like HTTP is an abstraction

[04:14:04.0000] <annevk>
i don't see how this is very hard to get...

[04:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
websocket isn't an abstraction

[04:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's a minimal browser origin model security layer

[04:15:02.0000] <annevk>
it will be an abstraction of some kind once we have send(Stream)

[04:15:03.0000] <annevk>
well, and UTF-8 support is already an abstraction, imo

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think "abstraction" means what you think it means

[04:19:00.0000] <annevk>
higher-level?

[04:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
seriously, you can do everything websockets does in like 10 lines of documentation if all you want is a convention of using UTF-8 or something like htat.

[04:19:02.0000] <annevk>
/me doesn't really care what term we use

[04:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why you would use websocket

[04:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
unless you specifically cared about browsers

[04:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
i understand using it for something where browsers is a use case and you also want to handle non-browser clients

[04:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
but for something where you don't have browser clients?

[04:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's silly.

[04:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: even for cutting through firewalls?

[04:22:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it seems like you don't even try to understand their concerns

[04:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: websocket doesn't do anything special to cut through firewalls.

[04:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think a use case with both browser and non-browser clients is legitimate

[04:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: please enlighten me

[04:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
you may well not want to offer two forms of your service

[04:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: absolutely

[04:23:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I could also imagine that once you have that infrastructure, you may want to reuse the client and server code for some cases that don

[04:23:05.0000] <othermaciej>
t also involve a browser client

[04:23:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure those should get consideration on the level of a primary use case

[04:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's like saying "ok, i've deployed IMAP, now I want to be able to run my MUD using IMAP"

[04:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I could also imagine that you may want to talk an extended version of your protocol to a non-browser client rather than having a whole different protocol

[04:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I would bet someone has actually run a MUD over IMAP :-)

[04:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
and they're silly :-)

[04:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
people also run back end business-to-business data messaging over HTTP

[04:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
HTTP over WS-* over Web Socket

[04:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
people do a lot of silly things

[04:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
that doesn't stop them being silly

[04:27:00.0000] <annevk>
well, it seems to me they want something akin to HTTP for bidirectional communication

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk>
they also think that deploying a new protocol is costly

[04:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes, i have several people say those things a lot

[04:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
have seen, rather

[04:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: if they want bidirectional HTTP for B2B back end integration, what does it have to do with Web Socket?

[04:29:02.0000] <annevk>
it seems they don't believe that deploying two protocols will work so they want WebSocket to also accommodate use cases / requirements they have

[04:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: seems like the orderly close could be done easily just by having an echo feature of some kind

[04:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: either at the application level or in WS itself if we wanted to require all implementations to do it

[04:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: echo feature?

[04:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah where the side that wants to close the connection sends a packet saying "this is close attempt X" for some value of X, and the other side replies "close X", and if the first side receives a "close X" with the value of X that it sent, and it still thinks it wants to close, then it closes.

[04:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
without lingering.

[04:56:00.0000] <annevk>
but the side that sends close X does not know when it can close?

[04:56:01.0000] <annevk>
because wasn't the concern that if it closes to early "close X" would not arrive

[04:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
the side that sends close X will know it can close when the other side closes.

[05:00:00.0000] <annevk>
in that case one side could just do the closing attempt right?

[05:00:01.0000] <annevk>
no need for confirmation

[05:00:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Then there might be data lost in transmission

[05:02:00.0000] <annevk>
A says close, B closes on arrival of that message, A knows B closed

[05:02:01.0000] <annevk>
so A can close

[05:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie's example said "and it still thinks it wants to close", though.

[05:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I guess that might not be a necessary step

[05:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i guess you could just do it that way

[05:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually no

[05:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
you need the two-way handshake

[05:06:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm looks like tests that i wrote 4 years ago have the same style as tests i write today

[05:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I believe that would be a fine orderly close mechanism, but I don't understand the TCP issue super well

[05:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
otherwise if A says to "close" to B, and B sends data to A then closes, B wouldn't see what A said

[05:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
er

[05:06:06.0000] <Hixie>
A wouldn't see what B siad

[05:06:07.0000] <zcorpan>
except i probably try to automate tests more now

[05:07:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, good point

[05:07:01.0000] <annevk>
you win :)

[05:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the reason I think it should be considered for the base protocol is that WebSocket is broken for any app-level protocol where you don't do this

[05:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: depends on the protocol

[05:07:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: not just "no acks" broken but "might gratuitously lose data even though everything seemed fine" broken

[05:08:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, heh

[05:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if the server is just sending a stream of updates "stock AAPL up $1" "stock MSFT up $5" etc, then you don't care about lost packets

[05:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it very much depends on the subprotocol

[05:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: if the server initiated the close, then it seems wasteful for the server to order the client to discard the last few packets

[05:08:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: even if the client being a few messages out of date might not be a critical problem

[05:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
6 out of 8 have been fixed from http://zcorpan.1go.dk/test/opera-bugs/

[05:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
agreed

[05:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
in that case the client would close

[05:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
not the server

[05:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it seems like that is what's happening with this TCP issue - not just that you don't know for sure what got delivered, but that you are actually telling the client to discard data that it already received

[05:09:05.0000] <annevk>
you could put it in the base protocol and allow the server to close regardless if it doesn't care

[05:09:06.0000] <Hixie>
but the client wouldn't want an orderly close, especially if e.g. the websocket object is already GCed

[05:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we can come up with some thing simple enough that can be ignored if the server doesn't need it, it makes sense to add it to the base protocol

[05:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I actually don't know the bare minimum required for a proper orderly close handshake over TCP

[05:11:01.0000] <annevk>
it seems you could just use the highest byte as a special closing message

[05:11:02.0000] <annevk>
that needs to be returned

[05:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wish someone on the thread had explained how you would solve the problem with a proper close handshake instead of a lingering close - like at least one example of something that works

[05:12:01.0000] <annevk>
so 0xFF

[05:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if we need the number X from my example

[05:12:03.0000] <annevk>
as a standalone closing frame

[05:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we can just do 0xFF 0x00

[05:12:05.0000] <Hixie>
and if you receive an 0xFF frame, you know the other side wants to close

[05:12:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: If you want to support changing your mind about closing, you need it, don't you?

[05:12:07.0000] <annevk>
you don't even need 0x00 I think

[05:12:08.0000] <Hixie>
and you can send an 0xFF to say ok

[05:12:09.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i don't want to add a third kind of frame

[05:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: yeah, but it's not clear we need that

[05:13:01.0000] <annevk>
boring :)

[05:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
foolip: maybe I am dumb, but if RDFa is fundamentally a graph structure, that seems like a poor API for it

[05:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how are HTML notications in http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/desktop-notifications/api-specification supposed to work with D-Bus or Growl notifications?

[05:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the spec talks about the browser rendering them as a browsing context

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but who really want that except in a Chrome OS -like environment where there's nothing but the browser?

[05:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
*wants

[05:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
they're not, as i understand them

[05:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me has similar concerns

[05:20:04.0000] <foolip>
othermaciej: I agree, it's not terribly useful

[05:20:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: also a concern for iphone or android environments where the OS has a built-in notification system that is pure-text or close to it

[05:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i should go sleep

[05:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
in particular, you'd expect the children of an RDFa graph node / triple to have the same subject as the triple's *object*, not the same subject as its subject

[05:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thinks it would be good to start out with a simple icon + plain text API that maps to system notification mechanisms

[05:21:04.0000] <othermaciej>
it also seems like you would really want to be able to query by subject, object or predicate, not just by type...

[05:21:05.0000] <hsivonen>
what mailing list am I supposed to whine on about the notication API?

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aside: it's rather amazing that Growl still isn't part of Mac OS X itself

[05:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
amazing from a practical POV that is

[05:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
not amazing from a NIH attitude POV

[05:22:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: you could use webkit-dev, to complain about what's implemented, since the code is in WebKit, but fwiw I think Chrome is the only browser shipping with it enabled

[05:22:04.0000] <othermaciej>
for proposing a standard version of this and proposing changes to that, I dunno

[05:22:05.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML is not really an obstacle for Growl

[05:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
IIRC it uses WebKit to render notifications

[05:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: does chrome send stuff to growl or d-bus on Mac/Linux?

[05:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I don't know

[05:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[05:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
non-Chrome WEbKit vendors/devs were not fully sold on the suitability of this API or the value of shipping it without sufficient cross-vendor discussion

[05:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I expect they implement it all internally and do not use any system or third-party notification services

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I see

[05:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does Windows have a system-wide notification service that doesn't involve registering a tray icon first?

[05:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
onvolumechange didn't work at least

[05:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but addEventListener worked

[05:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's a bug I guess

[05:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
per HTML5 it should clearly be on HTMLElement and HTMLDocument

[05:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[05:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and window

[05:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I need to catch up on this fullscreen thread at some point

[05:37:01.0000] <zcorpan>
feature testing says it's on window but not document or element

[05:37:02.0000] <zcorpan>
in webkit

[05:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
which is not so useful since volumechange doesn't bubble :)

[06:41:00.0000] <annevk>
so to get an.ne I need to a have a registered company in Nigeria named "an"

[06:41:01.0000] <annevk>
that seems like too much trouble

[06:42:00.0000] <ray>
man, uganda doesn't have any silly restrictions like that

[06:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk, surely you could just bribe the right official?

[07:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"Markup conformance requirements that need to be tested and give them a stable identifier that will persist across drafts of the specification." - http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-test-methodology-20100128/

[07:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders how many thousands of distinct conformance requirements there are in HTML5.

[07:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's easy, just use the text of the conformance requirement as the identifier

[07:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess if the text changes, you've changed the conformance requirement anyway . . .

[07:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: I counted 223 requirement statements for <canvas> a while ago

[07:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
so there's going to be quite a lot across the whole spec

[07:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is that counting something like "When X occurs, user agents must execute the following algorithm:" as one requirement or lots?

[07:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lots

[07:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I suppose it's more about testable points than about conformance requirements)

[07:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are what, like 8,000 tests for CSS2.1?  And HTML5 is how much longer, twenty times as long?

[07:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
:/

[07:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is ballparking

[07:09:01.0000] <annevk>
last estimate was 50000 tests needed

[07:09:02.0000] <annevk>
maybe that was optimistic

[07:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML5 has lots of features, many different facets to test for each, very detailed requirements for most of them, and some nontrivial interactions among different features

[07:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so probably the level of test coverage needed is even higher than comparison of length to CSS would imply

[07:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though to be fair, CSS is also pretty damn complicated

[07:11:02.0000] <annevk>
CSS is prolly more complicated

[07:11:03.0000] <annevk>
most of HTML5 is written in a pretty straightforward way

[07:11:04.0000] <annevk>
CSS has very complex interactions

[07:11:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
You couldn't test a lot of HTML5 requirements in a cross-browser way, could you?  You'd need something more like Mozilla's mochitests, that can synthesize input and whatnot.

[07:11:06.0000] <othermaciej>
CSS has some very complex interactions by design

[07:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML5 has a fair number of complex interactions by accident of history

[07:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there are many HTML requirements that would be hard to test if the browser itself is your only test tool

[07:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that doesn't mean you can't do it in a cross-browser way

[07:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How would you do it, then?  Except manually, of course.

[07:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't want to see anyone try running 100,000 tests manually :P

[07:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
one possible way is to run an external program to synthesize input events, and possibly capture output

[07:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
people have made such tools that work with any given browser, for example for testing Web sites or for general QA of any native application with a GUI

[07:14:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i generated about 15000 tests for a css feature

[07:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Generated"?

[07:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
of course for any conformance requirement that can be tested by scripting against the DOM, that's the best way to do it

[07:15:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah, i wrote some python scripts

[07:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
although i wanted to generate more for interaction with svg

[07:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So how many substantively different things did these 15,000 tests actually test?

[07:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i tested different combinations of percentages, lengths and keywords, visibility:hidden/visible, and the different values for the feature, for a number of different elements

[07:19:01.0000] <zcorpan>
including invalid cases

[07:19:02.0000] <zcorpan>
oh and with different images

[08:01:00.0000] <Huvet>
gah, I'm going crazy with all the different html parsing libraries... I want three things: parse broken html -> remove all tags except a list I specify -> get all text blocks that remain

[08:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess this is why people give up and use regexps

[08:02:01.0000] <Huvet>
the only way I see of doing this, is to parse with html5lib, serialize to html, parse with lxml.html.clean and clean up, then parse again with html5lib, and select out all the text from there with xpath

[08:02:02.0000] <Huvet>
... and that's a mess :)

[08:02:03.0000] <Huvet>
yeah :)

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why can't you parse with html5lib with lxml treebuilder, then do whatever manipulations you need to the tree structure, then serialise as text?

[08:04:00.0000] <Huvet>
because the tree I get from the lxml treebuilder is not the format lxml.html.clean, expects... I get 'lxml.etree._ElementTree' object has no attribute 'rewrite_links' when trying to clean that document

[08:04:01.0000] <Huvet>
so it seems there are more methods on html trees somehow

[08:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, right

[08:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
Do you have to use lxml.html.clean, rather than implementing the functionality you need yourself using the normal lxml API?

[08:05:02.0000] <Huvet>
no, I'll switch as long as it works :)

[08:06:00.0000] <Huvet>
I'm screenscraping pages, and have found that a good way is to strip all tags except div, and then look for the longest text string that's left

[08:06:01.0000] <Huvet>
that's (most often) the article text

[08:06:02.0000] <annevk>
should be pretty easy to go through a tree and dump elements you do not like and append their content to the parent?

[08:07:00.0000] <annevk>
or some such

[08:07:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe with some different branches depending on the element

[08:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be easier with a SAX-like API since you could trivially filter out unwanted tags

[08:07:03.0000] <jgraham>
The seperation between lxml.etree and lxml.html is a real pain

[08:08:00.0000] <Huvet>
good ideas, all of them

[08:08:01.0000] <Huvet>
jgraham: yeah, I was hoping for a lxml.html.frometree(doc)

[08:08:02.0000] <jgraham>
Huvet: Have you tried looking at the implementation of the lxml.html thing and seeing if you san port it to vanilla lxml.etree?

[08:09:00.0000] <Huvet>
jgraham: I think that's a bit over my head, I'm not that used to lxml

[08:09:01.0000] <Huvet>
http://codespeak.net/lxml/api/lxml.html.clean-pysrc.html

[08:10:00.0000] <Huvet>
700 lines

[08:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
Huvet: You could rather inefficiently walk the tree and rebuild it in lxml.html Elements

[08:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or you could patch html5lib asnd see what breaks :)

[08:12:00.0000] <Huvet>
I guess the best way is what annevk said... except the "pretty easy" part ;)

[08:13:00.0000] <Huvet>
get the lxml tree and walk it and drop nodes as I go along

[08:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Huvet: You have to be a bit careful because of the .tail

[08:19:00.0000] <jgraham>

[08:53:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Heyo.

[09:05:00.0000] <no_mind>
has html5 got something special for centering a div ?

[09:06:00.0000] <annevk>
we're not in the business of styling ;)

[09:06:01.0000] <annevk>
you want CSS

[09:06:02.0000] <annevk>
something like margin:0 auto; plus an explicit width

[09:06:03.0000] <annevk>
or some fiddling with table layout

[09:06:04.0000] <no_mind>
ok, so which channel is suitable for css ?

[09:10:00.0000] <annevk>
#css on irc.w3.org, though that's mainly for the CSS WG

[09:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's also #css here.

[09:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's unofficial.

[10:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, chrome doesn't support wave in <audio>?

[11:37:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Anyone know how often the http://html5gallery.com/ guys update

[12:16:00.0000] <annevk>
reading http://unicode.org/draft/reports/tr46/tr46.html I really wonder how IDNA2008 got through

[12:16:01.0000] <annevk>
where is the upside?

[12:16:02.0000] <annevk>
it sounds insane

[12:16:03.0000] <annevk>
let me repeat that

[12:16:04.0000] <annevk>
insane

[12:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me reads section 1.2 decides that "insane" is probably being kind

[12:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Surely all valid comments were taken into consideration

[12:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's just that imperfect beings such as us can't comprehend the trascendental perfection

[13:17:00.0000] <Huvet>
thanks for the help figuring this out Philip`, annevk, and jgraham: http://dpaste.com/153474/

[13:17:01.0000] <Huvet>
input: an URL to an article, output: the article text

[13:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Huvet: You can write doc = html5lib.parse(html, treebuilder="lxml")

[13:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
Rather than explicitly creating a parser that is never reused

[13:31:00.0000] <Huvet>
ah, great, fixing right away

[13:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
That is probably not documented anywhere

[13:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
We have documentation?

[13:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me would tend to write the filter as a list comprehension or a generator expression

[13:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
like texts = (x.strip() for x in doc.xpath("//text") if x)

[13:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but it doesn't matter)

[13:36:00.0000] <Huvet>
yeah, I heard that from another python guru too... but I kinda like the idea that I'm "filtering away the empty texts" and it says "filter" there

[13:37:00.0000] <Huvet>
and yeah, you desperately need documentation

[13:37:01.0000] <Huvet>
I would set that as my main priority if I where you

[13:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me imagines the main priorities should be things like writing documentation and improving the sanitizer, and spec compliance should be somewhere near the bottom of the list

[13:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Well we do, there are a few docstring and the old, lost documentation

[13:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
But it is abysmal, I grant you

[13:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I know, I know...

[13:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But what's the fun of that?

[13:47:00.0000] <smaug___>
/me still doesn't understand why the draft changed to have async back()/forward()

[13:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, the whole point is spec compliance

[13:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Users don't care about spec compliance

[13:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe users aren't the point, but they'd probably disagree

[13:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/wiki/UserDocumentation

[13:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
Now it just needs to be right and good

[13:53:00.0000] <Huvet>
great!

[13:54:00.0000] <Huvet>
things that many documentations fail to do is provide examples... you could just include things that people have done with html5lib right in the docs

[13:54:01.0000] <Huvet>
that would help most people get started

[13:54:02.0000] <Huvet>
and I mean from url to string

[13:55:00.0000] <Huvet>
not only the parser-specific thing in between

[14:00:00.0000] <Huvet>
you should move to the whatwg wiki with all docs imo

[14:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, yt?

[14:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, there's a bug in your live microdata tool with support for additional-name

[14:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
when there are multiple additional-name properties used, they should be comma separated when the vcard is generated, just like you do for street-address

[14:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, they didn't like mappings

[14:49:00.0000] <annevk>
or maybe you mean something different from what I said earlier in that thread...

[15:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, same bug with itemprop="type" within "tel"

[15:12:00.0000] <annevk>
aah

[15:12:01.0000] <annevk>
IDNA2003 is tied to Unicode 3.2 and does not do bidi

[15:12:02.0000] <annevk>
though do you really want bidi in URLs?!

[15:17:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.macchiato.com/unicode/idna/security-issues is a good document on the IDNA2008 mess

[15:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
My first attempt at using microdata seems to be a success. I just marked up my contact page using the vcard profile. http://lachy.id.au/about/contact

[15:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
although tedious, it was actually quite easy

[15:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
the one thing I found annoying was that I kept mistyping itemtype="..." instead of itemprop="..."

[15:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, that page of mine nicely illustrates those bugs in your tool that I mentioned above.

[16:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Awesome.  http://www.fileformat.info/convert/text/punycode-encoder-decoder.htm doesn't declare a charset, and so is autodetecting to something other than unicode, making it impossible to use the page for what it is intended for.

[16:06:01.0000] <Lachy>

seems to be declaring it for me

[16:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  Well, something's wrong then.  It's giving me back a bad punycode.

[16:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
check which encoding your browser is actually using

[16:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
the bug appears to be a problem with the site's cgi script.

[16:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, looks like it.  Luckily I haven't submitted the feedback yet!

[16:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
I guess it's trying to read the input as if it were encoded as ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8

[16:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That'd be my guess, since it's turning "bücher" into "bÃ¼cher".

[16:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: there appears to be only a single working online punycode encoder.  >_<  Luckily it's the first google result.

Hixie: spec says the content model of figure is limited to figcaption and phrasing content

annevk: Is Opera's current initial about:blank loading into a browsing context behavior considered sufficiently Web-compatible by Opera devs? 

[00:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Wich part of it? There are parts that aren't.

[00:19:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: I'm here

[00:19:01.0000] <foolip>
/me has a look

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: 1) creating the initial about:blank DOM synchronously, 2) not scheduling a normal load for about:blank that'd overwrite the initial about:blank, 3) firing a 'load' event for the initial about:blank and 4) firing the 'load' event async

[00:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: can you say which parts aren't?

[00:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as far as I can tell, there a the four behaviors out there: Gecko, WebKit/IE, Opera and spec

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
given the data available to me, I tentatively consider Opera's behavior most desirable  here

[00:22:01.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: I'm afraid I'm just doing what the spec says: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#conversion-to-vcard

[00:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: That's fine

[00:22:03.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: only the first additional-name is used

[00:22:04.0000] <hsivonen>
although it's scary that WebKit/IE have their behavior in common

[00:22:05.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: The problems relate to iframes created through DOM before the body element

[00:22:06.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: thanks

[00:22:07.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: (at least I'm unaware of any issues with it)

[00:22:08.0000] <gsnedders>
(and I spent a while looking at this a few months ago)

[00:23:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: write to the list and I'll align with whatever the spec changes to

[00:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, ok. I was looking at the actual vCard RFC, which allows multiple occurrences of those fields, so I'll report the spec bugs shortly

[00:27:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: good, perhaps you can look over the other fields and see if there are other discrepancies too?

[00:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Is Google's JSON-C still JSON but with more compact structures that in their existing JSON APIs_

[00:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[00:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or is JSON-C modifying JSON itself?

[00:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, unfortunately, RFC 2426 isn't entirely clear. :-( It states:

[00:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
   Type special note: The structured type value corresponds, in

[00:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
   sequence, to the Family Name, Given Name, Additional Names, Honorific

[00:42:03.0000] <Lachy>
   Prefixes, and Honorific Suffixes. The text components are separated

[00:42:04.0000] <Lachy>
   by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59). Individual text

[00:42:05.0000] <Lachy>
   components can include multiple text values (e.g., multiple

[00:42:06.0000] <Lachy>
   Additional Names) separated by the COMMA character

[00:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
It doesn't explicitly specify which fields allow multiple values and which cannot, suggesting they all cane. Although with it using the plural of Additional Names, Honorific Prefixes and Suffixes, suggesting that it's only those 3 that can.

[00:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/cane/can/

[00:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
But it has the character names in all caps!

[00:44:03.0000] <jgraham>
What could be clearer than that

[00:44:04.0000] <jgraham>
?

[00:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I do know someone here in Norway with 2 first names and 2 last names, and she insists that they're not middle names even though they're not hyphenated. So I'm inclined to say that all fields can contain multiple values.

[01:06:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: that person would be wrong

[01:06:01.0000] <virtuelv>
unless hyphenated, the last name is one word only

[01:06:02.0000] <virtuelv>
you can have as many first and middle names as you want

[01:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
§ 7. Doble etternavn 

[01:09:01.0000] <virtuelv>
       To navn som kan tas som etternavn, kan tas som et dobbelt etternavn der de to navnene er satt sammen med bindestrek. I forhold til §§ 3 og 4 regnes et dobbelt etternavn som to adskilte etternavn.

[01:10:00.0000] <virtuelv>
§ 7 Doble surname

[01:10:01.0000] <virtuelv>
       Two names that can be taken as a last name, can be taken as a double last name, where the two names are put together with a hyphen. In relation to § § 3 and 4 is considered a double last name as two separate surnames.

[01:10:02.0000] <virtuelv>

virtuelv: what's the semantic role of Wium in howcome's name?

[01:10:04.0000] <virtuelv>
it would be his middle name

[01:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
there might be exceptions for some names

[01:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: is it the same kind of middle name as in English and not the kind of middle name that occurs in Danish?

[01:11:02.0000] <virtuelv>
von Tetzchner, or von Koengisegg

[01:12:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: this is covered by § 9

[01:12:01.0000] <virtuelv>
which says that all acceptable last names are acceptable middle names

[01:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: ah. so that permits Danish names in Norway

[01:14:00.0000] <virtuelv>
colloquially, though, people may refer to an unused first name as a middle name

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems to me that the Norwegian statute has the same bug as the Finnish statute

[01:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it doesn't state the permitted character repertoire and length of the names

[01:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(or I'm bad at skimming Norwegian text)

[01:16:01.0000] <virtuelv>
there is no limit on the length

[01:16:02.0000] <virtuelv>
and there is, as far as I can tell no limit on the character repertoire

[01:16:03.0000] <virtuelv>
on the length thing: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/11/julius-andreas-gimli-arn_n_284276.html

virtuelv: if a Russian-born person gets Norwegian citizenship, are cyrillic letters printed on the passport?

[01:17:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(Yes, he did indeed misspell Chewbacca)

[01:17:02.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: I don't know

[01:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
an Estonian-born person with a Russian name who got the Finnish citizenship told me that there was a mandatory algorithmic mapping to the Latin script

[01:19:01.0000] <virtuelv>
note that for that guy, only elessar-jankov is last name, as evidenced by the first line of his driver's license

[01:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it bothers me that I can't find the specs for this stuff

[01:19:03.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: if there is, it isn't written in law, at least

[01:20:00.0000] <virtuelv>
then again, I live in a country where the tax algorithm is described in terms of a 1300-line COBOL program

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
there's definitely a limit on how many characters fit on the optically-readable part of a passport

[01:23:01.0000] <virtuelv>
yeah

[01:23:02.0000] <foolip>
virtuelv: there are plenty of Swedes with two surnames without hyphen

[01:23:03.0000] <virtuelv>
he had to drop highlander from his passport

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and there's a German-oriented ASCII-ification of names for the optically readable part

[01:24:01.0000] <foolip>
(mostly people who couldn't decide which name to take when getting married)

[01:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me has wondered what happens if a person with an umlauted name tries to travel to the U.S. these days and applies a conversion that Finns or Swedes would apply naturally

What are the main reasons for the html5 spec to not demand closing your tags?

[01:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
which tags?

[01:34:01.0000] <pesla>
Tags of which the end tag can now be omitted

[01:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
pesla: backward compat with HTML4 authoring

[01:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
didn't seem to be helpful to require them

[01:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
i like omitting tags

[01:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[01:35:03.0000] <hsivonen>
pesla: those tags were optional in HTML4, too

[01:35:04.0000] <hsivonen>
pesla: also, it's nice to less to type when writing test cases

[01:35:05.0000] <pesla>
I know, but what problems would arise if the html5 spec demands it?

[01:35:06.0000] <hsivonen>
s/to less/to have less/

[01:35:07.0000] <Hixie>
pesla: i'd be less happy

[01:35:08.0000] <Hixie>
pesla: and my fingers would hurt more

[01:35:09.0000] <pesla>
But I think a lot of frontend devvers would be happier

[01:35:10.0000] <hsivonen>
pesla: migrating from HTML4 to HTML5 becomes more tedious for no good reason

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
pesla: they can include them if they like

[01:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
pesla: they are free to do the additional typing

[01:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
pesla: they can even write validators that warn if you omit them

[01:36:03.0000] <pesla>
There is no benefit to omit the closing tag is there? Apart from writing less ;)

[01:36:04.0000] <pesla>
(Mind my crappy english :()

[01:36:05.0000] <hsivonen>
(or they can wait for Firefox to ship with the HTML5 parser and then me fixing the validator)

[01:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
pesla: writing less is a benefit

[01:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
pesla: check out the SGML spec

[01:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
pesla: it's full of "to avoid repetitive keying"

[01:37:03.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: although, reading the sgml spec is a cruical part on the path to insanity :D

[01:37:04.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, Norwegian rules about naming don't apply everywhere. My sister in law, when she married my elder brother, changed her last name from Wedgewood to Wedgewood Hunt. So technically, she has two last names now.

[01:38:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: yes, but I was refering to Norway, and what the law here says on names

[01:38:01.0000] <virtuelv>
either way, and back to microdata and contact formats

[01:38:02.0000] <virtuelv>
it's so complex that

[01:39:00.0000] <virtuelv>
a) Devising an algorithm for extracting names from a single field is not feasible

[01:39:01.0000] <virtuelv>
b) Having format constraints for first/middle/last names is not feasible

[01:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
names in hCard are a rathole unless the name is of the form Given Surname

[01:39:03.0000] <virtuelv>
c) You can't use the terms I used in b) for names

[01:39:04.0000] <virtuelv>
because of countries where the last name is the first

[01:40:00.0000] <qfox>
hi

[01:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hi

[01:40:02.0000] <virtuelv>
as I understand it, people in Iceland don't really have last names

[01:40:03.0000] <virtuelv>
their phone book is sorted by first name

[01:40:04.0000] <qfox>
pesla's question was kind of because of me, i guess

[01:40:05.0000] <jgraham>
No they have names like Jonsdottir

[01:40:06.0000] <pesla>
lol

[01:40:07.0000] <jgraham>
sp?

[01:40:08.0000] <jgraham>
(Mean's Jon's daughter)

[01:41:00.0000] <virtuelv>
jgraham: yes, but I'm not sure they qualify as "last" names

[01:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
*meaning

[01:41:02.0000] <virtuelv>
because they are certainly not last names in the sense we use last names in the rest of the world, which is "family name"

[01:41:03.0000] <jgraham>
virtuelv: Well not in the traditional sense of family names. But they are typically written after their given name

[01:41:04.0000] <qfox>
so the only reason for closing tags not being in the spec would be to prevent cruft? 

[01:41:05.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: aren't the *dottir names just for compat with the rest of the world?

[01:42:00.0000] <qfox>
apart from potential compat problems between html5 and older versions...

[01:42:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I recall we had some trouble with it in the past, but our current behavior is ok afaik

[01:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: they are a compat problem in these cases: <p><table>, <p><article>

[01:42:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: thanks

[01:42:04.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I was under the impression that they were a long-time naming tradition. But it's not like I'm an iceland guru or anything

[01:43:00.0000] <qfox>
hsivonen: in what regard exactly?

[01:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: so omitting </p> is contextually dangerous

[01:43:02.0000] <qfox>
yes, but that's not against putting it in the standard...

[01:43:03.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, the spec uses given-name and family-name anyway, so the cultural issues of first vs. last names is irrelevant.

[01:43:04.0000] <qfox>
i'm wondering why the tags arent forced to be closed by the spec

[01:43:05.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: omitting <html>, </html>, <body>, </body>, <head>, </head>, <tbody> or </tbody> is totally safe

[01:43:06.0000] <qfox>
i understand that

[01:44:00.0000] <qfox>
but it is also very error prone

[01:44:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: "family-name" is a cultural issue

[01:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: <p><table> depends on quirks vs. standards

[01:44:03.0000] <qfox>
especially to people new to html

[01:44:04.0000] <jgraham>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_name

[01:44:05.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: <p><article> depends on legacy parser vs. HTML5 parser

[01:44:06.0000] <qfox>
i'm sure it is, however, those should have a doctype telling the browser what behavior should be executed

[01:44:07.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: see jgraham's wikipedia link

[01:44:08.0000] <qfox>
anythng else would fall into quirksmode anyhow

[01:45:00.0000] <qfox>
(or should)

[01:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: well, if the doctype makes <p><table> a non-concern, then the only actually problematic case is <p><article>

[01:45:02.0000] <qfox>
and there's absolutely no workaround for that? i mean, the spec isnt finalized yet? 

[01:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: the workaround is writing <p></p><article>

[01:46:01.0000] <qfox>
ok so i guess an article cant be wrapped by p? sorry if that sounds like a silly question :)

[01:46:02.0000] <qfox>
and also. how is that still an argument _against_ forcing the closure of open tags..?

[01:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: can't in HTML5-compliant text/html parsing (without magic intervening tags)

[01:47:01.0000] <qfox>
because then it wouldnt be a workaround, it'd be a rule.

[01:47:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: omitting <body> isn't totally safe in ie

[01:47:03.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, that's true, but using family-name for "Jónsson" (from the wikipedia example) is semantically close enough

[01:47:04.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: nor old firefox

[01:47:05.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: how?

[01:48:00.0000] <qfox>
ok. i'm not talking about omitting tags here. i dont care about that right now. i'm just talking about closing a <p> when you open it. what problems arise when that would be enforced? 

[01:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ie inserts some tags to the head and then creates a non-tree

[01:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: you'd have to typo </p> more often when editing HTML by hand

[01:48:03.0000] <qfox>
yeah

[01:48:04.0000] <qfox>
that sounds like a real sound reason

[01:48:05.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: eww.

[01:48:06.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: e.g. for <!doctype html><div><form>lol

[01:48:07.0000] <qfox>
</sarcasm> . but are there any other reasons?

[01:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: firefox puts scripts in head for <!doctype html><div></div><script>alert(document.body)</script>

[01:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: not having to add </p> tags when upgrading pre-existing HTML5 content to HTML5

[01:49:02.0000] <qfox>
because that seems to be the only reason people come up with. that and "well it's part of the spec"

[01:49:03.0000] <qfox>
when upgrading, a lot has to be rewritten anyways

[01:49:04.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, I assume the conclusion from all of this is that we shouldn't try and restrict the *-name properties to single occurrences since the rules and conventions for names vary so much

[01:49:05.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: ouch. I *think* I've seen a bug report about that

[01:49:06.0000] <qfox>
the adding of closing tags should not be a problem at that point

[01:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: in the "will be fixed by HTML5 parser" bucket

[01:50:01.0000] <qfox>
in fact, if its so "difficult" it only proves the necessity

[01:50:02.0000] <qfox>
or supports it, at least.

[01:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
How so?

[01:51:00.0000] <qfox>
because if the code would be properly closed, the format and scoping would be easier to read

[01:51:01.0000] <qfox>
and thus better to maintain

[01:51:02.0000] <qfox>
like this example above

[01:51:03.0000] <qfox>
to upgrade from html4 to 5

[01:52:00.0000] <qfox>
a lot has to be rewritten anyways, right?

[01:52:01.0000] <qfox>
so you'd have to be able to read the existing code

[01:52:02.0000] <qfox>
scoping and everything

[01:52:03.0000] <gsnedders>
If you're compliant HTML 4.01 Strict, you have to change very little

[01:52:04.0000] <annevk>
I only had to change the DOCTYPE

[01:52:05.0000] <qfox>
doing so in code that's not properly closed is a ... far more difficult.

[01:52:06.0000] <hsivonen>
to read markup, you need to infer the close tags anyway

[01:52:07.0000] <qfox>
yes, but if you're compliant with html4, you're not.

[01:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if you trust on what's explicitly written, you'd be fooled, since the inference rules still apply

[01:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I'd say <p>foo\n<p>bar is just as clear as <p>foo</p>\n<p>bar</p>

[01:53:02.0000] <qfox>
with all the new tags in html5, can html4 be truly upgraded by just replacing the doctype?

[01:53:03.0000] <virtuelv>
yay

[01:53:04.0000] <virtuelv>
russian patronymics are even worse

[01:53:05.0000] <qfox>
that's like saying c++ is like c.

[01:53:06.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: a lot of HTML4 content can, yes

[01:53:07.0000] <virtuelv>
they are neither first, nor middle or last names

[01:53:08.0000] <qfox>
yes, a lot. but not all.

[01:53:09.0000] <qfox>
which was my point.

[01:53:10.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: a lot of C code can be assimilated to C++, too

[01:53:11.0000] <hsivonen>
by design

[01:54:00.0000] <qfox>
aye

[01:54:01.0000] <virtuelv>
mongolian names are nouns or adjectives

[01:55:00.0000] <qfox>
so far i've not heard any argument against it that's worth more than pro's of a properly structure html document. especially in regard of people new to the language and the error prone-ness of not closing tags.

[01:55:01.0000] <qfox>
laziness is not an argument that outweights that, imo.

[01:56:00.0000] <qfox>
(and there's IDE's for that :p)

[01:56:01.0000] <virtuelv>
some cultures do not seem to use sur/last/family names at all

[01:56:02.0000] <virtuelv>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname

[01:59:00.0000] <annevk>
qfox, laziness is a great argument

[01:59:01.0000] <annevk>
also backcompat with HTML4

[01:59:02.0000] <annevk>
no reason to break that over aesthetics 

[02:00:00.0000] <qfox>
there's more to it than just aesthetics. 

[02:00:01.0000] <pesla>
qfox: Most of it is personal preferene

[02:00:02.0000] <qfox>
but maybe pesla was right, they're more of a point to corporate environment..

[02:00:03.0000] <qfox>
and a coder's point of view.

[02:01:00.0000] <qfox>
but either your job is to write html, in which case the extra keys to press to write a closing tag comes natural for you, or you use an IDE to do this for you

[02:01:01.0000] <qfox>
or its not your job and the extra keypresses should not impact the rest of the cycle

[02:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes there are plenty of us who write HTML professionally who omit tags

[02:02:00.0000] <qfox>
yeah, i could comment on that, but i guess i'll leave it at that probably being part of the reason this discussion started in the first place.

[02:02:01.0000] <annevk>
my job is writing HTML and it does not come natural...

[02:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
the main reason the "allow tags to be optional" camp wins the argument is that if tags are optional, youcan still write software that acts as if they're not

[02:03:01.0000] <annevk>
in fact, what comes natural is omitting stuff :)

[02:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
but if they're not optional, you can't write software that acts as if they are

[02:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
so it's a simple tradeoff

[02:03:04.0000] <workmad3>
omitting tags isn't a problem, as long as you follow the spec wrt what tags can have their close omitted

[02:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
one way, you can get both behaviours, the other way you can only get one

[02:03:06.0000] <Hixie>
2>1

[02:04:00.0000] <qfox>
i can hardly believe that not closing tags is preferred from a professional point of view. starting at code maintainability and error proneness. exit at creating code for other people to use.

[02:04:01.0000] <qfox>
there's just so many things wrong there..

[02:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: gsnedders, annevk, Hixie and I write test cases as part of our professional activities

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: and I can assure you that people who write all the tags in profession test cases don't make their test cases immune to gotchas

[02:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: test cases don't need to be valid though

[02:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
including the <head> and <body> and <html> tags leads to more errors in my experience

[02:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: see http://twitter.com/hsivonen/status/7979756782

[02:06:02.0000] <qfox>
hsivonen: testcases (especially larger, complexer ones) would only benefit from closing tags because there's less chance of introducing bugs in your testcases.

[02:07:00.0000] <qfox>
and i'm not sure what that status update has to do with this discussion. but that's probably just me.

[02:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: the relevance of the tweet is that writing <head> or </body> explicitly didn't make test cases resilient to gotchas

[02:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
qfox: you're more likely to have bugs if you have the tags included

[02:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: because white space moves magically even if you have the tags

[02:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
qfox: how can you have bugs if you omit them?

[02:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
qdat least for <html>, <head>, and <body>

[02:08:05.0000] <Hixie>
er

[02:08:06.0000] <Hixie>
s/qdat/qfox:/

[02:08:07.0000] <qfox>
... testcases arent imune for bugs.

[02:09:00.0000] <qfox>
why do you need testcases if you omit bugs from your production code?

[02:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean how can omitting the tags introduce bugs that would be avoided by including them

[02:09:02.0000] <qfox>
:/

[02:09:03.0000] <qfox>
because you can make errors in scoping?

[02:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
not for <html>, <body>, and <head>

[02:09:05.0000] <qfox>
maybe. but if you do it for any other tag, why not those three as well.

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
because it avoids bugs

[02:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
and because i don't do it for hte other ones

[02:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
again, the spec allows you to include them, just as you want

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
why do you want to change the spec to disallow me from omitting them, as i want?

[02:11:01.0000] <pesla>
To protect people who don't know exactly what they are doing

[02:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
how does that protect them

[02:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
if they don't know what they're doing, they're not gonna be using a validator, and they'll never know

[02:11:04.0000] <qfox>
make a better organized document, prevent people from making mistakes in scoping, especially when editing code later

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
the conformance rules don't prevent the authors from doing anything if they don't know what they're doing

[02:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
they'll just make invalid documents

[02:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: the thing is that scoping mistakes aren't prevented, because the parser will still perform tag inference

[02:12:03.0000] <qfox>
how's that?

[02:12:04.0000] <qfox>
the whitespace example?

[02:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: well, people write <p> ... <table> ... </table> ... </p>

[02:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: now it looks like scoping is right

[02:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: but it'll still parse as <p> ... </p><table> ... </table> ... 

[02:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: so you can't just wish this stuff awy

[02:14:02.0000] <hsivonen>
away even

[02:14:03.0000] <zcorpan>
the trailing stray </p> will actually be parsed as <p></p>

[02:15:00.0000] <qfox>
shouldnt the parser either throw you in quirksmode in such case, or throw some kind of parsing error somehow?

[02:15:01.0000] <qfox>
rather than accept it, do what you say it will, and still be in "standards mode" ?

[02:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: excellent point

[02:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
qfox: no

[02:15:04.0000] <qfox>
i guess i'm thinking too idealy then.

[02:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I can't believe how poorly written the vCard RFC is. It's contradictory, doesn't define things clearly at all and forces readers to make assumptions based on examples and ambiguous wording.

[02:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose that makes it a typical RFC then.

[02:17:02.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: sounds like most specs

[02:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
you should let the hybi group know, they want me to change websockets to use the style more commonly used by RFCs

[02:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, ok. Who is the hybi group?

[02:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, I don't have time to finish reviewing it now. Maybe later tonight. But when I finish, I will have a lot of changes for you to make to the vcard conversion algorithm.

[02:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
238 people

[02:19:00.0000] <qfox>
oh. i didnt read that topic. silly me. sorry for that :p

[02:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
soooo. Where does the <script event="..."> stuff come from?

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Microsoft? the XHTML2 WG?

[02:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
XMLEvents, probably

[02:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
wasn't it a mozilla invention?

[02:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
actually no i think IE did it first

[02:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
and mozilla's is incomplete or something

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: CVS blame points to it being an IE compat thing: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174404

[02:24:00.0000] <pesla>
Is cp1252 always exchangable with windows-1252?

[02:24:01.0000] <pesla>
Err, interchangeable

[02:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It's an alias for it.

[02:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the scary part is that there's still code in the tree from handing the event attribute content to the script engine

[02:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
dunno if that's dead code, though

[02:25:03.0000] <pesla>
gsnedders: Yea, but I wasn't sure if windows-1252 caused problems.

[02:25:04.0000] <pesla>
In my memory it did, somewhere ;)

[02:28:00.0000] <workmad3>
anything non unicode will probably cause problems at some point

[02:28:01.0000] <workmad3>
anything unicode will probably cause problems straight away though :P

[02:28:02.0000] <pesla>
Migration to utf8 is a todo for this year :D

sweet jesus the hybi list beats even public-html in terms of people talking about minutiae that doesn't matter

[02:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
people are arguing about the reference to use for ASCII!

[02:41:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I think you play it somewhat close to what is described as "asshole" here though: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/16/specs :)

[02:42:00.0000] <annevk>
though you just argued your reference is more useful, so maybe not

[02:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
my argument here is that i really couldn't care less and think the entire argument is a complete waste of everyone's time

[02:44:00.0000] <workmad3>
/me likes the moron-asshole analogy :)

[02:54:00.0000] <annevk>
oh lol

[02:54:01.0000] <annevk>
the TAG said Web-keys might not be the best idea

[02:55:00.0000] <annevk>
well, Noah from the TAG said that

[02:55:01.0000] <annevk>
long emails follow

[02:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
are web keys like secret cruft in flickr image file urls?

nn

[02:57:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, yes, but in addition they're supposed to not leak

[02:57:02.0000] <annevk>
of course URLs leak everywhere

[02:58:00.0000] <annevk>
which as Noah's point

[02:58:01.0000] <annevk>
was*

[02:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
flickr private photo urls arem't supposed to leak, either

[02:58:03.0000] <annevk>
I see

[02:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
same design on facebook too, i believe

[03:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm, I thought CanvasPixelArray clamped rather than taking the modulus. Did that change or am I misreading something?

[03:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It used to clamp

[03:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
Now it seems to defer to WebIDL's octet definition, which moduluses

[03:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I think some people wanted it to match WebGL's typed arrays instead, but I don't know what they do)

[03:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Probably best to converge in the long term)

[03:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
do JS engines optimize the return value of charAt to a unsigned short type or does it really create a string object?

[03:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or is one supposed to use charCodeAt for high perf code?

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
TraceMonkey seems to have lots of specialisations for charCodeAt (for getting/returning ints and doubles) but none for charAt

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I see

[03:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and charAt always returns a new dependent string)

[03:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, another bug in your live microdata tool. The data URIs for download links should use charset=UTF-8 instead of encoding=utf-8

[03:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wishes he knew why X randomly decides to stop receiving any keyboard input for no apparent reason

[03:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
and usually fixes itself randomly after a few minutes

[03:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
(The keyboard's fine since I can switch to a text console)

[03:51:00.0000] <Wes_>
hi

[03:52:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: another? the first one wasn't mine ;) does capitalization of utf-8 matter for mime types, or would charset=utf-8 also be OK?

[03:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's case-insensitive

[03:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
and uppercase is ugly :-p

[03:53:02.0000] <foolip>
I agree

[03:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's typically --insensitive and _-insensitive too

[03:54:01.0000] <Wes_>
but once upon a time we wrote.... <FONT>

[03:54:02.0000] <Wes_>
and uppercase was cool

[03:54:03.0000] <Philip`>
so I can never define whether I prefer utf8 or utf-8

[03:55:00.0000] <Wes_>
font tag too :)

[03:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
Wes_: I don't remember it ever being cool

[03:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
It was just what one did because it's what everyone else did :-)

[03:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it made more sense in the early web, where you had more content than markup

[03:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
and so it was handy to make the markup stand out more

[03:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
but now it's the other way round

[03:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you often write whole pages with no textual content whatsoever

[03:57:01.0000] <Wes_>
eheh... nice era

[03:58:00.0000] <Wes_>
true!

[03:58:01.0000] <Wes_>
lot of pages are full-xmlhttp

[03:58:02.0000] <Wes_>
just tags and scripts

[03:59:00.0000] <Wes_>
hey... it's my first time here, english is not my first language and i'm sorry for this

[04:00:00.0000] <Wes_>
the flexible box model is part of whatwg?

[04:00:01.0000] <foolip>
Wes_: that would be the CSS WG

[04:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, lowercase "utf-8" is ugly.

[04:02:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: OK, as you wish

[04:02:01.0000] <Wes_>
and whatwg does not collaborate with csswg?

[04:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, I don't mind that much. It's up to you

[04:02:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me rather likes lowercase utf-8

[04:02:04.0000] <Lachy>
I was just countering Philip`s unsupported argument with one of my own.

[04:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Wes_: collaboration with the CSS WG happens informally or formally with HTML WG hats on

[04:11:00.0000] <Wes_>
what do you think about aside element?

[04:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Wes_: seems to address a common use case (pull quotes)

[04:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and sidebars

[04:13:00.0000] <Wes_>
but is visual, not structural... i mean... i believe in convergence of html and xhtml

[04:16:00.0000] <Wes_>
the mean is "not so important"? xD its a floated element placed before the real content... so parsers like search engines can identify "real content" and "additional content"?

[04:17:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: fixed

[04:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Wes_: It seems pretty important to me. See e.g. the BBC which has lots of stuff like <p>Some text</p><div class=aside>A random quote</div><p>Some text that follows the previous paragraph</p>

[04:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
(their markup doesn't look quite like that but the idea is the same)

[04:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
So a UA reading the page would likely want to skip the <div> first time around and just read the main content

[04:22:00.0000] <Wes_>
maybe it is too generic

[04:23:00.0000] <Wes_>
an "asided" element can be a paragraph

[04:23:01.0000] <Wes_>
<p aside="aside">

[04:23:02.0000] <Wes_>
<p class="aside">

[04:24:00.0000] <Wes_>
a standard classname

[04:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Wes_: But it can also be several paragraphs as in a pull-out box that you get in magazines

[04:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
And people really don't like standard classnames

[04:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
(because they can clash with authour-defined classnames)

[04:26:00.0000] <Wes_>
and what people think about aside? and browser vendors?

[04:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Wes_: I believe "people" are divided on aside

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Wes_: I don't recall browser vendors objecting to it

[04:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure that "browser vendors" have officla opinions on it

[04:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Wes_: and browser vendors usually don't promise support

[04:27:03.0000] <Wes_>
lol, usually just one vendor

[04:27:04.0000] <Wes_>
xD

[04:27:05.0000] <jgraham>
e.g. I work for a browser vendor and I like <aside> but that's not any sort of official position

[04:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
I mean, it's not clear that desktop browsers will do a lot with it. Behaviourally it is more useful for search engines and AT and so on

[04:28:01.0000] <Wes_>
but whatwg isn't a consortium of browser vendors?

[04:30:00.0000] <Wes_>
and big it companies?

[04:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Wes_: the whatwg is an informal gathering of people initiated by a group of people working for browser vendors

[04:30:02.0000] <Wes_>
*IT

[04:30:03.0000] <Wes_>
ah

[04:30:04.0000] <foolip>
Wes_: kind of, but only people have opinions and they tend to differ (even when sharing the same employer)

[04:30:05.0000] <Wes_>
so none is changed

[04:30:06.0000] <foolip>
for example, I work for the same browser vendor as jgraham, but think <aside> is kind of ugly (not ugly enough to care though)

[04:33:00.0000] <Wes_>
why not web polls? so users can decide, not implementors

[04:33:01.0000] <Wes_>
?

[04:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Wes_: users don't have commit access to the code repositories that browsers are built from

[04:34:00.0000] <Wes_>
no.. just "do you like aside?" yes|no

[04:34:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That wouldn't be very useful

[04:34:02.0000] <foolip>
Wes_: if you're able to organize fair and representative polls that gather real opinions of real web authors, I'm sure it would be taken into account

[04:34:03.0000] <Dashiva>
You'd have to make sure everyone answering had a proper and full understanding of what aside is, and what it is meant for

[04:35:00.0000] <foolip>
but I don't know how that wouldn't turn into a big cheating fest though

[04:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Just look at OOXML to see what happens when you do voting :P

[04:35:02.0000] <Wes_>
it is difficult... but with collaboration can be done

[04:35:03.0000] <Wes_>
lol

[04:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
It is not clear that design-by-poll leads to the best outcome

[04:37:01.0000] <Wes_>
anyway... browser wars made the web... so this is not so bad

[04:39:00.0000] <Wes_>
and... what about html5 served as xml?

[04:39:01.0000] <Wes_>
it can be done?

[04:40:00.0000] <Wes_>
can i use my own xml namespaces with html5?

[04:41:00.0000] <foolip>
Wes_: only if you serve it as XML

[04:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
But first you should realise that you probably son't want to

[04:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
*don't

[04:43:00.0000] <Wes_>
why not?

[04:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Because it's more complex and fragile, and in most cases it doesn't give you any useful benefits

[04:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and because Philip` will break your site by posting U+FFFE in a comment

[04:47:01.0000] <Wes_>
LOL?

[04:49:00.0000] <Wes_>
we use namespaces for browser based apps. not public websites... some of my developers works without collaboration on the same thing... and everyone works on a different namespace,

[04:49:01.0000] <Wes_>
for readability too

[04:49:02.0000] <Wes_>
custom tags are cool... class="" its hard to manage

[04:49:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Wes_: different XML namespace?

[04:49:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Wes_: for each developer?

[04:49:05.0000] <Wes_>
yes

[04:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow

[04:50:01.0000] <Wes_>
lol... namespace for every feature

[04:50:02.0000] <Wes_>
not for every developer xD

[04:54:00.0000] <Wes_>
anyway i'm using a lot of html5 features, drag & drop is cool, file apis too

[04:54:01.0000] <Wes_>
do you will write someting about clipboard management?

[05:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, when is something dom-x versus dom-window-x?

[05:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if a snowstorm makes it enough like Christmas that if he closes his eyes and wishes hard enough for a window.atob and window.btoa spec, it might come true

[05:55:00.0000] <annevk>
are they complicated?

[05:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
I thought nobody uses them

[05:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
except for feature detection

[05:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/feature detection/browser sniffing/

[05:56:00.0000] <foolip>
function atob(s){return s.replace(/a/g, 'b');}

[05:56:01.0000] <foolip>
is that it?

[05:56:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Worst function names ever

[05:56:03.0000] <foolip>
/me looks up what they really are

[05:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
base64 stuff

[05:57:01.0000] <workmad3>
ah, 'ascii to binary' :)

[05:58:00.0000] <workmad3>
yeah, worst names ever

[05:58:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And surely no one would ever think the 'b' is for base64

[05:58:02.0000] <workmad3>
/me wonders what's wrong with base64encode and base64decode

[05:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
foolip: Why not just s.replace("a", "b")?

[05:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that atoi does something very different in C

[05:59:02.0000] <foolip>
gsnedders: doesn't that just replace the first occurence?

[05:59:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Should it not be in HTML 5 on the Window interface?

[05:59:04.0000] <gsnedders>
foolip: I don'th tihnk so, but I get things like that wrong often, so it's possible

[06:00:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Dashiva: I actually implemented those backwards

[06:00:01.0000] <annevk>
hixie thought they should be in ECMA

[06:00:02.0000] <annevk>
that's not going to happen of course

[06:00:03.0000] <foolip>
gsnedders: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0D%0A%3Cscript%3Ew('aa'.replace('a'%2C'b'))%3C%2Fscript%3E

[06:01:00.0000] <foolip>
silly default in my opinion (I was right)

[06:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't get anything written to the log in Chrome 4.  Maybe because of XSS prevention?

[06:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I have to do something like w("some string constant") to get the log working in Chrome for some reason

[07:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is getting ridiculous.  Now it's registered users changing the dates around too.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Resistor#Your_change_to_HTML5

[07:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But that's what the charter says!

[07:31:01.0000] <annevk>
who cares anyway

[07:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If nobody cared about fixing mistakes in Wikipedia, it wouldn't be a very useful resource, would it?

[07:33:00.0000] <annevk>
it's not that useful for Web standards I think

[07:33:01.0000] <annevk>
and I know ideally I should help fix it, but conflict of interest would be pretty high

[07:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's useful for web standards if you don't know anything about web standards, which most people don't.

[07:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not if you idle in #whatwg all the time, of course.

[07:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And it's not a conflict of interest just because you're a WHATWG/HTMLWG member.  If that sort of thing counted, nobody could edit anything they knew much about.

[07:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, is this article awesome or what: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tables_of_vampire_traits

[07:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Totally useless, but, awesome.

[07:42:00.0000] <annevk>
I still don't like that they killed the unique page for each Pokemon thing

[07:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I hate deletionists.

[07:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
:(

[07:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I like how just about every Wikipedia article of any importance contains a reference to some dumbassed video game

[07:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakamoto_Ryōma

[07:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://xkcd.com/446/

[07:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Those sections need to be killed with fire.

[07:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
"In the video game Live A Live, Sakamoto Ryōma appears as a playable character."

[07:47:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me checks for policies

[07:47:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems like "kill them with fire" isn't the current policy, more like "do actual work to improve them", so I guess I'll leave it.

[07:48:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, yeah, popular culture is always funny

[07:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think the Wikipedia edtards should create a special admoninition: "This Wikipedia article currently contains no references to any dumbassed video games. Therefore because it can't possibly important, it is being consider for deletion."

[07:49:01.0000] <meledin>
Don't knock it! Wikipedia is the world's foremost resource on fiction.

[07:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Not to mention dumbassed video games

[07:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Those count as fiction.

[07:54:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
They have free-speech protection in the US and everything!

[07:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if it's bad to be eating ceral at 5 pm because he's peckish

[07:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I read a Ninth Circuit decision that mentioned, in passing, that even if you could come up with definitive evidence that playing violent video games increased crime rates, you still couldn't restrict them because of that, because the harm is too indirect and tenuous.

[07:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
No but it would be bad to be eating birdseed because you were peckish

[07:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me almost spits out cereal on to his laptop laughing at that

[07:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Careful, it will end up like Hixie's.

[07:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't remember Hixie's laptop looking noticably bad

[08:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"In the video game This Could be You, a Wikipedia contributor suffers a life-threatening ass kicking after adding one too many dumbassed non-sequitor junk-culture references to a Wikipedia aricle."

[08:06:00.0000] <meledin>
Citation needed.

[08:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
AryehGregor: the title text on http://xkcd.com/446/ is especially good

[08:33:01.0000] <crankharder>
say I wanted to implement an "offline" version of my app that was used primarily for bare-bones data entry -- when the user reconnects this data would then be sent up to the server somehow. I was thinking of using HTML5's client-side DB, how stable is that at this point in Chrome/Safari/FF(?)?  What other hoops do you think there might be?

[11:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/02/an-html5-offline-image-editor-and-uploader-application/ is a neat demo

[11:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I like how the blog post says "You'll need Firefox 3.6".  Standards are great, right?  (It's probably not true, though.)

[11:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Does webkit have CORS?

[11:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think it has the other bits needed

[11:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh does it use the file API? I guess only firefox has that at the moment

[11:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, maybe.

[11:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders why WebKit and Gecko tend to implement roughly the same sets of features, while Opera often implements totally different parts of the same specs or entirely different specs.

[11:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I don't think that's really true, is it?

[11:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know, I've noticed it in a bunch of cases.

[11:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like border-radius, Gecko and WebKit both implemented that way before Opera.

[11:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But Opera implemented Web Forms way before either of them, for instance.

[11:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(not that those two examples are comparable in scope)

[11:30:03.0000] <jgraham>
It's not really fair to compare with 10.10 because that is rather old (from a Core point of view)

[11:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Compare what with 10.10?

[11:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Gecko/WebKit implemented border-radius long before 10.10 was released, right?

[11:31:02.0000] <jgraham>
The current tate of gecko and webkit

[11:31:03.0000] <jgraham>
*state

[11:31:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also both implemented video/audio before Opera did.

[11:31:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not, I'm comparing who implemented what first.

[11:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And Opera implemented <datalist>, Gecko/WebKit not.

[11:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: It is pretty difficult to tell when Opera implements things because they have not always shipped soon after implementation

[11:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, I see.

[11:32:03.0000] <jgraham>
although the plan is to do better at that

[11:32:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, forget implemented, let's say released.

[11:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
border-radius: Firefox 1.0, Safari 3.0, Opera what?  9.50?

[11:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
Web Forms is certianly a fair example. I don't know the details but I guess Opera betted on other people implementing it and that didn't happen 

[11:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
Or hasn't happened yet

[11:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
video: Firefox 3.5, Safari ?, Opera 9.50.

[11:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
WebKit is starting to implement WF2.0.

[11:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe WebKit and Gecko are more public about their under-development features, and tend to track each other because they're more prominent?  Dunno.

[11:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I implement cool features if at least one browser supports them, even if it's only Opera, so Opera will get the fancy Web Forms stuff when Wikipedia switches to HTML5 (whenever that is).

[11:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Validator.nu uses type=url

[11:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: You are atypical in that respect. Most people only care if x% of browsers by marketshare implement something where x is typically larger than Opera alone (on desktop)

[11:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, yeah, I know.

[11:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
(in western europe and north ameria)

[11:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm implementing because it's cool, not because it's a pragmatically good use of my time.   :P

[11:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is sad about <datalist> not working well in Opera for search suggestions, but WebKit might get it reasonably soon.

[11:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nobody does anything useful for type=url except the iPhone, I think.  MediaWiki uses search, number, email, and maybe a couple others.  A bit of pattern.  And lots and lots of autofocus.  :)

[11:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: If there is a problem with the feature you should file a bug 

[11:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, I did.

[11:40:02.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Oh, good

[11:40:03.0000] <jgraham>
thanks

[11:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Same as I did with the pattern attribute when I figured out that it's not very handy for password fields.

[11:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If another browser implements either feature, I'm going to have to uncomment the code with a browser version check, so I hope you guys fix it before then.

[11:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(neither problem can be feature-sniffed from JS AFAICT)

[11:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, seriously, why are Chromium people calling their notification system "HTML5 notifications"?

[11:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Are they specced anywhere vendor-neutral?

[11:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I thought it was just an error in their Chrome 4 announcement, but it's here too: http://dev.chromium.org/developers/linux-technical-faq

[11:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe because the notifications themselves are HTML?

[11:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me i being generous

[11:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: everything new is HTML5

[11:59:01.0000] <virtuelv>
AryehGregor: because hixie tried to add it to html5 at some pojnt

[11:59:02.0000] <virtuelv>
point, even

[11:59:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, I'm okay with that as long as it's on a standards track.

[11:59:04.0000] <virtuelv>
it's not

[12:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assume they'll try to get it standardized at some point, but still.

[12:00:01.0000] <virtuelv>
because hixie ripped it out again

[12:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, well, at least it was in HTML5 at some point, then.

[12:01:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I would like to see notifications as well[1], but I recall having some objections to the notifications that were there

[12:02:00.0000] <virtuelv>
[1] Opera implements the following: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-widgets-specification-fourth-ed/#wo_getAttention

[12:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: does showNotification() go to Growl on Mac and D-Bus on Ubuntu?

[12:05:01.0000] <virtuelv>
currently, I think not

[12:06:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Gnome's notifications are problematic, since you can't acknowledge them

[12:06:01.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: although, 10.50 uses Growl

[12:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: nice (growl), but why do you need to ack?

[12:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
my growl stuff fades away

[12:07:02.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: you don't need to

[12:07:03.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: the use case would be something like

[12:08:00.0000] <virtuelv>
"I have 2214 new messages, take me to my inbox because I chose to acknowledge"

[12:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think clicking the bubble on growl should bring the originator tab to front

[12:09:01.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: also note that notifications in Opera are used in Opera unite

[12:09:02.0000] <virtuelv>
which don't have a visible window

[12:14:00.0000] <roc>
I'm not sure that supporting HTML in notifications is a good idea

[12:14:01.0000] <roc>
given it means you can't use Growl or libnotify

[12:14:02.0000] <roc>
the use-cases for arbitrary HTML in notifications would have to be pretty strong

[12:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
virtuelv: I am quite the fan of the new ubuntu notifications

[12:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well not really but they seem very clean, which is nice

[12:21:00.0000] <roc>
I have to say that mentioning "HTML5 notifications" in an FAQ is a much less egregious error than others I've seen

[12:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
On the subject of large numbers of messages, I wonder why thunderbird persists in telling me that I have 6147 unread emails by labelling the dock icon. I obviously don't care so why add the visual noise?

[12:59:00.0000] <virtuelv>
jgraham: it's thunderbird's way of telling you you should switch to an e-mail client where inbox 0 is achievable :-)

[13:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: i told them to experiment and prove their idea before we add it to html5

What is upposed to happen if I delete an index property from a CanvasPixelArray?

[14:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
*supposed

[14:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
I can't see anything special in the spec which suggests it works like an ordinary js object i.e. the property gets removed 

[14:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
But I wonder if that is detrimental to performance

[15:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
(Needless to say cross browser compatibility here is negligible, but Opera, Safari and Chrome seem to agree that properties should not be deleted by 'delete' even though Chrome and Safari return 'true' for the delete operation. Also Safari doesn't seem to support hasOwnProperty on the CanvasPixelArray)

[15:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: There's no deleter operator on the interface, so delete wouldn't do anything (unless there was a real JS property to delete)

[15:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Interesting. But why does an index property not count as a real property? It returns true for hasOwnProperty?

[15:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/?//

[15:04:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
roc: not really; then they could keep selling their dev tools, but output HTML5 and stop maintaining their runtime (which they give away)

[15:05:00.0000] <roc>
sure

[15:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Specifically in http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#delete we must get to step 3 because otherwise properties with deleter set wouldn't be deleted

[15:05:02.0000] <roc>
I think they'd face more competition in HTML5 tools

[15:05:03.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: But step 3 doesn't apply so we end up in step 5

[15:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
i wish they'd face competition in HTML5 tools

[15:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: The way the interface is specified, there is no JS property/ies respresenting the actual data

[15:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's like a java object with only getValue and setValue

[15:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: I see your argument but it is wholely unclear to me that that is how it is intended to work

[15:08:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, it has been a long time since I read WebIDL, let me check that it hasn't changed incompatibly underneath me

[15:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
It also leads to the strange behaviour where delete CanvasPixelArray[index] unconditionally does nothing yet always returns true

[15:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, here it is

[15:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I was partially wrong. The properties for the indexes are indeed created. However, they are created with { DontDelete }

[15:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
Ah, that sounds promising

[15:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me finds that

[15:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It should return false on delete, though

[15:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Thanks

[15:12:02.0000] <Dashiva>
(Since they're DontDelete)

[15:12:03.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Sure. WebKit browsers are wrong

[15:12:04.0000] <jgraham>
(and Firefox is very wrong)

[15:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is happy because this is how he assumed it would work in the first place :)

[15:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(I suppose their code might be based on earlier webidl where the properties didn't exist at all)

[15:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, that probably sounded criticl in a way that I din't intend

[15:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
*critical

[15:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is looking forward to the new version of WebIDL based on ES5, hopefully with the same improvements to algorithm readability

[15:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't envy anyone the task of making it compatible with both es3 and es5 :)

If I had a text selection plugin that selected text from X to Y, would you think that Y was a length or an absolute distance like X?

[16:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[16:12:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yes to which?

[16:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
I wouldn't assume one particular behaviour - JS isn't even self-consistent, with substr vs substring

[16:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
so I'd check the documentation

the reason validator.nu didn't have that same bug is that the mistake was in the assertions.sch (Schematron) file, which v.nu doesn't actually use (it uses some workalike Java code now)

[20:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does CORS limit what headers can be sent cross-site using a whitelist or a blacklist?

[20:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess it's a whitelist unless you opt into more

[21:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: anything interesting on the hybi list today? i saw masses of traffic but haven't read it yet

[21:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: useful info about close handshake and what it takes to make one that actually works (depending on what you are trying to achieve)

[21:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[21:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>

[21:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I will ask abarth to look at the latter as soon as it appears in the archives

[21:21:00.0000] <Hixie>

i've decided to take a new approach to the whole "Flash is ready now, HTML5 won't be ready til 2022" thing.

[23:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
"2022 is the date I estimate there'll be two complete and bug-free implementations of HTML5. What's the estimated date for when there'll be two complete and bug-free implementations of Flash?"

[23:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is Adobe Flash Player axiomatically bug-free?

[23:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
can reference impls have bugs?

[23:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but, yeah, that's the appropriate response

[23:27:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought Flash was over?

[23:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[00:13:00.0000] <Lerc>

[00:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[00:16:01.0000] <meledin>
youtube.com/html5?

[00:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but I've disabled Flash in Fennec on my N800

[00:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
meledin: I use a browser that doesn't support proprietary codecs except via NPAPI

[00:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah i did consider that one of the possible follow-ups would be to say something like "i'm feeling generous. How about an ETA for _one_ bug-free implementation?" but that's not really the point I wanted to make. :-)

[00:17:02.0000] <annevk>

and one of them isn't even available to IP addresses associated with Finland

[00:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like I whitelisted hulu while traveling

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the whitelist being google.com, hulu.com, lufthansa.com, thedailyshow.com, vimeo.com, youtube.com, google.fi and sony.fi

[00:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so one airline whose online check-in is implemented cluelessly

[00:21:01.0000] <matijsb>

[00:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
one product catalog site that is implemented cluelessly

[00:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Google Maps

[00:21:04.0000] <hsivonen>
plus video sites

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm sure other people have other kinds of lists, but it seems that everything on my list could already be done with browser-native features in Firefox, Chrome and Safari (and soon Opera)

[00:22:01.0000] <meledin>
All I know is I developed a disdain for Flash once I realised it was the cause of 100% CPU use on one core whenever it activated, no matter what it was doing

[00:23:00.0000] <meledin>
Also that gave me a handy excuse to ignore any youtube links

[00:25:00.0000] <matijsb>
Flash has been abused for the wrong purpose too many times

[01:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does XHR send Referer?

[01:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
If so, that's a third way in which UMP might not be a CORS subset (unless CORS is taken to give license to exclude it)

[01:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, yes

[01:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[01:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor updated it to 1.6 beta

[01:14:03.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: should CORS with a unique identifier Origin strip Refer, or would that happen automatically?

[01:14:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[01:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: the change seems to have possibly broken the mechanism that validator.nu uses for parsing out the alt-advice from the Wiki

[01:15:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, it would not happen automatically

[01:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
what Refer (if any) gets sent when you have a unique identifier origin?

[01:15:03.0000] <othermaciej>
er, Referer

[01:15:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: and maybe also the code for retrieving microsyntax info

[01:15:05.0000] <othermaciej>
it's so hard to type the misspelling!

[01:16:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, heh

[01:16:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, I'm not sure really

[01:16:02.0000] <annevk>
I've no idea how Referer is constructed usually

[01:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
does XHR specify anything about Referer?

[01:17:00.0000] <annevk>
Only that authors cannot manipulate it iirc

[01:17:01.0000] <annevk>
Yup, that's all

[01:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does HTML5 specify the Refer to use when the origin is a unique identifier? (and would that apply to XHR or CORS?)

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if the old MediaWiki used <h2> for "Contents"

[01:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(I'm trying to figure out what bugs if any I need to file)

[01:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: look for the "fetch" algorithm

[01:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it says how to determine Referer

[01:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: let me know if it needs changing

[01:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe the code needs to scrape span class="mw-headline" instead of h2

[01:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: no hits on the term "fetch algorithm"

[01:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#fetch

[01:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
well there are, but all relating to media elements

[01:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it looks like the computation of Referer does not specifically consider whether the origin is a unique identifier

[01:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"Generate the address of the resource from which Request-URIs are obtained as required by HTTP for the Referer (sic) header from the document's current address of the appropriate Document as given by the following list."

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess it just always gives the full URL currently

[01:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
data: and all

[01:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think it should probably say that no Referer should be sent if the  origin is a unique identifier

[01:22:03.0000] <annevk>
XMLHttpRequest does not use "fetch"

[01:22:04.0000] <othermaciej>
both for the sake of data: and for the sake of sandboxed iframes

[01:23:00.0000] <annevk>
I tried, but it did not work out for some reason

[01:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: XHR probably needs to spec Referer itself then

[01:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. weird. the first list item has the right content at least at the start

[01:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
or rather, what URI to use for Referer as required by HTTP

[01:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: can you enter a bug using the review feedback tool?

[01:24:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, yeah :/

[01:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: doing it the old fashioned way

[01:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yeah, I noticed the same thing

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: thanks

[01:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know if the fullscreen thread has reached a conclusion i can spec? was the security problem figured out?

[01:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have 300 e-mails on video that i should get around to replying to

[01:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
and 143 on parsing

[01:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I need to read the video thread

[01:26:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the fullscreen thread rather

[01:26:04.0000] <othermaciej>
and the es-discuss threads on modules

[01:27:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought the fullscreen thread was awaiting some input from WebKit

[01:27:01.0000] <annevk>
but maybe I missed something

[01:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
then I better read it

[01:27:03.0000] <othermaciej>
though I know Simon posted

[01:28:00.0000] <annevk>
oh yeah, hmm

[01:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe that for subtle reasons the fullscreen video API we have in WebKit is secure, but I would much prefer a general fullscreen API (not sure why we did not do that) and that might be a harder problem

[01:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
filed http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8869

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I'm not sure if CORS needs to specify Referer behavior in addition to XHR

[01:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd love to know how it's secure :-)

[01:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: it looks like the condition for moving out of IN_PROSE is brittle

[01:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think you can't use it to fool the user into thinking it's the OS because it has a distinct animation going into it (so it's clear what is happening), because it shows controls when it first pops up, and because it requires a user event to pop it up (so it can't just go fullscreen while you are AFK)

[01:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it also doesn't accept keyboard input

[01:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure what other security risks people are worried about

[01:30:03.0000] <hsivonen>
this is not as bad as reading one's old Perl code, but I wish I had written down what I was thinking when I wrote the exit condition for IN_PROSE

[01:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aah. now I remember

[01:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[01:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: ew, not allowing keyboard input is a pretty coarse solution

[01:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: effective, mind you

[01:31:04.0000] <hsivonen>
MediaWiki has moved to id='foo' and gotten rid of the <a name> cruft

[01:31:05.0000] <hsivonen>
so yay, I guess

[01:32:00.0000] <annevk>
so they're up to 2000 standards now?

[01:32:01.0000] <annevk>
good for them!

[01:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/track/issues/115

[01:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well, it's sufficient for <video>, but not really for arbitrary full-screen

[01:33:01.0000] <annevk>
yay, issues

[01:33:02.0000] <annevk>
we'll do eternal WD for XHR

[01:33:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: a full-screen video should not need the ability to handle arbitrary user events (since in our current model at least it gets built-in standard controls)

[01:33:04.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I don't think that one warrants coming out of CR or redoing LC or whatever

[01:33:05.0000] <annevk>
sometimes it would be nice to have a WHATWG copy I could mark as Draft Standard so people would implement it

[01:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is anyone currently unwilling to implement it due to the current status?

[01:34:01.0000] <annevk>
Boris Zbarsky has indicated that, though maybe it is no longer true

[01:34:02.0000] <annevk>
not sure about the IE guys either

[01:35:00.0000] <annevk>
(of course Firefox does implement all the new features)

[01:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i've suggested setting something up so i can import XHR into the complete.html spec on the fly :-)

[01:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if Firefox is refusing to implement the bug fixes because the spec is not CR, that is major weaksauce

[01:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
like I said though I don't think the Referer issue should block CR

[01:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: wouldn't that contaminate the spec's license?

[01:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it is not an error per se, just a case where something is underspecified by the other relevant specs

[01:36:02.0000] <annevk>
no, it's more that he's not interested in spending much time on it

[01:36:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess if it goes CR it can be in Acid4

[01:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: well anne would have to relicense it, yeah

[01:36:05.0000] <annevk>
Acid4 hopefully has new criteria

[01:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
then, after copious whining about how acid tests suck, Mozilla and IE would conform to the spec

[01:37:01.0000] <annevk>
and yeah, it should test every single bug, twice

[01:37:02.0000] <annevk>
we'll get to REC in no time :)

[01:38:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, you think we still want UMP if we can get AnonXMLHttpRequest?

[01:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I don't buy Tyler's arguments for why we need it if CORS clearly has a mode that is equivalent to UMP

[01:38:02.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, if so I'm not sure AnonXMLHttpRequest or XMLHttpRequest(anon=true) is worth it

[01:39:00.0000] <annevk>
k

[01:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: his argument that CORS should be written as a UMP extension in particular does not sway me, since UMP is not written in a way that seems to allow extensions

[01:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me strongly prefers an argument and not a whole new object

[01:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
whether AnonXMLHttpRequest uses UMP or a CORS mode doesn't really matter much to me though

[01:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
i guarantee a whole new object will result in a whole set of new bugs

[01:40:00.0000] <annevk>
it's a new constructor

[01:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I have mixed feelings

[01:40:02.0000] <annevk>
not object

[01:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
benefits of new object:

[01:40:04.0000] <annevk>
it's not a new object!

[01:40:05.0000] <annevk>
:)

[01:40:06.0000] <othermaciej>
1) slightly easier for Caja-like things to do their thing

[01:40:07.0000] <othermaciej>
2) could remove or further restrict APIs that you are not allowed to use for an anonymous request

[01:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for example, it could completely lack the ability to set the credentials flag

[01:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
instead of having to specify that for the anon case, it is ignored or raises an exception

[01:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
should lack the ability to set custom headers other than the whitelist too

[01:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but that wouldn't remove API, just add more restrictions

[01:41:04.0000] <hsivonen>
so wasn't Caja supposed to be magic that makes advertising JS safe on exising browsers?

[01:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and new Caja requires changes to the browser platform?

[01:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/new/now/

[01:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it doesn't require changes

[01:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: JS constructors are objects

[01:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: so technically... :-P

[01:42:05.0000] <othermaciej>
right now if you wanted to use a Caja-like solution that allowed XHR, you would have to write an elaborate facade

[01:42:06.0000] <othermaciej>
with XMLHttpRequest(anon=true), the facade would be a lot simpler

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sure if you were writing Caja you'd want control over the API anyway, so you'd write the facade either way

[01:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
with AnonXMLHttpRequest(), it could be even simpler than that

[01:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hasn't read all the UM stuff carefully

[01:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if it were easier for Google to tell advertisers to write Java to a tiny API and run a trusted copy of the GWT compiler with JSNI disabled for advertiser-originated code at Google's end

[01:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
seems easier to lock down $ENTIRE_DIFFERENT_LANGUAGE compiled to JS than JS itself

[01:50:00.0000] <annevk>
boo, Nexus One is done by Vodafone in the Netherlands

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: hat's what Caja is

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[01:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's, even

[01:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: isn't it an unlocked device?

[01:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: oh. Is Caja's $ENTIRE_DIFFERENT_LANGUAGE just a JS lookalike?

[01:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't like any solution with GWT as a component

[01:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah

[01:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: because the GWT toolkit is bad for the Web?

[01:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the GWT *compiler* is cool

[01:56:03.0000] <jgraham>
Because GWT is bad for my sanity

[01:56:04.0000] <hsivonen>
/me disapproves of the toolkit

[01:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i think in fact it _is_ JS

[01:56:06.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: just running in a different context

[01:56:07.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: which is then compiled to run on the web context

[01:56:08.0000] <jgraham>
(specifically debugging problems in GWT generated code is bad for my sanity)

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I see

[01:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't GWT have a debugger?

[01:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
(which is a very self-centred viewpoint but there you have it)

[01:57:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I thought you disapproved of Opera-unfriendliness of the browser-specific code paths in the toolkit

[01:57:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh you mean other people's code

[01:57:05.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: That too

[01:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes someone wrote a competitive GUI toolkit for GWT without browser sniffing

[01:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although I don't really know how much that is endemic to the toolkit and how much is application-specific

[01:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
my only use of GWT deliberately exorcises the toolkit and browser sniffing

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I thought building in Web Worst Practices in the toolkit was a major performance selling point

[01:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(loading code on a per-browser basis for 3 browsers)

[02:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(or maybe 4)

[02:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I have never really investigated the sasuage factory, just picked apart some of the sasuages

[02:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if the V8 hidden classes feature manages to reidentify the Java classes 

[02:05:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, ah yeah, there's that

[02:05:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I read an article that just talked about Vodafone... didn't really think further (also, it's not out yet)

[02:06:00.0000] <annevk>
all this global market but local rules stuff makes me sad

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Web5 exists already http://web5.w3.org/

[02:15:01.0000] <annevk>
Web4 too, by that measure :)

[02:54:00.0000] <annevk>
omg, drama over nothing

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: ?

[03:09:00.0000] <annevk>
over at the neighbors in #html-wg

[03:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the BBC is endin their Real Media feeds

[03:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I can't recall when I've last played Real Media

[03:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I see

[03:12:00.0000] <annevk>
I wish there were better text heuristic tools. We could feed them lots of IRC logs and email and make a whine-o-meter

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I see a potential 20% time Google project 

[03:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
using favicon in notifications makes svg favicons more useful

[04:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders where the API docs are for making this UI show up: http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/Aa511497.notifications16%28en-us,MSDN.10%29.png

[04:01:00.0000] <boogyman>
hsivonen: unless you're building a desktop application, CSS3 can handle drop shadows... ask over in #css for more information

[04:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
boogyman: I meant the Windows API for showing such a notification

[04:05:00.0000] <boogyman>
I am sure there is a #microsoft based channel that can solve your inquiry

[04:06:00.0000] <annevk>
prolly no need to tell hsivonen how to search :)

[04:06:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i'm under the impression that there's no standard api for notifications in windows, since different apps seem to have different options and style for notifications

[04:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but then again i don't know anything about windows apis

[04:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok well i should sleep

[04:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:07:03.0000] <boogyman>
t/c Hixie 

[04:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511497.aspx makes it look like there's an OS service

[04:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but they don't bother linking to the APIs

[04:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Shell_NotifyIcon seems to be the OS-provided way

[04:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but then everyone implements their own different versions)

[04:49:01.0000] <virtuelv>
fwiw, on h.264 vs. Theora:

[04:49:02.0000] <virtuelv>
http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/axhld/no_you_cant_do_that_with_h264/c0jwnjx

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk>
so does YouTube pay for all those people encoding their videos?

[04:51:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[04:51:02.0000] <annevk>
but yeah, non-free exchange standards suck

[04:51:03.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: Freedom Zero FTW

[04:51:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: thanks

[04:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: a more interesting question is: does Blip.tv pay MPEG-LA when the users of the service run the H.264 encoders

[04:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I always think "legacy" when I see "DWORD"

[04:55:01.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: a more interesting question is "does anyone who encodes h.264 have to pay"

[04:55:02.0000] <virtuelv>
the answer to that seems to be clear

[04:56:00.0000] <virtuelv>
and buying software to do so, doesn't buy you that freedom, it seems

[04:56:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I wonder what kind of license h.264 as encoded by my camera has

[04:56:02.0000] <virtuelv>
can I actually distribute those videos without re-encoding them?

[04:56:03.0000] <meledin>
For personal, non-commercial use? Probably

[04:57:00.0000] <meledin>
Commercially I think they use some form of "broadcast territory" notion when dealing with internet streaming

[04:57:01.0000] <meledin>
(Though what broadcast or territory means for the internet is conspicuously undefined)

[04:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the blip.tv ToS has nothing about "MPEG"

[04:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
So if I were to use my camera to make a promo video for some company, I might have to unexpectedly pay MPEG-LA?

[04:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
my camera outputs Motion JPEG...

[04:59:01.0000] <virtuelv>
jgraham: that's my question

[04:59:02.0000] <virtuelv>
my camera does avchd

[05:00:00.0000] <virtuelv>
or even: If my camera allows such distribution, I'm screwed if I have to edit off-camera

[05:01:00.0000] <virtuelv>
what if I transcode from an original h.264 source to, say Ogg? Am I in trouble then too?

[05:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like nessy has published a paper about this: http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/view/21/45

[05:02:01.0000] <meledin>
According to 

[05:02:02.0000] <meledin>
eek

[05:03:00.0000] <meledin>
copy/paste fail

[05:03:01.0000] <meledin>
According to this pdf on mpegla's site they don't seem interested in collecting fees for anything other than codec manufacturers and broadcasters

[05:03:02.0000] <meledin>
(This doesn't imply that you are off the hook ofc, just that they aren't interested in small fries)

[05:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
meledin: they count Web sites as "broadcasting"

[05:04:01.0000] <meledin>
Yeah, I said that

[05:04:02.0000] <meledin>
And they don't specify what a "broadcast market" is w.r.t. internet

[05:05:00.0000] <meledin>
However, for internet broadcast they've generously waived the royalty until 31 Dec this year

[05:05:01.0000] <meledin>
(And I use the word 'generously' very... generously)

[05:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. It's February now

[05:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
did the MPEG-LA publish the terms for 2011 by the end of January 2010?

[05:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
The temperature is above zero for the first time since mid December!

[05:06:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me just noticed

[05:06:03.0000] <gsnedders>
WHAT!?

[05:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I go away and you get positive temperatures!?

[05:07:01.0000] <annevk>
could you leave Oslo before Monday gsnedders? :)

[05:07:02.0000] <meledin>
The MPEG-LA as far as I can see only shows a /summary/ of the license on their website

[05:07:03.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: http://www.mpegla.com/Lists/MPEG%20LA%20News%20List/Attachments/226/n-10-02-02.pdf

[05:07:04.0000] <annevk>
or actually, maybe you should stay another week so I can go skiing first :)

[05:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I leave in, uh, an hour and a half

[05:08:01.0000] <meledin>
oic

[05:08:02.0000] <meledin>
This is news, good catch jgraham

[05:09:00.0000] <meledin>
'course, it doesn't say what happens 2017

[05:09:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, maybe you should tell the weather forecast: http://www.google.com/search?q=weather+oslo

[05:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: OK, I've told it.

[05:11:01.0000] <meledin>
Pfft

[05:11:02.0000] <annevk>
as a PDF

[05:11:03.0000] <annevk>
wtf

[05:11:04.0000] <annevk>
my hope for good news here is 17 feb

[05:12:00.0000] <annevk>
but I have a feeling that is way too early to tell

[05:12:01.0000] <annevk>
well, I'm pretty sure

[05:12:02.0000] <meledin>
Good news being?

[05:12:03.0000] <annevk>
google on2 deal

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: thanks

[05:15:00.0000] <annevk>
on http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html Google Chrome is still in beta...

[05:15:01.0000] <annevk>
guess they don't look often at that page

[05:16:00.0000] <meledin>
Comparatively I guess there's not much traffic there, no.

[05:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i thought google is always in beta

[05:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Gmail has a pref to add back the 'beta' label

[05:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me finds <div id="msg" />

[05:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in the V8 test suite

[05:35:00.0000] <virtuelv>
meledin: the point, I think, is «when do I become a broadcaster»?

[05:44:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hsivonen: is the empty string a valid IRI?

[05:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmithX: it's a valid IRI reference (aka. relative URL), IIRC, but not a valid IRI (aka. absolute URL)

[05:48:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
OK

[05:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
MikeSmithX, I guess this breakage is related to the question you asked me before about whether there's any way to scrape the contents of sections from a wiki page?

[05:55:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: no, that was actually something different

[05:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh.

[05:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, the HTML output is really intended for human consumption, it's not exactly stable . . . for this use-case, if I'm getting what you're doing here, maybe you could just do http://wiki.whatwg.org/index.php?title=Validator.nu_alt_advice&action=raw and split on "=="?

[05:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I was under the impression that a bunch of wikipedia scrapers used the (X)HTML? Wasn't that the reason you had to revert the HTML5 change at first?

[05:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, well, yes.  They break all the time too, and yell at us, and then we yell at them for screen-scraping and tell them to use the API.  :)

[05:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And then they tweak their bots instead to adapt to the new HTML output instead.

[05:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
You should emit a large number of random variations of HTML output

[05:58:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: yeah, maybe it could be worthwhile to take some to time to change the relevant parts of the validator.nu to use the actual MediaWiki API instead of the current scraping mechanism it uses, which is fairly fragile

[05:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
and carefully design is so that they can't reliably use regexps to skip over the randomness

[05:58:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, it would be easier to just stop emitting well-formed XML, that would stop most of them.

[05:58:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yeah, then they'd use regexes.

[05:59:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: so what would be the right way to get the contents of the page in XML using the API?

[05:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: I don't want to scrape wikitext

[05:59:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
MikeSmithX, what sort of XML do you want?

[05:59:03.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: but I would like to scrape a wikitext to HTML output without all the surrounding UI

[06:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Validator.nu_alt_advice?action=render

[06:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, you can also fetch wikitext and then feed it back as strings to api.php to get a parsed version.

[06:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: ooh. nice. thanks

[06:00:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: whatever form of XML output is the most guaranteed to not change again in the future

[06:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: is there a way to make the TOC go away, too?

[06:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
MikeSmithX, API formats are quite stable, as far as I know.  That's really their whole purpose in life.

[06:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, well, you could remove it altogether by adding __NOTOC__ somewhere on the page.  If you only want the bot to not get it, then not that I can think of, no.

[06:01:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
good to hear, if that's an actual policy

[06:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: ok. thanks

[06:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
MikeSmithX, it is, although I don't actually work on the API at all, so I can't *personally* vouch for it.  I've seen some breaking changes, but my understanding is they're very rare.

[06:02:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor:  some projects don't seem to understand so well that that's what APIs are for 

[06:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmithX: fwiw, I thought I fixed the scraper, then it seemed that I didn't, then I had switched context to Firefox bugs

[06:02:04.0000] <MikeSmithX>
twitter seems to change their API whenever the whim strikes them

[06:02:05.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmithX: but I still intend to fix it

[06:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/api.php?action=parse&text=''Some%20text%20to%20parse''&format=xml

[06:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me debugs again now

[06:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This also might be useful: view-source:http://wiki.whatwg.org/api.php?action=parse&page=Validator.nu_alt_advice&format=xml&prop=sections

[06:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Er, sans view-source:.  :P

[06:05:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hsivonen: np -- I guess it's not terrifically urgent. was just musing about whether it might be worthwhile to switch to using the mediawiki API as long as you're going in to touch the code

[06:06:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: that reminds me about what I had asked you before

[06:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right, this whole thing reminded me.

[06:07:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
that gives you the section titles, but not the section content

[06:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm sure that could be easily added.

[06:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Since we're running trunk anyway, I could commit it and then just sync the WHATWG wiki to the latest revision.

[06:07:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I think what I had wanted to do before was, given a section title, return just the content of that section

[06:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Would it work to just have it return XML for all the sections on the page?

[06:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
XML doesn't really help compared to HTML

[06:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like: http://wiki.whatwg.org/api.php?action=parse&page=Validator.nu_alt_advice&format=xml&prop=sectionshtml returning a list of all the sections' HTML wrapped in XML tags?

[06:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: that would make things harder

[06:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So like this, maybe, but with each <s> containing the section's (XML-escaped) HTML: http://wiki.whatwg.org/api.php?action=parse&page=Validator.nu_alt_advice&format=xml&prop=sections

[06:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why?  Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you need it for?

[06:09:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hsivonen: I guess I was thinking the API XML output would help if it were stable

[06:09:04.0000] <MikeSmithX>
it seems there are no guarantees of stability for the HTML

[06:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What info are you getting out of the HTML?

[06:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: Validator.nu wants the HTML content as XHTML tree fragments

[06:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: the stuff between the headings

[06:10:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
ah yeah

[06:10:04.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: so adding more XML just complicates things

[06:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, so that's what I suggested, except of course that you could have <div><h2>Foo</h2></div> and then it wouldn't be well-formed.

[06:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
given that the HTML parser needs to be involved anyway

[06:11:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hmm, so what would be good would be addition of stable HTML output from the API

[06:12:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
HTML as an API output format

[06:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I'm saying that instead of <h2>Foo</h2> <p>Bar</p> <h2>Baz</h2> <p>Quuz</p> you'd get <s name="Foo">&lt;p>Bar&lt;/p></s><s name="Baz">&lt;p>Quuz&lt;/p></s>

[06:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or something like that.

[06:12:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not clear what sort of HTML you want.

[06:13:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: something guaranteed to be free of changes like replacing <a name> instances with id attributes instead

[06:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The "like" is the tricky bit here.

[06:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: the HTML format itself is fine as long as it doesn't change in structure

[06:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
What other changes would qualify?

[06:14:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe you'd want something like what we have now, but with just <h2> or such for headings and no fancy id's and edit links and such added?

[06:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And TOCs and so forth?

[06:15:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: yeah, that sounds like something that would be generally useful

[06:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That might be a more intrusive change for us, it'd probably end up touching the actual parser and adding a new mode to it.

[06:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: any change that introduces or deletes markup between the end of a section and the heading for the next section

[06:15:04.0000] <hsivonen>
or that changes how section headings are marked up

[06:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or that introduces markup between the heading of a section and the section content

[06:16:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: so like the action=render output but without the edit links and TOC, as you say

[06:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And without the added id's and divs and other weird stuff we put on the headers, I guess.

[06:18:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: I think that stuff is mostly ignorable, but it would make the HTML cleaner to work with programatically for somebody going it to write a processing app for it

[06:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
well, right now the code expects to see the spans and classes on the headings :-)

[06:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but a stable format would ideally have only <h2>

[06:18:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML-fragments-in-XML (or other format of your choice) really seems like a simpler way to do this unless you've already written an app that expects to be dealing with the HTML headings.

[06:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which you have, of course.

[06:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But for a new app it seems like a suboptimal approach.

[06:19:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
that part could be changes

[06:19:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
*changed

[06:19:04.0000] <MikeSmithX>
but HTML-fragments-in-XML would seem to me to be a good way

[06:19:05.0000] <MikeSmithX>
or HTML-fragments-whatever

[06:20:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
or HTML-fragments-in-whatever

[06:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The only question is, what if you have <div><h2>...</h2></div>?

[06:20:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
ah, as you wrote -- "or other format of your choice"

[06:20:03.0000] <hsivonen>
HTML-fragments-in-whatever needs two parsers, so while it might be stable, it wouldn't be simpler

[06:20:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It depends what you're using the fragments for.  You might not need to actually parse them.

[06:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: V.nu is definitely going to parse them

[06:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, if you're asking for XHTML-in-XML, it's only really one parser.

[06:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, okay.

[06:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
HTML in divs or XHTML in XML would work

[06:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm still not clear what the expected behavior is if the contents of the section, taken by themselves, are not well-formed.

[06:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: this stuff goes through an HTML5 parser that is set to coerce its output to be a well-formed infoset

[06:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
In your case, yes, but if someone is going to add a feature to MediaWiki, it's not just going to be for validator.nu.  Most people don't use HTML5 parsers at this point.

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. so it seems Eclipse is showing me one file and running another

[06:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that's why my debugging is going nowhere

[06:25:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
well, for both validator.nu and in general, I think what would be ideal is what I mentioned - given a section title, return just the child HTML content of that section

[06:25:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are two options for what sort of HTML to output: 1) whatever happens to lie between the section tags in the actual page, and 2) what you get by running the section's wikitext through the parser (which will strip mismatched tags and such).

[06:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(2) seems more sensible to me if you're looking at each section by itself.

[06:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
#2

[06:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
MikeSmithX, the easiest way to do that would just be to return all the page's sections at once, surely?  You probably want more than one section from the page anyway.  You can get it wrapped in JSON or YAML or whatnot instead of XML if you want an easier-to-parse wrapper format.

[06:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, there can be two sections with the same name on the page.

[06:28:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
ah

[06:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There can even be two sections with the same id if you do something tricky like == Foo == == Foo == == Foo 2 ==, although we usually manage to avoid that.

[06:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(that particular bug would be pretty easy to fix, but there are probably more important things to do)

[06:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Validator.nu_alt_advice?action=render is fine as long as random UI doesn't start appearing there

[06:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's the HTML output meant for browsers, it's not meant for machine parsing and isn't guaranteed to be stable at all.

[06:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's very likely that the exact format of the headings will be adjusted again in the future, it's happened multiple times before.

[06:35:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor:  I suppose for the case of multiple sections with the same title, the simple thing to do would be to just have the API return the contents of all the sections (each just appended after the other in the output)

[06:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
MikeSmithX, what's wrong with returning all the sections on the page with some thin wrapper in the format of your choice?

[06:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if this wiki HTML output parsing thing is really solving the right problem

[06:37:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
AryehGregor: nothing wrong, but it would just be good to have an HTML wrapper be one of the available formats

[06:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
Wouldn't it be better if the original input data was in a more easily machine-readable format?

[06:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, yes, but then we have millions of pages that need to be reformatted somehow, not to mention countless editors who've gotten used to the current wikitext format.

[06:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's doable, but it would be a huge change given the need for backward compatibility.

[06:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: I mean for validator.nu, not for Wikipedia :-p

[06:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh.

[06:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me emerges from the classpath battle victoriously

[06:38:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me wouldn't willing suggest rewriting the entire content of Wikipedia

[06:38:05.0000] <Philip`>
*willingly

[06:38:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
You mean, like, tell people to make that specific page in some validator.nu-specific format instead of wikitext?

[06:38:07.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: You can never win

[06:38:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would make a lot of sense.

[06:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, fixing the scraper was simple

[06:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the hard part was that the source code and the running code didn't agree

[06:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: If I haven't misfollowed the conversation, I expect it's for any validators that want to use the normative data currently encoded in the wiki, not just validator.nu

[06:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
but they'd all have basically the same requirements so that's okay

[06:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, the point is the same, surely.

[06:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Surely it wouldn't be hard to find someone who knows Ruby on Rails and can type in two lines of code to set up a publicly-editable structured database for all these registries and lists

[06:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
with an HTML view so people can check the data makes sense, and an XML/JSON view for machines

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
finally running the deployment script

[06:47:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Philip`: yeah, agreed. yet that's not happened so far, for whatever reason

[06:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: With the proposed RDFa changes in MediaWiki, does anything prevent people writing <p xmlns:foo="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"> and getting it echoed out through the XML API and causing a WF error?

[06:48:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
maybe the hoopla about the link registry can help motivate us to get something like that set up for that, and the reusable for the existing stuff

[06:49:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
(above comment was just about the structured-database idea)

[06:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmithX: deployed! <figcaption> validates. thank you.

[06:50:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
cool

[06:50:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
thanks man

[06:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone happen to have the reverse of Hixie's data URL kitchen?

[06:54:00.0000] <annevk>
view source?

[06:54:01.0000] <annevk>
i.e. the adress bar

[06:57:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hsivonen: btw, about the earlier build problem, it seems like adding a call to prepareLocalEntityJar() at the beginning of buildAll() might prevent that

[06:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, if you want an online version, see http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2005/06/base64-ie/

[06:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's basically a data: URL proxy built for IE

[06:58:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hsivonen: let me know if you think we should add that to build.py

[07:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmithX: it seems like a useful addition

[07:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: good point (view source)

Semantic q: It’s fairly common to have a citation note at the end of a blockquote, however the spec mentions the content inside the blockquote must be quoted…

[08:08:00.0000] <boblet>
Since small can be used for attribution, would adding <small>(<cite>book title, page number</cide>)</small> at the end of a blockquote be kosher?

[08:09:00.0000] <boblet>
(great to see UAs should expose citation links btw)

[08:15:00.0000] <boblet>
boogyman: for spell (it was a typo)

[08:16:00.0000] <boblet>
boogyman: unless there really is a <cide> element I’m unaware of?

[08:17:00.0000] <boogyman>
I haven't had a chance to read the HTML5 specification so I am not sure. I do know there is a CITE element though

[08:18:00.0000] <boblet>
boogyman: hehehe. np, forget I typed (just for the record there’s no cide element btw ;-)

hrm. will ask again when more ppl are awake. nn

[12:42:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, news reporting is somewhat shitty

[12:43:00.0000] <roc>
you've only just noticed?

[12:43:01.0000] <annevk>
article talks about http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience/form-factors/tablet and mentions it's not a Google operated site so just speculation what Google might do ... blah blah

[12:44:00.0000] <annevk>
one search for the name mentioned on that page reveals he's the lead UI for Chrome

/me wonders how often html5.validator.nu is updated, given that figcaption happened last Friday, h.v.n "still" didn't reflect figcaption a day or so ago, and it does now

[12:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
jwalden: hsivonen pushed it today (obviously). I guess how often it is updated depends on how busy he is rewriting your parser :)

[13:24:00.0000] <annevk>
Adobe is getting desperate, lol, http://twitter.com/bobspace/status/8603836976

[14:02:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me is unsure whether or not <figcaption> is growing on him, or at least gradually growing less cringe-inducing

[14:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: No, really?

[14:23:00.0000] <quuxman>
so what i the lesser of two "evils": laying out HTML with table tags or with JavaScript?

[14:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<table>

[14:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But neither is a good solution.  Do it properly.

[14:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
depends on the JS

[14:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Depends on the content

[14:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I say <table> just because I use it myself (a single two-element layout table to do columns).

[14:27:00.0000] <quuxman>
TabAtkins: yes, tables are by far the most sane way to layout things in columns and center things vertically, and sometimes horizontally

[14:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's definitely better to go from a single-page layout to a two-column layout done in CSS dynamically using JS, than to use tables, imho

[14:27:02.0000] <quuxman>
I'm aware there are CSS hacks to do all of these things, but they're horrific and extremely time consuming

[14:27:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, for centering and most layout tasks I use CSS properly.

[14:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's just the major two-column layout happens to have requirements that are perfectly met by tables, and very badly met by CSS.

[14:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But it's part of my mission to fix that.  ^_^

[14:30:00.0000] <quuxman>
Hixie: Currently I'm using JavaScript for a couple layout things, but I'm realizing if I use tables I could relatively easily make the site pretty usable without JavaScript

[14:34:00.0000] <annevk>
quuxman, yay, more Opera invasion of #whatwg

[14:46:00.0000] <annevk>
oh wait, pablo uses the nick quuxbaz, nm

[15:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Does it make sense to say "RAND royalty-free license"?

[15:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
No.  No it doesn't.

[15:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It is an attempt to trick people.

[15:40:00.0000] <roc>
who's saying that?

[15:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's in a comment in a h264-and-theora blog post

[15:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Talking about On2's release

[15:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Something new about On2?

[15:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
No, the basis for Theora

[15:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So it seems MPEG-LA has granted us another five years of h264...

[15:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I haven't found anything in the logs, so I assume it hasn't been covered yet

[15:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"royalties for Internet Video that is free to end users (known as Internet Broadcast AVC Video)"

[15:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That seems to let youtube off the hook

[15:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
By 2016, I'd assume Dirac would be mature as well

[15:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, dirac is not really aimed at internet video. It's aimed more at production quality video

[15:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
but the extra 6 years for royalty free h.264 content distribution doesn't have much effect at all, beyond saving companies like YouTube and Vimeo 6 years worth of licensing fees

[15:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And every normal internet user too

[15:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not quite.  Us normal internet users can just use Theora.  We just miss out on people using Safari, shrug.


2010-02-04
[17:08:00.0000] <tantek>
hsivonen, I'm curious why validator.nu would report that 'type' and 'data' attributes are not allowed on 'object' when the spec certainly appears to allow them, e.g. see: http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Ftantek.com%2F&parser=html5&profile=polyglot

[17:08:01.0000] <tantek>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#attr-object-type

[17:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
probably a bug in the validator, file a bug :-)

[17:10:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, I tend to assume it's a bug in my code before thinking it's a bug in the validator :)

[17:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
looks like a validator bug to me

[17:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
it fails on data:text/html;charset=utf-8,<!DOCTYPE%20HTML><title>Test</title><object%20type%3D"image/png"%20data%3D"http://example.com/test.png"></object> too

[17:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
which i'm pretty sure is valid

[17:22:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie - bug filed: http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=716 (noted link to your test case also)

[17:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: cool

[17:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: hey while i have you here, do you have an opinion on getting rid of the "magic" around N in the microdata vCard vocabulary?

[17:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: i was looking at the vCard spec and it doesn't say the N needs to actually have any data, just that it has to be present

[17:34:00.0000] <roc>
Dashiva: In fact, "normal internet users"  have to be pretty careful about how they use H.264. See http://bemasc.net/wordpress/2010/02/02/no-you-cant-do-that-with-h264/ ... that's mostly about video production, but it also turns out that e.g. playing video using Flash for "commercial use" is also forbidden

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i hate working on the drag-and-drop API

[17:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
roc: They have to be careful they pay for a service that doesn't properly license its content, and even then nothing's going to happen

[17:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Internet broadcast is free until 2016, and that includes sites with ads, so unless you plan to set up full-blown commerical operation...

[18:03:00.0000] <roc>
it's true, if you just want to watch Youtube you'll be fine.

[18:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or post your own videos

[18:04:00.0000] <roc>
to Youtube

[18:04:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or your blog

[18:04:02.0000] <roc>
I believe that technically, you need to execute a license for that. You won't have to pay royalties until 2016.

[18:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's pretty clear that until H.264 is freely usable without any license nonsense, it's not a workable solution.

[18:06:00.0000] <nessy>
plus the weird stuff they recently replied to for open source software

[18:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
usable and implementable, yes

[18:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
(and i mean Free, not $0)

[18:07:01.0000] <nessy>
and then the one where you cannot do commercial content, even if you have a license to Final Cut Pro

[18:07:02.0000] <nessy>
more and more restrictions are coming out

[18:07:03.0000] <nessy>
even if they won't go after people for such infringements, it's still a scary state

[18:08:00.0000] <roc>
those restrictions were always there, people just didn't know or care

[18:08:01.0000] <roc>
of course most still don't, as long as they can watch Youtube

[18:08:02.0000] <roc>
which is fine

[18:08:03.0000] <nessy>
it's good it is being exposed - mostly it was unknown till now

[18:09:00.0000] <nessy>
I'm still hoping Google will "do good" and provide an Ogg alternative of YouTube, too

[18:09:01.0000] <nessy>
it's a massive transcoding effort, but then they did that for mobile content and HD content, too

[18:10:00.0000] <nessy>
I don't mind large corporates continuing to use H.264 - but it shouldn't be forced upon the small guys

[18:11:00.0000] <jcranmer>
google has the computing power, I bet

[18:26:00.0000] <jwalden>
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8496263.stm hum

[18:30:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, sorry I didn't see your q re: vcard/n til now

[18:32:00.0000] <tantek>
Much of the "optimizations" for n (and fn and others) were design/built to bridge the impedance mismatch/gap between the way people author content (only what they have to / seems obvious), and the strict top-down a-priori requirements of various formats.

[18:33:00.0000] <tantek>
given the years of experience we've had with hCard (and n and fn uses), there's definitely been a few cases where some optimizations can be dropped, others can be improved/refined, and there's room for a few more too (again, based on experience with what authors have tried to do with hCard)

[18:33:01.0000] <tantek>
I've captured much of this in hcard-brainstorming for hCard 1.0.1 (and similarly for hCalendar)

[18:34:00.0000] <tantek>
essentially all such "optimizations" come down to making the vocabularies more *usable*

[18:34:01.0000] <tantek>
anyway - feel free to jump into #microformats for more on hCard/vcard/n/fn etc.

[18:35:00.0000] <tantek>
btw on another topic (which was mentioned above)

[18:35:01.0000] <tantek>
http://bemasc.net/wordpress/2010/02/02/no-you-cant-do-that-with-h264/

[18:36:00.0000] <tantek>
the video codec situ seems quite messy

[18:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: k. sounds like it would be reasonable for the microdata version to just say that a blank N is generated if it's missing, then, with no special magic to generate it from FN, NICK, and ORG like hCard

[18:44:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, there are probably some cases where a blank n *should* be generated from fn, nickname, org etc., even in hCard

[18:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[18:46:00.0000] <tantek>
that is there are some cases where hCard auto-generates a value for the 'n' property when it should probably generate an empty 'n' property

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah i see

[18:47:01.0000] <tantek>
I'm going to have to another round of tests with modern vcard consumers to understand the impact of various combinations of implying a blank 'n' vs an 'n' with a non-empty value.

[18:47:02.0000] <tantek>
to have to *do* another

[18:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
k

[18:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
i have to say, one has to love how the vcard spec just says that N is required

[18:48:00.0000] <tantek>
don't get me started

[18:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
without saying how you're supposed to determine its value if it's unknown

[18:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
Atom does the same thing

[18:48:03.0000] <tantek>
Atom is actually much worse

[18:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
a bunch of things are required, but there's no suggestion of what to do when they're unknown

[18:48:05.0000] <tantek>
so many really bad MUSTs on content authoring

[18:48:06.0000] <tantek>
and so many bad requirements for artificial precision - e.g. RFC3339

[18:49:00.0000] <tantek>
e.g. forcing you to specify :00 seconds, even if you don't know/have a value for it from the content/data/authoring

[18:49:01.0000] <tantek>
forced artificial precision = antipattern

[18:49:02.0000] <tantek>
another case of, mandating the author to provide a value for something doesn't mean that you actually get meaningful content for it

[18:50:00.0000] <tantek>
I'm sure you can list examples from the HTML spec for that ;)

[18:50:01.0000] <tantek>
*HTML4*

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually html4 doesn't do that much

[18:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
mostly because it requires so little of anything...

[18:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
kinda the opposite problem :-P

[19:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders why he sometimes gets "- unknown class warning" when running his script

[19:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've tried commenting stuff out but i can't work out what is causing it

[23:50:00.0000] <quuxman>
hm, this is easier than I thought to do the layout with just CSS, but still quite a pain

[23:51:00.0000] <quuxman>
why does the "margin:0 auto" trick not work if the display is anything but static?

[23:54:00.0000] <quuxman>
I want the centering trick with "display:inline-block". This is why doing layout with CSS sucks :-P

[23:54:01.0000] <quuxman>
</bitch>

[23:55:00.0000] <foolip>
quuxman: use more wrapping divs ;)

[23:55:01.0000] <quuxman>
specifically what I want is a centered element, with another element to the right of it

[23:56:00.0000] <quuxman>
but for the centering trick, the element needs to be block, which makes it impossible to put another element next to it

[23:56:01.0000] <foolip>
uh... put them both in a single container and add padding of the same width as the second element to the left

[23:57:00.0000] <quuxman>
foolip: ah, good tip, thanks :)

[01:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Am I supposed to interpret section 4.5 of WebIDL as meaning that some_host_object.hasOwnProperty(some_idl_attribute) should be true

[01:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
?

[01:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
e.g. document.createElement("div").hasOwnProperty("class")

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
"class" is a poor example :-)

[02:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
Pretend that I used a different example then :)

[02:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or to put it differently "oh yes, so it is")

[02:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/368 - true in opera, safari, chrome; false in firefox

[02:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: sorry, don't know the answer to the question, so i figured nit picking was the next best thing :-P

[03:46:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, when is it dom-window-x and when is it dom-x?

[03:46:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, and when is it dom-Window-x etc.

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it would be nice to agree on a consistent policy for terms so all specs can follow it

[04:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: it's dom-window-x when i add new things after 2008, it's dom-x when i add new things before 2008. More or less.

[04:11:01.0000] <annevk>
fun

[04:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
(though i'm sure there's lots of exceptions either way)

[04:11:03.0000] <annevk>
more fun

[04:12:00.0000] <annevk>
i lowercased names in titles, you seem to do both there too...

[04:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that's more or less the same

[04:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
these days i try to be consistent with the actual case, so that search and replace is easier

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
mkay

[04:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
even more inconsistent is how i deal with concepts and algorithms

[04:14:01.0000] <annevk>
fair enough, though at some point we should try to get some consistency if we want this multi-spec cross-linking thing to work

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[04:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
agreed

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
my recommendation would be to leave what we have now as is, but that going forward we use:

[04:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
dom-InterfaceName-attributeOrMethodName

[04:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
event-eventname

[04:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
elementname

[04:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
attr-elementname-attributename

[04:17:05.0000] <Hixie>
dom-elementname-attributeOrMethodName

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
concept-word

[04:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
InterfaceName

[04:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
and just use the whole string for long algorithm names

[04:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
does that work for you?

[04:18:04.0000] <annevk>
yeah, that's more or less what I use

[04:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[04:32:00.0000] <annevk>
still not getting 9.10 in the Update Manager

[04:32:01.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders what Ubuntu bug he's hitting

[04:35:00.0000] <annevk>
I only get it when running update-manager -c

[04:49:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: your last install was LTS, perhaps?

[04:50:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: look in in Places → Administration → Software Sources → Updates

[04:51:00.0000] <virtuelv>
does it say "long-term support releases only" at the bottom?

[04:52:00.0000] <annevk>
no

[04:52:01.0000] <annevk>
i have 9.04

[04:52:02.0000] <annevk>
i'm running the updater now

[04:53:00.0000] <annevk>
hopefully it'll work out

[04:53:01.0000] <annevk>
otherwise I have a problem

http://livedom.validator.nu/?%3Cdatalist%3E%3Coption%3E%3C%2Fdatalist%3Ex - bug in v.nu or spec?

[05:49:00.0000] <annevk>
dunno, but hopefully the spec closes <option> on </datalist>

[05:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
seems like a bug in v.nu from my reading of the spec

[05:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh, http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=676

[05:52:01.0000] <annevk>
same reading here

[06:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, I think the RDFa changes whitelist xmlns:* with any URL-looking contents.  But I doubt we'll end up enabling raw RDFa/microdata input, based on the mailing list discussion.

[06:01:01.0000] <annevk>
so much for help with CSSOM

[06:02:00.0000] <annevk>
no answer yet to my query

[06:02:01.0000] <annevk>
I wonder how often I asked a question on a mailing list and got a completely useful reply

[06:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Okay

[06:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like the system tries quite hard to only emit well-formed XML, so that xmlns thing is just something that might trip it up if it's not exceedingly careful

[06:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
How technically feasible is it for browsers to apply special resource limits on nested browsing contexts?  Such as cutting an <iframe> off early if it starts looking like it's going to slow down the page?

[06:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: I don't have deep insider knowledge, but that sounds quite difficult

[06:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's what I suspected as well.  I'm just putting feelers out, because if it really is quite difficult, then I'll drop it from my suggestions for @sandbox additions.

[06:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, in what ways are you imagining a page within an iframe slowing things down, which wouldn't already be handled by existing techniques to, e.g., halt execution of long running scripts

[06:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Say from an SVG image with multiple chained filters.

[06:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, good question. I don't know

[06:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
As well, even with existing long-running script techniques, I may want to cut them off *even faster*, since I'm allowing scripts from untrusted sources.  Say after 5 seconds of lag, instead of the 30 or so (if I recall correctly how that works) for a normal page script.

[06:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
shouldn't a cloud backup offering talk about crypto on the front page?

[06:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
re: ubuntu one

[06:48:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I doubt anyone cares

[06:49:00.0000] <annevk>
though a little info somewhere would be good...

[06:50:00.0000] <annevk>
seems to lack resources, clicking on FAQ results in an error

[06:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I tried Ubuntu One but it didn't seem to work properly, so I gave up before actually storing any files on it.

[06:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, haven't you been looking for an online backup solution for months? Still not having any luck finding a suitable one?

[06:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
I never found one either, and haven't been actively looking lately

[06:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, what happened with H.264 licensing?  I guess they aren't going to start charging Internet video streamers yet?

[06:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
the best solution might be to set up your own remote server, possibly in a co-location facility, with enough storage for your needs that you have complete control over. Though, that might be a little costly.

[06:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you're only backing up once a day, you might be able to use 0 Mbps of bandwidth at the 95th percentile, so most of the cost would probably be in the setup.

[06:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hardware costs and such.

[06:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, yeah. It doesn't solve the problem with h.264 though. They're just delaying it for some reason. All it does is let companies like YouTube and Vimeo save money for a few more years

[06:58:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could probably do it for <$500 for the machine, and $10 or $20 a month for 1U of rack space.

[06:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, YouTube isn't saving money AFAIK, Google is already paying the full H.264 licensing fee, so they get to use it however much they want.

[06:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'd want at least 10TB of remote storage

[06:59:02.0000] <meledin>
Are you backing up the entire internet?

[07:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Peh. The internet is overrated.

[07:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you can get a 2 TB disk for $160, so 10 TB could be six of those in RAID5, which comes out to $2160 for the disks alone.  So okay, a bit more than $500.

[07:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
meledin, I currently have 7TB worth of storage space on external drives at home, with about 5TB of that full

[07:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(but RAID5 with 2 TB drives is risky, there's a high chance of read errors on resync, RAID6 would be safer)

[07:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Where are you getting your math?  160*6 != 2160

[07:03:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I make it up.

[07:03:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I tried to use braawi.com for backups but I never got the setup process to a point where it would work

[07:03:04.0000] <Philip`>
10TB is nearly a year of continuous HD video

[07:03:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyway = 720

[07:03:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Serves me right for trying to do multiplication in my head instead of typing /exec calc '160*6'

[07:03:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean... 960

[07:03:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hahaha.

[07:03:09.0000] <meledin>
Irony

[07:03:10.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, 960.

[07:03:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least my error was much closer to reality.

[07:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, so you could set it up for under $1500, probably.

[07:04:01.0000] <meledin>
Closest without going over

[07:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I did 360*6 instead of 160*6 for some reason.

[07:04:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Makes sense.

[07:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I did 120*6.  We're all about nice angles.

[07:05:01.0000] <meledin>
But, yeah, for 10tb of backup storage you are looking at a DIY solution

[07:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I've spent most of my day today waiting for IO. most of it not even network

[07:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Obviously you should get 10 TB of SSDs instead, then.

[07:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
10tb of remote backup does seem somewhat unreasonable

[07:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I chose to prepare my parents' computers for disk failure scenarios today

[07:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
But I would be interested in solutions that allowed for <~1Tb of remote backup

[07:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
(without unreasonable cost)

[07:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
(well maybe 1Tb is an overestimate)

[07:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Amazon charges $0.15/GB/month for the first 50 TB used, so $150/TB/month.  Is that "unreasonable"?  :)

[07:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, yes. I looked into Amazon previously, and concluded that the costs for large quatities of personal storage are excessive

[07:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does anyone else undercut them much?

[07:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
If 1Tb was an order of magnitude too high that would be reasonable

[07:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
i.e. I would pay $15/month

[07:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, $150 is almost enough to buy a 2 TB disk that you can use yourself forever.

[07:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: life is much easier if you don't possess movies after you've watched them

[07:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
hsivonen: Indeed.  I at least hang onto them until my share ratio goes above 3, but then they're gone.

[07:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
but then I'd have to redownload them to watch them again, or for other people to watch them later

[07:13:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Netflix.

[07:13:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
As long as they want to watch things that can be instant-streamed, or give you enough warning for you to order something they'd like.

[07:13:04.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, DRM, and I don't think they're in Norway.

[07:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Damn these national borders!

[07:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's nicer to see movies that you haven't already seen

[07:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
I can work around the national border thing fairly easiliy. It's the DRM I refuse to pay for

[07:14:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me doesn't use p2p so share ratio isn't an issue

[07:14:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
In content that is *inherently* temporary, that's not such a big deal to me.  I'm not trying to claim that I own the videos.

[07:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, do you use Usenet, or do you just not download pirated content?

[07:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: no pirated content

[07:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[07:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Copyright-infringement.  Nobody was kidnapped or murdered in the course of infringing the copyrights.

[07:16:03.0000] <hsivonen>
well, my in-the-cloud pvr provider is being investigated by the police

[07:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has no copyright infringing content but does have a camera that takes 20Mb/photo photos, which can add up fast

[07:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but not because they provide the wrong service but because they don't have the same media company cronies as their competitors

[07:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
there was a cable provider in the US who offered an in-the-cloud PVR service, and who went through copyright infringment claims. I believe they won that case last year.

[07:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but they have the best law firm in the field in Finland

[07:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, come on, when most people hear the word "pirate" they think of a goofy guy with an eyepatch and a parrot on his shoulder, not kidnap and murder.

[07:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Typically a macaw.

[07:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: True, but then the lying bastards in the content companies use that connection to tie copyright infringement to *real* piracy and counterfeiting issues.

[07:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nobody talks or thinks about "real" piracy these days, it's not the nineteenth century anymore.

[07:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Go tell that to Somalia.

[07:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's an amusing curiosity to hear that there are still real pirates in Somalia.

[07:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
btw, not all of my stuff is infringing downloads. A significant portion of it is from ripped DVDs that I own, which are on average 5 to 8 GB each.

[07:22:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The whole "copyright infringement is not piracy!" thing is overblown, language changes.

[07:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
People often water down existing negative terms by applying them to less negative things.

[07:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or add negative connotations to neutral or positive words by applying them to more negative things as euphemisms, on the other hand.

[07:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's no reason to get excited about it, "pirate" isn't even an insult at this point.  You even have a Pirate Party in the EU.

[07:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.  That doesn't mean that the negative connotations aren't still twisted to evil effect, though.

[07:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The word "pirate" *has* no negative connotations.

[07:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's what I'm saying.

[07:24:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
You're... wrong?

[07:24:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's lost them all by now.

[07:24:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or pretty much.

[07:24:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
If I'm wrong, why do so many pirates call themselves pirates?

[07:24:07.0000] <foolip>
arr arr, welcome to Sweden, matey

[07:24:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
The Pirate Party, Pirate Bay, . . .

[07:24:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because they've internalized the language?

[07:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which means it has no negative connotation anymore.

[07:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not at all.

[07:25:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It doesn't have negative connotations *to them*.

[07:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't have more than slightly negative connotations to anyone these days.  If it has any, it's like "jaywalker" or "litterer" rather than "murderer" or "kidnapper".

[07:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's like the word "fag".  It's 'reclaimed', but that doesn't mean that your average 12-year-old's use of the word isn't insulting.

[07:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, the word "fag" has a uniformly negative connotation when applied to people.  You don't have gay rights groups calling themselves "Society for Empowerment of Fags".

[07:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, but you do have gay *people* referring to themselves as fags, without offense.

[07:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I haven't ever heard that.

[07:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(not that I know many gay people)

[07:27:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
You hang around the wrong homosexuals.  ^_^

[07:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't hang around homosexuals at all, usually.

[07:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, sometimes people insult themselves as a joke, that's entirely different.

[07:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, the way it's used isn't meant to be insulting or a joke.  It's just an in-group term.

[07:30:00.0000] <workmad3>
it's just really what the intent behind the word is

[07:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I can't do a sociological analysis of groups I'm not affiliated with, but I can say that to me, the word "pirate" has no negative connotation.  Maybe to some groups (older people?) it does, but if so, it's not worth objecting.

[07:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It is when those old people are still making laws.  >_<

[07:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, it's really not.  It's pointless to bicker over terminology.  Just use whatever terms you prefer.

[07:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And the digital revolution is recent enough that it'll take quite a while for everyone dumb to die off.

[07:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's not like the word is misleading, it's just derogatory at worst.

[07:32:00.0000] <workmad3>
AryehGregor: probably a good example for intent is 'hacker'

[07:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Everyone calls people they don't like derogatory things.

[07:32:02.0000] <workmad3>
to me, it's not derogatory and in some ways complimentary to be a hacker

[07:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
Pirates of the Caribbean taught me that pirates are cool

[07:32:04.0000] <Philip`>
(except for the ones that are undead, and/or are hanged)

[07:32:05.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: for me it was Pirates of Silicon Valley :P

[07:32:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yes, yes it *is* misleading.  Nothing is even being stolen, for gods sakes.  The Supreme Court made it quite clear that copyright infringement is not theft.

[07:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And then combine it with the fact that real-life pirates use machine guns to steal boats, take hostages, and kill people, and you have legitimate confusion in the uninformed that prevents them from understanding why that "pirating" thing should be legal.

[07:34:00.0000] <daedb>
Philip`: Same, except it was Monkey Island for me :)

[07:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
Apparently pirates rarely kill people, because it's not at all profitable

[07:34:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, sure.  But that doesn't make them any better.  ^_^

[07:34:03.0000] <Philip`>
Better to keep them as hostages as long as possible, and if necessary send an itemised bill as part of the ransom demand

[07:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, it's not misleading because no one is saying that pirated software is literally a crime of piracy.  It's an extension of the word by analogy.

[07:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And you don't need the Supreme Court to tell you that copyright infringement is not theft under U.S. law, just look at the definitions in the relevant statutes.

[07:35:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it can still be called "theft" in a loose, non-legal sense.

[07:35:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: You're naive - people *do* think that actual piracy, as in murder-on-the-high-seas, is precisely what is talked about when talking heads on the news go on about the latest efforts by the RIAA to stop software piracy.

[07:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, who thinks that?

[07:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Real people?

[07:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Give me specific examples.

[07:36:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
People I have met?

[07:36:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Quotes?

[07:36:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
You want specific examples of people living in Houston?

[07:36:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I want proof that someone actually believes that.

[07:36:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Preferably not based on your vague recollection.

[07:36:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because I don't believe it.

[07:36:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
You won't get it.  ^_^

[07:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's always someone that believes anything

[07:37:01.0000] <foolip>
clearly *someone* must believe that

[07:37:02.0000] <foolip>
doesn't really say much, though

[07:37:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Not a single person for all things, they'd get very confused)

[07:37:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, but if you can prove that one person does without expending exorbitant resources, it's likely that a *significant* number of people do.

[07:37:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Same thing with using "theft", except probably worse.  *Many* more people believe that infringement is literal theft, because of people using that word to describe it.

[07:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which makes it *enormously* more difficult to teach them about infinite goods and how they violate expectations based on a scarcity economy.

[07:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It is arguably literal theft in a non-legal sense.

[07:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And worse, how to *benefit* from the ways in which infinite goods are different.

[07:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"To take (the property of another) without right or permission."

[07:39:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
No.  No it is not.  In any way.

[07:39:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me sighs

[07:39:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
To take, sure.  Who's taking anything?

[07:39:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
You're construing the meaning of all these words very narrowly, according to your specific viewpoint.

[07:39:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
And who's property is being 'taken' anyway?  I'm sharing my own property with friends.

[07:39:08.0000] <Philip`>
There's lots of products where all the expense is up-front and the manufacturing cost is relatively tiny, so it's not significantly different once the manufacturing cost reaches zero

[07:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Other people have different and equally legitimate interpretations of words like "theft".

[07:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/all/most of/

[07:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You really should acknowledge that fact.

[07:40:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Yes and no.  There's still a big mental difference between something being free and something costing a nickel.

[07:40:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, distribution/copying costs for software are nonzero too, they're just very low.

[07:40:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
But anything where all the expense is up-front is, basically, intellectual property.

[07:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I challenge those interpretations as incorrect, because they do *not* correspond with the legal meanings of those terms, and because they're mind-blockers.

[07:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: There's not a big economic difference, so it's not like we're transitioning to a completely novel system of economics once part of the cost of a product drops a lot

[07:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you're convinced that filesharers are 'stealing' from you, you'll go to significant effort to stop them, instead of embracing it and using it to make more money.

[07:41:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, "theft" is not purely a legal term.  It has a less precise, nonlegal meaning as well.  And sure, the language being used is prejudiced, but you're just trying to prejudice the language used in the opposite direction.

[07:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which is fine, but it's no more or less legitimate except insofar as you may happen to be more correct.

[07:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
TabAtkins: Economic difference, no.  Mental, yes.  People often have a hard time adjusting their mental models when their 'product' suddenly becomes the advertisement, because the 'customers' are willing to share it with their friends for free, using their own bandwidth.

[07:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Now he's talking to himself.

[07:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dammit!

[07:43:02.0000] <TabAtkins>

[08:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, there seems to be a design flaw with the way sandboxed iframes work that make it largely inappropriate for some use cases.

[08:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
I realised the issue as a result of this article http://angryamoeba.co.uk/singlecell/2010/01/15/html5-video-and-custom-players.html

[08:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
Use case: For embedding a custom video player from a video site like YouTube, where the iframe's content page handles all the issues like <source> selection, custom player controls, etc. It's useful to have a simple, copy and pasteable piece of markup for authors to use in their own pages

[08:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
but using <iframe src="http://youtube.com/path/to/videoplayer.html?videoid" sandbox seamless> doesn't provide any sandboxing in legacy browsers

[08:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
And being a 3rd party site, there's no way to use the text/html-sandboxed mime type and srcdoc is inappropriate here where the content needs to be served remotely

[08:24:00.0000] <boogyman>
ew @ iframe!

[08:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
That article I mentioned above says that forum software doesn't usually permit iframes to be embedded either, and it's going to be difficult to convince them to do that while there are still legacy browsers out there that would be vulnerable without sandboxing

[08:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
boogyman, there's nothing inherently wrong with an iframe. It just has a few security issues for these use cases.

[08:25:00.0000] <boogyman>
Lachy: server side includes FTW

[08:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
boogyman, and if you're trying to claim that iframe is somehow disgusting like the author of that article did, then you're argument is no good

[08:25:02.0000] <boogyman>
frames are so 1996-8

[08:25:03.0000] <Lachy>
how would server side includes address this use case at all?

[08:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
boogyman, <frameset> and <frame> are bad by design. <iframe> is not if used appropriately

[08:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, plenty of forums allow whitelisted YouTube links.

[08:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like [youtube]some URL[/youtube] which regexes out the video id and outputs the right <object> boilerplate.

[08:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
in fact, even <frameset> isn't bad if used properly, though it frequently isn't and has few valid use cases

[08:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, nice. But that doesn't allow other video sites to compete very easily by offering their own videos to embed in 3rd party sites

[08:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure, but are forums really going to whitelist <iframe seamless sandboxed>?  Maybe, but I have my doubts.  It can do a lot of things, particularly performance-wise.

[08:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
I assume they don't also have tags for [vimeo], [dailymotion], [insert-other-video-site-here], etc.

[08:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The correct long-term solution is to do direct <video> inclusion, surely.

[08:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
that doesn't allow custom controls

[08:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So?  It'll still work.

[08:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe if this is your use-case, you should talk to actual forum software developers and ask what they'd allow.

[08:29:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
phpBB probably has a mailing list somewhere.

[08:30:00.0000] <workmad3>
phpBB you'd just define bbcode tags with the correct embed syntax for the sites you want to allow

[08:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
video sites like to use custom controls, their own branding and additional features like links to related videos, etc. All of these features are offered by flash, and can be replicated using <iframe>, but not with <video> alone

[08:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is betting <iframe sandbox> is not going to be allowed anywhere by default without whitelisting of sites.

[08:30:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
("anywhere" meaning "in any forum software package")

[08:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They can add the branding to the video as a watermark or clips shown before/after.  Beyond that, sure, I agree, but I suspect forum developers won't.

[08:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unrestricted <iframe sandbox> is kind of scary even if browsers support it.

[08:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
what's scary about it?

[08:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It allows arbitrary scripts to run on the page, just theoretically they can't do anything that actually steals data.

[08:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
They can use tons of CPU, for one thing, making it slow to browse.

[08:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Can it do alert() or other things like that?

[08:33:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
If no, are you really sure you've gotten all of them?

[08:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Apparently no.

[08:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
"scripts are still prevented from creating popups"

[08:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What if they trigger an endless loop of HTTP authentications, say, in a browser where those are modal dialogs?

[08:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or any number of other obnoxious things.

[08:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Surely a modal dialog counts as a popup for those purposes?

[08:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess so.  I've actually gotten modal dialogs popping up in Firefox and blocking page load because someone used a signature image from a badly-configured server.

[08:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, me too.

[08:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
well, if sandbox doesn't address those issues and they're real problems, then perhaps it should address them

[08:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not to mention someone using a signature image (which was even a 404) from a domain that Chrome was convinced was evil incarnate, so all visitors to some threads got a giant terrifying "THIS SITE MIGHT DESTROY YOUR COMPUTER!!!" message.

[08:37:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Agreed.  There's a thread over in whatwg that would be relevant to bring them up in.

[08:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Presumably the warning message will be intelligent wrt sandbox.

[08:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>

[08:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me glares

[08:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Realistically, forums tend to have lots of moderators who can edit this stuff out on a case-by-case basis, so as long as it's just annoying at worst and not a security problem, it might be tolerable.

[08:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I'm not the best one to ask, you should be asking phpBB devs or something, if that's your use-case.

[08:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
MediaWiki won't allow this by default for totally different reasons (privacy, etc.).

[09:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>

[09:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Seemingly runs decodeURI on .hash

[09:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Which breaks Google Wave on the Fx codepath (the default of the bypass browser sniffing) in everything else

[11:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, it seems like there is a notifications spec: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebNotifications/publish/

[11:26:01.0000] <boogyman>
updated today lolz

[11:26:02.0000] <boogyman>
:P

[11:26:03.0000] <AryehGregor>

/me forgot i didn't sleep last night D'oh!

[12:03:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Do common desktop notification systems (read: Growl and the ones in Ubuntu/Gnome even support what that notification spec implies

[12:05:00.0000] <opdynamiks>
probably. The spec sounds like the think that Google Gears was doing with notifications (to alert the user when they were in a different App or Window)

[12:15:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm not sure

[12:16:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the HTML notifications seem like complete overkill

[12:17:00.0000] <virtuelv>
and I'm pretty certain neither Growl nor Ubuntu notifcations support it

[12:23:00.0000] <tantek>
recommend that those here who design/develop real world websites participate in this survey: http://surveys.webdirections.org/index.php?sid=69882 (has some good questions on HTML5)

[12:25:00.0000] <gratz|home>
heh

[12:48:00.0000] <opdynamiks>
virtuelv: I don't think it is overkill... and I'm not sure if it is technically considered HTML5 since it generally is a set of JavaScript functionality that ties in to the user's browser system (i.e. task tray on Windows and Gnome, notifications bar on Android)

[12:48:01.0000] <opdynamiks>
virtuelv: although such a thing may proove to be super annoying to users (think: advertising notifications popping up)

[13:13:00.0000] <FireFly>
opdynamiks, well, the browser could force you to accept or deny it on a per-host basis... I mean, I can see web apps like gmail sending notifications when you receive new mail being pretty useful

[13:15:00.0000] <opdynamiks>
FireFly: yeah thats true, that could easily be a browser setting (default: on or off for new sites).

[13:16:00.0000] <opdynamiks>
I could see it being cool for media player web apps (MP3 and streaming radio) displaying track information on song change

[13:16:01.0000] <opdynamiks>
does anyone know if the drag N drop thing in HTML5 would make drag N drop file uploads possible?

[13:31:00.0000] <opdynamiks>
nevermind, found that it does indeed work with file uploads. have to fool around with that tonight. can't wait until it becomes a reality

[13:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think notifications are generally pretty annoying to begin with. I certianly don't want full HTML notifications (meaning they could include audio, video, flash, whatever)

[14:02:00.0000] <opdynamiks>
No, I agree that they should be text only, maybe bold supported.

[14:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me searches for "html5" in the flashplayer bts

[14:40:00.0000] <roc>
opdynamiks: drag-and-drop file upload is supported in Firefox 3.6

[14:41:00.0000] <opdynamiks>
roc: really, no earlier huh. I'll have to try it out

Lachy: seamless can't work cross-site anyway, btw. But why do you need sandbox="" in that example?

[15:35:00.0000] <Sonja>
hi

[15:36:00.0000] <Sonja>
when will html5 become official?

[15:36:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
what do you mean by official?

[15:38:00.0000] <Sonja>
ohhh "Ian Hickson, editor of the HTML5 specification, expects the specification to reach the W3C Candidate Recommendation stage during 2012, and W3C Recommendation in the year 2022 or later"

[15:38:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
well, the requiremtns of it being a W3C recommendation is actually quite sctrict as far as i recall

[15:39:00.0000] <Sonja>
the new equivalent of Flash and silverlight will be canvas?

[15:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Strict enough that HTML4 isn't a Rec under the current definition.  ^_^

[15:39:02.0000] <jonnybarnes>
html5 is quite well supported all ready

[15:39:03.0000] <jonnybarnes>
*already

[15:39:04.0000] <jonnybarnes>
particularly in modern browsers

[15:39:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sonja: <canvas> is meant to replace some of the things that Flash/Silverlight does.  Some things that are currently done with Flash are solved more simply using other parts of HTML.

[15:39:06.0000] <jonnybarnes>
indeed, as TabAtkins says

[15:40:00.0000] <Sonja>
can you recommend a neat html5 test page to see it in action and test my browser?

[15:40:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
for <canvas>, or html5 in general?

[15:40:02.0000] <Sonja>
i guess both ?

[15:40:03.0000] <Sonja>
or either

[15:41:00.0000] <jonnybarnes>
link for canvas game: well blog post about, it contains link for games

[15:41:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2008/04/super-mario-in-14kb-javascript.html

[15:41:02.0000] <Sonja>
"other parts of HTML". do you mean like javascript?

[15:42:00.0000] <jonnybarnes>
html5 video demo, needs safari or google chrome though, http://jilion.com/sublime/video

[15:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
In part, yes.  But also, say, internet video is done with <video> now.

[15:42:02.0000] <jonnybarnes>
thats less an html5 issue, more a what video codec will the browser support

[15:43:00.0000] <Sonja>
so do you thnk youtube and such sites will migrate to a new format?

[15:43:01.0000] <Sonja>
using <video> and such?

[15:43:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
They already have, in fact!

[15:44:00.0000] <Sonja>
neat

[15:44:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
yeah, youtube.com/html5 is a demo for it i think

[15:44:02.0000] <Sonja>
i'm guessing ff will support <video> soon enough

[15:45:00.0000] <Sonja>
or is mozilla trying to kill html5 video?

[15:45:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
its an issue with what codec to use

[15:46:00.0000] <jonnybarnes>
when you use the <video> tag the browser decodes the video natively

[15:46:01.0000] <jcranmer>
ff supports <video> since 3.5, if not 3.0 itself

[15:46:02.0000] <jonnybarnes>
sites like youtube are using a codec caleed h264

[15:46:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Mozilla *definitely* wants the <video> tag.  But they want it with codecs that don't require royalties, so their users are safe.

[15:46:04.0000] <jonnybarnes>
very good, but licensed(sp?)

[15:46:05.0000] <jcranmer>
just youtube doesn't support FF's video

[15:47:00.0000] <Sonja>
h264 is not royalty-free?

[15:47:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
mozilla won't5 pay the money for financial and politicaln reasons

[15:47:02.0000] <jcranmer>
bwahahaha no

[15:47:03.0000] <jonnybarnes>
nope

[15:47:04.0000] <jonnybarnes>
MPEG-LA own the license

[15:47:05.0000] <jcranmer>
it requires like $1M+ in fees, and I don't know if that's per-annum

[15:47:06.0000] <Sonja>
i'm reading up now.... http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2010/01/video_freedom_a.html

[15:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, ROC's post is a good one.

[15:48:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
yeah, thast a good article about it

[15:48:02.0000] <jcranmer>
I'm willing to bet that if MS implements <video> in IE 9, it won't support H.264 for a large number of computers

[15:48:03.0000] <roc>
TabAtkins: not just users, but content providers and everyone else

[15:48:04.0000] <jonnybarnes>
why not? what would MS use instead?

[15:48:05.0000] <roc>
jcranmer: more like $5M for us

[15:48:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
roc: Sorry, was meaning the term broadly like that.  ^_^

[15:48:07.0000] <roc>
per year

[15:49:00.0000] <jcranmer>
jonnybarnes: I believe MS only includes the H.264 codec with Win 7

[15:49:01.0000] <jcranmer>
roc mentioned the version at some point

[15:49:02.0000] <jonnybarnes>
jcramnmer: fair enough

[15:49:03.0000] <Sonja>
maybe this will make people switch from ff to chrome

[15:49:04.0000] <roc>
jcranmer: that is correct

[15:49:05.0000] <jcranmer>
that's the oddest misspelling of my name that I've seen

[15:50:00.0000] <roc>
maybe it will

[15:50:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I doubt it

[15:50:02.0000] <jonnybarnes>
lol, shows how tired i am

[15:50:03.0000] <jonnybarnes>
as long as flash exists as a faalback

[15:50:04.0000] <jonnybarnes>
most users wont noptice a difference

[15:50:05.0000] <jcranmer>
most users don't care about HTML 5 video support

[15:50:06.0000] <Sonja>
it defeats the purpose of having html5 to go back to flash tho

[15:51:00.0000] <jcranmer>
and many of those that do are likely to be evangelist for Theora

[15:51:01.0000] <roc>
currently, that's true, but that could change

[15:51:02.0000] <Sonja>
one of the appeals of html5 for me is that i won't need to use 3rd party thingy from adobe

[15:51:03.0000] <Sonja>
and i can use some sort of open format

[15:51:04.0000] <Sonja>
or maybe i'm misunderstanding what html5 will do

[15:52:00.0000] <roc>
no, that's totally true

[15:53:00.0000] <Sonja>
<acronym> is gone? i guess <abbr> is used instead ?

[15:54:00.0000] <Sonja>
i was using it with title="spell it out in full"

othermaciej: man, the copy/cut/paste events are as screwed up as the drag-and-drop events!

[16:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: sadly I am not surprised :-(

[16:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why wouldn't Microsoft just ship the H.264 codecs with XP/Vista if IE10 supports it?  It's not going to cost them any money, right?

[16:14:00.0000] <jonnybarnes>
maybe they have their own agenda and want a different codec being used.

[16:14:01.0000] <jcranmer>
get people to update to Win7, of course

[16:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, if that were their idea, they could just release IE9 for Windows 7 only.  But that doesn't seem to be what they're doing so far.

[16:15:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
reading wiki, is canvas patent-free? or do apple still have any patents for it?

[16:15:02.0000] <jonnybarnes>
wiki = wikipedia

[16:15:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
jonnybarnes, if they have any patents, they'd have to have declared them when HTML5 reached FPWD at the W3C, as far as I understand it.

[16:16:00.0000] <jcranmer>
a lot more people will complain if IE 9 is only available on 7 than if codecs are only on 7

[16:16:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
so essentially no-one has to worry about patenting issues?

[16:17:00.0000] <jcranmer>
apple would probably be shooting themselves in the foot

[16:17:01.0000] <jcranmer>
but that hasn't stopped people

[16:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jonnybarnes: That's one of the nicer things about working in the w3c - the patent policy at least helps protect people when implementing the specs.

[16:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jonnybarnes, you don't have to worry about a member of the HTMLWG having undisclosed patents on anything covered by the spec, no.

[16:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least, not on anything necessary to implement it.

[16:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not sure how far that goes into related technologies.

[16:46:00.0000] <quuxman>
what governs the height of a div tag?

[16:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
quuxman: The content, or the css height property.

[16:47:01.0000] <quuxman>
why would a div be twice as big as it should be? The bottom is just empty

[16:47:02.0000] <quuxman>
and it has no height property

[16:48:00.0000] <quuxman>
I just double checked there's no height with Firebug

[16:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
quuxman, link?

[16:51:00.0000] <quuxman>
oh duh, I had another element expanding it inside of course... just had to figure out which one

[17:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone remember what the status is of the "image analysis" thread is?

[17:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
was there some conclusion about what i should change the spec to?

[17:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think the conclusion was you should make it vaguer so it doesn't sound like anyone is doing actual image analysis in deployed AT.

[17:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like "UAs should think up clever stuff to do if there's no alt text, but any author who relies on this will be held to judgment and suffer in hell for all eternity".

[17:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(the latter part is non-normative)

[17:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(unless you think you can God to follow the spec)

[17:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
s/God/get God/

[17:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor's summary is accurate.

[17:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[17:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
done

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i should mail public-html

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
should we make lang="" missing on <html> trigger a warning?

[18:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't see why.  Most UAs don't actually need to know the language, and if they do, they can probably more reliably sniff it from content than by reading the lang tag.

[18:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Especially for common languages.

[18:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[18:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's the lang attribute actually good for anyway, realistically?

[18:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
other than making the i18n group happy? dunno

[18:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
i like making the i18n group happy, they're really nice people

[18:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
they never bitch or anything

[18:14:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh.

[18:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would mean you'd need another boilerplate tag in a minimal document to avoid warnings.

[18:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Would that warning trigger if you omitted <html>?

[18:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, I guess you already need to declare your charset to avoid a warning.

[18:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: yeah i guess so

[18:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh, whatever then.  I don't care much about warnings anyway.  I'll just continue omitting it because it's cooler that way.

[18:28:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
doesn't requiring a lang imply that the page only has one langauge in it?

[18:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
KevinMarks: no, I don't think it does

[18:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it specifies the default language for the page

[18:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah this would just be the default

[18:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least as far as I understand it

[18:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll leave it as is

[18:31:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
ah right, so you can override it 

[18:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: fwiw, validator.nu already emits a warning for a similar case, which is if there's no character-encoding information given in the doc

[18:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
even if the doc is all-ascii?

[18:31:03.0000] <KevinMarks>
Like Stephanie does: http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2010/01/26/my-journey-out-of-procrastination-doing-things-now/

[18:31:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
yes

[18:31:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yeah, even for all-ascii, I think

[18:32:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
character encoding is not similar to language

[18:32:01.0000] <KevinMarks>
encoding is a computational construct, language is a human one

[18:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: iirc the spec has a MUST if there's no encoding and it's not ascii (and some other conditions aren't met, e.g. boms, http headers), and there's no conformance problem at all without one if it's pure ASCII

[18:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I'm not sure that it's possible to have validator.nu make a determination of whether a doc is pure ascii or not

[18:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it would have to sniff the entire doc, would it not?

[18:35:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Doesn't it have to do that anyway?

[18:35:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, my point was that we do have a precedent of emitting a warning for a case that's not a strict conformance error but that could lead to problems with portability of the document

[18:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[18:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the message it currently emits is something that it emits early in processing, by looking just at the first 512 bytes for a character-encoding declaration

[18:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or for a lack of one

[18:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah it would take more work to do the right thing there

[18:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's certainly do-able, but not sure it would be worth it or not

[18:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that code is in the HTML parser

[18:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Could leaving the lang unspecified actually "lead to problems with portability of the document"?

[18:38:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
AryehGregor: I dunno

[18:38:04.0000] <Sonjaaa>
ahhh http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/04/mpeg_la_h_264_codec_licence/ !

[18:39:00.0000] <Sonjaaa>
h264 will stay royalty free!

[18:39:01.0000] <Sonjaaa>
i don't understand why firefox won't have it

[18:39:02.0000] <jcranmer>
um

[18:40:00.0000] <jcranmer>
what that basically means is you don't have to pay per individual use

[18:40:01.0000] <Sonjaaa>
ohhh

[18:40:02.0000] <jcranmer>
you still have to pay licensing fees

[18:40:03.0000] <Sonjaaa>
i see. tahnks fo helping me understand what is going on

[18:40:04.0000] <Sonjaaa>
with the future of webs!

[18:41:00.0000] <Sonjaaa>
multimedia webs!

[18:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It will also only stay free until 2016.

[18:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
At that point they could impose fees until well into the 2020s, when the last patent expires.

[18:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
2028, I think?

[18:42:03.0000] <Sonjaaa>
is this similar to the unisys/gif patent thingy?

[18:42:04.0000] <KevinMarks>
can you really assert the page is ascii just by checking all chars are 7-bit?

[18:42:05.0000] <jcranmer>
kind of

[18:42:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
AryehGregor: I don't know what all problems might arise with a lang-less document, but if the advice of the i18n folks is that we should warn about it lacking, their advice is worth considering very carefully. As Hixie points out, the i18n group are pretty nice people to work with, and they don't ask for stuff often, and when they do, it's always with a very considered opinion and communicated with tact

[18:42:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
But Mozilla would have to pay $5 million/year anyway to implement it in its browser, it wouldn't fall under the license-free clause.

[18:43:00.0000] <NickYoung>
incidentally, I still haven't been able to get QtWebkit working with youtube/html5. I'm thinking they're checking the user agent of the browser and the media engine.

[18:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
MikeSmith, maybe we could ask them why?  Where did they ask for this?

[18:43:02.0000] <Sonjaaa>
i think the gif patent has expired now?

[18:43:03.0000] <Sonjaaa>
i still use png

[18:43:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sonjaaa, yes, GIF patents expired a few years ago.

[18:43:05.0000] <jcranmer>
except that MPEG-LA is probably better able to enforce patents than Unisys

[18:43:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unfortunately, H.264 is patented for a long while to come.

[18:43:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think the IPTV industry might end up being the single biggest force to help unwind the H.264 monoply

[18:44:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
m'colleague at Apple had a millennium countdown clock modified to countdown to the GIF patent expiry.

[18:44:01.0000] <jcranmer>
especially because GIF was widely used before Unisys started enforcing the patents

[18:44:02.0000] <jcranmer>
and H.264 was widely used after enforcement

[18:44:03.0000] <KevinMarks>
when it expired, he checked in encoding into QuickTime

[18:44:04.0000] <Sonjaaa>
is there no "free" equivalent of h.264?

[18:44:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure is, Theora.

[18:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
lacking a free codec, IPTV hardware and service vendors and all their customers are otherwise going to be paying mountains of money in royalties 

[18:45:01.0000] <Sonjaaa>
but youtube and such don't want to switch to theora?

[18:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But Apple refuses to support Theora, and Google isn't distributing Theora video, and Microsoft probably will try to avoid supporting it too.

[18:45:03.0000] <Sonjaaa>
all the big boys don't like theora

[18:45:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
For a variety of reasons.

[18:45:05.0000] <Sonjaaa>
i'm assuming that theora is like vorbis? it gets put in an ogg file?

[18:45:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, Theora is put in OGG files, generally.

[18:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Sun was working on a royalty-free codec before they got bought up by Oracle. Maybe Oracle will take up work on it again

[18:46:01.0000] <Sonjaaa>
avi is also a container file... you could have theora in avi too?

[18:47:00.0000] <Sonjaaa>
so they are disputing what should be the standard for html5?

[18:47:01.0000] <NickYoung>
youtube's problem with theora is a supposed concern about quality-per-bit

[18:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
KevinMarks: I wrote a remarkably similar set of articles to that series by Stephanie Booth. except my first article was titled, "My journey out of procrastination, part 1: Preparing for the journey" and part two was, "Still working on getting ready, give me a little more time" and part 3 was "Quitting bugging me about it already", etc.

[18:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I wrote another series pretty much along the same lines, "My journey towards sobriety"

[18:51:01.0000] <quuxman>
what exactly does vertical-align do? I'm using it to center inline-block elements inside a block element, and it works fine, but in another spot it's not working

[18:53:00.0000] <Sonjaaa>
is there an ogg theora hardware decorder?

[18:54:00.0000] <quuxman>
I see... it actually determines the alignment of adjacent elements

[18:55:00.0000] <quuxman>
in reference to itself. So it only works if you have an element that spans the entire height of the parent

[18:55:01.0000] <annevk>
fyi: http://www.defectivebydesign.org/ipad

[18:55:02.0000] <NickYoung>
Sonjaaa: Not as yet, I believe

[18:56:00.0000] <kinetik>
Sonjaaa: depends how you define "hardware", but yes: http://www.schleef.org/blog/2009/11/11/theora-on-ti-c64x-dsp-and-omap3/

[18:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
getting Theora supported on more hardware would be a great thing

[18:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
especially in chipsets for mobile devices

[18:57:01.0000] <doublec>
also theora decoder on fpga: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPmMYG6_VgI

[18:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
kinetik, doublec - great stuff, thanks for the heads-up

[18:59:00.0000] <quuxman>
the old vertical alignment problem. No good way to do it. It still baffles me

[18:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
doublec: you guys are supporting this work?

[18:59:02.0000] <quuxman>
er, vertical centering

[18:59:03.0000] <doublec>
MikeSmith, we supported the c64x dsp/omap3 stuff

[18:59:04.0000] <doublec>
the fpga stuff is fairly old

[19:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[19:02:00.0000] <Sonjaaa>
thanks !

[19:05:00.0000] <nessy>
I am a big believer - I believe Google will "be good" and eventually provide a Ogg Theora alternative to YouTube

[19:05:01.0000] <Sonjaaa>
is google still "not evil" ?

[19:06:00.0000] <nessy>
well … I think they're trying to

[19:06:01.0000] <Sonjaaa>
their android OS is a fork, eh

[19:07:00.0000] <nessy>
pretty difficult as a large corporate

[19:07:01.0000] <nessy>
I haven't lost hope :)

[19:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: hey, thanks for the reply about the accessibility media issues. Eric Carlson was on the telcon and gave a summary of what you all had been discussing thus far. I think he said you were hoping to find some time to have a phone discussion some time soon

[19:08:01.0000] <nessy>
well, I'm not organising the media subgroup

[19:09:00.0000] <nessy>
I am hoping that John Foliot and/or David Singer will organise such a phone hook up soon

[19:09:01.0000] <nessy>
it would be good to have in about 2 weeks, I think

[19:10:00.0000] <nessy>
I have three new discussion threads to start and then with that feedback we should be ready for the phone call and some agreement on moving forward

[19:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: so far it seems like both John and Dave have not be able to free up enough time to really drive the work and expedite it. If you were able to help with leading it more, maybe we could get it moved along faster

[19:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you had time

[19:11:02.0000] <nessy>
that's why I volunteered on the next steps

[19:11:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[19:12:00.0000] <nessy>
I cannot promise it - right now I'm basically out of contract 

[19:12:01.0000] <nessy>
I do need an income ;)

[19:12:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[19:12:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, understood

[19:12:04.0000] <nessy>
but I am preparing another funding request so hopefully that will go through

[19:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wishes he could get his hands on some Web Foundation money...

[19:13:01.0000] <nessy>
I'll do what I can - I'm definitely not giving up

[19:13:02.0000] <nessy>
but in Dec and Jan I wasn't able to do anything, so not much happened about media a11y

[19:14:00.0000] <nessy>
had other contracts to finish

[19:14:01.0000] <nessy>
right now it's all good, but I can't say until when

[19:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: well, going forward, whatever I can do to help with the media a11y stuff, let me know

[19:14:03.0000] <nessy>
awesome, thanks

[19:15:00.0000] <nessy>
maybe we can start setting up a phone conf meeting for in 2 weeks

[19:15:01.0000] <nessy>
I'm sure John and Dave would agree, but just haven't time themselves to organise it

[19:15:02.0000] <nessy>
if you could do that, that would really help, IMHO

[19:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you mean just a one-time call, or do you want to set up a regular weekly call?

[19:22:00.0000] <nessy>
just a one-time call

[19:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[19:22:02.0000] <nessy>
we work very productively over email, so don't need weekly calls

[19:23:00.0000] <nessy>
but a one-time call is probably a good thing now

[19:23:01.0000] <nessy>
just to make sure we are all on the same page

[19:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK. any particular day of that week? (the week of the 15th to the 18th? or after?)

[19:25:00.0000] <nessy>
how about 23rd?

[19:25:01.0000] <nessy>
oh, we said a11y meeting on 19th will be focused on media?

[19:26:00.0000] <nessy>
so maybe do it a day or two before that

[19:26:01.0000] <nessy>
at a time that suits me ;)

[19:28:00.0000] <nessy>
how about http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2010&month=2&day=17&hour=21&min=0&sec=0&p1=224&p2=179&p3=240

[19:28:01.0000] <nessy>
should pass it by Dave and John, I guess

[19:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: yeah, I will send a message to the list proposing that

[19:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
should make sure that Eric can make it too

[19:29:02.0000] <nessy>
indeed - and Philip!

[19:29:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah

[19:29:04.0000] <nessy>
I might even involve Ken from Google, even if he otherwise loathes standards participation

[19:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as the regular weekly a11y call, I suggested that we move it that week to a different, eastern-hemisphere-friendly time, so that you could be on that week

[19:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
wow, somebody who loathes standards participation, that's a rarity :)

[19:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can't imagine why anybody wouldn't like it.. the rest of us love it so much

[19:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
people just don't know what they're missing

[19:33:00.0000] <nessy>
all these misunderstandings, repeated explanations, heated arguments over nothing, and finally little moves towards correct technical solutions - really don't know what they are missing!

[19:33:01.0000] <nessy>
;)

[19:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yep

[19:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the drama of it all

[19:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the Thrill of Victory and the Agony of Defeat

[19:36:01.0000] <nessy>
heckling is fun

[19:36:02.0000] <nessy>
it's the modern oriental market

[19:36:03.0000] <nessy>
you have to know how to stand your ground to sell your carpet ;)

[19:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's an embarrassment of riches, as far as the opportunities for heckling go

[19:40:00.0000] <nessy>
/me chuckles

[19:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: is there anybody in the media subgroup who's on the US east coast?

[19:41:01.0000] <nessy>
are you?

[19:41:02.0000] <nessy>
I assume you might be interested in participating?

[19:42:00.0000] <nessy>
ah, you're right - we need to make sure that Philip can participate - New York is not that important

[19:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: I live in Tokyo

[19:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'm roughly in the same timezone comfort range as you

[19:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the time you suggested is 22:00 for Philipp, so not too heinous

[19:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will propose it and Cc him and JohnF and Dave and Eric and see what they say

[19:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: meet for 90 minutes?

[19:45:00.0000] <nessy>
nah, maximum 60 should be fine

[19:45:01.0000] <nessy>
don't want to drag it out

[19:45:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[19:47:00.0000] <nessy>
6am for you is a bit early!

[19:47:01.0000] <nessy>
but with such requirements, it might be hard

[19:49:00.0000] <nessy>
so, basically I want to discuss three things:

[19:49:01.0000] <nessy>
* Multitrack JavaScript API

[19:49:02.0000] <nessy>
* external caption formats

[19:49:03.0000] <nessy>
* declarative syntax for associating external text resources

[19:58:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
nessy: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-a11y/2010Feb/0063.html

[19:58:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
foolip: ↑

[19:59:00.0000] <nessy>
cool - I will reply with agenda items :)

[20:01:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
thanks

[20:03:00.0000] <nessy>
John Foliot just said he's fine with that time

[20:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
great

[20:15:00.0000] <nessy>
thanks for organising! will you do zakim and stuff, too?

[20:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: yep

[20:16:01.0000] <nessy>
you rock :)

[20:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm just the cook.. I gets paid two bottles of wine a week, and I don't have to pick no cucumbers or tomatoes

[20:24:00.0000] <nessy>
lol

[20:24:01.0000] <nessy>
I am a passionate tomato picker!

[20:27:00.0000] <nessy>
I only sometimes need to be paid to buy other fruit and vegetables - so I can turn all my attention to the tomatoes.

[20:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
tomatoes is one of God's greatest creations

[20:30:00.0000] <quuxman>
does IE support the display:table, display:table-cell vertical centering hack yet?

[20:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
tomatoes are evil

[20:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: tomatoes told me that they like you

[20:36:01.0000] <nessy>
hahahaha

[20:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
quuxman: IE8 does.

[20:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or rather, it supports the full table-* set of display values, and all the hacks that entails.

[20:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me may go ahead and change his company's websites over to using table-* rather than <table> for the two-column, and just use js to hack IE7 into shape.

[21:04:00.0000] <quuxman>
TabAtkins: what's the market share of IE8 these days?

[21:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
man, it would be really nice if when I were using a comma-separated list of css selector expressions, I could have a comma after the last one and it would still work as expected

[21:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: is there a reason why that case should not be allowed?

[21:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: ↑

[21:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
in many programming languages when you have a structure with a comma-separated list like that, having a comma after the final one in the list is valid

[21:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's just annoying in css when you're doing a lot of copy and paste

[21:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: No clue.  Bring it up on the www-style list?

[21:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hai

[23:13:00.0000] <quuxman>
is there a better way in CSS to say ".foo[class~=bar] { ... }" to match an element with class="foo bar"?

[23:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
quuxman: .foo.bar I think

[23:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
string em together like a choo-choo train

[00:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: have you been noticing any increased delays when committing to dev.w3.org?

[00:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm getting long delays between calling cvs and getting any messages back

[00:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
doesn't seem to be due to locking, but just.. slow

[00:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: no, but i don't generally notice when things are slow at that stage

[00:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[03:36:00.0000] <annevk>
I initially thought http://blog.vlad1.com/2010/02/05/mjs-simple-vector-and-matrix-math-for-js/ was about othermaciej

[03:36:01.0000] <annevk>
o_O

[03:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that is indeed a funny thing to call a library

[03:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=716

[03:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
from tantek

[03:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can't reproduce it

[03:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that bug report reminds me that I should ask rubys if he has gotten requirements from tantek and zeldman

[03:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if the polyglot stuff isn't going anywhere, it should be taken out of the UI in order to stop confusing users

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I see the bug in deployment

[03:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
let's try locally...

[03:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I suppose the polygot stuff could be kept and made a runtime option for others who want to run the own downstream installs

[03:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I suspect the problem is caused by the changes I made to move the required-attributes reporting to the assertions-checking code

[03:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that stuff is working as expected for me locally

[03:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but maybe I neglected to check in some necessary part

[03:52:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, I need to just revert that change

[03:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
in anticipation of getting the required-attributes reporting into the jing v.nu branch

[03:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe you can take a look at the generated embed-vnu.rnc file and see if that's correct

[03:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can't figure what else would cause this problem

[03:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me starts a clean install

[03:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. looks like I have a failing assertion in the parser

[03:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what a relief that it's not me that broke something this time :)

[03:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I suspect, you broke something, too

[03:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
damn

[03:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
just when I was getting ready to pat myself on the back

[03:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: on the serious/bright side, dunno if you saw the patch submitted from Carey Evans, to build.py

[03:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
to get it work as expected under Windows

[04:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
he mentions that it seems to run and work fine

[04:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
last I remember, you had said that you couldn't get v.nu to run correctly on Windows

[04:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I was unaware of a patch.

[04:00:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm near email bankruptcy again

[04:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
close your eyes and start deleting

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. Eclipse doesn't break on assertions if I tell it to break on AssertionError

[04:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=715

[04:02:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://bugzilla.validator.nu/attachment.cgi?id=147

[04:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. no, I'm again looking at and debugging different things in Eclipse

[04:02:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I should get my Windows VM working again so I can help test on Windows

[04:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. awesome. so there's a way to create child processes from python that works on Windows

[04:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, seems so

[04:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Carey deserves at least a beer for that

[04:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
now eclipse breaks correctly

[04:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or an non-alcoholic beverage :-)

[04:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yeah, true, maybe some laudanum 

[04:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, I guess maybe that has alcohol too

[04:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe could make some alcohol-free laudanum

[04:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so it seems that the assertion is revealing a real parser bug...

[04:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm.

[04:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
no

[04:09:03.0000] <hsivonen>
doh

[04:09:04.0000] <hsivonen>
the assertion is bogus

[04:09:05.0000] <hsivonen>
xml:lang strikes again!

[04:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I've been living in the Gecko land so long that I've forgotten about other parser configurations when writing my assertions

[04:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I can reproduce locally the bug tantek reported.

[04:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: so chances are you haven't checked everything in

[04:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: btw, I *think* my review queue is empty. Do you have patches that I should review but that I've missed?

[04:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I don't think I do have any patches that I've sent to you but that you've not reviewed

[04:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I need to finish the jing patch and get that to you

[04:17:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I won't get around to that til next week

[04:17:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I basically need to trim down what I ported over from George's patch

[04:17:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
his patch builds a string representation of the content model

[04:17:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
rnc syntax

[04:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but since we don't need/want to emit the model, but instead just the names of the missing attributes/elements, it seems like I should trim that part out

[06:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: it'd be in the html namespace if you specify the html namespace

[06:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
as long as you do while(stripos($input, ($token = random))); then your token will be secure

[06:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wishes brutal death from above on people who advertise their website as being at foo.example but actually only have a server at www.foo.example

[06:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, oh, oops. I misread it. Kornel was using that as the prefix, not the namespace URI.

[06:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: If people find collision attacks on SHA512, I think HTML sandboxes are likely to be the least of people's concerns

[06:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Salt is helpful to make dictionary attacks n times harder where n is the number of users you're trying to attack simultaneously, and I'm not sure it's relevant here)

[06:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would mean that even if you computed one viable attack input by brute force, it would only work when the salt value you used in generating it comes up

[06:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(which leaves you with as strong a defense as just using a good quality random number

[06:30:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, shouldn't browsers fix that?

[06:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you pick an arbitrary $token and then manage to find an input that hashes to that (with </sandbox token=$token> inside it), then the hash is severely broken and lots of cryptographic systems would collapse

[06:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
and I don't see how the token thing could be broken in easier ways

[06:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
and I'm happy to believe SHA512 is not severely broken enough for this to be an issue in the next decade

[06:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Browsers are not the only UAs, you know (and not all browsers fix it)

[06:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
(...and you're not going to compute one viable attack by brute force, because there's more hash outputs than there are atoms in the universe)

[06:39:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, I guess people should use Google first then o_O

[06:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"52framework is a CSS framework which aims to provide an easy way to build websites using HTML5 & CSS3 while still supporting all modern browsers (including ie6)."

[06:41:01.0000] <zcorpan>
wait, ie6 is a modern browser?

[06:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: anyone knowledgable enough to make a considered judgment about what hash algorithm to use is also knowledgable enough to know how to get good random numbers

[06:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, unfortunately, for some people, developing sites for compatibility with IE6 is a reality.

[06:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
Although, that is rapidly changing now that some major sites have finally dropped support for it

[06:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: that doesn't make IE6 modern, though

[06:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
on the site of the framework, text overlaps a vertical rule

[06:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
based on the quote, I think the implication that IE6 is modern is a grammatical ambiguity

[06:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: I'm not sure I agree with that

[06:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: It's easy to tell someone to use SHA512 because that's a good hash function, and they can easily find how to access it in their programming language

[06:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's just as easy to tell them to use, say, arc4random

[06:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
my attention span timed out before I found out what license 52framework is under

[06:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(though I suppose it might be less likely their language already has it)

[06:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: If I try to search for how to generate secure random numbers in PHP, I get pointers to mt_rand and sha512(mt_rand) and lots of things that seed based on the time

[06:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, as long as $token is subsequently generated to be a sufficiently long randomised string, based on the random number, as opposed to an integer between 0 and 32768

[06:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like the only way to do it in PHP is to read /dev/urandom

[06:50:03.0000] <Philip`>
or something else on other platforms

[06:50:04.0000] <Philip`>
as far as I can tell

[06:50:05.0000] <Lachy>
(funtions like rand() in PHP or, apparently, arc4random() just return integers)

[06:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
and it's very easy to get it wrong, e.g. by using a wrong RNG or not seeding sensibly

[06:52:00.0000] <annevk>
why do we want <sandbox>?

[06:52:01.0000] <annevk>
what's wrong with <iframe srcdoc>?

[06:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
We probably don't

[06:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, you'd want more than 32 bits of randomness, but it doesn't really matter if you convert numbers to strings as ASCII or in some other way

[06:52:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I still like srcdoc.  Nuts to randomness or hashing.  Just a single, trivial, quickly-and-obviously-failing escaping step is better.

[06:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
<sandbox> would have some potential advantages over <iframe srcdoc>:

[06:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
1) frames have high memory and performance overhead - a page with hundreds or thousands of iframes would likely be a bad user experience

[06:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I thought we wanted it because security is a fun new thing to argue about once we are bored with accessibility and Process

[06:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, if your token is just a number convered to ascii, like <sandbox-18489>, where that number is randomly generated each time the page is generated, then an attacker could insert </sandbox-25930> and get a successful attack on approximatley 1/32768 visitors

[06:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
2) if your desired fallback is content that sizes naturally in the document, then it's hard to use <iframe> at all until all browsers support seamless iframes

[06:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(i.e if you are using sandboxing in combination with server-side sanitization for defense in depth)

[06:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: By the time @sandbox and @srcdoc are supported properly, @seamless should be too.

[06:55:03.0000] <annevk>
it seems it would be even harder to use <sandbox> othermaciej

[06:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not saying it's better overall, just listing the possible advantages

[06:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it has some disadvantages too

[06:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
there's no obvious way to do <sandbox allow-script>

[06:56:03.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: If your token is based on a number between 0 and 32767 converted to a long randomised string by applying sha512() to it, you'll have the same problem

[06:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: you need more than 32 bits, but how you convert it to a string doesn't really matter

[06:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(incidentally, 2^32 is 4,294,967,296, not 32,768)

[06:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
one in 4 billion is probably too close for comfort but even 64 bits of randomness would be sufficient

[06:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
(PHP's rand() apparently goes up to 2^16 on some platforms (Windows))

[06:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, rand() has a platform-specific max

[06:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm sure using PHP's rand() is terrible

[06:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Believe me, that's what will be used.

[06:59:03.0000] <jgraham>
I think that is a killer

[06:59:04.0000] <zcorpan>
you could use 16 bit rand several times and add them together

[07:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
bad random number generators are an attractive nuisance

[07:00:01.0000] <meledin>
If someone is inclined to use rand() anyway I doubt they'd take that extra step?

[07:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan: And get less than a bit per extra?

[07:00:03.0000] <jgraham>
It's bad enough if part of the solution is people typing S-H-A into their code, let alone saying "you need a random number generator (but not that one)

[07:00:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Window's system random number generators are also really weak in addition to not using enough bits

[07:00:05.0000] <Philip`>
(With 32 bits of randomness you just need to put 64K sandboxes on a page and there's a good chance one of them will collide)

[07:00:06.0000] <Philip`>
(I think)

[07:00:07.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to decide whether to go to uni in Edinburgh or Glasgow

[07:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we need a birthday paradox calculator

[07:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, actually that's rubbish)

[07:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: You have an offer frm E.?

[07:01:03.0000] <Philip`>
(because it's not any-vs-any)

[07:01:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: yes.

[07:01:05.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Go there

[07:01:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: if/when you sync up to the build r91 commit and still see any problems, let me know.. but I think that should fix the problem tantek found (for now at least, until we get the jing missing-attributes enhancement in )

[07:01:07.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: That's what I'll probably do.

[07:01:08.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Go to both

[07:01:09.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: :P

[07:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But Glasgow has joint-honours CS and Eng. lang. which is tempting

[07:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
He's not doing social studies with a gap year in a university in an underprivilidged region, you know

[07:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Like the east-side of Glasgow?

[07:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
or the west side

[07:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Calton has a life expectancy of 54)

[07:04:01.0000] <annevk>
/me reads the remainder of the "integration of HTM"

[07:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: ah, right, birthday paradox doesn't apply

[07:04:03.0000] <Philip`>
Does joint CS and Eng. lang. mean you only do half as much of each?

[07:04:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if the L was accidentally or intentionally omitted in that thread title

[07:04:05.0000] <Philip`>
That sounds bad in terms of learning anything particularly useful in either one

[07:04:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yes.

[07:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Yes (to the second point)

[07:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
(so that was really directed at gsnedders)

[07:05:02.0000] <annevk>
/me doesn't like how Richard just seems to try to push things through without listening to feedback on complexity

[07:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If anyone has an infinite-precision float library sitting around, the problem is simply n = log(.5) / log( (2^32)-1 / 2^32 )

[07:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I am getting the impression that he's trying to strong-arm people into going with his preferred design

[07:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Unfortunately, I just get 0 back from the latter part.

[07:07:00.0000] <meledin>
-1/32

[07:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I'm not sure if he is being intentionally misleading about the level of support his proposals have from Mozilla and Apple (and, in one case, specifically me) or if he just hears what he wants to hear

[07:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Also: it is somewhat ironic that Edinburgh teaches more Haskell than Glasgow.

[07:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: the birthday paradox number for 2^32 possibilities would be only 30084 for a 10% chance of collision

[07:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but, birthday paradox does not actually apply to this problem

[07:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but we're not hitting birthday.

[07:08:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
This is different.

[07:08:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: (I don't know about other subjects, but in CS there's usually a load of introductory stuff in the first year because some people don't know programming or basic algorithms etc, and if you're someone who's good at computers then it'll be a while before the more challenging stuff gets introduced)

[07:08:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's a much larger number.

[07:08:06.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Wolfram Alpha

[07:08:07.0000] <othermaciej>
it's simply linear

[07:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to have a 10% chance of collision you need 0.1 * 2^23 tries

[07:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yeah, I know

[07:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
since each is independent

[07:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Edinburgh starts with Haskell and other related things, whereas Glasgow starts with Python

[07:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe somewhat more, that's actually the number needed for your expected number of collisions to be .1

[07:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: (and I guess if you only spend half as much time on CS then you'll be almost at the end of the course before it starts doing anything exciting)

[07:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but since you can have more than 1, that's not the same as the probability of having at least one

[07:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: In the first two years you get all the CS stuff.

[07:10:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: As in Scotland you normally do three subjects in first year, and two in second.

[07:10:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, yes, I'm getting that you need a 31-bit number of tries.

[07:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So it's only in honours (i.e., the final two years) where things really differ.

[07:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I realized that you could simplify the expression to a single log in a different base.)

[07:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Ah, sounds all weird and crazy

[07:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you have two prefixes (a and b) identifying the same namespace, can you do <a:e></b:e> ?

[07:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
No

[07:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, that's no longer well formed XML

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
"To conform to this specification, a document MUST be well-formed according to the XML 1.0 specification"

[07:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
(says XMLNS)

[07:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It needs to be both well-formed XML (per /TR/xml/) and namespace-well-formed (per /TR/xml-names/)

[07:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
(and "A document is namespace-well-formed if it conforms to this specification.")

[07:20:04.0000] <Dashiva>
So it's not well-formed, but is it namespace-well-formed?

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
No

[07:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Namespace-well-formedness is only defined for things that are well-formed

[07:21:02.0000] <Dashiva>
kk

[07:21:03.0000] <Philip`>
If it's not well-formed XML, it doesn't conform to XMLNS, so it's not namespace-well-formed

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I don't see why that's the case

[07:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's defined in terms of conformingness to the XMLNS spec

[07:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Peh.

[07:22:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm wrong.

[07:22:04.0000] <Philip`>
and conformingness to the XMLNS spec is defined in terms of whether something is well-formed or not

[07:22:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm a terrible browser QA guy.

[07:22:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You should replace me.

[07:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/gsnedders/???/

[07:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't work out what to replace him with

[07:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: I think yourself

[07:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Er, I hate to tell you this, but gsnedders just disappeared, and there are now three question marks asking me how to set up their computer

[07:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, how do I keep typing </fielset> over and over and over again?

[07:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That should be a valid closing tag for <fieldset> just to fix my screwups.

[07:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: That would be even more evil than <image>

[07:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But it would mean I wouldn't have to make a 2-second fix every time I write a page with a form!

[07:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Or you could just not use fieldsets, use divs instead!

[07:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But then I'd need to put in extra styles!  This is clearly suboptimal.

[07:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Nobody uses default fieldset styling, surely

[07:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, no, not in public-facing sites.

[07:57:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or most of my private pages.

[07:57:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
But my throwaway scripts do!

[07:57:04.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think you should care about the look of your throwaway scripts, that will make you less likely to actually throw them away

[08:05:00.0000] <nesta>
does anony know if there is documentation on the javascript API to the <video> element (in safari/iPhone) ?  -- e.g. how to get buffer status, play/pause, position, video duration, etc. etc.

[08:06:00.0000] <annevk>
the spec?

[08:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The spec.

[08:06:02.0000] <nesta>
the spec

[08:07:00.0000] <nesta>
I haven't seen any dev documentation for controlling video

[08:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The spec explains all the functions involved in the <video> API.

[08:07:02.0000] <annevk>
look for the green boxes

[08:07:03.0000] <hsivonen>
the spec doesn't say which parts of the spec safari implements, though

[08:07:04.0000] <annevk>
they give dev documentation

[08:07:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ok, that's true.

[08:08:00.0000] <nesta>
aye -- but they're probably following it

[08:08:01.0000] <nesta>
? :)

[08:08:02.0000] <annevk>
yes

[08:08:03.0000] <nesta>
can you link to the URL?

[08:09:00.0000] <nesta>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/  ?

[08:09:01.0000] <nesta>
thankfully it works in Chrome

[08:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[08:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Specifically, start here: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#media-elements

[08:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Everything below that point is talking about the apis.

[08:10:03.0000] <nesta>
TabAtkins: thanks -- it's making sense now

[08:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Cool.

[10:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes how GStreamer splits its plugin packages into "good", "bad" and "ugly"

[10:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It'd be nice if they explained what the difference was, though)

[10:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
((Looks like ugly is like good but with patent issues, and bad is like good+ugly but with quality issues))

[10:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/splitup.html - oh, they do explain it

[12:17:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, fyi, document.head is in the spec

[12:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
it is?

[12:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
woo

[12:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
when did i do that

[12:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
what was the bug # again?

[12:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
got it

[12:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
commented

[12:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yt?

[12:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8375

[12:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: is the last paragraph the only request at this point?

[12:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is Silverlight standard in IE now?

[12:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wondering about that new post in whatwg about the theora streamer leveraging silverlight3.

[12:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If that's fairly dependable, then fuck yeah.

[12:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Did David Gerard post that one too?

[12:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
He posted one to wikitech-l.

[12:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[12:46:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Cortado is already established and will work much more reliably cross-platform.

[12:46:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's a java applet, though.

[12:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, and?

[12:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's why it works much more reliably cross-platform.

[12:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, I don't know what the penetration numbers are on silverlight vs java runtime.

[12:47:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Within the IE-using community, specifically.

[12:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean, if I can hit IE with this, then I can just deploy <video> with theora and ignore Safari until they shape up.

[12:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'm fairly sure it's not installed by default

[12:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm pretty sure Java is more widely installed than Silverlight even on IE/Windows, but I haven't checked.

[12:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's shown as an optional update whenever you run Windows Update, but I've never seen it get installed without me performing some explicit action)

[12:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wonder how many people have installed it already as a plugin prompt on major websites, though?

[12:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know that, frex, Netflix runs on Silverlight.

[12:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me installed it to try watching videos on itv.com

[12:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
before discovering that get_iplayer could download its videos as nice simple .asf files that work in mplayer and can run at fullscreen without dropping frames

[12:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
and without the unskippable adverts

[12:55:02.0000] <Steve^>
Did someone say silverlight3?

[12:55:03.0000] <Steve^>
I think Mono barely supports 1

[12:55:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[12:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
and before deciding that the video quality was barely watchable

[12:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Shrug.  Use FF or Opera and you don't need Silverlight.

[12:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
and before realising that they didn't have any content I wanted to watch anyway

[12:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd just be using it to serve IE people.

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
gah

[17:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
i though the point of RDF URLs is they were usefully dereferencable

[17:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me ends up going to google and googling the URL instead

[18:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's only the point when you want it to be

MikeSmith: hey Mike, you there?

[23:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yes, i guess that paragraph is the only request in that bug

hsivonen: k

[10:03:00.0000] <si-p>
hi, could someone please confirm whether the tests for html5lib (python) should all pass. I run runtest.py and get a shed load of failures ... lots of Es and Fs.

[10:04:00.0000] <si-p>
i hope this is the correct place to ask

[10:05:00.0000] <si-p>
using the default branch

[11:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
si-p: This is the correct channel, though nobody who can answer is paying attention to the room right now.  Best best is asking somewhere during a normal workday in GMT.

[11:22:00.0000] <si-p>
TabAtkins: ok, thanks

[13:26:00.0000] <daedb>

Hixie: I <3 the split/rename of the Web Browsers section

[16:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I was just about to file a bug when I noticed it

[16:41:00.0000] <annevk>
/me missed that

[16:43:00.0000] <annevk>
arguably in complete.html some Web application APIs should be under that new section...

[16:46:00.0000] <annevk>
if srcdoc implies <!doctype html> I think text/html-sandboxed should too

[17:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: text/html-sandboxed and srcdoc have totally different purposes

[17:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't see the relation

[17:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, I think the idea is that since text/html-sandboxed is a new MIME type without the legacy issues of text/html, then documents served as such should be rendered in standards mode

[17:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure whether or not that's a good idea though

[17:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, I can see the potential benefit

[17:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
on the other hand, it effectively introduces a third syntax

[17:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
for just one minor difference

[17:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That would have a bad save-as story, unless the mime-type comes with a new file type suffix as well

[17:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you'd probably want a new suffix for the sake of Web servers that bind by extension

[17:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>

/me actually has to go for a bit but should be around later on

[10:18:00.0000] <Huvet>
hi, is there a way (similar to commit_on_success) that can commit a transaction every 100:th save that's made?

[10:19:00.0000] <Huvet>
would be a great way to speed up my bulk inserts, but still allow me to break them off halfway if needed

[10:34:00.0000] <Huvet>
ehm... that was NOT in the right channel, sorry

[12:33:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, well, we introduce a new syntax for srcdoc

[12:33:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, would make sense to me if text/html-sandboxed uses the same

first? o_O

[21:50:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Released _to_

[21:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: wait, what?

[21:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[21:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that might even qualify as the most astonishing sentence I've read all weekend

[21:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is the file extension really going to be .sandboxed?

[21:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: URIs don't have file extensions

[21:58:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Looking at http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/iana.html#text-html-sandboxed

[22:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah well yeah the IANA asks for a filename for some reason

[22:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2010Feb/0082.html is pretty fantastic

[22:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
especially the baseless accusation in sentence two of paragraph one

[22:06:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And its fantasticness will be amplified in the minds of all the non-members who can only imagine what it says :)

[22:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
i also love the way the author of that thread always makes sure to take their complaints out of the public eye

[22:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's like they realise that they'd be lambasted if they made that kind of accusation in public

[22:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's what formal process is for, avoiding accusations based on common sense

[22:07:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Good morning, zcorpan

[22:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
good morning Dashiva

[22:09:01.0000] <zcorpan>
had a good weekend?

[22:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I have no complaints, at least :)

[22:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
great

[22:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I actually hadn't read that message yet, was trying to take some time off from that thread

[22:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
don't blame you

[22:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i noticed that i was cc'ed on a later w3c-archive thread so i figured i should check if anything else had been going on

[22:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
imagine my surprise!

[22:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
w3c-archive? Oh great.

[22:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
You can tell things are going well when they end up _there_.

[22:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(w00t for MO lists)

[22:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: are you empowered to see MO content?

[22:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: I'm an Opera rep, so yes

[22:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's interesting because almost all the content on that list is from sysbot

[22:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, it always surprises me how scarce content is there

[23:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(excluding sysbot)

[23:09:00.0000] <abarth>
Hixie: is http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-December/024335.html a bug in the spec?  i wasn't sure if i read it right

[23:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like a bug

[23:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
haven't fixed it yet

[23:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's on the pile

[23:10:03.0000] <abarth>
ok, thanks

[23:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
are PUT and DELETE only allowed as methods for same-origin form actions in the first place?

[23:11:01.0000] <abarth>
yes, but the spec doesn't seem to stop redirects

[23:11:02.0000] <abarth>
307

[23:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that does sound like it would subvert the requirement

[23:12:00.0000] <abarth>
i don't think anyone implements that currently

[23:12:01.0000] <abarth>
but it's probably good to fix :)

[23:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
now here's something that gives me hope: http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/how-the-letterman-oprah-leno-super-bowl-ad-came-together/

[23:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if Jay Leno and David Letterman can get along, maybe we can publish a technical specification without killing each other

[23:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Javascript URIs behave as if they're same-origin, right?

[23:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, webkit linebreaks (if necessary) for <nobr>foooo<wbr>baaaaar</nobr>

[23:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
but firefox doesn't

[23:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: depends on where you use javascript urls

[23:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: iframe@src

[23:25:02.0000] <zcorpan>
yep

[23:25:03.0000] <zcorpan>
iirc

[23:26:00.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej - I've seen no killing yet, just loud animals - and they are everywhere ;)

[23:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. so it looks like one of the threads on public-html make a comeback from w3c-archive

[23:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I don't like the pattern of taking HTML WG threads into the Member archive space

[23:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, I recommend that people who do have Member access check out what kind of stuff gets taken off-public-html in a way that cannot stay public in www-archive but doesn't go totally person-to-person, either

[23:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Things vanishing into an effective black-hole seems really bad

[00:21:00.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: thanks for the reply - I'm using 0.11, tip of the default branch from https://html5lib.googlecode.com/hg/

[00:24:00.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: just installed to a fresh environment and the first problem I get is http://paste.pocoo.org/show/175252/

[00:25:00.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: this issue has been mentioned on the mailing list so I altered the code to catch the ValueError exception and continue

[00:25:01.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: and the tests complete, but lots of errors

[00:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
si-p: 0.90 should be tip…

[00:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
si-p: That error is caused by SimpleJSON being stricter than the spec

[00:29:00.0000] <si-p>
gsnedders: thanks, I'll try 0.9 

[00:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
si-p: What revision is tip at for you?

[00:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
si-p: And what sort of errors are you getting?

[00:34:00.0000] <si-p>
gsnedders: tip is 1512:f4ce29fce65f

[00:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
OK, that's what it should be

[00:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Which is identical to 0.90 release.

[00:35:02.0000] <si-p>
are there any tests for 0.9?

[00:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
0.9 != 0.90

[00:36:00.0000] <si-p>
oh

[00:42:00.0000] <si-p>
gsnedders: is the tip of the default branch the code I should be using?

[00:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[00:42:02.0000] <si-p>
gsnedders: I'm not the best with mercurial

[00:43:00.0000] <si-p>
ok and the SimpleJSON errors are expected?

[00:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[01:37:00.0000] <si-p>
gsnedders, jgraham: tests are passing ok now, thanks

[01:37:01.0000] <si-p>
the reason for running the tests was because I had a parse error on a html file, but that looks to have cleared up also

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to deal with some feedback from bz about <object>, type sniffing, MIME types, and so forth, and goes cross-eyed trying to work out what the algorithm should be

[02:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mxr ftw

[02:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
1. Go to step 2 (fallback).

[02:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
apparently webkit takes type information for <object> from <param name=type>

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm not even going to that level of wackiness

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
my whiteboard is already full just with MIME vs type vs sniffing vs extension

[02:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
we might have to copy webkit on that for compat with banks that use java

[02:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you do, file a bug

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
in the meantime, file a bug on webkit to remove their magic :-)

[02:23:01.0000] <zcorpan>
we'll try to figure out what to do first

[02:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
I think that's what I have to spec.

[02:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
to replace the "Determine the resource type, as follows" algorithm

[04:28:00.0000] <benjoffe>
The webstorage spec appears ambiguous:  http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/, consider the following:

[04:28:01.0000] <benjoffe>
storage.setItem("0", "foo");

[04:28:02.0000] <benjoffe>
alert(storage[0]);

[04:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
webidl defines the precedence order

[04:38:00.0000] <si-p>
gsnedders: any idea why I get this_should_never_appear_publicly element in the tree after parsing?

[04:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
If that's the element I think it is, because I created a bug.

[04:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, no, not my bug.

[04:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Um, what's the input? File a bug on that.

[04:41:00.0000] <si-p>
tostring(html5lib.parse('<html></html>', treebuilder="lxml"))

[04:41:01.0000] <si-p>
produces

[04:41:02.0000] <si-p>
'<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">\n<html:html xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><this_should_never_appear_publicly/></body><html:head/><html:body/></html:html>

[04:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Um, that's bad.

[04:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
What version of lxml?

[04:43:00.0000] <si-p>
 dont understand how the tests are passing

[04:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me has never seen that

[04:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't understand how that element can get there

[04:43:03.0000] <si-p>
lxml-2.3dev-py2.6-linux-i686.egg

[04:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
What is tostring?

[04:44:01.0000] <benjoffe>
Hixie: are you sure it is defined? "If an object implements more than one interface that defines a given special operation, then it is undefined which (if any) special operation is invoked."

[04:44:02.0000] <si-p>
lxml.etree.tostring

[04:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[04:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
I get '<html:html xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><html:head/><html:body/></html:html>'

[04:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
with lxml 2.2.2, I think

[04:46:00.0000] <si-p>
this isn't a lxml problem though is it?

[04:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'd presume it's a change in lxml's behaviour

[04:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
benjoffe: there's only one interface involved here though right?

[04:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
I get the right output with lxml 2.2.4

[04:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Not necessarily lxml's problem - html5lib might be relying on non-guaranteed behaviour here)

[04:47:03.0000] <jgraham>
So it seems like a 2.3 change

[04:47:04.0000] <Philip`>
(although arguably it's lxml's problem that html5lib has to rely on non-guaranteed behaviour)

[04:48:00.0000] <benjoffe>
Hixie: right, i just can't see where in webidl that is actually defined

[04:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has no recollection of why that magic tag has to be inserted

[04:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Creating a DOCTYPE is impossible in lxml apart from at parse-time

[04:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yes, I remember that much

[04:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: And to parse anything you need a well-formed XML document, which requires a root element

[04:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The point of calling it that and not "html" is to make sure the tag name is correctly changed

[04:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
benjoffe: in the [Get] definition, probably.

[04:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
benjoffe: if it's not defined, see the status section of the webidl spec for where to send comments

[04:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
so that we can get it defined :-)

[04:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: But won't lxml complain about the mismatch between <!doctype html> and the root element name?

[04:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
(well obviously it didn't, but they are supposed to match, no)

[04:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: no, that's a validity constraint, not a well-formedness constraint

[04:57:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: It only enforces valdiity constraints if you enable them.

[04:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: But the whole point of doing things like this was to get the right information into the dtd object

[04:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
Do we actually get that right now?

[04:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AFAIK yes

[04:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
it looks like we at least partially do

[04:59:02.0000] <jgraham>
in 2.2.x at least

[05:01:00.0000] <si-p>
is the workaround to downgrade lxml?

[05:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
si-p: Hopefully that will work

[05:02:00.0000] <si-p>
ok thanks

[05:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What I really don't get is how it ends up as a child of body

[05:05:00.0000] <si-p>
gsnedders: it's done in one of the parse phases

[05:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
None should move the root element, ever

[05:09:00.0000] <annevk>
-> in Oslo

[05:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Now that I've run away :P

[05:12:00.0000] <annevk>
seemed better that way

[05:19:00.0000] <si-p>
yeah, downgrading lxml sorts it

[05:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
si-p: Could you file a bug please? I will try to investigate

[05:22:00.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: on code.google.com?

[05:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
si-p: Yes

[05:22:02.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: ok

[05:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
si-p: Thanks

[05:44:00.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: done, issue 136 :)

[06:06:00.0000] <annevk>
is anyone actually ever using the filtering options HTML5 tracker provides?

[06:06:01.0000] <annevk>
I personally just find the color coding useful but the form feels like clutter

[06:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I've sometimes used the tools and conformance checker filters

[06:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: though more often using my forked script than your instance

[06:12:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm going to comment it out and see who starts yelling

[06:19:00.0000] <annevk>
cleaned up http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker a little bit

[06:19:01.0000] <annevk>
arguably it should be called Web Applications 1.0 Revision Tracker but this seems good enough

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
grrr. I had forgotten Java has a 2^16 byte limit for the size of the static initializer

[07:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Does this page die with a character encoding error on line 2 for any of you?  www.weitz.de/hunchentoot

[07:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It does for me in Chrome/Win if I force it to interpret as utf-8

[08:03:00.0000] <daedb>
TabAtkins: It dies on line 150 for me (with forced utf-8).

[08:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
How bizarre.

[08:03:02.0000] <daedb>
That's in Opera/win, btw

[08:05:00.0000] <annevk>
why bizarre?

[08:07:00.0000] <annevk>
line 150 has "í" as character which will clearly fail your XML if you try to decode it using UTF-8

[08:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, right.  My eye passed over that.

[08:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wondering why I get an error on line 2, on the ? that ends the PI.

[08:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Someone else gets an error on line 2 with the opening ?.

[08:08:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe because the encoding label is considered wrong?

[08:09:00.0000] <annevk>
browsers should disable the character menu for anything but text/plain and text/html I think

[08:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oddly enough, Firefox claims it's interpreting the page as utf-8, but doesn't die.

[08:11:01.0000] <annevk>
does that version of Firefox fail Acid3?

[08:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I only get a 92 on Acid3.

[08:12:01.0000] <annevk>
pre-Acid3 browsers have "broken" XML pipelines

[08:12:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
This is current 3.6, though.

[08:12:03.0000] <annevk>
the part that does character decoding is not aware of XML restrictions; Acid3 got that aligned with the XML spec

[08:51:00.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: hmm, looks like this lxml/html5lib issue may be my fault

[08:51:01.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: at the bottom of one of my modules I'd set the default parser for lxml

[08:51:02.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: and this seems to have been causing the issue

[08:52:00.0000] <si-p>
jgraham: still looking at it, but I may close the bug report

[08:53:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[08:53:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe I can use HTML5 fetch in XMLHttpRequest after all

[08:53:02.0000] <annevk>
if I use the "pause" concept for the sync case

[08:56:00.0000] <annevk>
it would be nice since fetch defines a lot of details

[08:57:00.0000] <annevk>
/me hopes Hixie can answer the question ^^

[08:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finds yet another ECMAScript spec bug

[09:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
This is somewhat depressing.

[09:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I look at the spec for around ten minutes and find four places that are wrong.

[09:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Where wrong is defined as disagreeing with all implementations in a way that implementations cannot realisitically change)

[09:01:02.0000] <Dashiva>
es3 or es5?

[09:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: es5

[09:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Though these issues seem to exist in ES3 too

[09:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: You have been looking for more than 10 minutes :)

[09:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
(but agreed it is depressing)

[09:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Time flies when you're having fun!

[09:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(I must be a sick masochistic lion…)

[09:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
That's a song from the Wizard of Oz, right?

[09:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What is?

[09:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
"I must be a sick masochistic lion"

[09:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
No

[09:09:03.0000] <jgraham>
I realise

[09:09:04.0000] <jgraham>
It was funny

[09:09:05.0000] <jgraham>
In my mind

[09:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Um, OK

[09:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
You're weird.

[09:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Though you are a far better cook than I.

[09:10:03.0000] <jgraham>
Are you asking for food?

[09:10:04.0000] <annevk>
food

[09:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
, glorious food

[09:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
No, I have food at home I need to cook and eat myself.

[09:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't need feeding, Mummy.

[09:11:03.0000] <zcorpan>
i can has a girlfriend who makes me food

[09:11:04.0000] <annevk>
oh thy, glorious food, gimme some, more

[09:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes around three people here will get the joke of calling jgraham that

[09:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Ah, so that's what I'm missing.

[09:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yes, distance relationships are bad for that

[09:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although they can always phone and order you takeaway

[09:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
(note: untested in actual relationship. May lead to breakup and/or death)

[09:14:01.0000] <si-p>
is is possible to replace the element class that gets created by the tree builder?

[09:14:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder if the margin boxes can include edit frequency in an automated way

[09:14:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Hmm, maybe I guess I ought not alpha test that

[09:15:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I integrated some of your changes btw

[09:15:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: cool

[09:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
si-p: Not without hacking it, AFAIK

[09:15:03.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I didn't integrate the back/forward stuff because it's not first/last proof

[09:15:04.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i know it's not, but i figured it didn't really matter much

[09:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
at least i was too lazy to implement checks :)

[09:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the back/forward thing was what i actually wanted, though

[09:17:01.0000] <si-p>
gsnedders: ok - thinking about trying to replace TreeBuilder.elementClass with my own

[09:17:02.0000] <annevk>
lolz

[09:17:03.0000] <annevk>
ok

[09:17:04.0000] <annevk>
i'll have another look

[09:17:05.0000] <annevk>
the back/forward stuff was not mentioned in your changelog so I thought it mattered the least

[09:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh, i guess i suck at writing checkin comments

[09:18:01.0000] <si-p>
gsnedders: probably leave that for another day - thanks for your help btw

[09:22:00.0000] <annevk>
guess I have to do some more checking

[09:22:01.0000] <annevk>
your code generates server errors

[09:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
snap

[09:28:01.0000] <zcorpan>
did you remove the filter thing?

[09:35:00.0000] <annevk>
i commented it out

[09:35:01.0000] <annevk>
next/previous added

[09:36:00.0000] <annevk>
do you want it back?

[09:36:01.0000] <annevk>
once Opera 10.5 ships with localStorage I'm going to remove this cookie mess

[09:37:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe we could move filters back in as well as long as we make them persistent

[09:37:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yes please :) i can tweak the style to make it less ugly

[09:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
we could move to localStorage now

[09:38:01.0000] <annevk>
<form> is no longer a required container right?

[09:38:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, we could, but that'd be annoying for me...

[09:38:03.0000] <zcorpan>
the form can submit, though

[09:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh there are two forms

[09:39:01.0000] <annevk>
yup

[09:39:02.0000] <annevk>
filters are back in

[09:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
just for scripting convenience it seems

[09:40:01.0000] <zcorpan>
thanks

[09:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
   form { margin:0; font-size:smaller }

[09:41:01.0000] <zcorpan>
   fieldset { border:none; padding:0 }

[09:41:02.0000] <zcorpan>
   legend { padding:0; font-weight:bold }

[09:41:03.0000] <zcorpan>
   form > fieldset > p { margin:0 }

[09:41:04.0000] <annevk>
just realized the scripting stuff

[09:41:05.0000] <annevk>
is that just for the first form?

[09:41:06.0000] <zcorpan>
styling for both

[09:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
form > fieldset > p could be replaced with form p

[09:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
foodz

[09:43:01.0000] <annevk>
that's ugly

[09:44:00.0000] <annevk>
fieldset also has margin btw

[09:51:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, when you get back it would be useful to know which parts of the filter you are using

[10:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Anyone know the reason input type=range,checkbox,radio,color can't be readonly?

[11:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i use show editorial content

[11:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does Opera not support Unicode characters in IDs?  Test case: <!doctype html><meta charset="utf8"><a href="#ל">Click me</a><a href="#%D7%9C">Click me too</a><div style="margin:100em 0" id="ל">Do you get here?</div>

[11:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Neither link works in Opera 10.10.  Both work in Firefox, Chrome, and IE6.

[11:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, only the first link seems to work in IE6.

[11:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
First seems to work here

[11:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not in 10.10, though

[11:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it works in some other version?

[11:36:02.0000] <Dashiva>
10.5

[11:36:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I seem to recall it worked in 9.x when I tested it earlier.

[11:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe it's a bidi bug :)

[11:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Seems unlikely.

[11:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I should try with some LTR character, though, yeah.

[11:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I get the same behavior on 9.64.

[11:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The first link does work in 10.50, though, good.

[11:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe it's the url escaping thing

[11:52:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i seem to recall name="foo%20bar" matching #foo%20bar

[12:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I had hoped that we could ditch horrible URLs like <http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/קארים_בנזמה#.D7.A0.D7.91.D7.97.D7.A8.D7.AA_.D7.9C.D7.90.D7.95.D7.9E.D7.99.D7.AA>.  Oh well, maybe soon!

[12:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
does it work to use characters with no escaping?

[12:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh maybe you tried that

[12:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
JF's explanation of WCAG1 vs WCAG2 is somewhat amusing. Because the standard is "locked down", the response was to move all the useful content of the standard elsewhere.

[12:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I did it with no escaping anywhere, that's the only way it seems to work in IE6.

[12:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, unfortunately, that might be a real reflection on insane government agencies and such that take years to adapt to the release of new standards.

[12:17:02.0000] <zcorpan>
seems like no escaping works but with escaping doesn't, in 10.5 

[12:17:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
zcorpan, that matches IE AFAICT (at least IE6).

[12:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Other browsers seem to work either way, which seems correct to me.

[12:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[12:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
problem is maintaining compat with pages that expect escaped identifiers to match escaped name=""s

[12:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
s/identifiers/fragments/

[12:19:01.0000] <zcorpan>
iirc html5 solves that by special-casing <a name>

[12:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting.

[12:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was using id, not name.

[12:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
If Firefox works with that, probably no huge compat problem.

[12:20:03.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[12:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, it's pretty clear that most of the contention on public-html is caused by the fact that some members are using it as a consortium of browser vendors with narrow short-term goals, and some members see it as having other purposes that might conflict with those.

[12:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's nice to see someone actually point this out rather than just talking past the other side some more.

[12:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, why does YouTube's HTML video thing seem to deliberately block you from right-clicking on their videos?

[12:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
An empty div covers the video to steal the clicks.

[12:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Vimeo doesn't do that.

[12:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Particularly annoying since in WebKit, the only way to get fullscreen is to open in a new tab and hit F11 . . .

[12:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe youtube uses the div for captions and ads

[12:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
<div class="video-blocker">

[12:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm pretty sure it's to block clicks.

[12:29:03.0000] <zcorpan>
or maybe they want to hide save video as from clueless users

[12:29:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assume so.  Pretty obnoxious, but I guess only to be expected.

[12:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe that's a reason not to have good JS APIs, so that authors will be forced to expose default UI and can't easily hide things like "Save".  :)

[12:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(of course, they could just stick with Flash . . .)

[12:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
a site like youtube would probably want their own looks of the controls even if they could hide save from the controls

[12:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: maybe we could have "Filter:  [v] Show editorial changes  _More options..._"

[14:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Someone needs to write a LWP5

[14:41:00.0000] <Johnny__>
hello

[14:42:00.0000] <Johnny__>
What's the best way to style forms?

[14:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
dashiva: lwp?

[14:42:02.0000] <Johnny__>
I mean, is it ok to use id's and classes with input and form tags?

[14:42:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, of course it is.

[14:42:04.0000] <Dashiva>
TabAtkins: Perl's excuse for a www lib

[14:42:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
In fact you have to use ids on your inputs if you want to use <label> without wrapping the input.

[14:42:06.0000] <Johnny__>
I've seen a lot of people using input[type="text"] for example

[14:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, that's just easier.  You probably already have that data in your html, so there's no need to add class=text if that's all you're looking for.

[14:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But if you need to style things more specifically, certainly use classes and ids.

[14:43:02.0000] <zcorpan>
input:not([type]) - i usually omit type=text :)

[14:43:03.0000] <Johnny__>
Ok

[14:43:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, yeah, me too.  But IE doesn't accept :not().

[14:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
who cares

[14:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
My bosses do, because a good 70% of our website visitors use some variety of IE.  ^_^

[14:46:00.0000] <Johnny__>
That sucks.

[14:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh, at least I can get away with ignoring IE6 most of the time.

[14:46:02.0000] <zcorpan>
my mom's site has 57% ie

[14:46:03.0000] <Johnny__>
I always have to fix something to work on IE. It never ever works as it does in any other popular browser.

[14:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was very pleasantly surprised a few months ago when I finished up a major project and realized that I didn't have a single hack for IE8.

[14:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and firefox 30%, opera 4%, safari 4%, chrome 3%, mozilla 1%

[14:49:00.0000] <Johnny__>
I think the majority of people don't really know the difference between browsers, they use what they have and what they've been used to in the past. 

[14:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
only 7% of the ie users use ie6

[14:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Jeez, you're lucky.

[14:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's a constant sleight-of-hand to keep management from realizing how many people view our website with IE6, so I don't have to support it.  >_<

[14:51:00.0000] <Johnny__>
Does anyone in here still support IE6 ?

[14:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i tested the site in ie6 once and fixed a few things so that it was at least usable

[14:52:01.0000] <Johnny__>
I guess that's a no then.

[14:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm with zcorpan - I make sure the site is *usable* in ie6, but I make *no* effort to keep it pretty.

[14:53:01.0000] <Johnny__>
But you do display a message to someone using ie6?

[14:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[14:53:03.0000] <zcorpan>
no

[14:53:04.0000] <Johnny__>
Why not?

[14:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
not the kind of site to tell the user to switch browser

[14:54:01.0000] <webben>
Johnny__: I do.

[14:55:00.0000] <Johnny__>
I think that's a good idea, at least tell them that it's the browser not your site's fault.

[14:56:00.0000] <webben>
(Support IE6, that is, as part of http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/ )

[14:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
apparently my visitors have 19 different versions of flash

[15:01:00.0000] <Johnny__>
Do you style the section tag in css after declaring it as a block element?

[15:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If necessary?

[15:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's just like any other element.

[15:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I just feed it the IE shim and the quick block declaration for current-browser compatibility, then style it as I would any other element.

[15:02:02.0000] <Johnny__>
I've read an article saying that section is not for that and should use div instead.

[15:02:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think you misinterpreted the article.

[15:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<section> is not meant to be used *solely* as a styling hook.

[15:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
1280x800 is more common than 1024x768

[15:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is, if you need an element *only* to hang styles on.  <div> is appropriate there.

[15:03:03.0000] <Johnny__>
I'm talking about the html5doctor.com's article on how to use the section tag.

[15:03:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I suspected you meant that article.  That's not what they meant.

[15:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The rule is to just make sure that you're using <section> properly for its semantics, just like you should use all elements properly for their semantics.

[15:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
After that, style away.

[15:07:00.0000] <Johnny__>
I think I'm still a bit confused as to when should one use section and when should one use article.

[15:10:00.0000] <Johnny__>
<section><h1>title</h1><article>content</article></section> Is this wrong?

[15:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
my other site has 74% ie apparently

[15:13:00.0000] <Johnny__>
Do you use html5?

[15:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[15:13:02.0000] <Johnny__>
Can I see your site?

[15:13:03.0000] <zcorpan>
which one?

[15:13:04.0000] <Johnny__>
The one that uses html5

[15:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
emeress.se

[15:16:00.0000] <Johnny__>
Ok I see you used the section tag

[15:17:00.0000] <Johnny__>
Now I understand. 

[15:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess i can remove the script for firefox 2 by now

[15:25:00.0000] <Johnny__>
Thanks TabAtkins, and zcorpan

[15:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
nn

[15:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Johnny__: The difference between <section> and <article> is somewhat subtle, but there's an easy rule-of-thumb to tell them apart.

[15:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Use <section> whenever it would be appropriate to put a heading on the stuff you're enclosing (even if you don't actually end up putting one there).

[15:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Use <article> when you have something that could be a <section>, but would also be appropriate to link directly to, or to view by itself.

[15:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That rule-of-thumb helps capture the "independent content" semantic that <article> has.

[15:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Basically if it would be useful to link to a page that had *nothing* on it but the content of the <article>, then <article> is appropriate.

[15:46:00.0000] <Johnny__>
I see. 

[15:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Frex, I have a CMS with multiple tabs, one for each segment of my application.  Each tab is an <article>, because it would make sense to have them on a separate page (though I happen to collect them on a single page for convenience).

[15:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think using <article> or <section> for applications typically makes sense

[15:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean, look at the GMail UI, almost none of the logical groupings of UI elements have anything resembling a header

[15:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh, works for me.  Helps to delineate major sections of the app (using <article>) from minor sections (using <section>).

[15:51:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
They certainly *could* have a header.

[15:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the only thing that might be an <article> is an individual email message

[15:51:04.0000] <othermaciej>
they *could* but they don't

[15:51:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
They don't, because it's obvious from context.  But it wouldn't be weird to add one.

[15:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.  Presentational details like that shouldn't affect the semantics of the element.

[15:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't see any reasonable way to decide which groupings in the UI should be <section>s and which should be <div>s

[15:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just use the guideline I just said.

[15:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
<section> is a concept that makes sense for documents but not as much for applications

[15:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I agree, though, that the major sections of GMail should be <section>, and email messages should be <article>s.

[15:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you were explaining the difference between <section> and <article>, but that doesn't really clarify the difference between <section> and <div> in an app context

[15:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure.  The differernce is that <div> just groups things for some arbitrary reason, usually for styling or scripting purposes.  <section> groups them according to a logical division of the doc/app, with the "heading" rule of thumb helping to determine what's an appropriate "logical grouping".

[15:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That just keeps you from overthinking things and over-dividing the app.

[15:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Like, say, the Labels panel in the GMail ui - individual labels, with their color spot, would probably be <div>s.  It's not appropriate to use <section> there, because you wouldn't put a heading on individual labels.

[15:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, if you were on a label-centric page with a lot of info on each label, then it would be appropriate.

[15:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Same as how, frex, a group of ledes for blog posts on a blog home page should just be <div>s, but a group of full posts (or perhaps truncated posts with a "Read More" link) are appropriate for <article>.

[15:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<div> or <li> or something, that is.


2010-02-09
[16:10:00.0000] <Johnny__>
Does it make sense to nest two aside tags into one aside tag? I need to place two things one beside the other and float them so the one on the right won't go on the next row.

[20:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: about the report of problems with links in the http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/feed.rss feed

[20:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the feed readers I've tried do handle those links as expected

[20:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., if I click on the first link, it takes me to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0221.html

[20:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, I guess those are supposed to be absolute URIs

[22:05:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Morning.

[22:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
TheOutlawTorn: hey

[22:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: I filed a systems bug for the RSS feed link problem

[22:07:01.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Is this considered correct use of the following tags: <div id="someClass"><aside id="one">some stuff</aside><aside id="two">some stuff again</aside></div>

[22:07:02.0000] <nessy>
MikeSmith: excellent - wondered if there was some setup issue

[22:07:03.0000] <nessy>
thanks!

[22:07:04.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Basically I need to have a big block inside which I will position (using floats) something on the left and something besides it on the right.

[22:08:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I'm not sure I'm using the new tag correctly though.

[22:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: it seems that many (or maybe even most) feed readers resolve those into absolute URIs, but regardless, the feed validator says relative URIs in rss <link> elements aren't valid, so we should fix it

[22:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
TheOutlawTorn: is your content all <aside>s?

[22:11:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Everything is inside a <section> tag. The content is above the aside tags

[22:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so if the asides are stuff that you are having rendered as sidebars around the main content, then it would seem you are using it as intended

[22:12:01.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Well I'm placing a form in one and some text in the other

[22:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
all sounds fine

[22:13:01.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Hm, ok.

[22:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
that would all validate, as far as I can see

[22:13:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
but you can always check at http://validator.nu/ to make sure

[22:13:04.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
It validates, sure.

[22:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
TheOutlawTorn: if it validates, then the question about usage is mostly a subjective judgement call

[22:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
you could probably find somebody who might think the way you are using it is wrong

[22:21:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I see.. thanks

[00:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: link about the Oracle-Gnome accessibility news?

[00:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nm

[00:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
found it

[00:46:00.0000] <annevk>
do about: URIs need some kind of wiki registry as well?

[00:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
how many are there currently?

[00:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: ↑

[00:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and are we planning to add many more?

[00:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are there any where interoperability is needed, except about:blank?

[00:58:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, the sandbox stuff ended up adding one

[00:58:01.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, if people start using them for icons that would be at least one more

[00:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm

[00:58:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
困った

[00:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems like a registry might have an unintended side-effect of encouraging further proliferation of about: stuff 

[01:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
google translate couldn't detect the language for "困った" but could for "困った困った"

[01:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
weird

[01:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wonder how it translates it

[01:01:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Trouble trouble

[01:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
try 困ったな

[01:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Damn

[01:02:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's more like it

[01:06:00.0000] <annevk>
i guess it's not really needed

[01:07:00.0000] <annevk>
though some overview would be nice

[01:07:01.0000] <annevk>
i like overviews :)

[01:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it would be nice for any new registries to use some innovative technology of the last 30 years, such as, say, an actual database backend

[01:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone have a reference to an authoritative Google statement on the breadth of the H.264 decoding license a user get for Chrome?

[01:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_text.html says nothing on the topic

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(for background, Flash Player appears to be licensed only for non-commercial decoding)

[01:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
freedom zero FTW

[01:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I don't remember public statements except what was posted to the whatwg list

[01:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: thanks

[01:19:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, is it non-commercial if you make money of advertizements?

[01:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Doesn't that make commercial TV non-commercial?

[01:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
(I know TV is different)

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: IANAL, but I doubt the user of Flash Player is the one making money from advertisements when decoding is practiced

[01:22:01.0000] <annevk>
I thought commercial TV was TV not sponsored by the government

[01:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Is BBC World commercial or non-commercial under that definition?

[01:22:03.0000] <jgraham>
(but the point is it is a pretty weird defenition of "non-commercial" that includes the main way that video has amde money since its inception)

[01:23:00.0000] <annevk>
The public channels do advertising as well

[01:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/video/TV/ maybe. Or whatever the term is for "recorder moving images"

[01:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
*recorded

[01:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
having different licensing terms for commercial and non-commercial use is a trap.

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
setting those traps is uncool

[01:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'm looking at you, Creative Commons.)

[01:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me is quite happy to put photos under a non-nomercial CC license

[01:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
argh 

[01:24:04.0000] <jgraham>
commercial

[01:24:05.0000] <jgraham>
That wasn't even close

[01:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
But I would be somewhat less happy to put them under a simply BY license

[01:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: so someone else creates a larger work that includes your photos somewhere. Then later they find they want to make some money from their work.

[01:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: so they can't presumptively

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
which sucks

[01:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or they need to make more money than it costs to negotiate commercial licenses, which sucks

[01:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
It seems the problem is when people think CC-NC means "free but with some extra restrictions" instead of "proprietary but with some exceptions"

[01:27:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and you can extort them for money up to the cost of removing and replacing your photos

[01:27:04.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: In my spoecific case it would almost always be a case of "ask, get permission"

[01:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so effectively CC-NC is an attractive nuisance

[01:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
creators of larger works would be smarter to search Flickr for someone else's less good photos instead than take the risk of not being able to make money from their additive creativity

[01:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: You would prefer things were "all rights reserved" than BY-NC

[01:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: yes

[01:29:03.0000] <jgraham>
Curious.

[01:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
There are many instances where you are clearly never intending to make money from a project e.g. one-off presentations at science conferences

[01:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
However it is generally not worth the effort of asking for permission to use some nice pictures in those cases

[01:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Do people giving presentations at science conferences care about licenses, and not just crawl through Google Images looking for suitably amusing clipart they can grab without worrying about where it came from?

[01:31:02.0000] <jgraham>
I did. I'm not sure about anyone else

[01:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear those cases would even be violations of copyright law, depending on how many people watch your talk

[01:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
But I guess there is a higher-than-average chance of people doing that sort of thing abiding by the rules

[01:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: NC is basically this problem: http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090117/0537253446.shtml

[01:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the saddest part of it is how Lessig goes on the talking circuit talking about the problems documentary makers face in this area

[01:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and then his own organization is effectively promoting the same problem

[01:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that if you later find your larger work could be used in a way you didn't plan for, you are in a permission culture hell

[01:44:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I reckon he might have told you in private already, but just in case: http://bitworking.org/news/2010/02/joel-in-a-box

[01:44:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, also, if you're out there, did you see my notes on XMLHttpRequest from yesterday?

[01:44:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I was wondering if you agree it could use "fetch" if synchronous requests were told to "pause"

howdy folks

[01:45:00.0000] <annevk>
heya othermaciej

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: hmm... "fetch" works by queueing events

[01:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
er, tasks

[01:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
not events

[01:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
forget i said events

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: which means you have to spin the event loop to get them

[01:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: is the synchronous stuff supposed to block all tasks?

[01:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: this would be the thread to reply to on rel if you want to make your suggestion: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/1006.html

[01:46:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, yes

[01:46:04.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, apart from network tasks

[01:47:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, network tasks are processed to figure out when the request is done

[01:47:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, or to do some kind of timeout fail

[01:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: even network tasks relating to other things?

[01:47:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, or follow a redirect, etc.

[01:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: e.g. does <img onload> fire during a sync XHR?

[01:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, hmm no, that shouldn't happen

[01:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: or you could respond to the comments on issue 27 here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/1399.html

[01:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: is there  corresponding bug?

[01:48:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, only network tasks of the object in question

[01:48:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that issue predates the current process, and I believe there is no bug at all relating to it

[01:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: sounds like the process is too heavy weight, then. we should just do it in the lightweight bug fashion. I'll respond to the change proposals saying that and proposing we exercise the registry.

[01:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: sounds like your life would be better off if in the sync case you just did the fetch manually

[01:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: rather than try to use the event loop for everything except the event loop! :-)

[01:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: sounds ok to me

[01:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and I am fine with using a bug to track the needed change if after exercising the process there's consensus that we should go with it

[01:51:00.0000] <roc>
woohoo, some open Web motion in China: http://blog.mozilla.com/ligong/2010/02/09/china-construction-bank-supports-firefox/

[01:51:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, can I convince you to give "fetch" an optional sync flag so that I can use fetch?

[01:51:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, the reason I'm asking is that fetch defines a bunch of things already; having to define all those things again (as I've done now) is a bit of a waste

[01:51:03.0000] <annevk>
though I suppose I could

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: that might work. file a bug? mark it P1 critical if you need it this week rather than just anytime this month.

[01:52:01.0000] <annevk>
roc, would be interesting to know what they use for Firefox

[01:52:02.0000] <roc>
yeah

[01:52:03.0000] <annevk>
roc, do they use <keygen> or some Mozilla proprietary API?

[01:53:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, you don't know either :)

[01:53:01.0000] <roc>
I hope not

[01:53:02.0000] <roc>
even if they do, it's a big step forward from ActiveX

[01:53:03.0000] <roc>
of course it could also be NPAPI

[01:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe they use XBL1

[01:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's really sad that it's 2010 and banks support particular browsers

[01:55:01.0000] <roc>
in China it's not really 2010 :-)

[01:55:02.0000] <roc>
not on the Web

[01:55:03.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: It's not 2010 in Danske Bank, either.

[01:57:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, cool, thanks

[01:57:01.0000] <annevk>

[02:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, what does Flickr use to "protect" images?  I didn't think they did anything like that.

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: if the user who publishes photos chooses to enable the feature, Flickr disables the "All sizes" button and overlays the photo with a transparent gif

[02:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
as a result, browsers offer to save the transparent gif, since it's the frontmost image for any given pixel of the photo

[02:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
I thought the All Sizes button was just disabled for free accounts. I didn't realise there was an option to disable it manually

[02:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting tidbit of the day, there are named character references starting with each of the letters a-z and A-Z

[02:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
there are no other start characters for named character references

[02:18:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I removed the other filter options

[02:19:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, until someone complaints

[02:19:01.0000] <roc>
hmm, so it appears they have in fact wrapped their ActiveX controls in NPAPI

[02:19:02.0000] <roc>
so it could work cross-browser, but still stuck on Windows :-(

[02:19:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is happy to be able to read the spec in Minefield these days without beachballing

[02:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: because of parser changes or other changes?

[02:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what the situation with banking on mobile devices is in China and South Korea

[02:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I think both due to parser changes and due to layout changes

[02:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool

[02:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't think people actually do any browser-based banking in China and South Korea

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
at least with the Danske Bank JNI craziness, you can get around it using the Web bank version meant for mobile devices

[02:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
bank sites as a class are the worst as far as lack of cross-browser support and broken JS and other things

[02:22:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: ok

[02:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but airline sites as a class are not far behind

[02:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I find it not coincidental that airlines are in a class of business that it is known to treat its customers with a relatively higher degree of contempt that most other customer-service businesses

[02:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah. Lufthansa should rewrite their seat selector without Flash.

[02:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
banks also operate with a certain amount of contempt toward their average customers

[02:25:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I want to remove filter options from the diff page too because they are useless there

[02:25:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, that's for whenever I have some more free time

[02:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Web bank considerations are a big factor in my bank choice, but my airline choices would become overconstrained if I wanted to avoid both Heathrow and Flash

[02:25:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean I find it not so coincidental that the same classes of business that are known for poor/contemptuous customer services are also the same ones that try to force their users to use particular browsers and OSes

[02:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Heathrow is great example of open contempt on a large scale

[02:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc, annevk: I wish we could standardize some better crypto APIS than just keygen (whether Mozilla's PKI stuff, or something modeled on Microsoft's APIs, or something new)

[02:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: the diff page could have a link back to index

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: "A square wheel works, as long as you're willing to do a lot more work"

[02:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: you should go to the San Francisco exploratorium, they have a track with a square wheel where the ride is completely smooth :-)

[02:30:00.0000] <roc>
MikeSmith: there is massive amounts of online banking in China

[02:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, you don't need more work, you just need to make your road a catenary curve

[02:30:02.0000] <roc>
just not on mobile

[02:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rolling-Square.gif http://www.americandigest.org/mt-archives/square_wheels.jpg

[02:31:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: the issue here is that the large Chinese banks each have their own USB key storage device, and custom ActiveX controls to talk to those devices

[02:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I see, awesome

[02:32:00.0000] <roc>
it's pretty dumb

[02:32:01.0000] <roc>
there is no trusted path to the device, so you don't actually get any protection against malware

[02:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if you ever look at the per-country browser stats from NetApps, China seems to have much more computing monoculture than almost any other country

[02:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Before cavemen invented circles, I wonder if they made square wheels and inverted-catenary roads

[02:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the percentages for Windows and for IE are both much higher than anywhere else I could find

[02:33:02.0000] <roc>
China and South Korea

[02:33:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(though part of that could have been Maxthon getting counted as IE)

[02:33:04.0000] <hsivonen>
one *should* count Maxthon as IE

[02:34:00.0000] <roc>
We should send Li Gong from our Beijing office down to talk to you guys

[02:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: yeah, I was just referring to browser-based banking from mobile devices

[02:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: from the perspective of "computing monoculture", that is probably true

[02:35:01.0000] <roc>
he's been in there for years figuring out the problems and trying to make progress

[02:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me decides to use the indent/outdent feature in fckeditor to be translated into <details>

[02:39:00.0000] <roc>
one huge problem is that almost every PC comes with CDs full of pirated software

[02:39:01.0000] <hendry>
/me lived in Korea for a year. Also I am helping train some guys from our Taiwan office who find it difficult to think outside Visual Studio.

[02:39:02.0000] <roc>
if you want distribution your best strategy is to pay to be on those CDs

[02:39:03.0000] <roc>
along with the malware guys :-(

[02:40:00.0000] <roc>
another interesting problem is that the "non-IE browser" niche has been partially filled by browsers like Maxthon and others that are just shells around Trident

[02:40:01.0000] <roc>
they are perceived as non-IE

[02:40:02.0000] <roc>
better still for them, they are perceived as Chinese-made

[02:41:00.0000] <roc>
that's in addition to the complete dependence of banking on ActiveX, and on Web sites in general on IE quirks

[02:43:00.0000] <roc>
it may also be true that Microsoft can get away with certain practices in China that they can't any longer in other countries

[02:44:00.0000] <roc>
ah well. There is hope.

[02:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
Mobile is interesting, because Microsoft don't have nearly the same presence there

[02:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
true, I have not observed the same kind of monoculture in mobile browsers or operating systems anywhere

[02:45:01.0000] <roc>
ahem

[02:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, indent used style="" without a wrapper element, so that's not so useful. blockquote probably works better

[02:47:00.0000] <roc>
Mobile is probably the big hope in China, because ActiveX controls simply won't be a solution there

[02:48:00.0000] <hendry>
i've seen a couple of Chinese android devices at work. So we can look forward to a webkit monoculture :)

[02:48:01.0000] <roc>
there are in fact quite a few people looking forward to a webkit monoculture

[02:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there are people who want a webkit monoculture, but even that is less "mono" than an IE monoculture, plus I don't see them getting their wish so far

[02:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Opera is still pretty big in mobile browsing volume

[03:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, I would consider making your floor be a precisely-shaped series of inverted catenaries to be "a lot more work".

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

MikeSmith, http://wiki.whatwg.org/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&titles=Validator.nu+alt+advice&rvprop=content&rvsection=2

[03:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I finally managed to find the API guy and ask him.  He's on at different times from you, I guess, so I kept on forgetting.

[03:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs at the es5-discuss emails

[03:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
AryehGregor: nice, thanks

[03:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, or not, maybe

[03:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's just giving the raw wikitext, right?

[03:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
man, subversion never fails to find new ways to be disappointing

[03:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm discovering that once you have a workspace that you've used with a newer version svn client, you can't then go back to using that workspace with an older version of an svn client

[03:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: what makes you sigh about them?

[03:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: once you've boiled the ocean, retiling your floor is no big deal

[03:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: Well, basically, we have interop on behaviour of \09 and \9, but because the comittiee doesn't like octal escape sequences, we're just going to make them illegal.

[03:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, it gives you wikitext.  As discussed, it's not obvious what HTML output would be correct.  You can feed it back with action=parse: http://wiki.whatwg.org/api.php?action=parse&title=Validator.nu+alt+advice&text=''Foo''

[03:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(you might want to POST if you're using lots of text, I guess)

[03:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es5-discuss/2010-February/003491.html

[03:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: what does it mean to make them "illegal"? will the required behavior for \07 change, or will it be mandatory to reject it, or will it just be "undefined"?

[03:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there's not even a surface-level ECMAScript conformance checker so it's hard to say what is illegal for the language

[03:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(I think maybe there should at least be a checker to verify that your program is correct syntax per the ECMAScript grammar, even though that wouldn't catch many other kinds of undefined constructs)

[03:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: Per spec, "\07" does not meet the grammar, except if you allow octals (defined in appendix B). "\08" equally does not match the grammar.

[03:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The problem is the latter case

[03:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I see, so pseudo-octal is the problem?

[03:42:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Everything treats that as \x008

[03:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
OR octal-followed by non-octal

[03:42:05.0000] <othermaciej>
and by "problem" I mean not part of the defined grammar and behavior not defined

[03:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The grammar uses lookaheads to forbid it

[03:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
So yeah, behaviour is undefined

[03:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: if Brendan thinks it's not used on the Web, I kinda wish he would test that with the Mozilla code before failing to spec t

[03:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Whereas if the lookaheads asserting != OctalDigit and not != DecimalDigit, it would match the spec

[03:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sends email asking when they intend to change Gecko

[03:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, surely you could write a decent ECMAScript validator by just adding extra code to normal JS engines, which (maybe optionally) raise a warning whenever they hit spec violations?

[03:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, it wouldn't be perfect, but it would catch errors that were actually hit at runtime.

[03:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: the word "just" in your question contains a large assumption

[03:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That it would be easy to do that?

[03:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you could presumably offer to raise warnings for at least *some* conformance requirements.

[03:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even if most would be hard to check for.

[03:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
JavaScriptCore couldn't even easily be used to check the syntax level, since we support many extensions

[03:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so step 1 would be rewriting the tokenizer and parser to remove all grammar extensions

[03:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Shouldn't those extensions raise warnings as spec violations if used?

[03:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess it's not quite that simple.

[03:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it's doable in principle.  Gecko is rewriting its HTML parser right now for spec compliance, right?

[03:51:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks it would be non-trivial even in Carakan without us supporting many extensions

[03:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just depends on how much people want it.

[03:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: That doesn't throw warnings on parse errors

[03:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, well, no.  It's not meant to.

[03:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I didn't mean actual browsers should necessarily do JS validation.

[03:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . anyway.

[03:54:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No one seems to care about JS spec conformance.

[03:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've never even looked at the ES spec.

[03:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has spent far too much time looking atit

[03:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me really hates it

[04:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders where the missing space is meant to occur in "looking atit"

[04:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
*at it

[04:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[05:34:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, you are using "Pause until either any applicable style sheets have been fetched and applied, or the user agent has timed out and decided to not wait for those style sheets."

[05:34:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, so is that incorrect too?

[05:34:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it mixes pause and fetching

[05:35:00.0000] <annevk>
this stuff is hairy

[07:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"I'm not so concerned about implementers, I'm concerned about people reading just HTML5 and concluding that the spec requires sniffing"

[07:02:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What is the danger here?

[07:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You mean, like, what could happen if an author were to somehow read that and gain that impression?

[07:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
Users might decide that since the spec requires sniffing, it's safe for them to produce content that relies on sniffing

[07:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
and that would harm the UAs that don't sniff

[07:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The one user doing that seems rather insignificant compared with the thousands of users who don't read the spec, but produce content that requires sniffing anyhow

[07:06:00.0000] <annevk>
if users read the spec there would be no need for sniffing

[07:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: you could point that out in the bug

[07:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
That's still one user who would benefit from the spec being clear that sniffing is not required (from which they infer that they can't rely on sniffing)

[07:06:03.0000] <annevk>
because HTTP requires UAs to adhere to the Content-Type currently

[07:06:04.0000] <Philip`>
(and hence they will produce content that works in more UAs, so everyone wins)

[07:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
so it's better than nothing

[07:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: UAs that don't sniff would still be in an equally bad position

[07:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
They'd be in a marginally better position, and the author would be in a wider marginally better position

[07:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
and the HTML5 spec is a collection of tens of thousands of things that each make the world only a tiny bit better

[07:08:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If the author cared about UAs that didn't sniff, he wouldn't make content that relies on sniffing

[07:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
On the other hand, if he thinks that all UAs are required to sniff, then he might not care about ones that don't, as they're non-conformant in his eyes.

[07:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
If he reads just HTML5 and concludes the spec requires sniffing, then he is more likely to believe there are no UAs that don't sniff

[07:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Surely not

[07:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
If he cares about UAs that don't sniff, then he knows about them

[07:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
That seems untrue

[07:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
I care a bit about people who visit my sites in browsers I've never even heard of

[07:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
and search engine crawlers I've never heard of

[07:11:03.0000] <Philip`>
etc

[07:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I want to make content that is likely to work for them, even if I don't know any details about them

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
and to some extent I do that based on the assumption that if a spec requires something then these unknown UAs are likely to follow it

[07:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
(particularly if all desktop browser I test in follow it too)

[07:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
s//s/

[07:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: But that's trivially untrue, since a large amount of tools don't use HTML parsers.

[07:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
regexp ftw!

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: It's an unsafe assumption, but (in the absence of better information) it's the best assumption I can make

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
I have no idea how Googlebot parses HTML but I assume that if my page is valid HTML and parses correctly in desktop browsers then probably Googlebot will parse it correctly too

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
and I'll happily omit </p> and <html> tags, and write <br /> etc, based on that assumption

[07:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: But that changes your assumption. You aren't actually aligning with the spec, but rather with desktop browser behavior

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm aligning with the information I have available, which consists of the spec plus observable behaviour

[07:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
If they agree then I'll be reasonably confident in my assumption

[07:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
But if I conclude from reading the spec that some UAs might not have that behaviour, I'll be much more cautious about assuming it

[07:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, the spec says UAs don't have to support text/html, so leaving out </p> will break a class of conforming UAs

[07:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
using text/html at all will break a class of conforming UAs (regardless of tags used)

[07:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
My available information also consists of knowledge that most implementors are not entirely insane, and therefore will attempt to support text/html

[07:31:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Equally, most implementors are not entirely insane, and will sniff as required

[07:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe they'll sniff but not exactly as required

[07:32:01.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Hi

[07:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hi

[07:33:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Hi gsnedders

[07:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay for PHP SPL.

[07:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me just wrote a convenience class for turning mysql results into a tree iterator.

[07:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: The real question is are you dealing with software in which you can rely upon SPL being enabled

[07:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes - it's all personal tools for use on servers I control.

[07:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, that avoids so much of the horribleness of PHP.

[07:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yus.

[07:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me founds another crash bug in PHP over the weekend

[07:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is crashing PHP considered to be a bug?

[07:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
They are less often closed as bogus

[07:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Perl's unpack function lets you read arbitrary integers as pointers, so you can crash it trivially (unless running in a restricted-capability environment), so crashes with easy workarounds (i.e. "don't do that") aren't necessarily serious problems

[07:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
but crashes in JS implementations would be much more serious because there's different expectations in the environments where they're used

[07:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
but I don't know which end of the scale PHP asires to

[07:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
*aspires

[07:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
If something relies upon a deprecated option to crash, it might not matter

[07:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Otherwise, it probably does

[07:52:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Did any of you made a website recently that does not support 1024 screen resolution?

[07:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You mean, that is too wide for 1024?

[07:54:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I mean that the website will look as it should only at resolution higher than 1024, probabil 1280x768

[07:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, I've never done so.  I test my stuff at 1024.

[07:54:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I see.

[07:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
I only test at 1280x800, but I don't have users

[07:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which can be annoying sometimes, since all of my monitors are larger than 1024.

[07:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I've set up a resize command in Web Developer that helps out, at least.

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk>
getComputedStyle ... I wish you'd die

[07:56:01.0000] <annevk>
lalala

[07:56:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I finished my website that took a lot of planning since I don't do well at designing, and yesterday when I tested it at 1024 I've discovered that it does not look as it should. 

[07:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: I just... stay far away from that.  I rely solely on jQuery to do my CSS parsing for me.  Shrug.

[07:56:04.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I thought for a min not to support 1024 but I don't know how smart is that.

[07:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There's still lots of people at 1024.

[07:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So it depends on if you care about them or not.

[07:57:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Indeed there are.

[08:00:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Better offer support if I think about it, it's just about resizing an image and displaying a different stylesheet after all. 

[08:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Use media queries!

[08:01:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I thought of doing it with php since I don't know javascript

[08:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Media queries are CSS, actually.

[08:01:02.0000] <annevk>
actually, they're not

[08:01:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/

[08:02:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
lol

[08:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then why are they in a CSS spec, smartypants?  ^_^

[08:02:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I doubt that all the users using 1024 will have a modern browser. 

[08:02:03.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I bet a lot of them still use ie6

[08:02:04.0000] <Philip`>
Not everyone has their browser fullscreen

[08:02:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, but everyone hates ie6 users.

[08:03:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
:)

[08:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
People on larger screens might have multiple browser windows and preferably your page should work sensibly when they make the windows smaller

[08:03:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I hate IE users in general. 

[08:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
I hate users in general

[08:04:00.0000] <daedb>
No version of IE supports media queries.

[08:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's the spirit, Philip`.

[08:04:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
I didn't thought about what you just said, I guess I still need to do some tests before I can call it finished.

[08:05:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Hate is what keeps the world moving, never stop hating.

[08:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay SPL again.

[08:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me just wrote a useless class that lets him iterate through the fibonacci sequence.

[08:07:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Why?

[08:07:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just to play around.

[08:07:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Using the Iterator interface.

[08:08:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Hm

[08:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: That's not SPL

[08:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
foreach(new LimitIterator(new Fib,0,20) as $fib){ echo $fib."<br>"; }

[08:08:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Mang, whatever.

[08:08:04.0000] <Philip`>
Why not just write a function that returns it in constant time for any arbitrary index?

[08:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because that's silly, Philip`.

[08:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: http://se2.php.net/manual/en/class.iterator.php#91068

[08:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's just http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/6/8/968be88f42e32712cb10d89a765ce708.png and you save all the effort of iteration

[08:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Yeah, I know it's a common toy.  ^_^

[08:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: I was just playing around with infinite iterators :P

[08:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: That looks to have relatively hefty constant factors.  If I want the fib sequence starting from the beginning, iteration is cheaper.

[08:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Oh, haha, didn't see that was you who made the comment.

[08:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: :)

[08:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: I have written a fair bit of PHP :)

[08:11:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I know.

[08:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
]http://github.com/gsnedders/complexpie — what I've been touching recently

[08:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's my main language at this point, unfortunately.

[08:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: It's two pows and a subtraction and a division - that's going to be far cheaper than even just printing the output :-)

[08:12:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me needs to get Lisp running on his webserver.

[08:12:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Bah!

[08:12:05.0000] <Philip`>
Admittedly you might get problems with the finite precision of floating point numbers

[08:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, was just typing that it requires an accurate expansion of phi, which itself uses sqrt(5) in its definition.

[08:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
On that note: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=3458694&id=707492809&comments&alert

[08:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Dunno how widely viewable that is.)

[08:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bwahaha, the text-wrapping on my company's site means that, at the precise size that my IE window opened up at, we proclaim that we have "The World's Largest Member".

[08:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And that size is 800x600.  Glorious.

[08:30:02.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, the css3- prefix is a historical accident

[08:30:03.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, much like it is with Selectors

[08:31:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, anyway, ask the TAG, URIs have no meaning

[08:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know.  ^_^  My point, though, was that it didn't have anything to do with javascript, which seemed to be TheOutlawTorn's concern.

[08:33:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Well anyways I think it's best to use js since that's really easy to accomplish. 

[08:33:01.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
And I think it would be also good to start learning js at this point. 

[08:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It is a good idea.  Go learn jQuery, though.  Your life will be made infinitely easier.

[08:34:01.0000] <annevk>
wait what?

[08:34:02.0000] <annevk>
js is really easy but you don't actually know it?

[08:34:03.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
That is a javascript library

[08:34:04.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: You've never tried to debug random objects becoming undefined in jQuery obviously

[08:34:05.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
annevk: I never actually wanted to learn it in the first place.

[08:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: No.  I have never had such a problem.

[08:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: See, you obviously need to do more browser QA on buggy JS engines :P

[08:35:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
TheOutlawTorn: Yeah, I know.  I mean, though, that jQuery makes javascript development infinitely easier.

[08:35:03.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Yeah, I heard..

[08:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think I need to *not* do that, gsnedders ^_^.

[08:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: :)

[08:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Actually, that's a good reason to avoid joining the Chrome team fully, and instead just using them as a 20% project to implement CSS specs.

[08:44:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
?

[08:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That way I don't have to ever go debug random js engine things.

[08:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me just got hired by Google and hasn't yet gotten to the point where he decides what team to join.

[08:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
heh

[08:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
You should join the secret Evil team

[08:46:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hey, if they offer...

[08:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Oh, congratulations

[08:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thanks, jgraham. ^_^

[08:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
Did you announce that already? I missed it if so

[08:51:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd talked about it before, but I don't think many people were around then.  I wasn't sure I'd be able to accept at that point.

[08:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
So you are working mainly on specs, or mainly on products?

[08:54:01.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Congratulations.

[08:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
(well I guess you just said you don't know)

[08:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: My intention is to join the Open Source office with Hixie, and work on CSS specs.

[08:55:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
They let you choose what team you wanna be a part of?

[08:55:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
TheOutlawTorn: Yeah, several teams pitch themselves at you, and you pick which you'd prefer to work with.

[08:56:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Interesting

[08:56:01.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
What team has the most members?

[08:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
No clue.

[08:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders why thunderbird thinks "received:" headers are useful to normal people

[08:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Nice

[08:57:02.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Where are you from? If you don't mind me asking.

[08:57:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Houston

[08:57:04.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Nice.

[08:57:05.0000] <jgraham>
You don't fancy moving to California?

[08:57:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Since this is my real name, it's not like there's any real privacy involved.  ^_^)

[08:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, we're moving next month.

[09:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me wonders if there's any good way to expose depth information from his tree iterator in a foreach loop.  Maybe as the key?

[09:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Tree iterator for what?

[09:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The one that I just wrote.  Iterates through a hierarchical collection of mysql rows, turning it into a RecursiveIterator suitable for passing to RecursiveIteratorIterator.

[09:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Set a global variable

[09:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
RecursiveIteratorIterator doesn't sound like a class that should exist outside parody

[09:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Heh, I know.  It's kinda rediculous.

[09:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Although I've taken a MMI course where the prof had classes like SliderSliderSliderInputExample

[09:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But it transforms a RecursiveIterator into a linear iterator, so you don't have to deal with maintaining a stack as you descend through children yourself.

[09:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
Does it use a RecursiveIteratorIteratorFactory?

[09:05:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Luckily, no.

[09:05:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me is just staring wide-mouted at the IRC channel

[09:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
*mouthed

[09:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
RecursiveIteratorIterator? Seriously?

[09:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I attached a static function to the class that takes the same arguments as the constructor, which just returns a RecursiveIteratorIterator so I don't have to type that myself.)

[09:06:03.0000] <Dashiva>
So that class implements RecursiveIteratorIteratorFactory via duck typing

[09:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: http://php.net/manual/en/class.recursiveiteratoriterator.php

[09:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
I refuse to be dirtied by reading the PHP manual

[09:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Welcome to PHP.

[09:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hahaha.

[09:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Oh, come on. That's quite good by PHP standards.

[09:08:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nod.  It

[09:08:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's at least consistently named.

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's like they decided to copy the irritating parts of Java

[09:10:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
PHP: If you don't think it's built in, you haven't spent enough time reading the docs.

[09:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Practically nothing is reliably built into PHP, that's one of the most obnoxious things about it.

[09:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The difficulty is just in parsing it.  It's (RecursiveIterator)Iterator; that is, an iterator over a recursive iterator.

[09:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
$fileSPLObjects = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(new RecursiveDirectoryIterator($directory), RecursiveIteratorIterator::CHILD_FIRST);

[09:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Transforming a tree-like structure back into a list-like structure, so you can just hand it to the foreach() loop.

[09:11:03.0000] <Dashiva>
It's like I'm really using Java!

[09:11:04.0000] <Philip`>
I was just about to paste exactly that line :-(

[09:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Finally, I beat Philip` at something.

[09:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: congrats!

[09:13:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
What would you guys recommend as Windows sotware to convert mp4's to ogv's?

[09:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
use File::Find; find(sub { print "Found $_\n"; }, $directory);

[09:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Can you fix LWP so it uses the right content-type?

[09:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
What is "right"?

[09:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
Also, what is wrong?

[09:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do you want it to not look at <meta> or something?

[09:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
(That's the biggest annoyance I've encountered)

[09:15:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, partially

[09:15:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I want it to not look at meta if there is a HTTP header

[09:15:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Like HTML5 (and HTML4) says

[09:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And additionally, it looks like the most recent LWPs use the first HTTP header instead of the last

[09:16:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I was hoping to convert videos over to ogv for Firefox <video> support.

[09:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Google is unhelpful, JonathanNeal.  Shrug.

[09:18:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I know, that's why I came here.

[09:18:02.0000] <daedb>
Firefogg?

[09:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, you could use Firefogg.

[09:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Results when encoding H.264 -> Theora are not going to be great, though; conversions between different types of lossy formats never are.

[09:19:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I remember seeing some awesometastic transcoding anything-to-anything app, but I forgot the name

[09:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can also use ffmpeg2theora, according to this: http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html

[09:20:01.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders what will happen when there's a ffmpeg2. Will there be a ffmpeg22theora?

[09:21:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
haha

[09:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
This is why programming languages should stop reserving so much syntax.  ffmpeg->theora is much better.

[09:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or the actual unicode arrow.

[09:21:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Do you guys think mp4 support is in the future of Firefox?

[09:21:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me keeps forgetting to mod his keyboard to output the unicode arrows.

[09:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, you want to actually type a Unicode arrow when you want to invoke the program?

[09:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
YES.

[09:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, ffmpeg->theora = output of command "ffmpeg-" redirected to file "theora".

[09:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ys, because silly languages reserve so many symbols for their syntax.

[09:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Can you put theora inside a mp4 container?

[09:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
ffmpeg→theora should be a perfectly good command name, though.

[09:23:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lisp keeps it to a minimum.  ()#'`, is all.

[09:23:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
bash reserves everything and its brother.

[09:23:05.0000] <Sidnicious>
APL tried this: http://www.wickensonline.co.uk/apl/unicomp-apl-top-large.jpg

[09:23:06.0000] <Dashiva>
#bash-2.0# brother: reserved name

[09:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
When you're limited to ascii, at least use camelCasing.

[09:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
ffmpegToTheora

[09:24:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, yes if we had those arrows on our keyboards.

[09:24:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean, english letters and numbers.

[09:24:04.0000] <Dashiva>
TabAtkins: That insults the design sense of people who prefer lowercasenames

[09:24:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Those people can die in a fire.

[09:24:06.0000] <Dashiva>
They can, but I don't think they will

[09:24:07.0000] <JonathanNeal>
A dash never killed anyone either.

[09:24:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
JonathanNeal, Ctrl+Shift+u2192, not too hard to remember.

[09:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Dash is overloaded as minus, bad story there

[09:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: Yeah it does.  Stupid inline minus operator.

[09:25:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, camel-casing is contrary to Unix conventions dating to before both of us were born.

[09:25:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me uses dashes in all his Lisp stuff, as is appropriate Lisp style.

[09:25:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Unix "conventions"

[09:25:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, oh.

[09:25:06.0000] <JonathanNeal>
An underscore never hurt anyone.

[09:25:07.0000] <Dashiva>
That's sort of like microsoft "open standards"

[09:25:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Pretty sure "foo2bar" has been well established for an awfully long time.

[09:25:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Those conventions are silly.

[09:25:10.0000] <TabAtkins>
As demonstrated by ffmpeg22theora

[09:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: You know, sounding grumpy won't convert more people to lisp ;)

[09:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not trying to convert anyone.  ^_^

[09:26:02.0000] <Dashiva>
So atoi should be a2i

[09:26:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would just still be called ffmpeg2theora.

[09:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would you change the name of the command for a new version?

[09:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe ffmpeg and ffmpeg2 aren't compatible

[09:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
What, and use flags to tell it that you're passing an old version?

[09:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What?

[09:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why wouldn't the command-line syntax remain compatible across versions?

[09:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or at least compatible enough to give it the same name?

[09:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
There are lots of much sillier unix things than the naming conventions

[09:28:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
So then flags to tell it you're passing a new version?

[09:28:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
What does "passing a new version" mean?

[09:28:05.0000] <jgraham>
Like the total lack of a standardised way of telling what flag a program accests

[09:28:06.0000] <jgraham>
*accepts

[09:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I hear make is going to start supporting general whitespace before 2072

[09:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
ffmpeg versus ffmpeg2 (assuming they're incompatible for some reason)

[09:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
ffmpeg is a piece of software.  You don't "pass" it, you're calling it.

[09:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, you mean --help isn't good enough?  That's not *quite* universal, I'll grant, but it works pretty reliably.

[09:29:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Gah, pedantry.  You know what I mean.

[09:29:05.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Except when it's only -h

[09:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, no I don't.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Why would you even have the old version installed alongside the new version?  If you do, you can use the full path, weirdo.

[09:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: That's not enough for e.g. command line completionto work without insane hacks

[09:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, yes, but then usually it says "unrecognized option -" and prints a usage summary anyway.

[09:30:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, programs can provide custom command-line completion if they want, there's a standard way to do that.

[09:30:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Unless it's a helpful program that ignores unrecognized flags

[09:30:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
apt-get inst<Tab> -> apt-get install

[09:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, yes, there are a few of those, and they should die in fire.

[09:31:01.0000] <Dashiva>
-v is also a popular flag to overload

[09:31:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Everyone on Linux should follow the GNU command-line argument conventions, period.

[09:31:03.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: [citation needed]

[09:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: So linux should be incompatible with other *nixes?

[09:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, typing "apt-get inst<Tab>" on stock Ubuntu isn't good enough evidence for you?

[09:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
I was under the impression that those completions were hardcoded in shell-specific scripts

[09:32:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, no, they should use the same conventions too.

[09:32:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, shell-specific, maybe.  I don't know.

[09:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Not that the shell could parse out the command line options from the binary somehow

[09:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, obviously not, but there's a format that you can use to achieve the same effect.

[09:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Often you want more complicated autocompletion anyway.

[09:33:03.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: This is roughly my definition of "insane hacks"

[09:33:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
E.g., only autocomplete to files that exist *and* make sense for the command.

[09:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Your way isn't flexible enough, you need to support scripted autocomplete to get full functionality anyway.

[09:34:01.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: Surely metadata never becomes out of sync with the binaries

[09:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, pretty rarely, when you use package managers.

[09:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Because the people in charge of packages never make mistakes

[09:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, but you're inventing unreasonable hypotheticals at this point instead of pointing out real-world problems.

[09:35:02.0000] <jgraham>
less /etc/bash_completion looks kinda crazy

[09:35:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess the completion rules are bash-specific.

[09:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If so, that's kind of lame.

[09:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait a minute, these autocomplete rules are all stored in one big file?

[09:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, there's also bash_completion.d/.

[09:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's a perfectly good Unix-style convention: implement potentially complicated functionality using a shell script you include with your program.

[09:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't see a better proposal from you that's as flexible.

[09:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Embed the same information in the binary in a format that can be parsed out

[09:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why?

[09:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You'd have to use a scripting language anyway.

[09:38:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Looks like a lot of hardcoding inside bash_completion...

[09:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, some core programs seem to be there, /etc/bash_completion.d/ lets other programs add their own stuff, in typical Unix (or at least Linux) fashion.

[09:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>
freeamp is a core program?

[09:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.  Suppose not.

[09:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Heh, acroread is there. I guess they're anticipating installs :)

[09:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess it's easier to stick it there than have a whole new file.

[09:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay, it was trivial to hack a depth tracker into the SQLTree class, and just return it as the key of each value.

[09:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: ffmpeg has only done about one release in its entire history, and that was version 0.5, so I think we've got plenty of time before worrying about version 2

[10:01:00.0000] <hober>
It's nice to read something about how people *like* Hixie's spec-writing style for a change: http://bitworking.org/news/2010/02/joel-in-a-box

[10:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
RFC 5023 is APP, right?

[10:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Google says yes

[10:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs at the sheer number of RFCs he knows the numbers for

[10:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: http://github.com/gsnedders/complexpie/blob/master/src/cachearray.php — fun with PHP!

[10:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(complete with my own very naïve GC impl within PHP!)

[10:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay!

[10:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(basically for static variable caches within functions to avoid computing stuff all the time, and with GC to stop it from growing to really large amounts of memory)

[10:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(the GC is really too naive though, I expect, but it gets pretty good cache hit rates)

[10:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(compared with having no GC whatsoever)

[10:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(there again, for it to be worthwhile to still have the cache, the GC needs to be really cheap)

[10:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, so a helper for manually implementing memoization.  Cool.

[10:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
How does that actually cache anything?

[10:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
It looks like it's deferring to the parent all the time, and never returning anything from a cache

[10:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's an ArrayObject, which has an internal array backing.

[10:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And uses parent::offsetGet and parent::offsetSet to actually do the storing/retrieving.

[10:14:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Yeah, basically

[10:14:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
It just wraps gc around it.

[10:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, so this code isn't actually caching anything, it's more of a SelfCleaningArray?

[10:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Indeed, and offsetExists is deliberately not overridden to keep it quicker

[10:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: yeah

[10:15:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's meant for *other* things to use it for caching.

[10:15:04.0000] <gsnedders>
http://github.com/gsnedders/complexpie/blob/master/src/iri.php#L788

[10:15:05.0000] <gsnedders>
for example

[10:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
function foo(){ static $cache = new CacheArray; }

[10:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(it turns out doing IRI processing is amazingly expensive)

[10:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: That's invalid syntax, you can't set a new object like that

[10:16:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure you can.

[10:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
As long as your constructor can be called with no args.

[10:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Frex, I use foreach(new UserList as $user){} all over my code.

[10:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_NEW

[10:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: That's totally different

[10:18:03.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: It's the fact it's on the RHS of a static dfn

[10:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like a weird cache eviction policy

[10:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you access "x" 100 times, then "y" once, then "x" 99 times, it will throw away "x" and keep "y"?

[10:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: http://pastebin.ca/1791616

[10:19:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I said naïve for a reason

[10:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Naive is different to stupid ;-)

[10:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
patches welcome :)

[10:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(provided they don't make the getter in the general case more expensive)

[10:20:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, is that something special just for static vars?

[10:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: static and global, IIRC

[10:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: It's a property of the keywords

[10:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
How weird.

[10:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Same applies for public $foo = 'bar'; in a class dfn

[10:21:04.0000] <Philip`>
LRU would probably the most common arguably-naive algorithm, I guess

[10:21:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, well, I use static vars very rarely.

[10:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: The aim was more some fairly basic LFU

[10:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
With a really bad LFU-aging impl

[10:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You could perhaps drop $oldaccess, and just determine what to drop based on $access.

[10:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Perhaps just array_slice($access,0,80) to allow young accesses to stick around.

[10:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I could just move over to LRU, but I don't think that's very good for what I need

[10:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
e.g., given parsing a URL like '/', it may in general come up a lot, but in one file I get a thousand unqiue other items. I don't want to push that out of the cache

[10:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
There's a very long tail for this from the data set I was testing with, so caching that tail doesn't gain much

[10:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What is important is you get the high priority things

[10:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Which is why I really want some sort of LFU impl

[10:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
If it comes up a lot, it will always be recently used, and you'd only push it out of the cache for the duration of that one file where it's not used

[10:27:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, then just cut things based on array_count_values(

[10:27:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
$access)

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Things that are used frequently are used recently

[10:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It's a question of whether I want to push it out for that one file, whether I gain anything by losing that cache

[10:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
Also, RAM is cheap so make the cache much bigger :-)

[10:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: PHP often runs with small memory limits

[10:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose PHP isn't clever enough to have weak references

[10:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It isn't, sadly.

[10:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Does it throw an exception when you run out of memory, or just crash?

[10:29:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Exception, usually.

[10:29:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sometimes just a crash.

[10:29:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Throws E_ERROR, a non-catchable error.

[10:29:06.0000] <Philip`>
That's not so helpful

[10:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Indeed. The only option for keeping caches within a sane size is something like this.

[10:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me does still use an unbound (direct associative array) cache in one place, but where it grows to a certain size and stops growing due to the nature of the cache

[10:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(and where any indirection to another PHP function call is too expensive to be worthwhile even having the cache)

[10:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
You know you have been using computers in general, and irc in particular, too long when you can't remember what normal people say when they mean "ping"

[11:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Normal people say "ping"?  Other than as part of "ping-pong"?

[11:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
No, they don't, that's the point

[11:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh.

[11:00:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
So, uh, how can they mean anything when they say it, if they don't say it?

[11:00:04.0000] <othermaciej>
"hello"

[11:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: It's the noise you get when the touch a glass in a certain way!

[11:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: "say when they mean", not "mean when they say"

[11:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
They don't say it. But they say things with similar meanings

[11:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, I see.

[11:01:04.0000] <wycats>
question: why does CORS not support unfettered HTTP requests in non-credentialed mode?

[11:01:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I misread.

[11:01:06.0000] <othermaciej>
i.e. instead of saying "ping" to get someone's attention, face-to-face or over the phone the standard protocol is to say "hi" or "hello"

[11:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I suppose they say "Excuse me" or "Are you there" or such?

[11:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
people who are not geeks probably say "are you there" or "ayt" over IM-type communication channels

[11:02:02.0000] <jgraham>
In context the word I needed was really "remind"

[11:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but that doesn't make sense in general)

[11:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, like as a transitive verb.

[11:03:02.0000] <othermaciej>
oh, as in "can you ping her about that"

[11:03:03.0000] <jgraham>
Yes

[11:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh great. HTML5 parsing seems to make tests from the W3C DOM Level 1 test suite fail

[11:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oops

[11:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the test had been modified from the W3C original based on an old snapshot of HTML5

[11:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
now I need to change it back

[12:00:00.0000] <wycats>
so why does uncredentialled CORS still require approval to make the request?

[12:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
To stop pages from arbitrarily reconfiguring the user's router on http://192.168.0.1, perhaps?

[12:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: for "simple requests" it doesn't require approval to make the request, just to read the results

[12:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me may be misunderstanding the question

[12:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for non-simple requests, there is at least the risk of exposing servers behind firewalls to CSRF (beyond what is possible with cross-site form submission)

[12:06:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: why is approval required to read the requests?

[12:06:01.0000] <wycats>
without credentials == no CSRF, no?

[12:06:02.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: I'm curious why there's no "safe" API to make an HTTP request that doesn't expose any security issues

[12:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: you can't use CSRF to read a resource served from another server, whether with or without credentials

[12:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: in intranets, there are servers where the only "credential" required to access them is being behind the firewall, which is a credential XHR can't remove

[12:08:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: isn't this something UAs can handle?

[12:08:01.0000] <wycats>
and behind the firewall people can lock down the credential?

[12:09:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: in practice, this means that I can't use certain public APIs until people get around to supporting CORS :/

[12:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: what I'm saying is, there's servers behind firewalls containing confidential information that require no explicit credential to access

[12:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
their only protection is being behind a firewall

[12:09:03.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: right... and people can already get that info by installing a native app

[12:09:04.0000] <wycats>
the way around that is permissions

[12:10:00.0000] <wycats>
so UAs can allow the "corporate security" to disallow access

[12:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: browsing to a web page in your browser should not be equivalent to installing a native app

[12:10:02.0000] <wycats>
of course not

[12:10:03.0000] <wycats>
but making an HTTP GET request is a reasonable thing to be able to do

[12:10:04.0000] <wycats>
in the vast majority of cases

[12:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and indeed the spec lets you make such a request, just not read the result unless the server opts in

[12:12:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: in general, getting the results of an HTTP request is not considered a secure transaction

[12:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
browsers enforce the same-origin security model and therefore have created the expectation that it is, in the browser context

[12:15:00.0000] <wycats>

TabAtkins: congrats

[12:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thanks, zcorpan.

[12:54:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Hello

[13:13:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: back

[13:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
why can't css transitions transition to height:auto

[13:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
how are submenus or <details> supposed to have a nice animation with height:auto?

[13:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
CSS transitions should totally transition to (and from) height: auto

[13:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it does not work right now because it would have to do an extra layout at the end state to figure out how to animate

[13:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or something

[13:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm wondering if I can figure out another way to implement <details> nicely w/ mostly just CSS

[13:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
webkit animates to height:0 and then snaps over to auto

[13:45:01.0000] <zcorpan>
opera doesn't animate at all

[13:45:02.0000] <wycats>
zcorpan: sounds like an impl bug

[13:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the spec actually doesn't define animating to/from auto

[13:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so it is also a spec bug

[13:46:01.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: is the issue you referred to earlier about behind the firewall the same issue with JSONRequest?

[13:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(or really conscious spec design limitation)

[13:46:03.0000] <wycats>
one option of course would be to try to calculate it yourself

[13:46:04.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: there is some of that issue with JSONRequest, though JS content can to some extent be read cross-site already since there is no same-origin limit on embedding scripts via <script>

[13:46:05.0000] <wycats>
might work in many cases

[13:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yes, you could get the actual height, and animate from that to 0

[13:47:01.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: right but you can't actually SEE the data with the exception of the __defineSetter__ hole

[13:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
going the other way might be trickier (may need an extra layout)

[13:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: there have been other holes (mostly closed now I think)

[13:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I do think JSONRequest is not a great security design

[13:49:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: agree 100%

[13:49:01.0000] <wycats>
I'm just frustrated by having to get people to agree to open up CORS

[13:49:02.0000] <wycats>
thinking about adding an easy way to do it to Rails

[13:49:03.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: are you having trouble persuading people?

[13:49:04.0000] <wycats>
class MyController; cors_friendly; end

[13:49:05.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be nice for frameworks to give an easy way to do it

[13:49:06.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: there are two issues: (1) the security implications are not obvious, so people want to research; (2) it's never a high priority

[13:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you may want to give the option of allowing access to anyone or to a whitelist, and whether to allow credentials or not

[13:50:01.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: I work with the 37 signals guys and they say "cool" to adding CORS to their Campfire API but it's not on their list

[13:50:02.0000] <zcorpan>
working around the height:auto limitation with script gets really ugly

[13:50:03.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: yeah

[13:50:04.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: Rails tends to go with 90% case first and then refine to other cases

[13:50:05.0000] <wycats>
instead of trying to preplan everything... but some additional config wouldn't be bad

[13:50:06.0000] <othermaciej>
so you're thinking the 90% case is fully public data source that takes no credentials and is open to everyone?

[13:52:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: the 90% case I think takes credentials via an API token

[13:52:01.0000] <wycats>
or basic auth

[13:52:02.0000] <wycats>
more likely an API token

[13:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
depends on what kind of credentials you have in mind

[13:52:04.0000] <othermaciej>
if it's a resource that is somehow per-user, people may want to use cookies

[13:53:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: that's not a common case

[13:53:01.0000] <wycats>
the common case is you have an API that is available from Ruby or Java or something

[13:53:02.0000] <wycats>
via HTTP

[13:53:03.0000] <wycats>
and you want to open it up for web access

[13:53:04.0000] <othermaciej>
if for example GMail wanted to offer a contacts service as a data API

[13:53:05.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: I'd consider that the 10% case

[13:53:06.0000] <wycats>
Gmail has smart engineers

[13:53:07.0000] <othermaciej>
or flickr wanted a photostream data API

[13:53:08.0000] <wycats>
and we can converge on that case if it gets common

[13:54:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: why wouldn't an API token work for that case?

[13:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: how does an API token tell you which flickr user is logged into the browser?

[13:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
is the token per-user or is it an "app key"?

[13:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if it's per-app, then if you ship it down to the client anyone can rip it from your client-side code

[13:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if it's per user, then you need a server-to-server communication to do setup per-user

[13:55:02.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: nah it'd be stored in local storage

[13:55:03.0000] <wycats>
the user would type in their un/pw, and a call would be made to get the token

[13:55:04.0000] <othermaciej>
a call to who?

[13:55:05.0000] <wycats>
a fully open CORS service

[13:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you sure don't want the user typing their site A password into site B

[13:56:01.0000] <wycats>
ha

[13:56:02.0000] <wycats>
see: the internet :P

[13:56:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the whole point of CORS is to avoid brokenness like that

[13:56:04.0000] <wycats>
but yeah

[13:56:05.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: seems basic auth would work

[13:57:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: I was being snarky -- I of course realize that's bad

[13:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
basic auth over CORS requires the same level of opt-in as cookies, so you may as well use cookies since that is probably what the service already uses for normal login

[13:57:02.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: hmmm

[13:58:00.0000] <wycats>
so why wouldn't the default just be "allow cookies"?

[13:58:01.0000] <wycats>
in the non-preflight case we don't even need to do anything

[13:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well it's pretty easy for a server to opt into cookies

[13:58:03.0000] <wycats>
in the preflight case it seems "yes" is the right default

[13:58:04.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: yeah I've read the spec

[13:58:05.0000] <othermaciej>
all it has to do is add Access-Control-Allow-Cookies: true

[13:58:06.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: I know

[13:59:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: it seems the make_cors_friendly should do that by default

[13:59:01.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: I understand how the spec works, I'm thinking through the 90% case here

[13:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
seems fine for a framework to make it the default if that is well-documented and well-understood

[13:59:03.0000] <wycats>
(you are being very helpful, thank you)

[13:59:04.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: make_cors_friendly :cookies => false

[13:59:05.0000] <wycats>
would be the opt-out

[14:00:00.0000] <wycats>
obviously that would not be the method name

[14:00:01.0000] <wycats>
:p

[14:00:02.0000] <wycats>
probably something more like allow_cross_origin_requests

[14:00:03.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: and could be implemented as Rack middleware, although you'd probably want finer control than that offered

[14:05:00.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: what is the one-sentence answer to "I need to explore the security considerations"

[14:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: I don't know if there is one - depends on the context

[14:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wycats: if it's a fully public data service that's not per-user and would work without cookies, you could say "other sites can already do this by routing requests bak through their own servers"

[14:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
*back

[14:09:00.0000] <wycats>
lemme look at how conceptually campfire works

[14:09:01.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: why is it considered verboten to type un/pw into "some random web app" but not in "some random native iphone app"?

[14:09:02.0000] <wycats>
expectation discrepancy?

[14:13:00.0000] <wycats>
"When you're using the API, it's always through an existing user in Campfire. There's no special API user. So when you use the API as "david", you get to see and work with what "david" is allowed to. Authenticating is done with an authentication token, which you'll find on the "Edit my Campfire account" screen in Campfire (click the "Reveal authentication token for API" link).

[14:13:01.0000] <wycats>
When using the authentication token, you don't need a separate password. But since Campfire uses HTTP Basic Authentication, and lots of implementations assume that you want to have a password, it's often easier just to pass in a dummy password, like X."

[14:13:02.0000] <wycats>
I think this is pretty representative

[14:32:00.0000] <til>
i'm serializing some objects to XML, and trying to decide how to serialize the booleans

[14:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan: Are you going to ping www-style about the "animating to auto" thing?

[14:32:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
til: true/false?

[14:32:03.0000] <til>
i know that you guys consider a boolean to be true if the key is included and false if its omitted 

[14:32:04.0000] <til>
is this a feature of xml, or a quirk of html?

[14:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, that.  That's how HTML works.  A general XML language can define booleans however they want.

[14:33:01.0000] <til>
TabAtkins: i'm wondering whether to represent @mirror as <… mirror = 'true' />

[14:33:02.0000] <til>
TabAtkins: i thought so

[14:33:03.0000] <til>
thanks

[14:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
TabAtkins: not tonight

[14:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eventually, or you want me to do it?

[14:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
you can do it if you want

[14:58:00.0000] <jwm>
anyone know of some cool examples of a unified object namespace heh

[15:04:00.0000] <jwm>
not unified heh

[15:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me now has a non-animated js-impl of <details>

[15:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder if i should store the open state across reloads and navigation

[15:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Do you expect that browsers will do so?

[15:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks at the fullscreen feedback and tries to find if any browsers have actually implemented something he can test

[15:23:01.0000] <zcorpan>
dunno

[15:23:02.0000] <zcorpan>
browsers store state of form input

[15:23:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not across navigations, at least.

[15:23:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
reloads, yes.

[15:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
my browser stores form input when going back and forward

[15:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, true for that.  I thought you were referring to, say, a <details> appearing in the same place on a page, and it staying open when you navigated.

[15:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Easy to save, anyway.  Just pop a hidden checkbox into there, and check/uncheck it as appropriate.

[15:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Are you display:none'ing the contents of the <details>?

[15:28:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm a checkbox might be a reasonable way to implement details for legacy browsers anyway

[15:28:02.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[15:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
For accessibility reasons, you may want to position:absolute;left:-9001px; it.

[15:29:01.0000] <zcorpan>
right now i set tabIndex = 0 on summary and listen to click events on document

[15:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
dunno if all browsers fire click for unknown elements when activated with keyboard yet

[15:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
as it happens i managed to use <details> with tinymce by using the <blockquote> feature and replacing it with <details> afterwards

[15:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  Well, ff doesn't seem to be dispatching keyboard-based clicks on summary, based on a quick test I threw together.

[15:35:01.0000] <zcorpan>
oh well

[15:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
what's the boilerplate for listening to 'enter'?

[15:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Look for keycode 13, I believe.

[15:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All right, according to ppk, function(e) { var evt = e||window.event; evt.keyCode==13; }

[15:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sub in the rest of your code as appropriate.

[15:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Use keydown, though, as apparently IE won't fire keypress.

[15:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i was going to use the same function as my onclick handler, but that checks e.which and it seems some browsers use e.which for keyup also

[15:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe i can check for keyCode first

[15:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just check e.keyCode || e.charCode || e.which

hey Hixie 

[23:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
hi

[23:30:01.0000] <wycats>
just providing some much-needed traffic :)

[23:31:00.0000] <meledin>
You're using up my electrons!

[23:31:01.0000] <wycats>
oh noes

[23:31:02.0000] <wycats>
you guys are doing a helluva job

[23:31:03.0000] <wycats>
not sure how much you hear that but I think whatwg saved the web :P

[23:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
thanks :-)

[23:32:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: earlier I was chatting with othermaciej about CORS and getting support for it in Rails

[23:32:01.0000] <wycats>
(specifically, what the right defaults would be)

[23:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
neat

[23:32:03.0000] <wycats>
we've been throwing in as much support as we can for 3.0 :)

[23:33:00.0000] <wycats>
oh... and we're using the hell out of data- attributes

[23:33:01.0000] <wycats>
:-D

[23:34:00.0000] <wycats>
when we switched to HTML5 doctype people freaked out :P

[23:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh, cool, glad the data- attributes are helping

[23:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
are you finding you need other things we haven't added yet?

[23:34:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: yeah... we couldn't have done "valid" UJS stuff without it

[23:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
like other extensions mechanisms or the like?

[23:35:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: we haven't had a lot of need for any of the "extension" mechanisms, but maybe we're not doing fancy enough things

[23:35:01.0000] <wycats>
we're just catching up with stuff like audio/video

[23:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[23:35:03.0000] <wycats>
well... we caught up with that ages ago

[23:35:04.0000] <wycats>
but you get the idea

[23:35:05.0000] <wycats>
https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2843-patch-add-video_tag-to-actionview

[23:36:00.0000] <wycats>
I like how the ticket has info about the codec thing in it ;)

http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/51d7b3070c68492f5376c19d24d8e5a2d746d7ea <- if you look at the comments on bottom you can see some of the tension about how to deal with fallback content

[23:38:00.0000] <meledin>
Monkey has a stupid question. I'm doing ridiculous stuff such as for(i=0; i<65535; i++) string+=String.fromCharCode(i)

[23:39:00.0000] <meledin>
AFAIK this should be a proper (albeit stupid) string. Should I be able to send it via a websocket and get the same string back?

[23:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
no

[23:39:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: if you had to pick, what do you think the top priorities for HTML support in frameworks would be? 

[23:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
meledin: because it's not a valid thing to do :-)

[23:40:01.0000] <wycats>
(obviously we figure most of it out via user feedback, but just curious)

[23:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
meledin: there are a number of non-characters in the range 0..65535 that you can't express in UTF-8

[23:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
meledin: specifically, all the surrogate halves

[23:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
meledin: (JS doesn't deal in Unicode characters, it deals in UTF-16 words)

[23:41:01.0000] <meledin>
I see. Thanks. I guess I'll need to look into what the valid characters are

[23:41:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I guess I can address my only real HTML5 spec criticism to you? I've spoken with Jonas and some others but probably should just tell ya :P

[23:41:03.0000] <meledin>
(Trying to send stupid strings back and forth to see if I can break it)

[23:42:00.0000] <wycats>
it's extremely hard for practitioners to participate, because the spec is mostly written for implementors

[23:42:01.0000] <wycats>
so often we catch issues way too late in the process

[23:42:02.0000] <wycats>
one quick win would be to explain the motivation behind features more fully (because then the practitioners who motivated the feature would more easily notice that the issue is addressed)

[23:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
meledin: specifically, the 0xD800-0xDFFF range will cause an exception to be thrown

[23:43:01.0000] <meledin>
Oh, that's fine then

[23:43:02.0000] <meledin>
I'm failing in the range 0-1000 even

[23:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: does the author view of the spec help?

[23:44:01.0000] <wycats>
link

[23:44:02.0000] <wycats>
?

[23:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/?style=author

[23:45:00.0000] <wycats>
what is the difference?

[23:45:01.0000] <wycats>
am I being dense?

[23:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
it hides the implementation details

[23:45:03.0000] <wycats>
ah

[23:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
if you look at the top right there's a set of radio buttons -- if you pick the third one, it highlights the bits that are removed in the version above

[23:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
(which is the second radio button, iirc)

[23:46:01.0000] <wycats>
so an example of a problem I was having: I was trying to figure out how the change event operates for different kinds of elements

[23:46:02.0000] <wycats>
I'm pretty sure it's in there SOMEWHERE

[23:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[23:46:04.0000] <wycats>
I just wanted a clear description of how it's meant to operate

[23:46:05.0000] <wycats>
for different elements

[23:47:00.0000] <wycats>
I often go looking at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-index.html#events-0

[23:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm i don't think we have any text intended for authors describing how specific events work

[23:47:02.0000] <wycats>
right... it's all there in impl'speak

[23:47:03.0000] <wycats>
but it's hard to figure out what's going on

[23:48:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I wouldn't complain, except that it's useful for authors to participate at this stage

[23:48:01.0000] <wycats>
unless you disagree?

[23:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
authors are the most important people to get feedback from

[23:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how to add text about events

[23:48:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: and right now it's virtually impossible to understand large chunks

[23:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
i guess we could do it in the same way we do the API explanations

[23:48:06.0000] <Hixie>
the green boxes

[23:49:00.0000] <wycats>
drag and drop is really cryptic to me, and speaking with other authors I've heard that there are serious issues

[23:49:01.0000] <wycats>
I can't tell though

[23:49:02.0000] <wycats>
:/

[23:49:03.0000] <wycats>
(btw, I work on jQuery as well as Rails)

[23:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
drag and drop is totally ridiculous, but that's because the model is crazy, not cos the spec is poor, i think

[23:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
though i did write an intro section for drag and drop which is somewhat ok

[23:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
are the event summary tables for media elements and appcache ok?

[23:50:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: lemme look at appcache

[23:50:02.0000] <wycats>
I've been working with that API

[23:50:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I found the canvas spec to be really readable btw

[23:51:00.0000] <wycats>
I was stuck on an airplane with just the canvas spec and Webkit and was able to get my job done

[23:51:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I'm really happy to hear you say that about authors but I haven't gotten that impression

[23:51:02.0000] <wycats>
I'm happy to lead a charge to getting more feedback from my peers even

[23:51:03.0000] <wycats>
but there's a fair bit of defeatism :/

[23:52:00.0000] <wycats>
I think app cache could use a better description of the intended use cases for each section

[23:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i try to trawl the blogs for feedback

[23:52:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I can post :P

[23:53:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: my biggest annoyance with the cache manifest is the required mime type, which isn't a pain for me personally (as I write frameworks) but it adds a step to setup for people who just want to serve static iphone apps

[23:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
(but it's hard to make a spec that's both useful for implementors and authors)

[23:53:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: 100%

[23:53:03.0000] <wycats>
that was essentially what Jonas said

[23:53:04.0000] <wycats>
"we had to pick, and implementors won"

[23:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
re appcache i specifically meant the section with the table explaining the events

[23:53:06.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: yah

[23:53:07.0000] <wycats>
I'm going through the section

[23:54:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: what section #?

[23:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
well it's not so much that implementors won, so much as if we write a tutorial and not a spec, you guys lose out because the implementations will be buggy as hell

[23:54:02.0000] <wycats>
6.6.1.1?

[23:54:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: yep

[23:54:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: what's missing most of all is use-case motivation

[23:54:05.0000] <hsivonen>
fwiw, the app cache is semi-broken in Gecko when html5.enable=true, so one needs to set html5.enable to false to do app cache stuff

[23:54:06.0000] <wycats>
so I can see if a section actually addresses a concern I actually have

[23:54:07.0000] <wycats>
the event summary looks good

[23:54:08.0000] <Hixie>
um, section numbers differ in all the different versions so dunno the number. The section is titled "Event summary".

[23:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
6.6.1.1 in the complete.html version of the spec

[23:55:01.0000] <wycats>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html#appcacheevents

[23:55:02.0000] <wycats>
?

[23:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[23:55:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: what's unclear to me from that table is what order the events will be in

[23:55:05.0000] <wycats>
for instance, if I go to a page which has some changes

[23:55:06.0000] <wycats>
what events are fired?

[23:55:07.0000] <wycats>
and in what order?

[23:56:00.0000] <wycats>
the latter more than the former

[23:56:01.0000] <wycats>
I guess I can figure it out

[23:56:02.0000] <wycats>
now that I'm looking at it

[23:56:03.0000] <wycats>
like an LSAT logic game ;)

[23:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
the "Next events" column is trying to help with that

[23:56:05.0000] <wycats>
yep

[23:56:06.0000] <wycats>
"6 people are sitting across a table from each other"

[23:56:07.0000] <wycats>
"john cannot sit to the right of lisa"

[23:56:08.0000] <wycats>
;)

[23:56:09.0000] <Hixie>
i'd make a flowchart but the problem is every time i make a diagram, i end up having to change the spec the next day and then the diagram is all wrong and so i have to remake the diagram which takes hours

[23:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
"checking" is first

[23:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
I guess I should say that

[23:58:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: maybe there's a way to automate?

[23:58:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I'd say use cases are of large import

[23:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
that'd be awesome

[23:58:03.0000] <wycats>
for instance, what is MOTIVATING the ping attribute

[23:59:00.0000] <wycats>
I read it cover to cover and can't figure it out ;)

[23:59:01.0000] <wycats>
it seems like a Google hax

[23:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
search for "the ping attribute provides these advantages"

[23:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
(under "Hyperlink auditing")

[00:00:00.0000] <wycats>
right

[00:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
one of the reasons we don't have use cases is that sometimes people agree on what the spec should require, but disagree on why

[00:00:02.0000] <wycats>
that's just hypothetical

[00:00:03.0000] <wycats>
perhaps UAs may do useful things

[00:00:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: sure

[00:00:05.0000] <wycats>
that seems bad

[00:00:06.0000] <wycats>
the why seems important

[00:00:07.0000] <wycats>
for instance, if I agitate for a feature and it gets in

[00:00:08.0000] <Hixie>
at the end of the day, for hte spec, the what is what matters :-)

[00:00:09.0000] <wycats>
I should be able to detect that ;)

[00:00:10.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: sure

[00:00:11.0000] <wycats>
but it's hard for authors to figure out what's going on from just the what

[00:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd really like someone to maintain a parallel document with the motivations for many of the reasons for the decisions, though

[00:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's unfortunately never been anyone who had the time to work on that :-(

[00:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
(doing it myself would like halve my editing speed)

[00:01:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: totally

[00:01:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: it's tricky

[00:01:05.0000] <wycats>
I almost started doing it a while ago, but it seems hard

[00:01:06.0000] <wycats>
:P

[00:02:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I work with Sam on Rails btw

[00:02:01.0000] <wycats>
have had some of these conversations with him

[00:03:00.0000] <wycats>
the response I got in general was that authors just weren't important yet and someone would write a book

[00:03:01.0000] <wycats>
and then I could read it

[00:03:02.0000] <wycats>
:P

[00:04:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I'd humbly submit re: d&d that if the problem isn't the spec so much as the model that something has gone horribly wrong

[00:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
authors are critical, it's very sad that we haven't been able to get the author-facing materials off the ground as fast as the implementor-facing stuff

[00:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy's been working on some stuff, as have others

[00:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
but we really need more man-power

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
the d&d stuff is literally just describing what IE does

[00:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
no argument that something is horribly wrong with what IE does :-)

[00:06:02.0000] <wycats>
haha

[00:06:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I offer up my services

[00:07:00.0000] <wycats>
not sure if you saw the back and forth with me about WebIDL btw?

[00:07:01.0000] <wycats>
that conversation went horribly wron

[00:07:02.0000] <wycats>
wrong

[00:07:03.0000] <wycats>
(speaking of horribly wrong)

[00:07:04.0000] <wycats>
I was trying to make the point I'm making here but got baited into bashing WebIDL

[00:07:05.0000] <Hixie>
not sure

[00:08:00.0000] <wycats>
I was that petulant dude who was trying to overturn the order

[00:08:01.0000] <wycats>
I got smacked down pretty hard

[00:08:02.0000] <wycats>
pretty much left with my tail between my legs

[00:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
there's been a lot of webidl talk recently and i try to ignore who's saying what generally speaking so as not to be biased against facts based on who's bringing them forward

[00:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
so i probably saw it but didn't know it was you :-)

[00:08:05.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I made two points, both author-centric

[00:09:00.0000] <wycats>
1) the fact that WebIDL represents things that can't be represented in ES proper is very confusing

[00:09:01.0000] <wycats>
2) WebIDL itself is not an ideal description for authors

[00:09:02.0000] <wycats>
(corollary: absent anything else, authors are confused)

[00:10:00.0000] <wycats>
it's not really a comment about WebIDL at all

[00:11:00.0000] <wycats>
I was asked something like "don't talk unless you have a counterproposal" which is where everything went downhill

[00:11:01.0000] <wycats>
also something like "don't talk unless you read the entire history of the mailing lists" ;)

[00:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Opera got Apple's pre-approval for http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2010/02/10/ or if they are going to take a gamble with Apple

[00:12:00.0000] <wycats>
uh... that's not gonna happen...

[00:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: webidl really shouldn't ever be seen by authors ideally

[00:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: i mean, unless they want to see the nitty gritty

[00:13:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: 100%

[00:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: it's meant purely as a way to describe impl requirements

[00:13:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: it's nice for me to be able to peer into the UA stuff sometimes

[00:13:05.0000] <wycats>
but it shouldn't be the first line of attack

[00:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: i tried making the appcache bit make more sense, take a look

[00:14:01.0000] <wycats>
just refresh?

[00:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:15:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: in general, do you think it makes sense to have a parallel thing for authors?

[00:15:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: what part did you update?

[00:15:03.0000] <wycats>
the event table?

[00:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: event table and the text before it

[00:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: i think it would be best to have a parallel thing, i think we should also make sure the spec makes sense for authors

[00:16:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: right now it is possible to understand for a few authors

[00:17:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I kind of want to see the diff

[00:17:01.0000] <wycats>
it's hard to see what changed

[00:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=4685&to=4686

[00:17:03.0000] <wycats>
yay

[00:17:04.0000] <wycats>
still a little passive voice... who's firing the events ;)

[00:18:00.0000] <wycats>
+1 on the <strong>

[00:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: i'd love to make the spec better for authors in general, just not sure what exactly to do

[00:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: if you have specific ideas, you can file them by using the review tool at the bottom

[00:19:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: understood

[00:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: the kind of feedback that is most helpful is things like "as an author looking at this section, i couldn't easily tell which event was the first one to fire in this sequence"

[00:19:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I'd say the biggest thing is just that it conceptually is organized differently from how authors think

[00:19:05.0000] <wycats>
so I was looking for "when does a change event get triggered"

[00:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
well we can add intro sections that handle that

[00:20:01.0000] <wycats>
as opposed to "when the user does X Y Z follow algorithm A" -> "In algorithm A: an event is fired with the N name" <- N resolves to change

[00:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
file bugs using the spec review tool along the lines of "as an author, i tried to find the answer to the question 'when does the change event fire?' and i couldn't figure out the answer."

[00:20:03.0000] <wycats>
haha

[00:20:04.0000] <wycats>
absolutely

[00:20:05.0000] <Hixie>
that would be really helpful for me in terms of making the spec better

[00:20:06.0000] <wycats>
where is the review tool?

[00:20:07.0000] <Hixie>
bottom left of the window

[00:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
when looking at the spec

[00:21:01.0000] <wycats>
specification annotation system?

[00:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
bottom left, not top left :-)

[00:22:00.0000] <wycats>
ah

[00:22:01.0000] <wycats>
comment

[00:22:02.0000] <wycats>
that always looked like it would end up in the black hole

[00:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh, no, not at all

[00:22:04.0000] <zcorpan>
i use it all the time

[00:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
so do i :-)

[00:23:01.0000] <wycats>
:)

[00:23:02.0000] <wycats>
good to know

[00:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's actually the most reliable way of sending feedback

[00:23:04.0000] <wycats>
I should take a day and do a full review

[00:23:05.0000] <Hixie>
irc tends to get lost, and e-mail to whatwg always gets a reply but it can take years

[00:23:06.0000] <wycats>
another thing that's really confusing is the verbiage around <input>

[00:23:07.0000] <wycats>
yeah totally

[00:24:00.0000] <wycats>
the "password state" is totally unintuitive to authors I feel

[00:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah the whole forms section is definitely aimed more at implementors than authors

[00:25:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: and it's one of the most interesting/exciting parts

[00:25:01.0000] <wycats>
and one that people are most interested in emulating in Js

[00:25:02.0000] <wycats>
JS*

[00:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
the most helpful thing for me in terms of feedback would be reports like "as an author, i tried to find the answer to the question ... and couldn't find the answer"

[00:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
that gives me something very actionable to deal with as i can specifically find the best place to answer it and put the answer in clearly

[00:26:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I'll happily file such things

[00:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
sweet

[00:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
that would be awesome

[00:26:03.0000] <wycats>
there's an entire other set of "as an author, I am interested in learning more about the new form controls and I can't figure it out"

[00:26:04.0000] <wycats>
which can totally be broken down a bit

[00:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah an intro section for the forms section could help

[00:29:01.0000] <wycats>
worried about making it even larger

[00:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
it would be very helpful to have a list of questions to answer for such an intro section

[00:29:03.0000] <wycats>
Contexts in which this element may be used:

[00:29:04.0000] <wycats>
Where http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#phrasing-content is expected.

[00:30:00.0000] <wycats>
^^ example of something that makes no sense to me as an author

[00:30:01.0000] <wycats>
which is stupid -- I'm being lazy as an author :/

[00:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
what doesn't make sense?

[00:30:03.0000] <wycats>
so you go click on the phrasing content

[00:30:04.0000] <wycats>
right?

[00:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[00:31:01.0000] <wycats>
maybe it's just all the jumping around

[00:31:02.0000] <wycats>
to try and figure out what's happening

[00:31:03.0000] <wycats>
sorry for not having my thoughts fully together here

[00:31:04.0000] <wycats>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#phrasing-content

[00:31:05.0000] <wycats>
is actually not too bad

[00:31:06.0000] <wycats>
maybe it would be good to have stuff like that pop up right there

[00:31:07.0000] <wycats>
to avoid losing the flow

[00:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've kinda lost track of what you mean

[00:32:01.0000] <wycats>
ok

[00:32:02.0000] <wycats>
so... when I'm reading, I often encounter alien language

[00:32:03.0000] <wycats>
which is defined elsewhere

[00:32:04.0000] <wycats>
before I know it I've jumped 2 or 3 times

[00:32:05.0000] <wycats>
and I've lost track of what's going on

[00:32:06.0000] <wycats>
(ADD?) :P

[00:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
not sure how to fix that

[00:33:01.0000] <wycats>
"phrasing content" is also known as "inline content" in CSS?

[00:33:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I was suggesting having it pop up

[00:33:03.0000] <wycats>
right there

[00:33:04.0000] <wycats>
maybe have an <acronym> for things like phrasing content

[00:33:05.0000] <wycats>
this is good enough: "Phrasing content is the text of the document, as well as elements that mark up that text at the intra-paragraph level. Runs of phrasing content form paragraphs"

[00:33:06.0000] <Hixie>
phrasing content has nothing to do with inline content in CSS, it's similar to what HTML4 called "inline elements" but we renamed it because it was very confusing having CSS and HTML both call things "inline" that had nothing to do with each other

[00:34:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I see

[00:34:01.0000] <wycats>
presumably phrasing content normally defaults to being styled as inline content?

[00:35:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: what do you think about making things like "phrasing content" just have a little popup with the summary

[00:36:00.0000] <wycats>
am I going off the rails here/

[00:36:01.0000] <wycats>
?

[00:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
most phrasing content elements usually default to display:inline

[00:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose we could have a popup

[00:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
but someone would have to figure out what the popups should say :-)

[00:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is that i don't want to mislead people by giving them simplified explanations that aren't correct

[00:38:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: there's already a summary up top of each

[00:38:02.0000] <wycats>
you can click for more info

[00:39:00.0000] <wycats>
presumably "Phrasing content is the text of the document, as well as elements that mark up that text at the intra-paragraph level. Runs of phrasing content form paragraphs." is correct?

[00:39:01.0000] <wycats>
For "embedded content" it would make more sense to just list the elements

[00:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
phrasing content is described by that reasonably briefly, yeah

[00:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
but many things have complicated definitions

[00:39:04.0000] <wycats>
for all cases but phrasing content actually

[00:39:05.0000] <wycats>
agree

[00:39:06.0000] <wycats>
we don't have to bite it all off at once

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose we could have a floating iframe or something that when you click links it jumps the iframe to that link rather than jumping the main spec or something

[00:45:00.0000] <wycats>
hm

[00:45:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: back when I was getting myself into trouble over WebIDL I was considering spiking out what a section would look like if it was focused on authors

[00:45:02.0000] <wycats>
maybe I should do that for web forms?

[00:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not sure what you mean. In general, the spec is intended for everyone, but generally that's done by having intro sections for authors, followed by requirements for implementors.

[00:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd be happy to add more intro sections for authors in the forms section, i just need to get a better idea of what kind of questions need answering

[00:49:00.0000] <wycats>
absolutely

[00:49:01.0000] <wycats>
ok... so I'll go through the spec and start throwing in comments

[00:49:02.0000] <wycats>
preferably not at 1am ;)

[00:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
cool, i look forward to them :-)

[00:49:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: the tricky part is that sometimes the sheer amount of info makes it hard to read -- +1 on the author view

[00:49:05.0000] <wycats>
yep

[00:49:06.0000] <Hixie>
when you file a bug it gives you the bug number with a URL, btw

[00:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can follow the bug (Cc yourself, etc) if you want, which would be helpful in case I need to ask further questions before I can fix the problem

[00:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
glad the author view helps

[00:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
tell people about it :-)

[00:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
we haven't done a good job about spreading that info around

[00:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
btw if you want to participate more, we have a blog that you can post on, and a wiki you can use if you need scratch space

[00:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
we'd love to get authors more involved

[00:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
but we kinda need someone to lead such an effort

[00:51:02.0000] <wycats>
whoa I submitted a comment and it was like 4 steps

[00:51:03.0000] <wycats>
link to the blog?

[00:51:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I'm already set up with permissions and such

[00:51:05.0000] <wycats>
I went through the process a few months ago

[00:51:06.0000] <Hixie>
blog.whatwg.org and wiki.whatwg.org

[00:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
is 4 steps a lot or not? not sure if you're saying it's too much or too little :-)

[00:52:01.0000] <wycats>
too much :)

[00:52:02.0000] <wycats>
I want to type something and hit enter

[00:52:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I can only have one comment per sectin?

[00:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
you can have as many as you like, just file them separately

[00:52:05.0000] <wycats>
or is it just not clearing it?

[00:52:06.0000] <Hixie>
not clearing

[00:52:07.0000] <wycats>
how can I see what I submitted?

[00:52:08.0000] <Hixie>
i added the prompts because people were filing bogus bugs

[00:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
the last alert should give you a link

[00:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
looks like http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8914

[00:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've removed the prompt, we'll see how many people file bogus bugs

[00:54:01.0000] <wycats>
ha

[00:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
that makes it 3 steps

[00:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
let me see if i can make enter work

[00:54:04.0000] <wycats>
"the http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/browsers.html#active-document of the http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/web-application-apis.html#script's-browsing-context" <- is there a way we can have a phrase that's more descriptive for that particular combination?

[00:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[00:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't see how it helps for WAI specs to have theoretically malleable non-normative exegeses if government entities snapshot those as normative (like Québec)

[00:55:02.0000] <wycats>
"the active document of the script's browsing context" -- is there more author-friendly terminology we can use here (in addition to the existing)

[00:55:03.0000] <wycats>
is what I'm submitting

[00:55:04.0000] <wycats>
:)

[00:56:00.0000] <wycats>
what do you think about hiding the IDL in author mode?

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
we could I guess

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
some people like the IDL though, gives them a nice overview

[00:59:00.0000] <wycats>
true

[00:59:01.0000] <wycats>
omg thousands of users

[01:01:00.0000] <wycats>
I feel like I'm spamming the tracker

[01:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh no worries

[01:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's anonymous, nobody will know to blame you :-)

[01:05:01.0000] <wycats>
ha

[01:06:00.0000] <wycats>
a lot of my comments are mainly just asking whether there's a way to make clearer what a term actually means in real life

[01:06:01.0000] <wycats>
feel free to reject them all, I guess

[01:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
finding good terms is hard

[01:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone has any suggestions, please list them in the bugs!

[01:07:02.0000] <wycats>
:)

[01:07:03.0000] <wycats>
I've been :)

[01:07:04.0000] <wycats>
"User agents raise a SECURITY_ERR exception whenever any of the members of an HTMLDocument object are accessed by scripts whose effective script origin is not the same as the Document's effective script origin."

[01:07:05.0000] <wycats>
I suggested referencing the same origin policy

[01:08:00.0000] <annevk>
same origin policy is not really explained yet anywhere though

[01:08:01.0000] <wycats>
annevk: maybe we should get on that ;)

[01:09:00.0000] <wycats>
I love the use of quirks mode in the spec

[01:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
the same origin policy is "the html5 spec", sadly, i don't know that we can simplify it much further

[01:12:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: right -- I wasn't suggesting that we could

[01:12:01.0000] <wycats>
I was suggesting that referencing the term there would make it clear what we were talking about

[01:12:02.0000] <wycats>
"scripts whose effective script origin is not the same as the Document's effective script origin." <- took me a few to grok

[01:12:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, well yeah, but a high level overview is something we could someday give

[01:12:04.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, though maybe it should be in the origin spec

[01:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: the one place where i use the term resulted in someone complainig that it wasn't defined :-(

[01:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8866

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to comment on that bug if you have anything to add to it

[01:14:01.0000] <wycats>
will do boss :)

[01:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[01:15:00.0000] <wycats>
hmmm... it doesn't find my username...

[01:15:01.0000] <wycats>
pretty sure I have an account

[01:16:00.0000] <wycats>
created account

[01:17:00.0000] <wycats>
done: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8866

[01:19:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: according to the spec, a title element can exist in the body, but if there's no head, document.title = is ineffective

[01:19:01.0000] <wycats>
am I reading this wrong?

[01:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
it shouldn't say it can exist in the body

[01:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
well i mean it can _exist_ there, but it's not allowed there

[01:20:00.0000] <wycats>
"The title element of a document is the first title element in the document (in tree order), if there is one, or null otherwise."

[01:20:01.0000] <wycats>
"Returns the document's title, as given by the title element"

[01:20:02.0000] <wycats>
doesn't prevent it from being in the body

[01:20:03.0000] <wycats>
but... "Can be set, to update the document's title. If there is no head element, the new value is ignored."

[01:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
right, that's an example of error handling, where the spec tries to handle errors gracefully, but tries to minimise authors making new errors

[01:22:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: so if I put a title in the body, document.title works, but document.title= fails?

[01:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
right

[01:22:02.0000] <wycats>
also, I seem to have lost the comment box!

[01:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
well

[01:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
unless you have a <head>, which most people will

[01:22:05.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: that seems really unexpected

[01:22:06.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: understood

[01:22:07.0000] <wycats>
seems like an error should be raised

[01:23:00.0000] <wycats>
instead of silent failing

[01:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
look in the bottom right, there should be an arrow button to make it return

[01:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
an exception?

[01:23:03.0000] <wycats>
error

[01:23:04.0000] <wycats>
me and my ruby ways

[01:23:05.0000] <wycats>
don't see no arrows

[01:23:06.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think we can change that, it's probably locked down based on what pages do

[01:23:07.0000] <Hixie>
odd

[01:23:08.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: got it

[01:24:00.0000] <wycats>
I'm here: http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/dom.html#dom

[01:24:01.0000] <wycats>
is that the wrong place?

[01:24:02.0000] <wycats>
it is :P

[01:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
you don't want the w3c copy, it doesn't have the review comments thing

[01:24:04.0000] <wycats>
right

[01:24:05.0000] <Hixie>
and it's blue, green is clearly a better colour :-P

[01:24:06.0000] <wycats>
I got lost

[01:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
red > *.

[01:25:01.0000] <wycats>
ha!

[01:27:00.0000] <wycats>
is NodeList defined to be document order?

[01:28:00.0000] <annevk>
ja

[01:30:00.0000] <wycats>
so I have a question I'm going to submit: How does an author *get* an object implementing DOMHTMLImplementation?

[01:30:01.0000] <wycats>
is there another place that actually should go?

[01:31:00.0000] <annevk>
dom3core maybe?

[01:32:00.0000] <wycats>
annevk: do you think it makes sense to mention it here for authors?

[01:32:01.0000] <wycats>
yay done with 3.1 ;)

[01:32:02.0000] <wycats>
hahahaha: "Authors must not use elements, attributes, or attribute values for purposes other than their appropriate intended semantic purpose. Authors must not use elements, attributes, or attribute values that are not permitted by this specification or other applicable specifications."

[01:32:03.0000] <wycats>
I am laughing hard right now

[01:42:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I feel strongly about http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8928

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't look at how strongly people feel about things, only about the strength of the arguments put forward :-)

[01:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that seems like a reasonable bug from a quick glance

[01:47:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: ha I didn't mean to file a specific bug about the volumechange event

[01:47:01.0000] <wycats>
the entire table is busted ;)

[01:48:00.0000] <wycats>
I can clarify

[01:48:01.0000] <wycats>
it doesn't seem like ^^ is a goal of the table

[01:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can't look at specifics right now, but i will definitely look at the bugs in detail in the coming days and weeks -- please include as much detail as possible in each bug so that i can work out what it is you want changed :-)

[01:50:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: will do

[01:50:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I'm treating it like an annotation exercise

[01:50:02.0000] <wycats>
going through the spec and annotating things I have questions/bugs about

[01:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[01:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wycats: i agree it's more useful if the spec said when and where events fired instead of listing where event handlers can be specified

[01:58:01.0000] <zcorpan>
since most event handlers can be specified everywhere

[01:59:00.0000] <wycats>
zcorpan: :)

[01:59:01.0000] <annevk>
and not all events have event handlers

[01:59:02.0000] <wycats>
indeed

[02:00:00.0000] <wycats>
that's the specific issue I had that caused me to hop in here

[02:00:01.0000] <zcorpan>
wycats: oh but there's an Events section in Index

[02:00:02.0000] <wycats>
zcorpan: look at it

[02:00:03.0000] <wycats>
:)

[02:00:04.0000] <wycats>
I linked to it above

[02:00:05.0000] <wycats>
it doesn't provide the info

[02:00:06.0000] <wycats>
it always says "HTML Element"

[02:00:07.0000] <wycats>
even when it's clearly not true

[02:00:08.0000] <wycats>
such as volumechange

[02:00:09.0000] <zcorpan>
you're looking at a different table

[02:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
scroll down

[02:01:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-index.html#events-0

[02:01:02.0000] <wycats>
I don't see volumechange in there

[02:02:00.0000] <wycats>
no waiting

[02:02:01.0000] <wycats>
etc.

[02:02:02.0000] <wycats>
for change: "Fired at controls when the user commits a value change"

[02:02:03.0000] <zcorpan>
"Note: See also media element events, application cache events, and drag-and-drop events."

[02:02:04.0000] <wycats>
that could be significantly clearer

[02:02:05.0000] <wycats>
oy

[02:03:00.0000] <wycats>
ok I take it back

[02:03:01.0000] <wycats>
the info is all here... I think...

[02:03:02.0000] <wycats>
but the organization leaves a lot to be desired

[02:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
btw, it's usually more helpful to say what question you were trying to answer that you couldn't get an answer for than just saying something is unclear, as i often look at something that is said to be unclear and think "well it looks clear to me..." because i'm asking different questions :-)

[02:04:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: hm I will try to be clearer :)

[02:04:01.0000] <wycats>
feel free to ask follow-ups

[02:04:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: in this case, what's unclear is what is meant by "the user commits a value change"

[02:04:03.0000] <wycats>
it's not linked to anything

[02:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not sure what i'd link to

[02:05:01.0000] <wycats>
also, the values available in each event would be useful (I believe they're generally described in the UA algorithms)

[02:05:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: there should probably be a section explaining what "commits a value" means

[02:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
what it means takes multiple sections to describe

[02:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
(btw, the "Interface" column links to the definitions of the interfaces, which lists the possible values for the event)

[02:06:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: "commits a value" can link to each explanation

[02:06:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I see that

[02:06:04.0000] <wycats>
so the vast majority of these are generic Event?

[02:07:00.0000] <wycats>
why isn't Event linked?

[02:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand how "commits a value" isn't clear... what's the question you're trying to ask that explains it?

[02:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
Event doesn't have any values

[02:07:03.0000] <wycats>
thank you for your patience

[02:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
(and it's defined in a different spec)

[02:07:05.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I know what "commits a value" means in practice

[02:07:06.0000] <Hixie>
(we don't have cross-spec cross-references working yet... gsnedders is working on a script to do it)

[02:07:07.0000] <wycats>
but for instance, typing in a text box

[02:08:00.0000] <wycats>
at what point is it considered "committed"

[02:08:01.0000] <wycats>
I happen to know that it's committed on blur

[02:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's more or less up to the browser

[02:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(actually, I'm working on 10.50, not on Anolis2)

[02:08:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: It's fine to have a section that says that

[02:08:05.0000] <wycats>
although that's really not great

[02:08:06.0000] <wycats>
imho it should be specified

[02:08:07.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know how it can be specified

[02:08:08.0000] <wycats>
there are IE/everyone else discrepancies on this that suck

[02:08:09.0000] <Hixie>
different browsers are different

[02:08:10.0000] <wycats>
(specifically wrt checkboxes)

[02:09:00.0000] <wycats>
when I click a checkbox, what is supposed to happen?

[02:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
when you type something in on an iPhone, it's gonna work differently than when you're using a speech-based browser, than when you're using a braille display, than when you're using a huge display in Times Square

[02:09:02.0000] <wycats>
committed or not committed?

[02:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno

[02:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
depends how the checkbox works

[02:09:05.0000] <wycats>
hm

[02:09:06.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I think this is fair

[02:09:07.0000] <wycats>
we should be explicit about it

[02:09:08.0000] <wycats>
just a little section that says it's UA-specific

[02:09:09.0000] <wycats>
and link

[02:10:00.0000] <wycats>
because tbh until right now I didn't assume that to be true

[02:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's defined in the UA parts of the spec, e.g. "The activation behavior is to fire a simple event that bubbles named change at the element, then broadcast formchange events at the element's form owner." in 4.10.5.1.16 Checkbox state

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#interactive-content defines activation steps (again in the UA-specific bits)

[02:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have no idea how to boil all that down to some author-facing text that is of any use to authors

[02:12:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: understood

[02:12:01.0000] <wycats>
"It would be inappropriate, however, for the user to use generic software not associated with that music site to search for tracks of a certain length by looking at this data. This is because these attributes are intended for use by the site's own scripts, and are not a generic extension mechanism for publicly-usable metadata."

[02:12:02.0000] <wycats>
I don't understand this at all

[02:12:03.0000] <wycats>
why is this true?

[02:12:04.0000] <wycats>
preserve this space for the RDFa/microdata wars?

[02:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's because otherwise we'd end up with authors not able to use any attribute

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
the idea of the data-* attributes is to reserve them for authors

[02:13:02.0000] <wycats>
but why can't I say: "hey world: I've put some info here in data-duration"

[02:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
because my data-duration might be different than yours

[02:14:00.0000] <virtuelv>
can anyone give me any good reason why html notifications are a good thing?

[02:14:01.0000] <virtuelv>
to me, they are "popups version 2"

[02:14:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: but I'm putting it on my page for other people I communicate with to use

[02:14:03.0000] <wycats>
not as a general-purpose name

[02:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: we don't want e.g. google to say "ok, data-snippet is a piece of text we'll use in search results" and then everyone who uses data-snippet already gets screwed

[02:14:05.0000] <virtuelv>
in terms of annoyance potential, that is

[02:14:06.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: if you want to communicate with others, that's what microdata is for

[02:14:07.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: more specs /

[02:14:08.0000] <wycats>
:/

[02:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: microdata lets you define a vocabulary such that you won't clash with everyone else

[02:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
microdata is part of the same spec :-)

[02:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
just liek data-* :-)

[02:15:03.0000] <wycats>
I know

[02:15:04.0000] <wycats>
I am aware

[02:15:05.0000] <Hixie>
(at least on the whatwg side)

[02:15:06.0000] <wycats>
lemme skim it

[02:15:07.0000] <wycats>
isn't there some huge war about this?

[02:15:08.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[02:15:09.0000] <wycats>
I'm really not fully briefed

[02:15:10.0000] <Hixie>
some people prefer rdfa

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
the microdata section has a long author-facing intro

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
which hopefully you'll find helpful

[02:16:02.0000] <wycats>
yeah reading it :)

[02:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's one of the better sections in terms of being friendly for authors

[02:16:04.0000] <wycats>
huh... so this actually lets you do arbitrary things

[02:17:00.0000] <wycats>
this seems more appropriate for what we're doing in Rails

[02:17:01.0000] <wycats>
as opposed to data-*

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: calendar notifications don't _require_ acknowledgement, they just happen to offer the user a way to jump to certain features (see the event, snooze the alarm, etc)

[02:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: possible, yeah. it's newer.

[02:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the distinction is pretty clear: data-* is for scripts, microdata is for bots

[02:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
basically

[02:18:04.0000] <wycats>
not interested in stepping into a war

[02:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
don't blame you

[02:18:06.0000] <wycats>
hsivonen: in our case, we're a script, but we're also designing a general purpose spec for scripts

[02:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: iCal alarms, Awaken alarms and alarms or my phone all *require* acknowledgement and are quite distinct from Growl

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wycats: <script>s or server-side scripts?

[02:20:01.0000] <wycats>
hsivonen: <script>s

[02:20:02.0000] <wycats>
http://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/blob/master/src/rails.js

[02:20:03.0000] <hsivonen>
if the person who controls the attributes also chooses whether to include a particular <script>, data-* is appropriate

[02:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: ah. the notifications that Google would like for Google Calendar (insofar as Google has a single opinion, which isn't very far) are notifications that self-cancel once the event is over.

[02:20:05.0000] <wycats>
hsivonen: Rails controls the attributes

[02:21:00.0000] <wycats>
users control the <script>

[02:21:01.0000] <wycats>
we also ship with some standard <script>s

[02:21:02.0000] <wycats>
for say, jQuery

[02:21:03.0000] <wycats>
or Prototype

[02:21:04.0000] <wycats>
but you don't NEED to use those

[02:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
the term "user" here is a bit ambiguous... do you mean the user of rails, or the user of the final app?

[02:21:06.0000] <hsivonen>
without knowing all the details, I'd go with data-rails-*

[02:22:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: the user of Rails

[02:22:01.0000] <wycats>
call them end-developers

[02:22:02.0000] <wycats>
hsivonen: data-rails-* is ugly :/

[02:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>
or data-nonrailsformatnamehere-*

[02:22:04.0000] <wycats>
also we don't want to bind to Rails

[02:22:05.0000] <wycats>
if CakePHP wants to use the same markup, they can get our libraries

[02:23:00.0000] <wycats>
and any other libraries someone wrote

[02:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear to me what problem you're solving so it's hard to really give good advice

[02:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
wycats: do you have a name for this spec?

[02:23:03.0000] <wycats>
hsivonen: not yet :)

[02:23:04.0000] <hsivonen>
data-nameofspec-* :-)

[02:23:05.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: the problem is: frameworks want to be able to provide JavaScript helpers, but inline JS sucks horribly

[02:23:06.0000] <wycats>
a better solution is to describe semantically what's happening

[02:23:07.0000] <wycats>
and then allow people to write JS to script the markup

[02:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
so you wouldn't want, say, google to do anything with this data

[02:24:01.0000] <wycats>
As of Rails 3, we are shipping markup

[02:24:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: in general not

[02:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
then data-* is what you want

[02:24:04.0000] <wycats>
got it

[02:24:05.0000] <Hixie>
or rather i should say

[02:24:06.0000] <Hixie>
data-* is applicable

[02:24:07.0000] <Hixie>
microdata probably is too

[02:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
microdata is applicable in many cases where data-* is, they have some overlap

[02:25:01.0000] <wycats>
an example would be a link that, when clicked, will get an HTML fragment and insert it into a DOM node: <a href="...

[02:25:02.0000] <wycats>
"

[02:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
it depends on whether e.g. you're trying to overlay a separate data model, or whether you want to annotate specific elements (e.g. "this element is open")

[02:25:04.0000] <wycats>
whoops

[02:25:05.0000] <wycats>
<a href="..." data-remote="true" data-update="#node">

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah for that you want data-*

[02:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
microdata doesn't apply to specific elements, it's just kinda overlaid on top of them

[02:26:02.0000] <wycats>
so basically what we're doing works?

[02:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
seems like it to me

[02:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
(microdata is like a parallel plane of reality that happens to touch the html plane in many of the same places, like in many fantasy stories!)

[02:26:05.0000] <wycats>
:-D

[02:26:06.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: ha

[02:38:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: the requests don't seem to be going through anymore

[02:38:01.0000] <wycats>
I don't get any "thank you"s anymore

[02:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's not a good sign

[02:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
i may have broken the script, hold on

[02:38:04.0000] <wycats>
Content-Language:en-GB-x-Hixie

[02:38:05.0000] <wycats>
hahahahah

[02:38:06.0000] <Hixie>
(i've been trying to tweak it a bit)

[02:39:00.0000] <wycats>
:)

[02:39:01.0000] <wycats>
how can I see a list of the newest reported bugs?

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://bit.ly/blwuuD - look at the bottom

[02:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i see the problem

[02:43:00.0000] <wycats>
I'm dave.null?

[02:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
try reloading the spec, it should work again

[02:43:02.0000] <wycats>
oh I'm contributor@

[02:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
you're contributor⊙wo

[02:43:04.0000] <wycats>
I signed in

[02:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
well, the form is contributor⊙wo

[02:43:06.0000] <wycats>
shouldn't it be submitting it as me?

[02:43:07.0000] <wycats>
ah

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can mass-cc yourself to bugs you filed from that page btw

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
which would be helpful if i need to ask for more info :-)

[02:44:02.0000] <wycats>
yah

[02:44:03.0000] <wycats>
will do

[02:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
if you cc yourself you'll get e-mails whenever i update the bug, which you'll see involves some ugly-ass boilerplate that's part of the w3c htmlwg process :-)

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
tells you your rights and so forth each time i accept or reject a suggestion :-)

[02:45:01.0000] <zcorpan>
you have the right to remain silent

[02:46:00.0000] <wycats>
nice

[02:46:01.0000] <wycats>
I added myself :)

[02:46:02.0000] <wycats>
seems as though if I log in on the spec page the tickets should come from me

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah it'd be nice to have something like that set up

[02:47:01.0000] <wycats>
:-D

[02:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i'd have to ask for your bugzilla password and stuff and i don't want to be responsible for managing the security behind that

[02:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it could set cc

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm, good point

[02:49:01.0000] <wycats>
+1

[02:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
it could try, anyway

[02:49:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: from what I understand CORS was set up to handle this

[02:49:04.0000] <wycats>
I kid I kid

[02:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
if we had CORS set up this would be 100x easier

[02:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
cos i could just do a cross-site request from JS

[02:50:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: do it

[02:50:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I'm using a CORS-compliant browser

[02:50:03.0000] <wycats>
;)

[02:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
as it is i have to bounce everything through my server

[02:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but bugzilla isn't CORS-aware

[02:50:06.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I thought it was really easy to convince people to change their stuff ;)

[02:50:07.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: yeah this is the problem I was running into

[02:51:00.0000] <wycats>
that firewall problems sucks

[02:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks into what it would take to have hie file-bug.cgi script use the email address from the database used by status.cgi

[02:53:00.0000] <annevk>
CORS-compliant? doubt it :)

[02:53:01.0000] <wycats>
annevk: earlier I was complaining that there wasn't a way to do a cross-origin request with no credentials and no cooperation

[02:53:02.0000] <wycats>
on the grounds that HTTP requests should be safe

[02:53:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie was explaining the firewall issue :/

[02:54:00.0000] <annevk>
we'll create a way prolly

[02:54:01.0000] <annevk>
credentialfree = new XMLHttpRequest(true) or some such

[02:54:02.0000] <wycats>
annevk: how do you get around the firewall problem

[02:54:03.0000] <wycats>
annevk: there's already credential-free CORS

[02:55:00.0000] <wycats>
but you still have to get permission

[02:55:01.0000] <annevk>
oh, you'd still need opt in from the server

[02:55:02.0000] <wycats>
right

[02:55:03.0000] <wycats>
even though in the vast majority of cases it's not actually needed

[02:55:04.0000] <annevk>
well, I meant credentialandoriginfree

[02:55:05.0000] <annevk>
sorry

[02:55:06.0000] <wycats>
like... I should be able to make an HTTP request to google.com

[02:55:07.0000] <wycats>
and see it

[02:55:08.0000] <annevk>
and forced by the constructor

[02:55:09.0000] <wycats>
I guess that kills CSRF defenses?

[02:55:10.0000] <wycats>
no it doesn't

[02:55:11.0000] <wycats>
I lie

[02:56:00.0000] <annevk>
doing a HTTP request to google and see it won't ever work

[02:56:01.0000] <wycats>
annevk: why not?

[02:56:02.0000] <annevk>
IP-authenticated, etc.

[02:56:03.0000] <wycats>
annevk: I don't know what that means :/

[02:56:04.0000] <annevk>
you need server opt-in

[02:56:05.0000] <wycats>
annevk: why?

[02:57:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought Hixie explained that issue already

[02:57:01.0000] <wycats>
right

[02:57:02.0000] <annevk>
anyway, if you don't mind I'm going back to sorting out getComputedStyle

[02:57:03.0000] <wycats>
I thought you had something else to add :)

[02:57:04.0000] <wycats>
k

[02:57:05.0000] <wycats>
peace

[02:57:06.0000] <wycats>
the firewall situation just sucks :/

[02:59:00.0000] <wycats>
I don't like that mobile web apps are inherently more constrained than their native counterparts :/

[02:59:01.0000] <wycats>
(on this front)

[02:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone is filing any more bugs in the next few minutes, let me know if it fails

[02:59:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I will be

[02:59:04.0000] <wycats>
reading though 3.2.5

[03:00:00.0000] <wycats>
whoa <ins> and <del> can straddle <p> boundaries

[03:00:01.0000] <wycats>
gulp

[03:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: I seem to remember that Matthew Paul Thomas describing some reasonable use cases for notifications

[03:03:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: seems to have works

[03:03:01.0000] <wycats>
worked

[03:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[03:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
next step is to tell the file-bug script the username of the user

[03:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
btw if you reload you should see nice new fancy styles that lachy inspired me to do

[03:04:01.0000] <wycats>
I saw :)

[03:05:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: is there more information on document.write somewhere or is 3.5.3 all of it?

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
what kind of information?

[03:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, the parser is obviously relevant to how documnet.write works

[03:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
and that's a huge section

[03:07:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I just filed a bug to say that document.write should note that using it after the parser is done causes a new doc, which is implicit in "calls open() implicitly"

[03:07:01.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: there are plenty of legitimate uses of notifications

[03:07:02.0000] <virtuelv>
however, I would hate to see the onslaught of "V1AGRA!" flash notifications

[03:08:00.0000] <virtuelv>
which, coincidentally would be incompatible with notification systems like Growl or Ubuntu's own notifications

[03:08:01.0000] <wycats>
insertAdjacentHTML is huge win

[03:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: "Drink Pepsi!"

[03:09:01.0000] <wycats>
get that shit in Webkit!

[03:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: that's why any notification system has to have a mechanism by which you have to opt-in for the site to be able to use it

[03:09:03.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: my point is that the cognitive load difference between a google text ad, and a doubleclick evony ad is signifcant

[03:09:04.0000] <virtuelv>
significant*

[03:10:00.0000] <wycats>
"Wherever a subdocument fragment is allowed in a compound document" <- what cases are these?

[03:10:01.0000] <wycats>
I can just file a ticket to ask for explanation

[03:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: clearly to prevent that the solution is a policy-based notification mechanism and/or a notification policy framework or some other combination of policies and frameworks

[03:12:00.0000] <wycats>
ok fading fast

[03:12:01.0000] <wycats>
bedtime :)

[03:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[03:12:03.0000] <wycats>
thx for everything Hixie 

[03:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
thank _you_!

[03:12:05.0000] <wycats>
helluva job :)

[03:12:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
in general, when you need a magic solution to a problem, you just need to throw some policies and frameworks at it and the problems will just sort of solve themselves

[03:17:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: unless I'm crazy I just noticed a circular dependency in the spec

[03:18:00.0000] <wycats>
Contexts in which this element may be used: Where http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#metadata-content is expected.

[03:18:01.0000] <wycats>
Metadata content is content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of the content, or that sets up the relationship of the document with other documents, or that conveys other "out of band" information. => base command link meta noscript script style title

[03:18:02.0000] <wycats>
the first is to "link"

[03:18:03.0000] <wycats>
I don't see where the "contexts in which metadata-content is expected" is defined

[03:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not a special term, it just means it's regular english meaning

[03:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
its

[03:19:02.0000] <wycats>
so where a human would expect metadata content?

[03:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, where a spec says "expects: metadata content" or some such

[03:20:01.0000] <wycats>
ah

[03:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
for example, the <head> element says "Content model: ... Zero or more elements of metadata content."

[03:21:00.0000] <wycats>
aha

[03:21:01.0000] <wycats>
"One or more elements of http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#metadata-content, of which exactly one is a title element" :)

[03:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
right

[03:23:00.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: if a solution requires a policy-based mechanism, it's probably going further than it needs

[03:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: yeah, and/or the policy mechanism is really a platform feature that could potentially be used across other applications running on the platform, not something specific to the browser or Web applications running within the browser

[03:37:00.0000] <virtuelv>
my other concern is that html notifications excludes external notification applications

[03:37:01.0000] <virtuelv>
which leaves security of the notification up to chance

[03:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone tries to file a bug let me know if it fails

[03:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks at http://www.w3.org/mid/CB173250-44A4-4E98-B723-101BB5673C85⊙wo and the resulting thread and wonders how to fix the problem without offending the xml core wg

[03:45:00.0000] <annevk>
can't we write an extension to XML similar to Namespaces for XML is an extension to XML?

[03:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
positioning that kind of thing as an extension would be mind-blowing

[03:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
extensions are supposed to be good but changing XML is bad

[03:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: is the Interfaces appendix in the spec auto-generated? if so, there must be a bug in the script for it, because it's missing some elements -- e.g, del and command

[03:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
nothing is autogenerated

[03:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
except the entities

[03:49:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, namespaces is an extension of XML

[03:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the extensible markup language (...except for the parts that aren't open to further discussion about extending or changing, ever)

[03:50:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, it's a separate spec after all

[03:50:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, and every now and then it's positioned that XML without namespaces exists too

[03:50:03.0000] <annevk>
so it seems reasonable that a separate spec could increase the list of predefined entities...

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk>
(reasonable and prolly highly controversial at the same time)

[03:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me points to the "without offending" part of his comment :-)

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok if you're logged in to the status annotation thingy, it'll cc you when filing bugs

[03:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
make sure your e-mail address is the same

[03:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
otherwise it'll break

[03:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, everything in Spotify is playing at double speed

[03:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. it seems that I have broken the C++ version of named character tokenization but not the Java version

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
found the reason

[03:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
whew

[04:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, i use different addresses for the annotion and for bugzilla

[04:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: how does it break? does it just not add the cc?

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
it probably fails to submit the bug

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
it does whatever happens when you set a cc and bugzilla complains about the cc being unknown

[04:10:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, even with standardized REST APIs you still need some extra stuff in the browser, no?

[04:10:01.0000] <annevk>
e.g. I guess you want some kind of magic URI scheme that the browser binds to the appropriate service?

[04:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
you need a scheme and a path in that scheme, yeah

[04:10:03.0000] <annevk>
like data-service:contacts/... or some such

[04:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[04:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
isn't urn in ie like namespaceURI?

[04:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: so I've thought

[04:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me creates a new account for the spec annotation system

[04:34:00.0000] <annevk>
here I thought I knew what should happen when properties allow mixing of identifiers and strings for the same thing and along comes font-family

[04:34:01.0000] <annevk>
I guess font-family is a special case and not everyone agrees for it anyway

[04:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
what about font-family?

[04:38:01.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Sorry to bother you on IRC -- but I am a bit confused about something, which I currently think is a mistake in the validator services you have as well as W3C's for HTML 5.

[04:39:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Currently both are saying to me that <math> cannot occur enclosed in elements such as <p> or <div>, but looking at the spec it seems to allow this just fine.

[04:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: the validator doesn't allow it currently to discourage authors from deploying <math> or <svg> in text/html before browsers are ready

[04:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: there's currently no shipping browser that supports <math> or <svg> in text/html

[04:41:01.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Ah ok, guess I am a bit unique then since I used XHTML + MathML profiles before.

[04:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but it would be better to allow it and to emit a warning

[04:41:03.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Sure? Firefox 3.6 is then tricking me

[04:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: Firefox 3.6 in its default configuration doesn't support <math> in text/html

[04:42:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, it differs per browser, but e.g. font-family:"foobar", omg omg, serif turns into 'foobar', 'omg omg', serif or "foobar",omg omg,serif

[04:42:02.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Oh you mean with html5.enable set to false.

[04:42:03.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: right

[04:42:04.0000] <annevk>
in Opera it does something else altogether

[04:42:05.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Right, fair point. 

[04:42:06.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: if you set it to true, I recommend running trunk builds instead of the release

[04:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the HTML5 parser in the release is a snapshot from the end of June

[04:43:01.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: I haven't encountered much issues though.

[04:43:02.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Then again, maybe mine are simplistic enough ;)

[04:44:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Can I show you something in private related to this?

[04:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: ok

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk>
oh and, "foobar",omg turns into 'foobar', omg or 'foobar',omg

[04:51:01.0000] <annevk>
it seems nicer if custom values are consistently quoted

[04:51:02.0000] <annevk>
but maybe that can be changed

[04:54:00.0000] <asmodai>
So, just to get my thoughts straight, <svg> and <math> should be able to be enclosed with <div>, <p>, <span> and such elements, right?

[04:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: <math> and <svg> can appear where <img> can appear

[04:58:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i thought "foobar", "omg omg", serif was correct

[04:59:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Cool, thanks for that verification.

[04:59:01.0000] <asmodai>
23

[05:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i think we do that for 2dcontext.font

[05:03:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, interesting, we don't for fontFamily

[05:04:00.0000] <annevk>
but yeah, that sounds like how it should be

[07:13:00.0000] <moine>
hi

[07:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
hej

[07:13:02.0000] <moine>
i don't understand how to use websocket in html5

[07:14:00.0000] <moine>
i try to understand http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/

[07:14:01.0000] <moine>
what is this : http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/#the-websocket-interface

[07:14:02.0000] <moine>
javascript ?

[07:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, WebSockets are a JavaScript feature.

Oh god, the star wars holiday special is as bad as everyone told me.

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's a reason why they were telling you that :-)

[07:53:01.0000] <workmad3>
that's still on my 'to watch' list... right underneath 'hercules in new york'

[07:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me vaguely remembers its version of Kashyyyk being pretty close to the modern renditions of it

Afternoon

[08:27:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, margin-top behaves like nothing before

[08:27:01.0000] <annevk>
in theory margin-top "applies" when display is none

[08:28:00.0000] <annevk>
but there's no used value then... so browsers give the computed value

[08:32:00.0000] <annevk>
getComputedStyle #$@

[08:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Ahhh, you don't mean that, really

[08:39:00.0000] <annevk>
#$@ means great o_O

[08:47:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess padding-*, margin-*, *height/*width, line-height are the most special

[08:47:01.0000] <annevk>
when it comes to getComputedStyle

[08:47:02.0000] <annevk>
will prolly test the remaining details tomorrow and hopefully commit something

[08:47:03.0000] <annevk>
in Firefox top/left/right/bottom are also special but not in other browsers

[09:07:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if HTML Microdata is a delta spec

[09:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: I think it effectively is

[09:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although it shouldn't be :(

[09:10:00.0000] <annevk>
every now and then I try a literal read of the HTML charter to see if the people complaining actually make sense

[09:10:01.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure they do

[09:10:02.0000] <annevk>
but I don't really care either; guess I should find a better hobby

[09:11:00.0000] <annevk>
such as figuring out getComputedStyle, #$@

[09:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe a hobby that doesn't involve angle brackets, or computers, or electricity

[09:12:00.0000] <annevk>
they don't really last (with apologies to markp)

[09:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
you could try and read a book?

[09:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
That wouldn't last

[09:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to get more books, so he can give up on Ulysses and read something else

[09:14:02.0000] <annevk>
I read books, no worries, but currently I'm at Frank's place and have no access to it

[09:14:03.0000] <jgraham>
plural agreement error

[09:14:04.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: A good plan

[09:14:05.0000] <annevk>
and I skipped working for about an hour which I'm trying to catch up with now

[09:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Not if I get what Jansson pointed me to, I expect, in your opinion.

[09:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(House of Night)

[09:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
I have no idea what that is, but I assume it involves pale faced young ladies and surprisingly toothy men with a taste for blood

[09:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes

[09:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
What does 'editorial change' actually mean?

[09:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
I've never quite figured it out

[09:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
A change which has no normative changes to the spec?

[09:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think it means "change no one bothers to complain about later"

[09:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It means a change that's not substantive, it just rewords something or whatnot but the meaning is the same.

[09:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or what gsnedders said ;)

[09:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
plinss: The use-case isn't really when it's like 2.6e-4, it's like 2.6e-30, which is way easier to read than .00000...26

[09:19:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
bert?: In what cases is that not 0?

[09:19:03.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Wrong channel?

[09:19:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Shit.

[09:19:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses this is meant to be #css minutes

[09:19:06.0000] <Philip`>
Normative changes to a spec, rather than normative changes to the set of specs that in combination define the web platform?

[09:19:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Fail.

[09:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was wondering why "plinss" wasn't auto-completing.

[09:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not quite alpha, but not entirely beta either

I'm surprised there isn't a firestorm about H:TML's name

[09:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
suggest it be changed to X:HTML

[09:30:01.0000] <annevk>
why would there be?

[09:30:02.0000] <annevk>
it's not edited by Hixie

[09:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
H:TML is an incredibly confusing name, though.

[09:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, the abbreviation is.

[09:31:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Now, random question: why did Apple introduce <link rel="apple-touch-icon"> instead of, say, <link rel="large-icon"> or something?

[09:32:00.0000] <annevk>
why not just use rel=icon plus sizes?

[09:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or that.

[09:32:02.0000] <annevk>
wc?

[09:32:03.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe it should be HTML5 Document Conformance Reference or something

[09:32:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does the iPhone support that?  MediaWiki and Wikipedia output <link rel="apple-touch-icon">, and it annoys me.

[09:32:05.0000] <jgraham>
Didn't apple propose sizes for exactly this use case?

[09:32:06.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I'd suggest to let someone else bikeshed it

[09:32:07.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe because other browsers would always download the large icon and waste bandwidth?

[09:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Would they?

[09:33:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: we first need to start the bikeshed

[09:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me has no idea

[09:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Of course there is a cynical answer

[09:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, enlighten me.

[09:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me files a bug on hte name

[09:40:01.0000] <jgraham>
Getting your branding in markup is good advertising, especially if other people end up copying it for compatibility. It's one of the problems with namespace URIs; who wants to have a {http://netscape.com}img or a http://apple.com{canvas}

[09:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/http://apple.com{canvas}/{http://apple.com}canvas/

[09:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me imagines that's part of the reason for the proliferation of DTDs

[09:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, maybe.  I think it's more likely to be patterned after stuff like -webkit-*, though.

[09:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The old ones with names of companies and WYSIWYG editors in them, that is)

[09:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ugh, and Apple also had to replicate the broken well-known-location behavior from favicon.ico.

[09:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: There is a clear standardisation path there that typically works

[09:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
(for -webkit- and so on)

[09:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
(It's actually been pretty successful since now they get free advertisting in HTML specs for the rest of eternity, in the quirks mode lists)

[09:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/t//

[09:43:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, only if it marks a not-yet-standard property rather than a private-use property that's not intended for standardization.

[09:43:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know why standards-conscious vendors allow the latter to be exposed to the public web at all.

[09:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
This is clearly not like a private-use property since it is intended for developers to use it

[09:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yes, so I guess they qualify as not standards-conscious.

"Microdata was created as a step towards this goal by people wishing RDFa's use cases not to be satisfied" - um, what?

[14:08:01.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
hi

[14:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
TabAtkins: The main use case of RDFa is using RDFa

[14:09:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
FFS, apparently.

[14:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: I think that's called "making shit up"

[14:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There has to be reasonable RDFa people around.  They *have* to exist.  Why are none of them on the HTMLWG list?

[14:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Maybe they have better things to do than sign up for a world of pain

[14:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That would be a surprisingly rational action.

[14:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
FWIW there were several RDFa people who wrote quite reasonable, thoughtful blog posts about Microdata when it was first announced

[14:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
TabAtkins: The reasonable RDFa people are mostly in the unification camp, I think

[14:17:02.0000] <jgraham>
So I have reason to believe that such people exist

[14:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: That is a relief to hear.  I don't read nearly enough web-tech-related blogs to know what the wider internet thinks about things.

[14:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: What precisely is the goal behind unification?  Just finding an intersection between the two technologies, basically?

[14:18:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Not intersection... it's a bit more flexible

[14:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/124 was an example of a very well reasoned post

[14:19:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(And obviously there's no final definition, since if so we'd be debating adopting it.)

[14:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
I really don't understand the point of unification

[14:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's like saying that ruby and python should be unified because they cover a similar problem space

[14:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well sure, but they have totally different philosophys and make entirely differnt design trade offs

[14:22:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: That is a good post.

[14:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Surely better to let end users decide which is the better than spend years trying to reach some compromise that no one likes and has none of the original advantages of either approach

[14:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Surely we should see if improvements are possible before rejecting it

[14:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
RDFa 1.1 isn't just "let's keep RDFa 1.0 completely intact"

[14:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
I am quite happy to let RDFa evolve however it likes and Microdata evolve however it likes and see which one works best at the end

[14:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Similarly, microdata is open-ended with regard to full graphs and data types

[14:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess fragmentation is a possible issue but it is far from clear to me that it is a bigger issue than the type of compromise that you would have to make for microdata and RDFa to merge 

[14:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not like it'd be one or the other. The hybrid might favor one side over the other. Even if a hybrid is proposed, people could still use the "originals" if they preferred.

[14:28:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But if one side can accomodate the other better without any real loss, it would be a better candidate to become majority use

[14:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders what public-hypertext-cg is

[14:30:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The public face of the hypertext cg?

[14:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
apparently, though it only seems to be used by people cross-posting to it

[14:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe they don't like www-archive

Is there a way in canvas to draw the shadow for a path but not the actual path? when I set the fillStyle to 'rgba(0,0,0,0)' the shadow is not drawn either

[14:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
carllerche: No

[14:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
It uses the alpha from the drawn shape to generate the shadow

[14:36:01.0000] <carllerche>
Philip`: Is there a way to do this? will I have to draw the shadow myself?

[14:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
and it always composites both the shadow and the original shape onto the canvas

[14:36:03.0000] <carllerche>
Philip`: Is it possible to render multiple shadows per shape?

[14:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could set the shadow offset to be very large, and draw the shape somewhere off-screen, so only the shadow is visible

[14:38:00.0000] <carllerche>
hmm, tricky :)

[14:38:01.0000] <carllerche>
i'll try that

[14:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
The shadows are rendered once each time you call fill()/stroke(), though you can call fill/stroke multiple times per path

[14:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe easier to just draw the shadows manually :)

[14:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/shadow/shadow2.html emulates shadowing manually

[14:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
by doing the Gaussian blur

[14:41:01.0000] <carllerche>
thanks for that tip

[14:42:00.0000] <carllerche>
for some reason, if the fillStyle is set to 'black' the shadow renders correctly, if it's set to a gradient the shadow is only visible right around the edges of the shape...

[14:42:01.0000] <carllerche>
I might end up doing the shadows by hand :-/

[14:44:00.0000] <carllerche>
woah, my canvas renders completely differently in firefox than webkit

[14:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Shadows ought to work with gradients, I believe

[14:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be great if you could produce a minimal test case that indicates browser differences and report them as bugs :-)

[14:51:00.0000] <carllerche>
Philip`: this is my test http://carllerche.com/stuff/tests/index.html

[14:51:01.0000] <carllerche>
I don't think i'm doing anything crazy

[14:52:00.0000] <carllerche>
the shadow doesn't seem to render when it's a gradient (it does if fillStyle is set to black) and the shape is way off in firefox...

[14:52:01.0000] <carllerche>
i should probably make sure i'm on the latest FF

[14:53:00.0000] <carllerche>
Philip`: Indeed, I just updated FF and the shape is correct and the shadow renders. So, it seems to be a bug with webkit nightly

[14:54:00.0000] <boblet>
hey all, anyone here involved with html5lib? I’m wondering how far off it is from being used as a Tidy replacement for uF tools

[14:54:01.0000] <carllerche>
yeah, it's an already reported bug

[15:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The most entertaining thing about doing MediaWiki support is seeing all the crazy things people make wikis for.

[15:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've seen furries, Euclidean geometry, and now sneakers.  A wiki all about sneakers.

[15:30:00.0000] <t3rminat0r_>
anyone related with CFD?


2010-02-11
[18:12:00.0000] <boblet>
tantek: do you have any idea how far off html5lib is from usable for uF tools (like H2X)?

[18:13:00.0000] <boblet>
looks like it’s way more active than Tidy, but uF wiki note on H2VX doesn’t make it sound soon

[18:14:00.0000] <hober>
boblet: a fair number of people use html5lib in production, in both python and ruby

[18:15:00.0000] <boblet>
hober: that’s good to know. I guess H2VX might be waiting for a PHP port then

[18:16:00.0000] <hober>
*nod*

[18:16:01.0000] <boblet>
I wonder what language other Microformat tools are using…

[18:19:00.0000] <tantek>
yes H2VX is waiting for a PHP port of html5lib

[18:20:00.0000] <boblet>
tantek: how does html5lib-php-0.1 stack up? still a ways to go?

[18:21:00.0000] <tantek>
haven't had a chance to play with it - really wanting some reports on its usage before working on transitioning a production service (H2VX) to using it

[18:23:00.0000] <boblet>
tantek: thanks, good to know. Here’s hoping we’ll be able to use uF with HTML5 structural elements soon

[18:23:01.0000] <tantek>
boblet - yes I would like to do so as well

[18:24:00.0000] <tantek>
I'm also looking into alternatives that don't require Tidy or html5lib

[18:24:01.0000] <tantek>
e.g. an option for those who wish to serve biglot documents

[18:24:02.0000] <tantek>
to simply not use tidy and use PHP DOMDocument to directly load their content as well formed XML.

[18:26:00.0000] <tantek>
anybody (else) here serving biglot HTML5 documents?

[18:29:00.0000] <tantek>
/me wonders if Hixie has seen the typo report on the md draft.

[18:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, it's already filed as a bug i think

[18:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[19:51:00.0000] <annevk>
sleep is for the weak

[20:02:00.0000] <Garry->
hi

[20:03:00.0000] <Garry->
Can anyone give me an idea on how to make the footer go at the bottom of the page in html5?

[20:23:00.0000] <jwalden>
sleep is for the week

[20:31:00.0000] <annevk>
guess I should update html5-diff

[20:47:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I was able to write a faux Firefox HTML5 video player in Flash

[20:48:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It mimics the look and feel of Firefox's, so that in combination with something like Video For Everybody's solution should work pretty well :D

[21:02:00.0000] <annevk>
sigh

[21:02:01.0000] <annevk>
it's over 1000 revisions since last publication

[21:03:00.0000] <annevk>
though removing editorial changes helps

[21:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
is toString(36) defined in es5 these days?

[21:36:00.0000] <annevk>
is seamless defined in such a way that if sandbox forces a unique origin seamless still works?

[21:36:01.0000] <annevk>
I guess reading the spec myself would be faster...

[21:38:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems to cover it

[21:40:00.0000] <annevk>
hah

[21:41:00.0000] <annevk>
last TR/ version of HTML5 still has <legend> for <figure> and <details>

[21:41:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe I should object to publication to preserve the status quo

[21:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i must say i like <figcaption> and <summary> better than <legend>

[21:45:01.0000] <annevk>
i must say i disagree :p

[21:46:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, <meter> and <progress> have a form attribute now

[21:46:01.0000] <annevk>
fun

[21:46:02.0000] <zcorpan>
writing just figcaption and summary instead of figure > legend and details > legend in css is great

[21:46:03.0000] <annevk>
why wouldn't you just write legend?

[21:46:04.0000] <zcorpan>
and legend has annoying styling problems

[21:46:05.0000] <zcorpan>
because i want different styles

[21:47:00.0000] <annevk>
fair enough

[21:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
legend is the right solution imho

[21:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
but people care more about the short term, so...

[21:47:03.0000] <annevk>
I have "The <code>figure</code> element now uses a new element <code>figcaption</code> rather than <code>legend</code> because people want to use HTML5 long before it reaches W3C Recommendation stage."

[21:48:00.0000] <annevk>
oops, that has a typo

[21:48:01.0000] <annevk>
yay for proofreading

[21:48:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i used to think so, but actually using this in production made me think that dedicated elements are better

[21:48:03.0000] <annevk>
/me removes stage

[21:49:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess I'll just align the draft with the W3C reality of things

[21:49:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: even when ignoring short term problems like parsing and styling; dedicated elements makes selectors and scripts easier to work with

[21:49:02.0000] <annevk>
i.e. the split of microdata et al

[21:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(but the short term problems are real of course)

[21:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: that may be true, but it's not a scalable language design policy

[21:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: the language design should consider ease of use in script and css

[21:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
some other set of elements might be easier to use if they reuse an element or share an element; but for details and figure my experience is that they benefit from dedicated elements

[21:55:00.0000] <annevk>
the UI in the artwork for <details> has a bug

[21:56:00.0000] <annevk>
hide extension is ticked yet the extension is visible

[21:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[21:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[21:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
blame apple :-)

[22:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
what happened to http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker ?

[22:04:01.0000] <annevk>
what happened to svn.whatwg.org you mean?

[22:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
likely

[22:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me is learning how to restart apache on his dreamhost server :-P

[22:05:02.0000] <annevk>
the frontpage is not cached

[22:06:00.0000] <annevk>
I wonder whether I should remove the other caches as well since it's well over 20GiB now

[22:06:01.0000] <annevk>
and the damage was mostly done by this spammer bot that I killed

[22:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
k it should be back

[22:07:01.0000] <annevk>
it's getting more popular apparently

[22:07:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: maybe cache size and network load can be reduced by serving raw logs and annotating them client side

[22:08:00.0000] <annevk>
making an actual copy of the svn thingie that keeps itself up to date would prolly be even better

[22:08:01.0000] <annevk>
but so far that's classified as TME

[22:10:00.0000] <annevk>
almost 2000 failed requests for /to

[22:10:01.0000] <annevk>
also for /too /tools/w /tools/web-a etc. 2000 each!

[22:10:02.0000] <annevk>
what are all these people smoking?

[22:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe some browser does a request for each keypress in the location bar

[22:12:00.0000] <annevk>
oh well, plenty of room for improvements

[22:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder if some browser does dns lookup while typing in the location bar

[22:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: most of those are probably attempted attacks

[22:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
from automated malware

[22:21:00.0000] <annevk>
the HTML Vocabulary stuff didn't go through right?

[22:21:01.0000] <annevk>
/me goes to read some emails in more detail

[22:22:00.0000] <annevk>
ah right

[22:22:01.0000] <annevk>
HTML5, HTML Microdata, and HTML Canvas 2D Context

[22:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's still in the whatwg html spec, but yeah, the w3c didn't want it

[22:24:00.0000] <annevk>
that's a reply to my last statement?

[22:37:00.0000] <annevk>
anyways, updated the draft, emailed public-html

[22:39:00.0000] <annevk>
guess I can now start with waking up and start with what I was planning on working on today

[22:39:01.0000] <annevk>
getComputedStyle FTW

[22:40:00.0000] <Necrathex>
annevk: goeiemorgen :p

[22:41:00.0000] <annevk>
I was actually tempted to not email public-html as there is so much potential for whining over nothing with this draft it is bound to happen. Hopefully I'm too pessimistic.

[22:41:01.0000] <annevk>
Necrathex, morguh

[22:44:00.0000] <asmodai>
mogguh

[22:45:00.0000] <asmodai>
One thing I did not understand. If the HTML(5, 6?) features are going to be documented/implemented unversioned, how does this impact website designers? Will the spec provide guidelines for capabilities sniffing/exchange or?

[22:46:00.0000] <annevk>
there's no change for designers because as far as they are concerned it has always been unversioned

[22:47:00.0000] <annevk>
i.e. browsers have always done incremental improvements

[22:48:00.0000] <asmodai>
So basically we stay with capabilities sniffing then.

[22:48:01.0000] <annevk>
the idea with unversioning it and making incremental improvements is to reduce the gap between reality and spec writing

[22:49:00.0000] <annevk>
asmodai, yup

[22:49:01.0000] <asmodai>
Well, sure, writing a spec in isolation takes time, especially if features get implemented at the final publication of said spec. :)

[22:49:02.0000] <asmodai>
Doesn't help much in the quickly evolving way of web development.

[22:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
exactly :-)

[22:50:01.0000] <asmodai>
Just wonder if capabilities exchange couldn't be more streamlined in some way.

[22:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
btw i've dramatically reduced the MaxClients on whatwg.org (and all the other things in hosts, e.g. acidtests.org, hixie.ch, etc), so hopefully it won't run out of RAM so often anymore

[22:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
asmodai: how do you mean?

[22:51:00.0000] <asmodai>
Well, right now it seems only seriously involved people sniff out capabilities. A lot are still stuck with white-/blacklists, then you have those that just build a site without regard to additional features if browser X supports it.

[22:52:00.0000] <asmodai>
Maybe it just needs more documenting to get the larger mass of people to pick it up.

[22:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think most people just do what works in their browser

[22:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure we can do much about that

[22:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
other than getting the browsers in sync

[22:52:04.0000] <asmodai>
Or maybe my mind is just stuck with SATA drives and such that exchange capabilities to the controller :)

[22:55:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
annevk: in the sentence that begins "In addition to all of the above, Microdata an the 2D context API for canvas", the word "an" should be "and"

[22:56:00.0000] <asmodai>
mpilgrim: Btw Mark, for your dive into html5, Firefox 3.6 also doesn't support the placeholder thing with forms. Right now you only mention 3.5, and since 3.6 is out...

[22:56:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
annevk: also, later in the same sentence, "have been splitted into their own drafts" should read "have been *split* into their own drafts"

[22:56:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
asmodai: thanks, i will be updating the compatibility tables for fx3.6 soon

[22:57:00.0000] <asmodai>
mpilgrim: ah cool

[22:57:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
also need to bump chrome to chrome 4 now that that's hit the stable channel

[22:58:00.0000] <asmodai>
Still a pity only Firefox 3.6 does <math> :(

[22:58:01.0000] <asmodai>
Yes, I actually use MathML :P

[23:00:00.0000] <asmodai>
Love it actually, just wonder if the syntax is the best that people could've come up with.

[23:07:00.0000] <annevk>
thanks, fixed the typos

[23:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: "was introduced. to allow" stray dot

[23:43:00.0000] <annevk>
also fixed

[23:43:01.0000] <annevk>
plus some other things

[23:59:00.0000] <annevk>
bbl

[00:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I added some bold and italic to the issue status page per your suggestions

[00:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

can you help with a question in #webkit? i am not sure where to look in the webkit code

[00:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me studies the xml entity problem

[00:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
but make sure not to say anything about it here on irc, i wouldn't want people to think i was ignoring the uberthread that i carefully read through and just listening to advice here only

seems firefox and opera run moved scripts in the context of the original document

[00:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: what about IE and WebKit?

[00:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: tentetively, I think running scripts in the context of the document the parser is associated with would be less pain

[00:38:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: don't have ie, webkit didn't move anything for some reason

[00:38:02.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-end.html#scripts-that-modify-the-page-as-it-is-being-parsed

[00:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
also, the careful dance to avoid non-XML local names in XML falls apart when moving nodes (just checking the moved tree doesn't help if it's still being parsed)

[01:10:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, if an element is removed from the rendering tree Firefox no longer updates the CSSStyleDeclaration object

[01:10:01.0000] <annevk>
or something

[01:14:00.0000] <annevk>
so special are height/width/line-height/margin/padding so far

[01:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i really need to define <datagrid> just so that iTunes can switch back to something that's at least half-decent for displaying the tracks

[01:20:00.0000] <annevk>
hah, HTML will be implemented before HTML5

[01:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are already bits of the next generation of HTML that are being implemented before HTML5 is completely implemented

[01:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I was ashtonished that the iTunes 9 search result UI had gotten through whatever UI stuff has to get through at Apple

[01:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: e.g. the copy and paste events :-)

[01:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
(which aren't even in the spec yet)

[01:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the iTunes store's new HTML version is a disaster

[01:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: if a TV show has more than ~5 seasons, there's no way to see the list of seasons

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me uses Spotify and iTunes still doesn't carry movies or tv shows in my territory

[01:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
all the names are cropped so you can only see the first few words

[01:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is a disaster when you searched for something that matches many things which all differ only in the last part of hte name

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. "The Phantom of the Op..." where the full names are "The Phantom of the Opera (Broadway Cast)", "(London Cast)", "(Movie Soundtrack)", "(Karaoke)", etc

[01:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
the list of problems just goes on and on

[01:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the iTunes store has always been big on ellipsizing things

[01:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't like it

[01:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
especially the fact that often there is no way to get the full name but hover

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and a lot of things don't even show the expanded version on hover :-/

[01:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hmm, when I search for LOST I can see the full list of 6 seasons

[01:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: search for SG-1

[01:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: oh, i mean from the view of one of the episodes, btw, not from the search results

[01:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if I click "See All" from the search results I can see all 10 seasons, though in strangely random order

[01:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
look in the "More Seasons" part of http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=183133645&s=143441

[01:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's no season 1

[01:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that is indeed odd

[01:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've run into that a lot

[01:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. with Top Gear in the UK store

[01:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
(14 seasons)

[01:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
all the pages lack a Season 1 link except for Season 1 itself, which lacks a Season 2 link

[01:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I could file a bug

[01:43:00.0000] <annevk>
we should update the <title> for HTML5 revision tracker as well

[01:45:00.0000] <annevk>
lol

[01:45:01.0000] <annevk>
first please split out MIMESNIFF from HTML5

[01:46:00.0000] <annevk>
then, if MIMESNIFF actually gets through as a draft add a reference...

[01:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[01:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm getting weird hits from "Microsoft Office Existence Discovery"

[01:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
hits to my delayed-file script with delay values in the eons

[01:50:00.0000] <annevk>
web-apps-tracker is suddenly returning 500s?

[01:51:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, I guess it's something with svn.whatwg.org again

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah this "Microsoft Office Existence Discovery" is screwing me

[02:00:00.0000] <meledin>
... you had me at "Microsoft Office"...

[02:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok i added another 20 servers

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk>
what do you mean?

[02:01:01.0000] <annevk>
surely you don't get that much traffic

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
meanwhile it turns out that min-width works different yet again

[02:02:01.0000] <annevk>
I think I'll do a mix of WebKit and Gecko

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk>
WebKit quite often simply returns the computed value whereas Gecko does something more complicated

[02:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: 20 apache processes, i mean

[02:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: though given that i host 60 or so domains and subdomains, including acid3.acidtests.org, hixie.ch/tests, and whatwg.org, i do get enough traffic that i care about apache's settings

[02:10:00.0000] <annevk>
those prolly get lots of traffic

[02:10:01.0000] <annevk>
I have around 30 or so but still on a shared hosting account and no problems :)

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk>
+1 to berjon

[02:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I've gotten so used to +1 messages that I was about to ask what you were agreeing with

[02:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
btw it seems like +1 is relatively out of fashion on public-html now

[02:16:02.0000] <annevk>
when I don't make sense, it's usually a reference to whatever just arrived in my inbox :)

[02:17:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm hoping to popularize it on #whatwg

[02:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
+1 is the ultimate expression of aiming for consensus over strength of arguments

[02:18:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe more like majority strong-arming

[02:18:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
+1, down with consensus

[02:18:02.0000] <annevk>
+0

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: re what you said above, i push about 600 to 700 GB per month on my dreamhost account

[02:19:01.0000] <annevk>
ah, let me check

[02:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
(you can find the number under Status > Bandwidth Usage)

[02:19:03.0000] <virtuelv>
/me still wonders whan anne agreed with Robin on

[02:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
/me too

[02:19:05.0000] <Hixie>
most of which is whatwg.org

[02:20:00.0000] <annevk>
not surprising actually with 5MiB drafts :p

[02:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
i push about 4 times more traffic out of svn.whatwg.org than on acid3.acidtests.org! :-/

[02:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
acid3 is yesterday's news

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk>
dreamhost estimates close to a 100 with about 90% used by html5.org and 7% by annevankesteren.nl

[02:22:00.0000] <annevk>
philip and simon.html5.org take most of what remains

[02:22:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
is simon.html5.org mostly html5-elements?

[02:23:00.0000] <annevk>
no

[02:23:01.0000] <annevk>
 /test/

[02:23:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
oh

[02:23:03.0000] <annevk>
stuff in the root directory is only 2.27%

[02:24:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
maybe someone's using the tests in regression testing

[02:24:01.0000] <annevk>
 /specs/web-dom-core is the most popular file

[02:24:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
oooh

[02:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
But that's an out of date version of that spec!

[02:24:04.0000] <gsnedders>
My copy is newer!

[02:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, this whole thread about widgets being moved to another wg is giving more mail about widgets than i've seen in months

[02:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
a new WG or an existing WG?

[02:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hasn't read Process email lately

[02:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't care really so long as i don't have to read about it

[02:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#parsing-xhtml-documents

[02:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
paragraphs 3 up to the note

[02:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
what do you think

[02:38:00.0000] <annevk>
/me fetches

[02:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
you put a normative data: URL in the spec?

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk>
didn't we define a public identifier for XSLT?

[02:39:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, that's only in <canvas> afaik

[02:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the data: URL with a content type that Firefox doesn't handle natively is very annoying

[02:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: file a bug on firefox?

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i considered putting it inline but that seems like a lot of spam for not much use

[02:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
given that about 12 people are ever going to have to read that

[02:41:02.0000] <annevk>
where is it?

[02:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
for some reason I am amused to see a normative requirement in an href

[02:41:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I believe implementing that spec text would regress performance in Firefox without non-trivial work

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: other than that, it seems rather sensible

[02:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: you mean due to actually loading the data: URL?

[02:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me hopes hsivonen is going to explain what he did wrong so he can fix it :-)

[02:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
couldn't Firefox do basically what it does now and be as-if equivalent?

[02:42:04.0000] <annevk>
oooh

[02:42:05.0000] <annevk>
the browser jumped to the wrong section

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I mean that if -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN maps to a larger DTD than now, actually tokenizing it *every time* is going to regress perf

[02:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh it's the size that's the problem

[02:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AFAIK, Gecko doesn't have an expat backdoor for populating the entity table without loading sometihng

[02:43:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[02:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
i could limit it to the xhtml11 entities

[02:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
but then mathml gets screwed

[02:43:06.0000] <othermaciej>
in WebKit we we just do entity substitution in code like we do now

[02:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you need to map the MathML doctypes to the larger DTD

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh man

[02:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
gotta run to lunch

[02:44:03.0000] <annevk>
that sucks

[02:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's far more complexity than i'd like to do

[02:44:05.0000] <annevk>
change XML now!

[02:44:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I can't say right now how feasible it would be to make expat not really parse the DTD

[02:44:07.0000] <annevk>
mail your guy in congress

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't see why it's ok to screw mathml pages but not xhtml pages

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: if it's a perf hit for the 5 xhtml pages, why isn't it a perf hit for the 3 mathml pages?

[02:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: sure, it's a hit. I talkeed about *regression* compared to current hit

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, i see

[02:46:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
should QUOT be there?

[02:46:02.0000] <annevk>
why are word-spacing and letter-spacing different?

[02:46:03.0000] <annevk>
it makes no sense

[02:46:04.0000] <annevk>
no sense

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: webkit just uses the same table as text/html

[02:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: which seemed like the most obvious strategy

[02:48:00.0000] <annevk>
change XML now!

[02:49:00.0000] <annevk>
i think i'll treat this as a bug with CSS 2.1

[02:49:01.0000] <annevk>
meh

[02:49:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: does webkit support mathml entities?

[02:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
not currently

[02:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
we don't yet

[02:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it would not be a perf hit to do so

[02:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
then again, they also don't support mathml

[02:50:04.0000] <othermaciej>
though it could b a small memory hit

[02:50:05.0000] <othermaciej>
we actually do support some mathml now

[02:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
oh?

[02:50:07.0000] <othermaciej>
(actually I'm not sure if that's enabled by default but it is in the tree)

[02:50:08.0000] <othermaciej>
(still incomplete)

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
neat

[02:51:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
opera uses a different set of entities for html, xhtml and xhtml+mathml, i think

[02:51:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
like firefox

[02:52:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
xhtml+mathml documents are heavier to load than xhtml documents

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
sounds like a bug firefox and opera should fix

[02:53:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
sure, but it's not top priority to tweak performance for 5 documents on the web

[02:53:02.0000] <asmodai>
Heh, I saw that too 

[02:54:00.0000] <asmodai>
When I load my HTML5 document with MathML with html5 enabled is loads quite a bit slower than disabled.

[02:58:00.0000] <asmodai>
But can be that nightlies are much better in that aspect

[03:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
actually, the throughput situation with the html5 parser on trunk is quite distressing

[03:10:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Still a noticeable delay before rendering?

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: I haven't paid attention to that aspect. We don't measure it...

[03:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
we do measure full system throughput

[03:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and the HTML5 parser is doing badly

[03:30:03.0000] <hsivonen>
even though it has nice qualities like responsiveness

[03:50:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Once it's rendered it responds well, yes. :)

[03:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
finally getting browser implementation support for box-shadow and border-radius is just about that best thing that's happened to the platform in the last N years

[03:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: are nightlies unresponsive for you during parsing?

[04:13:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Would need to check with a nightly. Can it safely be installed next to 3.6 without fear of screwing up my profile? :)

[04:13:01.0000] <asmodai>
MikeSmith: It's used quite a lot for web 2.0 designs yea

[04:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
asmodai: it certainly makes it much more easy to create Web content with some of the same visual-information conventions that are typical in printed content and other visually rich media

[04:17:00.0000] <asmodai>
Absolutely.

[04:17:01.0000] <asmodai>
For me the MathML stuff is one of the more important things.

[04:18:00.0000] <asmodai>
Especially now that I am back working for a university.

[04:18:01.0000] <annevk>
seems I was right about posting to public-html about html5-diff

[04:18:02.0000] <annevk>
I was hoping for something a little more exciting though

[04:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think we have plenty of excitement already

[04:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
(implied scare quotes)

[04:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
asmodai: I realize that MathML is important for a lot of use cases, but I not sure it'd rank so high in the list of priorities for most Web developers/designers

[04:19:03.0000] <asmodai>
MikeSmith: Unfortunately not, no. :(

[04:20:00.0000] <asmodai>
But I love how I finally can read formulae without any shitty on the fly TeX rendering in pixelated font and such things.

[04:20:01.0000] <asmodai>
/me hides his typography interests

[04:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I think most decent designers have high interest in typography.. it's just that their expectations are so low in regard to typography on the Web that they are just happy for any small gains at all

[04:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but not sure how typography improvements in general should rank compared to, say, having a standard way (that doesn't rely on JS libraries or direct low-level JS coding) event-based way show/hide parts or page (by clicking or whatever)

[04:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: that could be so totally doable with my old <button type=toggle> idea

[04:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: all you'd have to do is make visibility of the children (which don't necessarily need to be visually inside it) depend on the checked state

[04:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and with CSS transitions, you could even have nice animations on the hiding and showing if you cared to

[04:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
having support for decent transition effect for it'd be important, but just having that base mechanism would be huge

[04:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I hope we can collectively find a way to make that happen sooner rather than later

[04:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it is possible to do it with very little scripting

[04:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
just add/remove the hidden attribute, or toggle a class

[04:33:00.0000] <asmodai>
MikeSmith: Oh sure, just that there's so many areas that can use improvements. And we all place emphasis on different parts. :)

[04:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: yeah, but the scripting part is the issue.. doesn't matter so much if it's very little or very lot

[04:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for one thing, due to case of many people running with JS off by default

[04:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: why is it an issue? are people reluctant to do anything that involves even minimal scripting?

[04:34:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
users

[04:34:04.0000] <othermaciej>
cause fancy CSS is often harder than simple scripting

[04:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
users browsing without JS

[04:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and in principle, core default UI behavior should not rely on JS

[04:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and for users running without JS, the default UI behavior should be degraded as little as possible

[04:36:01.0000] <asmodai>
It's funny how CSS sometimes really stops me from expressing the layout I have in my mind. Spend more time fixing inconsistencies between browsers than I do on design. :(

[04:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
key case I mean is when you want to have parts of the UI hidden by default

[04:36:03.0000] <othermaciej>
browsing without JS is pretty crippling nowadays

[04:36:04.0000] <othermaciej>
no longer a realistic option

[04:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: true, but a lot of people still seem to do it

[04:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
NoScript is surprisingly high in the list of Firefox extensions

[04:37:02.0000] <asmodai>
Mmm, but isn't HTML as it is now stateless and only via JS do we add state?

[04:38:00.0000] <asmodai>
Adding such an event system to HTML separate from JS would change the system pretty radically then.

[04:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML is not stateless

[04:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the DOM is a big pile of state

[04:42:00.0000] <asmodai>
othermaciej: Oh wait, due to DOM level 2 and the DOM events?

[04:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
HTML has all kinds of state

[04:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's HTTP that's (mostly) stateless

[04:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the document tree itself is state

[04:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but there are also smaller clusters of state such as form controls which mutate happily with no need for scripting

[04:44:01.0000] <virtuelv>
disabled

[04:44:02.0000] <virtuelv>
selected

[04:44:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
<video controls>

[04:44:04.0000] <othermaciej>
CSS is also aware of which element has your mouse in it and whether you are currently clicking on something

[04:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(:hove / :active)

[04:45:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
and what has focus

[04:46:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
and if the email address you just typed in is valid or not

[04:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
contentEditable also allows all sorts of mutations of the document tree itself to occur without the need for scripting

[04:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the current selection is also state

[04:48:00.0000] <asmodai>
Hixie: Yeah, my bad. I never really had to delve deep into the tech background of HTML itself. Guess I've been lucky to just brute force my way through the incidental web development stuff.

[04:49:00.0000] <asmodai>
/me is catching up quickly.

[05:21:00.0000] <boblet>
anyone here made uF hCards with a bilingual name? I’m wondering how to mark it up…

[07:05:00.0000] <asmodai>
Mmm, nice opera 10.50 results on JavaScript performance.

[07:05:01.0000] <asmodai>
http://my.opera.com/chooseopera/blog/a-new-era-of-browser-speed

[07:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wish people did 32-bit and 64-bit versions of benchmark results

[07:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
particularly since it's possible it'd show up JIT weaknesses

[07:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and in some tests I've got hugely different results for the same browser with different bittiness)

[07:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
asmodai, comparing pre-release Opera to released competitors?  Lame.

[07:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Some browsers (Chrome especially) seems to vary massively between Intel and AMD CPUs for some reason

[07:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chrome 5 edges out Opera 10.50 in Peacekeeper's tallies, I think.

[07:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Depends on hardware

[07:10:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably.

[07:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
SunSpider we are almost always quickest on

[07:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://service.futuremark.com/peacekeeper/browserStatistics.action

[07:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That shows Chrome 4 as being faster than Opera 10.50 across the board, although the difference does depend on CPU model.

[07:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders why there are no results for AMD on us

[07:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, Chrome beats Opera on the V8 benchmark.  :P  (But not by much . . .)

[07:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And only in one test

[07:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's still lame to compare Opera 10.50 to Chrome 4 and Firefox 3.6 instead of Chrome 5 and Minefield.

[07:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, I wonder why Safari's not there?

[07:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
We're quicker than Safari

[07:15:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You're quicker than IE too, but that's present.  :P

[07:15:04.0000] <gsnedders>
We should've included IE9 too :P

[07:16:00.0000] <annevk>
we should've left out IE

[07:16:01.0000] <annevk>
it's not interesting

[07:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Performance comparisons published by browser vendors are rarely very interesting.  The result is predictable in advance: our browser is best!

[07:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(for some carefully-selected meaning of "best")

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
The exception is when Microsoft publishes performance comparisons

[07:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
where the result is "we're far less pathetic than our previous release, and we're catching up with everyone else"

[07:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, that's why they don't publish those so often.  :P

[07:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although I think their last one was remarkably fair, it actually benchmarked against nightlies and everything.

[07:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is a much more important result than whether some browser is 20% faster than another on some artificial benchmarks

[07:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But everyone knows IE sucks, so people just care about IE getting better :P

[07:22:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me was amazed they got permission to publish that at all, actually

[07:22:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Arguably the important result is "how fast are you in practice on some site that users care about"

[07:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Raw JS performance isn't a big deal to me so much as responsiveness.  Firefox may be competitive in raw JS scores, but a lot of UI actions just seem a lot more laggy than, e.g., Chrome.

[07:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
(so saying "we're less lame than our previous release doesn't mean much if you still can't make canvas-based games run at an acceptable framerate, for example)

[07:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yeah, speed improvements do enable more apps.

[07:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
They also allow viewing the HTML5 complete spec.  :P

[07:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although even on Chrome that's slow enough that I usually use the multipage version.

[07:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
js-improvements mean nothing there

[07:24:04.0000] <jgraham>
That's mostly layout and DOM dominated

[07:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, it's a question of how often you reflow in large part

[07:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
I thought it was a question of whether you implemented CSS properly or not, too

[07:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
:how often you reflow" -> layout

[07:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Personally, as a user, I'd prefer a slightly buggy CSS implementation that's significantly faster.

[07:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although it's annoying as a web developer.

[07:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've found some very weird WebKit rendering bugs.

[07:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
I was under the (possibly mistaken) impression that gecko had problems because the status annotation script triggered an n^2 algorithm due to their particular DOM implementation

[07:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've found some Gecko rendering bugs, but they seem to be less weird.  :)

[07:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, I think it was something like that.

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought there was also something about dynamic updates to selectors, which WebKit just ignores and gives incorrect results for

[07:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't remember whether WebKit fixed the CSS bug that breaks the index page for his canvas tests

[07:37:00.0000] <asmodai>
The only thing I find interesting in all those benchmarks is how IE is so abyssmally slow

[07:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it really hard to e.g. set up some kind of capture/replay proxy and browse Gmail a bit and then do a replay with automated user actions and time it, rather than doing everything with artificial benchmarks?

[07:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Yes

[07:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why?

[07:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Because setting up automated user actions is hard, because sharing such a setup is hard

[07:41:00.0000] <meledin>
Sounds like something you could use Selenium to do. Don't know whether or not that does a performance penalty significant in the context.

[07:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Surely if you have a good test suite it will involve automated user actions, like Mozilla's mochitests.

[07:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Selenium doesn't seem relevant -- it doesn't involve an actual browser, does it?

[07:41:03.0000] <meledin>
It does

[07:41:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, not an arbitrary one.

[07:41:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me will have to reread that

[07:42:00.0000] <meledin>
Firefox, Safari, Chrome. IE should be possible too but I lack the necessary windows

[07:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[07:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
Right, but there's no cross browser way to do that. And you don't know what effect the automator has to the performance

[07:42:03.0000] <jgraham>
s/to/on/

[07:42:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you don't need a cross-browser way to do it if your goal is to improve real-world performance rather than show off how much awesomer your browser is than anyone else's.

[07:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Automator probably isn't going to make a huge difference to performance, but if it does, still a heck of a lot better than a synthetic benchmark.

[07:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The question is what is slow enough to have a noticable effect on perf?

[07:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Real-world input is the only logical thing to test for any program, IMO.  I'm suspicious of unit tests, too.

[07:44:00.0000] <meledin>
To me the question is what performance is fast enough to not have a noticeable effect on user experience.

[07:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: It depends how it is implemented. e.g. in Opera using the debugging interfaces disables JIT. So anything that uses the debugger is useless for performance testing

[07:44:02.0000] <meledin>
If you improve page load on google.com by 1000% (but it originally loaded in 0.02 seconds) you've done a hell of a job for no reason.

[07:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah.

[07:44:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Gmail loading initially is, but what about once it is loaded? Does any of that matter?

[07:44:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me loads Gmail about once every two days

[07:44:06.0000] <Philip`>
so I really don't care about that

[07:44:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Me too.

[07:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I suspect most Gmail slowness is server-side, though.

[07:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like when it takes multiple seconds to load the next e-mail, WTF is up with that.

[07:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
(I think the same is true in other browsers e.g. Firebug disables JIT in tracemonkey)

[07:45:03.0000] <Philip`>
You don't want to make the browser *just* fast enough to make users happy with all current sites

[07:45:04.0000] <Philip`>
You want it to be fast enough that developers can make new fancier sites, without being significantly restricted by performance

[07:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
(assuming the idea is to improve the web, which benefits everybody, rather than merely to compete against all current browsers on the current web)

[07:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, mochitests don't use Firebug, though.  It's using the regular JS engine AFAIK.

[07:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It basically just runs a webpage that has some elevated privileges, so it can synthesize user input and such.

[07:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Right, my point was just that disabiling optimisations in certain situations was common

[07:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Clearly.

[07:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me suggests not designing systems to be untestable

[07:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
That'd make everything so much easier

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
"thankfully we've got Jean-Baptiste Clamence who has collected some of them [statements]" - indeed, he has done sterling work as an unbiased archiver helping people stay well-informed on WHATWG matters

[08:19:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah signal/noise on public-html ftw

[08:19:01.0000] <annevk>
not

[08:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: where's that a quote from?

[08:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. public-html

[08:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.w3.org/mid/AAF736D7957145618141DAF4979730AB@kmPC

[08:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
"whoa. public-html" is a surprisingly common reaction to public-html

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22whoa.+public-html%22

[08:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I think that's technically untrue

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers http://www.flickr.com/photos/hober/4256801493/

[08:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That image is about as productive as Last Week in HTML5.

[08:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I.e., extremely unproductive.

[08:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Less long-winded, though

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does anyone else see flashing bold text in #html-wg?

[09:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if it's just his IRC client getting confused

[09:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
No, it's not

[09:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, it's not flashing here. But I have that turned off in my IRC client :)

[09:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But the bold bit too

[09:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
s/too/I do/

[09:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Odd mistake

[09:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
how do you get flashing text in IRC?

[09:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Control characters

[09:13:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: On a totally unrelated note, I'm hungry.

[09:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
would you like to go get some food?

[09:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes

[09:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Where would you like to go? A restaurant?

[09:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Somewhere quick and close, like a takeaway

[09:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But not too close. those places aren't nice.

[09:15:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(IMHO, YMMV, etc.)

[09:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
I was told that there was a really nice place just down stairs, either in this building or nearby

[09:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's not really nice.

[09:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[09:16:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It's not very nice at all really.

[09:16:04.0000] <gsnedders>
That's one of the places I was excluding.

[09:16:05.0000] <Lachy>
fair enough

[09:16:06.0000] <gsnedders>
And why am I talking to you on IRC and not moving my mouth?

[09:16:07.0000] <Lachy>
because this is clearly faster

[09:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
OBviously

[09:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Though I can't type this quickluy witohut making mistakes

[09:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me looks at his public-html folder

[09:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Aaaaaaaaah

[09:19:00.0000] <annevk>
you won't miss if you delete it all prolly

[09:19:01.0000] <annevk>
lots of Process fodder

[09:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
I looked at it ten minutes ago

[09:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wow, lots of Bugzilla activity.

[09:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
but then there were 32 bug keyword updates

[09:22:00.0000] <Traveler0>
hi.

[09:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hello

[09:23:00.0000] <Traveler0>
I'm using sifr on a web project of mine and everytime I upload the file on the server sometimes the sifr replacement text doesn't load. The page loads everything else except sifr and stops.

[09:23:01.0000] <Traveler0>
Sometimes I refresh it once and it works nicely, sometimes it takes 4-5 times until the text appears. 

[09:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does this have to do with the WHATWG, or . . . ?

[09:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, I don't expect anyone here to know the answer.

[09:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(although maybe I'm wrong)

[09:24:01.0000] <Traveler0>
I know you guys are pretty knowledgeable

[09:24:02.0000] <Traveler0>
Could it be some server problems? 

[09:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Knowledgeable about HTML, not about sIFR :-)

[09:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
sIFR looks like voodoo magic to me.

[09:25:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
We hate Flash here, remember?  :)

[09:25:03.0000] <Traveler0>
Well on my local server it loads fine, I doubt it's because of sIFR :P

[09:26:00.0000] <Traveler0>
I used to hate it too, until I tried the text replacement thingye. It's nice.

[09:26:01.0000] <annevk>
the reason is because Flash is teh evil

[09:26:02.0000] <Traveler0>
The page just looks so nice with the flash text

[09:26:03.0000] <annevk>
@font-face

[09:27:00.0000] <Traveler0>
You can't use font-face for every font

[09:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why not?

[09:27:02.0000] <Traveler0>
It breaks the copyright, even cufon does. 

[09:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
Use fonts that allow you to use them

[09:27:04.0000] <Traveler0>
The number of fonts that allow are very limited.

[09:28:00.0000] <Traveler0>
And not worth it I guess.

[09:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But they let you use sIFR?

[09:28:02.0000] <Traveler0>
+ @font-face isn't a good idea, since browsers render fonts differently and you would have some unpleasant surprises. 

[09:28:03.0000] <Traveler0>
Indeed, sIFR doesn't break copyright.

[09:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It sure does break copyright unless they explicitly let you use it.  Do they have a whitelist of technologies they allow?

[09:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Browsers that support @font-face render it the same way to the best of my knowledge, although some of their implementations have gotchas.

[09:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(modulo platform conventions and such, I guess)

[09:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
They use different font renderers on different platforms

[09:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
which sometimes give very different results for the same font data

[09:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, this is a channel for a standards development group, so saying you want to use a Flash-based solution when a semi-usable standards-based solution is available is unlikely to get you a lot of enthusiastic assistance here.  :)

[09:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(a standards development group that has killing Flash as one of its major goals, for that matter)

[09:33:00.0000] <Traveler0>
I see. Can I ask why do you hate it though?

[09:33:01.0000] <Traveler0>
It makes websites look better, you have to agree on that. 

[09:34:00.0000] <Traveler0>
I'm not very enthusiastic about flash either and I don't particularly like entire flash websites, but I think sifr is ok.

[09:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Flash is a proprietary solution that's locked the web into one program written by one vendor, and forces us all to dance to their tune.  It stifles competition and innovation.  Flash is also notoriously buggy and unstable, to the point that multiple browsers are now putting a lot of work into sandboxing plugins largely so that Flash doesn't cause them to crash so often.

[09:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
For the web to remain healthy, we need standards that can be implemented by many vendors competing against each other, so that we get the best possible implementation and no one is left out.

[09:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Flash doesn't support all platforms either, because Adobe can't be bothered supporting some, and some platforms don't want to depend on Adobe (e.g., iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad).

[09:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML5, when more widely implemented, should supersede Flash in most common use-cases, e.g., videos and simple games.  With any luck, this will reduce Flash market penetration until it eventually becomes unattractive as a development target.

[09:37:00.0000] <Traveler0>
hm

[09:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think killing Flash is a major goal

[09:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
Making Flash unnecessary by providing better solutions to relevant use cases is much more of a goal

[09:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yes.  Same deal, from a slightly less aggressive perspective.

[09:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
Not really

[09:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
Flash could be unnecessary but still very much alive

[09:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
They're distinct states

[09:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But closely related.

[09:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, I was using "kill" in a broad sense.

[09:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe

[09:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not like "Adobe stops developing it".

[09:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
More like "we can all safely ignore it".

[09:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think you were using "Flash" in a monolithic sense

[09:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
What does that mean?

[09:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
which isn't necessarily the best sense, e.g. <video> is useful because it makes Flash unnecessary for a subset of use cases, even though it does nothing for many other use cases that Flash satisfies

[09:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
I mean you seemed to mean you wanted to kill Flash in the sense of making the entire thing disappear / become irrelevant / etc

[09:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
As long as Flash has 98% market penetration, authors will use it, forcing users to install it, in a vicious cycle.  The only way to break out of this and get to standards-land is to sharply reduce Flash's market share, by making it less necessary to users, thereby less useful to authors, etc.

[09:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Loosely speaking, that's "killing" it 

[09:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
.

[09:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Modulo hyperbole.

[09:45:00.0000] <Traveler0>
I guess each one has their opinions on how stuff should work.

[09:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'd be quite happy if 98% of users had Flash installed but only 0.1% of sites relied on it because most were happy with features provided by HTML instead

[09:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/happy/happier/

[09:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then users would stop installing Flash.  It doesn't usually come bundled with the OS, right?

[09:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course someone is always going to use Flash, as long as it exists.

[09:46:02.0000] <Traveler0>
It would suffice if youtube would stop using flash

[09:46:03.0000] <Philip`>
PCs come bundled with hundreds of things

[09:46:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
But the usage would ideally be negligible.

[09:46:05.0000] <Traveler0>
Most of the users with internet connection visit youtube

[09:46:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
YouTube support HTML5 video now, partially.

[09:47:00.0000] <Traveler0>
I've seen their page on html5

[09:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
They support HTML5 for most videos now.

[09:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can opt-in in preferences.

[09:47:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Only if you use Chrome or Safari, though, since it's H.264 only.

[09:47:04.0000] <Philip`>
Doesn't work on any browsers I have installed, as far as I'm aware

[09:47:05.0000] <Traveler0>
FF doesn't support html5 videos?

[09:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
It does, but only Theora

[09:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
not H.264

[09:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
H.264 is a patented video format, which is also evil.  Theora is unpatented.  Firefox supports only Theora, but YouTube currently only provides H.264.  The latter has much bigger market share, it's very widely used.  Theora came onto the scene much later, sadly.

[09:49:01.0000] <Traveler0>
I guess flash will be less important in the near future

[09:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
Theora is patented

[09:49:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nitpicker.

[09:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
You're just wrong :-p

[09:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's patented but all patents are irrevocably released to the general public royalty-free.

[09:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So s/patented/patent-encumbered/g if you want.

[09:50:03.0000] <Philip`>
All widely-known patents

[09:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Did anyone find the thing which actually said the patents were free for use in the contexts where Theora is now used?

[09:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The last I remember, it was kind of specific to a particular Theora implementation, or something along those lines)

[09:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Theora came onto the scene much later" - how are you interpreting coming onto the scene?

[09:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
Apparently standardisation of the first version of H.264 was completed in 2003

[09:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
and Theora was started in 2002 (based on a codec from 2000) and the format frozen in 2004

[09:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
so they're mostly contemporaneous

[09:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, or H.264 was marketed better, or whatever.  It's dominant, Theora isn't, for whatever reason.

[09:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Network effects, etc.

[09:58:00.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - my understanding is the H.264 provides higher quality / bytes, that is a technically/experientially superior format.

[09:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, http://people.xiph.org/~greg/video/ytcompare/comparison.html

[09:58:02.0000] <tantek>
that's the reason I have heard from supporters of H.264. I don't have reference.

[09:58:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
The difference isn't that large, apparently.

[09:58:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
H.264 is probably better overall, but not hugely.

[09:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's partly a consequence of encoder implementation

[09:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
Because H.264 is popular, lots of people put lots of effort into implementing it well

[10:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(for lots of different meanings of "well", involving different tradeoffs of quality and size and encoding speed and latency and decoder capabilities etc)

[10:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
whereas it seems Theora has had a not-very-good encoder for most of its life, with recent work on one better encoder, and that's about it

[10:01:00.0000] <tantek>
Thanks for the reference AryehGregor - I will share it.

[10:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also there's been pretty much no point in using Theora, because nobody wanted to widely distribute video-playback code in open source software where they couldn't simply ignore licensing concerns

[10:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
until <video> came along

[10:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, it's not just about browser vendors.  Wikimedia has been using Theora since before any browser supported it.

[10:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has almost never actually seen a video on Wikipedia

[10:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and I've definitely never attempted to actually watch one)

[10:14:01.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - is there a query you can do to tell how many Theora videos are posted on Wikimedia?

[10:14:02.0000] <tantek>
(would be a useful stat to have)

[10:14:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, one sec.

[10:14:04.0000] <tantek>
(as well as growth over time)

[10:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Growth over time is less trivial, obviously, since it would require a bunch of queries at best.

[10:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do a single query for the last-modified dates of each file and draw a cumulative graph?

[10:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Weird, lots of stuff with application/ogg MIME type.

[10:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and assume they won't get overwritten enough to care about)

[10:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe because it doesn't know whether it's audio or video?

[10:17:03.0000] <Philip`>
How does it decide how to render the file?

[10:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
No idea.

[10:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe it does know, but it isn't stored in the database.

[10:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me waits for SELECT COUNT(*) FROM image WHERE img_minor_mime = 'ogg'; to complete . . . table scan, yay

[10:19:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
well, if wikipedia crashes, we'll know who to blame

[10:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is on the toolserver, not Wikipedia.

[10:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So it's a replica running on separate servers.

[10:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Toolserver access is open to anyone, it's just read-only and most private stuff is removed.

[10:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I happen to be a toolserver root, so I can see the private stuff, but I still can't change anything on the servers that actually run Wikipedia.

[10:21:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
i was joking, but that's interesting

[10:21:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I figured you were joking, but I also figured it would be interesting.  :)

[10:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
One day I'll probably get shell access to the Wikimedia cluster, which means root DB access too, since the root database passwords are on NFS.  But I don't have it now, I only have commit access.

[10:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmph, I was going to try to trick you into running DELETE FROM image but it sounds like that won't achieve anything very exciting :-(

[10:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not even running from my root account right now, so on my current MySQL shell that wouldn't even affect the toolserver.

[10:24:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
another editor would just come along 90 seconds later and revert the change anyway

[10:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
Good point, they'd just run "UNDELETE FROM image" and it'd be back to normal

[10:25:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
/me ponders what it would take to get back to writing

[10:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
Extreme boredom?

[10:26:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
no, that doesn't seem to have worked so far

[10:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you figure it out, tell me so I can see if it works for me doing my math homework.

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could pick some arbitrary challenges to make the writing more interesting, like requiring it to be an acrostic

[10:29:00.0000] <wycats>
hey guys

[10:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what books to buy

[10:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
All of them

[10:30:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
that's funny, because at one point i was trying to get the first letter of each chapter of "Dive Into Python 3" to be in alphabetical order

[10:30:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
but i kept rearranging chapters and finally i gave up

[10:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me waits for mpilgrim to suggest Dive into HTML 5

[10:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
Like the CSS2 appendices?

[10:31:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
that is awesome, i never noticed that before

[10:32:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
now i must top it

[10:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me likes the title of App. E.

[10:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hahaha.

[10:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Who did that?

[10:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I never noticed, although I always thought Appendix E was named a bit oddly.

[10:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, just don't try alphabetic acrostics in English if you have 24 chapters or more.

[10:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, me too

[10:36:00.0000] <tantek>
/me is glad someone finally noticed the CSS2 appendices. Courtesy of the CSS working group - many many years ago (including myself and Hixie).

[10:36:01.0000] <tantek>
2.1 that is

[10:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
("The Neverending Story" did that, but it's a novel, so it just had to introduce a character named Xayide.)

[10:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
tantek: Who's idea was it originally?

[10:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(if you can remember)

[10:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
In Hebrew the only problem letter is the sixth, ו.  Practically no legitimate word starts with it, but it can be used as a prefix meaning "and", so everyone just does that.

[10:37:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me didn't notice it, it was mentioned in this channel some time ago

[10:37:04.0000] <tantek>
Hixie and I got kind of obsessive about it and brainstormed ways to retitle the appendices to make it work.

[10:37:05.0000] <tantek>
(as well as re-ordering)

[10:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes that sounds like tantek and Hixie :)

[10:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Hebrew has less problems here because it uses an alphabet designed for it, as opposed to English that uses an alphabet that went like Phoenician -> Greek -> Etruscan -> Latin -> Norman -> English or something.)

[10:38:02.0000] <tantek>
now, can you find the missing-from-the-TOC Appendix H? ;)

[10:38:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I'm totally unsurprised that it was you two.

[10:38:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hahaha, that's awesome.

[10:38:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, H is missing, I didn't notice that either.

[10:39:00.0000] <tantek>
*apparently* ;)

[10:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I noticed that

[10:39:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/leftblank.html

[10:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hahaha.

[10:39:04.0000] <gsnedders>
tantek: That's somewhat desperation, though, I presume?

[10:39:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, where did you find that?

[10:39:06.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: App G, press next

[10:39:07.0000] <tantek>
gsnedders - nah, more like an excuse for a minor easter egg

[10:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: gsnedders got it.

[10:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If I buy one book beyond what I already intend on buying, what should it be?

[10:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Memoirs from an Antproof Case

[10:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://www.amazon.com/Memoir-Antproof-Case-Mark-Helprin/dp/0380727331

[10:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
One of your MySQL queries on this host has been running for 639 seconds,

[10:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
which is higher than the warning threshold, 600 seconds.  This may indicate

[10:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
that the query is faulty, and should be optimised.

[10:42:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The query (id 1995461) was: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM image WHERE img_minor_mime = 'ogg'

[10:42:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me sigh

[10:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, doing EXPLAIN says 8529900, and that's probably right to within an order of magnitude.  Is that good enough?  :)

[10:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, no.

[10:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
No :-)

[10:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's just number of rows examined.

[10:43:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not number returned.

[10:43:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's a table scan, so that's all files.

[10:43:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does MySQL have a way to do random samples?

[10:44:01.0000] <tantek>
The first time Hixie and I collaborating on a deliberate and meaningful alphabetized sequential ordering was actually for the CSS Test Suite Documentation - but it may have been too subtle. 

[10:44:02.0000] <tantek>
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/testsuitedocumentation.html#atomictests

[10:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
like can you do an ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 100000 efficiently, or something?

[10:44:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, not in a way that would be useful here.

[10:44:05.0000] <Philip`>
and then count what proportion of those are ogg

[10:45:00.0000] <tantek>
hint: the first 3 in the sequence are atomic, basic, composite

[10:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The answer is 112197.

[10:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Took 27 min 0.41 sec to run.

[10:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders who all these people are following him on Google Buzz who he doesn't recognize

[10:47:02.0000] <tantek>
thanks AyrehGregor - just to be sure those are all video right? or does that include Ogg Audio-only?

[10:47:03.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - they are people who have sent you email.

[10:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, it includes audio, actually.  Not sure how to tell them apart from the database.

[10:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Does it auto-populate from your email contacts?

[10:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, tantek, they have to explicitly choose to follow me.

[10:48:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It might suggest me based on e-mail patterns.

[10:48:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me turned Buzz off as soon as he saw the button to turn it off

[10:48:05.0000] <Philip`>
so I don't really know what it is

[10:48:06.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor, followers/followings were auto-populated when Buzz was launched

[10:48:07.0000] <tantek>
seeded from apparent email sending patterns

[10:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, right, I think I explicitly un-followed someone.

[10:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to efficiently do a random sample in mysql.  All methods that I'm aware of are bad.

[10:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you only want one random row at a time, you can make an extra column containing a random number.

[10:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then select the first row whose random value is bigger than a randomly-chosen value you just picked.

[10:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But that doesn't work if you want a random sample bigger than one, because the order won't be random; all of the results will be predictable from the first one.

[10:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could just repeatedly query and filter out duplicates on the application side, though, I guess.

[10:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(this is how "Random page" on Wikipedia works)

[10:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
This is just a one-off random sample, it doesn't need to be a different random order multiple times

[10:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, but it requires adding, populating, and indexing a new column, so it's not very helpful for one-off stuff.

[10:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess I could have done the query on the page table using page_random and filtered out non-image pages.

[10:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although not every image corresponds to an image page, nor conversely.

[10:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I guess every image probably has an image page.

[10:56:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dunno about the converse.

[10:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, MySQL says it does explicitly support ORDER BY RAND()

[11:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
so can't you do "select count(*) from (select * from image order by rand() limit 100000) where img_minor_mime = 'ogg'" to count within a random sample?

[11:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes.

[11:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
and then multiple by the total number of rows to get an accurate estimate of the number of oggs

[11:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
*multiply

[11:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then it will dump the entire contents of the table into a temporary table, generate a random number for each row, sort according to the random number, drop all but the first 100000 rows, and run the query on what's left.

[11:01:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
You did ask for "efficiently", right?

[11:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Surely it'll just extract the list of row IDs and pick randomly from them?

[11:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
It doesn't need to copy any other data from the table

[11:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
|  1 | SIMPLE      | image | ALL  | NULL          | NULL | NULL    | NULL | 8529989 | Using temporary; Using filesort | 

[11:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, but it will still hit every row of the table.

[11:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The filesort might only use the row ID and the random number in the actual sorting phase, you're right.

[11:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
The IDs would be in an index so that should be fast

[11:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
and then it would only need to load the rows that are in the sample, to check their mimes

[11:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is InnoDB, so the table is a B-tree with the IDs as keys, they're not in a separate table.

[11:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't know enough about MySQL's query optimiser or EXPLAIN output

[11:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, MySQL is stupid about optimizing subqueries, it will probably execute the subquery naively here.

[11:05:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Is <nav role="navigation"> redundant for screen-readers? Would the nav element on its own be okay?

[11:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has only ever looked at query optimisation in PostgreSQL, and then in not much detail

[11:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You told it to retrieve *, so it will probably do that.  Since it's using filesort, it can't do it before limiting, it will filter after.

[11:06:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So it will hit all rows either way.

[11:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
JonathanNeal, I assume so.  It would be kind of ridiculous, otherwise.

[11:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
I thought a fundamental point of SQL was that it's based on relational algebra so there's valid ways to reorganise and optimise queries, and it doesn't just blindly do what you type in

[11:07:02.0000] <paul_irish>
AryehGregor: indeed though would the browsers need to "support" the nav element? which, of course, many do not right now

[11:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
(like it knows project(select(...)) is equivalent to select(project(...)) (but faster) etc depending on what columns you use)

[11:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, yes, but that assumes the DBMS is smart enough.  It's like saying the compiler is allowed to do global optimization in C, so why doesn't gcc figure out that this lengthy computation involving lots of void pointers is actually unused and not compile it?!

[11:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"project"?

[11:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
paul_irish, I don't know, sorry.  Accessibility isn't my forte.

[11:09:02.0000] <paul_irish>
no worries. :) thx

[11:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
"project" is when you extract out particularly columns from a table

[11:09:04.0000] <Philip`>
(vs "select" which is extracting rows)

[11:09:05.0000] <Philip`>
s/particularly/particular/

[11:09:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Never heard of it.  Pretty sure MySQL doesn't support it.

[11:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's what "select foo, bar from baz" is doing

[11:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you say so.

[11:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me realized only now why appendix H of CSS2 has been intentionally left blank

[11:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmm, I think I should say "restrict" instead of "select" when talking about algebras)

[11:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra

[11:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, it's kind of funny.  I'm a Ph.D. student in mathematics, and do tons of programming-related stuff in my spare time, but I'm not really interested in the mathematical formalism of anything related to computers.

[11:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
The relational model is why RDBMSs have the R in them :-)

[11:14:01.0000] <workmad3>
AryehGregor: most of it is kinda dull and not very complicated admittedly :)

[11:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I'm aware there's all this math behind it, but that doesn't seem useful.

[11:14:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
workmad3, that's what I've observed.

[11:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's useful because it means query optimisers can work and do clever things

[11:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm taking a course in cryptography this semester, which is somewhat interesting, but the math part seems superficial.

[11:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
and, in practice, they do so

[11:15:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, not MySQL's!  :D

[11:15:04.0000] <workmad3>
some of the more advanced language formalisms are a bit more complicated, but not compared to actual maths

[11:15:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't believe MySQL is *that* rubbish :-p

[11:15:06.0000] <workmad3>
(as in theory of languages formalisms)

[11:15:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, it does have an optimizer, just a pretty stupid one.

[11:15:08.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: MySQL is pretty rubbish in terms of RDBMS systems

[11:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It has some fairly nice features, but the quality of its query optimizer isn't among them.

[11:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me liked looking at Postgres's query output where it shows it generating bitsets and hash tables and everything

[11:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Subqueries are nontrivial views are more or less unusable on large sites, you're playing with fire if you touch those.

[11:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Subqueries *or* nontrivial views are more or less unusable on large sites, you're playing with fire if you touch those.

[11:16:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
(at least in my experience)

[11:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's too much risk it will just execute them naively.

[11:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's gotten better in more recent versions, I guess, but I still don't trust it.  :)

[11:17:02.0000] <workmad3>
MySQL isn't very good for most of the features that are pretty damn great in other RDBMS systems

[11:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Joins are where it's at.  Although sometimes you have to tell it which way to do the join, because it decides to filesort 500,000 rows instead of looking at 10 presorted.

[11:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(which way to do the join, and which index to use)

[11:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've heard it has a relatively nice replication implementation, though.

[11:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
What have the developers been doing for the past five years, if they haven't made basic functionality non-rubbish yet?

[11:19:01.0000] <workmad3>
I've not heard of anyone managing a decent materialised view system on MySQL

[11:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1 mostly consisted of adding basic functionality like subqueries and views, except so poorly done as to be unusable, as far as I can tell.

[11:20:00.0000] <workmad3>
5.x added unusable stored procedures too ;)

[11:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right.

[11:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And triggers, and so on.

[11:20:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
And partitioning.

[11:20:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess some of these features are usable to some people despite their crippling limitations.

[11:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The more interesting work is scalability improvements.  That's why Wikipedia finally upgraded to MySQL 5.1.  

[11:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It was on 4.0 for ages because all the new features were useless.

[11:21:02.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: my theory is that they've been trying to play catch-up with pg and oracle so they can call themselves a relational db system seriously, so added the features before making them usuable

[11:21:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, that seems to be it.

[11:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've been meaning to learn pgsql, but no one uses it compared to MySQL, so I can't muster much motivation.

[11:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And I know MySQL pretty well, so it would be a waste to just throw that out.

[11:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like the scalability issues would be better addressed by making the relational features work properly

[11:22:03.0000] <workmad3>
AryehGregor: more people than you think use it I reckon... I'm switching to it fully now

[11:22:04.0000] <workmad3>
I think it's more a case of people don't feel they need to advertise that they use it

[11:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
I used it on one site (after using MySQL on quite a few earlier ones) and it seemed pretty straightforward to learn

[11:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, no, it's scalability in stuff like running MySQL on more cores and disks, reducing locking overhead, that sort of thing.  Improvements for basic features like simple selects and joins.

[11:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It turns out you can do pretty much anything with just joins, only it might take a bit more work.

[11:23:03.0000] <Philip`>
There's some minor differences in syntax but nothing that makes it really hard to learn

[11:23:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
workmad3, yeah, but MySQL is *way* more commonly used in web apps.

[11:23:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
If an app supports one DBMS, it's MySQL.

[11:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: It wouldn't have to scale to more cores and disks if it could do efficient subqueries instead of filesorting hundreds of megabytes of data :-)

[11:24:01.0000] <workmad3>
AryehGregor: most mainstream web apps that you'd install support several

[11:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
MediaWiki supports lots of DBMSes, but only MySQL really works fully, since it's what Wikipedia uses and what everyone develops on.

[11:24:03.0000] <workmad3>
/me has mediawiki running with pg

[11:24:04.0000] <workmad3>
not had a problem with it

[11:24:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, you don't have to filesort hundreds of MB of data in practice.  You design your tables to avoid that.

[11:24:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
workmad3, last I checked, not all the maintenance scripts work, and a fair number of extensions don't work.

[11:25:00.0000] <workmad3>
but yeah, mysql is the most common one... annoyingly :(

[11:25:01.0000] <workmad3>
damn their marketing

[11:25:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The toolserver uses pgsql on MW and it's broken more than once because someone did SELECT foo, bar ... GROUP BY foo; or something.

[11:25:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me used PostGIS which seemed pretty handy too

[11:25:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Marketing, meh, more like network effects.

[11:25:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
SQL isn't really standardized.

[11:25:06.0000] <workmad3>
AryehGregor: what do you call the SQL standard then? :P

[11:25:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
If pgsql tried to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL, it would have a much better chance.

[11:25:08.0000] <Philip`>
workmad3: Science fiction :-)

[11:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
workmad3, something that's followed just closely enough that you can write portable-ish SQL if you put some work into it.

[11:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Kind of like C.

[11:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
As opposed to, say, CSS2.1, which has a bunch of implementations that are *really* interoperable -- it's rare to run into show-stopper bugs (outside of a few less well-implemented features like run-ins).

[11:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, show-stopper incompatibilites.

[11:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, also outside of old browsers.

[11:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
s/ilites/ilities/

[11:28:00.0000] <workmad3>
AryehGregor: pg is a lot closer to standard compliant than mysql is... and that's half the problem

[11:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Seems like you need an opportunity to develop a new system from scratch (so there's no MySQL legacy) that you'll run on servers you control (so you don't have to worry about them only having MySQL installed), so you can experiment with technologically better solutions rather than being stuck with MySQL forever

[11:30:00.0000] <workmad3>
pg is really more of a low-end open-source oracle, while MySQL is a jumped up persistence store pretending to be an RDBMS

[11:30:01.0000] <tantek>
Philip` - I wouldn't mind seeing a MediaWiki fork that used a different backend for storage.

[11:31:00.0000] <tantek>
frankly, it would be interesting (and useful IMHO) to see a MediaWiki frontend that used a Git backend.

[11:31:01.0000] <workmad3>
tantek: as I said earlier, I have a (simple) mediawiki install running on pg without problems so far

[11:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
General database design and SQL skills carry over without too much effort, and decent database interface libraries should support multiple DBMSs, so it's straightforward as long as you don't have lots of application code and data to migrate

[11:31:03.0000] <workmad3>
tantek: that sounds crazy enough that it just might work :D

[11:32:00.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: yeah... it's the DB creation more than the DB querying that isn't portable

[11:34:00.0000] <workmad3>
tantek: a git backend may cause problems with people browsing wiki history though... git isn't really designed around having multiple versions of the same data in place at the same time

[11:34:01.0000] <workmad3>
so you could end up with race conditions caused by two people requesting different versions at the same time

[11:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
workmad3: Clearly what it should do is download the Git repository to each user's browser, and use local storage for it

[11:37:01.0000] <tantek>
yes - and thus enable offline wiki editing!

[11:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
There's no point using a DVCS and having everyone use a centralised copy of the repository

[11:37:03.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: that would be... great :D

[11:38:00.0000] <workmad3>
so then... who's working on the js version of git? :D

[11:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
Then there's no race conditions, and you just have to set up a decent merge UI

[11:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
git takes out a global lock for tons of things.  I doubt it's usable if you need concurrency.

[11:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Let alone if you want to do queries that its storage format wasn't designed to support.

[11:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Global locks are fine, if you have lots of small disconnected globes

[11:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, the funny thing is, Google develops most of its software in-house, and could surely use pgsql if it were the better tech.  They typically use Python instead of PHP, for instance.  But they use MySQL.

[11:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The same goes for a couple of other major websites.

[11:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikimedia's DBMS maintains (unless I'm misquoting him) that pgsql doesn't scale as well as MySQL for large MySQL-style web workloads.  So I dunno.

[11:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's an easy mistake to standardise on :-)

[11:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Meanwhile, I just remembered I have a seminar today in less than an hour and a half.

[11:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So . . .

[11:43:03.0000] <asmodai>
Don't confuse incompetency in administering real RDBMSes with ones that aren't. :P

[11:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me supposes that when you really do have a lot of data, and you need to do lots of select-by-ID and update-by-ID on it, it's not actually that important if non-trivial queries are painfully slow, because it's easier to hack around that by writing lots of dumb queries than it is to fix unacceptable select-by-ID performance

[11:50:00.0000] <asmodai>
Philip`: Most MySQL using programmers have little knowledge of proper SQL tuning >_<

[11:50:01.0000] <workmad3>
and big corps that are using MySQL will want/need to defend their use, because changing will cost a fortune

[11:51:00.0000] <workmad3>
although I don't see why they don't say that as a reason instead... 'we aren't changing our database because we have billions of records and migrating to a different system would take months, even after we've designed and implemented it'

[11:53:00.0000] <asmodai>
Heh

[11:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
That would be admitting that their original design decision was a mistake

[11:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also, if they're stuck with MySQL and hate it and then tell everyone that it's the bestest thing ever, their competitors will probably pick it too ("they've got experience and they still say it's good") and won't gain a competitive advantage

[11:56:01.0000] <asmodai>
rofl

[11:56:02.0000] <workmad3>
heh :)

[11:58:00.0000] <workmad3>
still, have to admit I don't know the full issues that a google or wikipedia or facebook would have to solve in scaling their DBMS... but the issues they (may) encounter with something like pg are unlikely to be encountered in most peoples apps

[11:59:00.0000] <workmad3>
and if I ever run into the situation of needing to solve scalability issues in pg... then I'd try and crack on and solve them rather than give in and use a system that is otherwise inferior :)

[12:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
By that time you'd be locked into Postgres even if it was the technically inferior solution :-)

[12:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, finally through all the emails.

[12:30:00.0000] <asmodai>
/me sends TabAtkins more email

[12:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
DAMMIT

[12:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(You're not Sylvain, so this new mail isn't *actually* from you, but still...)

[12:33:00.0000] <asmodai>
:D

[12:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: damns, looks like upgrading to jQuery 1.4 broke my daily journal application in IE. ;_;

[12:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Time to go debugging!

[12:38:00.0000] <carllerche>
Philip`: Hey, i figured out a nice way to draw a shadow without the object 

[12:38:01.0000] <carllerche>
I discovered that compositing only seems to take into consideration the previous fill / store or drawing

[12:39:00.0000] <carllerche>
so, I draw the shape with a shadow, then redraw it with globalCompositeOperation = 'destination-out'

[12:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
carllerche: Hmm, not quite sure what you mean

[12:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
In particular, not quite sure whether that's exploiting a browser bug or not :-)

[12:58:00.0000] <carllerche>
Philip`: hmm.. let me check in a couple

[13:01:00.0000] <carllerche>
hmm.. it does seem to behave different in different browsers :(

[13:01:01.0000] <carllerche>
Philip`: Is there a way to do something like "layers" as in, set globalCompositeOperation that does not effect the background?

[13:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
If it behaves differently in different browsers, you should report bugs in the ones that are wrong :-)

[13:09:00.0000] <carllerche>
I will

[13:09:01.0000] <carllerche>
although, i find that the bugs I hit are usually reported :P

[13:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, fair enough :-)

[13:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
There isn't really anything like layers (unless you make independent overlapping <canvas>s) - when you draw a shape, it just constructs the shadow bitmap and composites that onto the canvas, then composites the drawn shape bitmap onto the canvas, and you can't access the intermediate bitmaps or change the compositing mode between those steps

[13:24:00.0000] <carllerche>
hmmm


2010-02-12
[19:26:00.0000] <Giacomo->
morning

[19:27:00.0000] <Giacomo->
I was looking at a website's source after the owner said that it's using html5 and noticed a lot of tags inside an <article> tag. Lik <header> div's some p's and footer. Is that a correct use of the tag?

[19:27:01.0000] <Giacomo->
Website is http://ryanmerrill.net/

[19:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Looks legit: http://validator.nu/?doc=http://ryanmerrill.net/

[19:34:00.0000] <Giacomo->
I think the validator is a bit too forgiving :P 

[19:35:00.0000] <Giacomo->
I checked it there before coming here, but would you agree that the article tag isn't so appropriate there?

[19:35:01.0000] <Giacomo->
Maybe a section would of been better

[19:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
the <article> seems fine

[19:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
the <hgroup>s at the top are a little more dubious

[19:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
should probably just be one of them or something

[19:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
not really clear what the right outline would be

[19:37:02.0000] <Giacomo->
hm, I see

[20:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dammit

[20:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: ?

[20:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: ah, nothing specific, just a general curse.. several things not working as expected

[20:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., I'm trying the Check for Updates option in Opera.. I select it and nothing happens

[20:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and my XChat not working like it should

[20:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: btw, I tried Colloquy and really liked it, but it didn't work as expected with this "tircd" thing that I use for twitter

[20:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: what's tircd?

[20:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
IRC-to-twitter gateway?

[20:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[20:56:01.0000] <boblet>
oh hey MikeSmith

[20:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: hey man

[20:56:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
you been trying to ping me for a while

[20:56:04.0000] <boblet>
heh—wondering if I need to book a park bench for next Wednesday or not :)

[20:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, sure, definitely

[20:57:01.0000] <boblet>
thanks man (as always)

[20:58:00.0000] <boblet>
also did you get any info about the speech? just an hour on whatever, huh?

[20:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I think so

[20:58:02.0000] <boblet>
hope my Japanese is in working order that day

[20:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
mine will be in its usual order, namely bad

[20:59:01.0000] <boblet>
hehe. I figure lots of code examples np

[21:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will do what I can but will probably end up being lazy and falling back to English and kataka-izing prolificly 

[21:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as my part, I'm just going to do a walk-through of the validator.nu sources and demo

[21:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, I think Hatano-san will be making a visit to Osaka some time soon

[21:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
to do a presentation that we helped line up for him

[21:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: hey, I didn't tell you but Isshiki-san and Ashimura-san and I were in Osaka a couple weeks ago

[21:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I didn't call you because it was a whirlwind visit

[21:03:02.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: I think Hatano-san is here for next week right? Hopefully gonna catch up in the weekend

[21:04:00.0000] <boblet>
heh, np. what’s with all the activity down here? *nothing* happens here :/

[21:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
dunno when he's going, didn't realize it was that soon

[21:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: visiting friends at Panasonic

[21:04:03.0000] <boblet>
Kyoto if I’m not getting confused

[21:04:04.0000] <boblet>
aah, nice

[21:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
we arrived at lunchtime then had a couple meetings and then left pretty early because we had something else we had to go to the next day in Tokyo

[21:07:00.0000] <boblet>
yikes. you weren’t kidding

[21:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, thanks for that smoked meat. That stuff is amazing. ate it with some australian red wine, because I was hungry and had neither a razor nor a bottle of Laphroig close at hand

[21:10:00.0000] <boblet>
good stuff. yeah Aussie red works well—will bring some up for next month…

[21:11:00.0000] <boblet>
/me wishes <address> could be used inline (want to add copyright info to same sentence)

[21:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me has no idea what to do with ian's idea of uploading directories

[22:13:00.0000] <murr4y>
hi, i was wondering if someone had a general idea of the status of web fonts today?

[22:14:00.0000] <murr4y>
i mean, håkon lie made a stir around 2007/2008, and i haven't heard much about it since

[22:15:00.0000] <murr4y>
what's generally supported these days? tt? eot? plain opentype? woff?

[22:15:01.0000] <murr4y>
sorry for not having a very specific question :p just wondered if you have any opinions

[22:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
murr4y: I think the css3.info site might have some details

[22:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
murr4y: http://www.css3.info/?s=font

[22:38:00.0000] <murr4y>
nice, thank you

[00:19:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh, larry made a Formal Objection to publishing the drafts, quelle surprise

[00:24:00.0000] <boblet>
murr4y: for syntax check http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/

[00:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, I don't see Larry's objection anywhere on public-html

[00:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: where?

[00:25:02.0000] <annevk>
see the minutes of the telcon

[00:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
<masinter> do I need to repeat objections?

[00:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
paulc: the co-chairs are aware of the formal objection

[00:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
rubys: it would be helpful to repeat the objection

[00:27:03.0000] <Lachy>
paulc: it would be helpful to people who aren't reading w3-archive email

[00:27:04.0000] <Lachy>
so I guess his objection was originally sent to w3c-archive

[00:27:05.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. I didn't know you are allowed to make FOs in secret

[00:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
The section "On Standards" in http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2010/01/sympathy_for_the_devil.html is insightful

[00:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
for those with access, this is the only mention of an objection that I can find from Larry http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2010Feb/0108.html

[00:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
maybe I missed the actual objection elsewhere, since that talks about it in past tense

[00:32:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
it'd be awesome if adobe selled authoring tools for html5

[00:33:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i hope they'll do it

[00:33:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I guess it shows that the W3C approach might not really work

[00:33:02.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan__, I expect them to update Dreamweaver with HTML5 support

[00:34:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
Lachy: i mean the tools they currently have to produce flash content

[00:35:00.0000] <asmodai>
Why would anyone object to publishing drafts? :S

[00:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
has anyone else noticed how larry's e-mails get narrower and narrower the longer they get?

[00:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what causes that

[00:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
it messes with my head anytime i actually read all the way through his long e-mails

[00:36:00.0000] <annevk>
custom line breaks?

[00:36:01.0000] <asmodai>
Hixie: as in a funnel shape?

[00:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
asmodai: yeah, though left-aligned

[00:36:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
clearly, if you pull an email to make it longer, it has to get narrower

[00:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
wedge shaped

[00:37:00.0000] <asmodai>
mmm, are the emails angry in tone? Anger might explain rational thoughts short circuiting causing use of smaller sentences or so.

[00:38:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, fyi, redirects are a mess

[00:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
asmodai: not especially

[00:40:00.0000] <annevk>
which begs the question, what isn't?

[00:40:01.0000] <asmodai>
Hixie: Mmm, interesting then.

[00:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/0539.html is an example of the wedge

[00:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
though it's more a step than a wedge

[00:42:00.0000] <asmodai>
Wonder if he hits enter manually.

[00:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
no response to my comment on http://blogs.adobe.com/jd/2010/02/adobe_authoring_for_html5.html :-(

[00:48:00.0000] <asmodai>
I'm not sure what to think of Adobe nowadays to be honest.

[00:48:01.0000] <asmodai>
I dislike Flash with a passion in some areas and can understand its use in some others.

[01:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: never noticed the wedge before - that's weird

[01:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's really noticable in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2010Feb/0100.html

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
also http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2010Feb/0079.html

[01:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love how http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2010Feb/0106.html talks about how transparency is important

[01:27:00.0000] <annevk>
lolz

[01:27:01.0000] <annevk>
so cross-document messaging is without a W3C home for now?

[01:27:02.0000] <annevk>
/me didn't realize that was nuked from orbit too at the W3C

[01:30:00.0000] <danbri>
Hixie, sorry that's a password protected link... :?

[01:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
surely not, the author clearly indicates that transparency is important

[01:34:00.0000] <danbri>
i hope all the w3c member archives eventually get archived in public, for future historians to marvel over

[01:35:00.0000] <danbri>
/me reads some of the webapps rechartering thread yesterday ... not so fun reading

[01:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should archive it all now, and post it on Wikileaks in 20 years once nobody cares that much about keeping it private any more

[01:36:00.0000] <danbri>
something like that seems reasonable

[01:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
s/50/0/? :-)

[01:37:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, http://dev.w3.org/html5/postmsg/#idl is empty?

[01:38:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, also, could you rename the draft to Web Messaging as was suggested by othermaciej? then I can simply reference it as such from html5-diff

[01:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: what got nuked from the orbit and how? did one of the split out part not get adopted by webapps?

[01:39:01.0000] <annevk>
pretty much

[01:39:02.0000] <annevk>
though maybe after june

[01:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for time to market

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me blogs

[01:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: done

[01:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: that spec is probably one of the most widely implement features of HTML5 (at least as far as actually new features go)

[01:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: fortunately implementations don't wait until CR

[01:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so it doesn't actually matter

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
however WebApps is likely to complete rechartering within a few months at which point it can be published as FPWD

[01:49:00.0000] <annevk>
was anything else split out that I didn't notice?

[01:56:00.0000] <meledin>
Am I the only one to think "quantum particle theory" when reading the "Message Channels" section of the HTML5 Messaging document...

[01:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
the spec even uses the term "entangled"

[01:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's not a coincidence :-)

[01:57:00.0000] <meledin>
That's a comfort. Means I haven't become too geeky yet.

[01:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i did physics at university

[01:58:01.0000] <meledin>
Are there any plans to extend message channels between different hosts (by which I mean hosting environment/browser) or is it strictly in-browser currently?

[01:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I think microdata, microdata vocabularies, canvas 2d context, and postMessage/MessageChannel are the only drafts spun off since our last publication

[01:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
i occasionally like to give hat tips to my old subject :-)

[01:59:00.0000] <annevk>
oh right, microdata vocabularies

[01:59:01.0000] <annevk>
is that the three separate drafts?

[01:59:02.0000] <annevk>
who's publishing those?

[01:59:03.0000] <annevk>
apart from the WHATWG, of course

[01:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
vocabs are gone altogether currently in w3c space

[02:00:00.0000] <annevk>
there's still editor drafts in cvs

[02:00:01.0000] <annevk>
but okay

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not being updated

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
k

[02:02:01.0000] <annevk>
i'm adding "Specific microdata vocabularies are gone altogether in the W3C draft

[02:02:02.0000] <annevk>
    of HTML5 and are not published as a separate draft. The WHATWG draft of

[02:02:03.0000] <annevk>
    HTML5 still includes them."

[02:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: can you remind me of your POST test case?

[02:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the one that demonstrates how to do a POST without the user's permission and without using scripting?

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's in this directory: http://damowmow.com/playground/demos/http/002/

[02:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: thanks

[02:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
one of my favorite test cases ever :-)

[02:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i kinda like that one too

[02:39:00.0000] <virtuelv>
that's sort of hard to protect against, no?

[02:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
nah, not really

[02:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
same-origin, just avoid doing it

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
cross-origin, use Origin or other CSRF protections

[02:40:01.0000] <virtuelv>
yes, in terms of protecting the server

[02:41:00.0000] <virtuelv>
also delivering some hash to the user in a hidden form field

[02:42:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I was more concerned with the "let's hide from the user that we're doing a post"

[02:42:01.0000] <virtuelv>
and that's a harder problem to protect against

[02:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
not clear that it's a problem

[02:43:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: it's a problem only to the extent that web sites are broken

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[02:44:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(which is to say, they are, but I don't think we can fix problems that lie between a developer's chair and keyboard)

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
same-origin, the server can do whatever it wants anyway, without the client even being involved

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it's not clear to me why it matters whether you're doing a GET or a POST

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are advantages to do with UI that give good reasons to do the "right" one

[02:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't see any particular threat from being able to "trick" the user into doing a same-origin post with the user's knowledge

[02:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
if there was, the whole web would have broken down long ago :-)

[02:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
given that you can script a .post(), etc

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
er, a .submit(), not a .post()

[02:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
What makes you think the web hasn't broken down long ago? :-)

[02:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
if this is broken, i'd love to see it working!

[02:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
If this is working, I'd hate to see it broken :-p

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
"broken" would be like the web in the 80s

[03:44:00.0000] <workmad3>
Hixie: the web didn't exist in the 80's (well... 89, but that's barely the 80's)

[03:44:01.0000] <workmad3>
although I guess not-existing is a form of broken :)

[03:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's what i meant, yeah :-)

[03:44:03.0000] <workmad3>
and wow, I need to start checking time-stamps and not reviving hours old arguments :)

[03:44:04.0000] <gsnedders>

[03:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>

[03:45:01.0000] <workmad3>
gsnedders: fair point :)

[03:45:02.0000] <Hixie>

[03:45:03.0000] <meledin>
The English language has been broken for decades...

[03:45:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is blatantly too much of a QA to allow such bugs

[03:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: That would be better still

[03:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me remembers at joint HTML-WG/TAG meeting in '08 timbl making some comment about work on HTML going back 18.5 years, and just commenting in IRC: "/me feels like a n00b, again", causing several people in the meeting to laugh

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if maybe we should just punt on PUT and DELETE methods

[03:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
for form submission

[03:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I've learned that parser performance isn't parsing but painting

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear that they're really useful given XHR

[03:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: did you cause too many incremental updates?

[03:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: yes.

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, it's annoying that Mac and Vista have so different perf characteristics than XP&Linux

[04:00:00.0000] <meledin>
Hixie: Wouldn't the same line of reasoning apply to GET and POST then?

[04:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i understand the use cases for GET and POST from a form's perspective

[04:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
PUT and DELETE are a bit less obvious

[04:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
when was the last time you deleted something that had a URL?

[04:01:01.0000] <meledin>
It stems from the church of REST

[04:01:02.0000] <asmodai>
Isn't that whole GET/POST/PUT/DELETE at least directly mappable to CRUD?

[04:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i guess it depends how much you buy into the whole REST thing

[04:01:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: looking for the wrath of HTTP fans again?

[04:01:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: no, i'm trying to work out how to deal with actual issues raised

[04:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you make it same-origin only (and not allowed to follow cross-origin redirects) then it should be safe

[04:03:00.0000] <meledin>
To be fair I never used PUT/DELETE in forms at all since, err, they don't work :-)

[04:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know whether it would actually be useful

[04:03:02.0000] <meledin>
I do POST to /delete

[04:04:00.0000] <meledin>
Well, the theory being that if you would PUT to, e.g. a post reply on a forum, there would be no risk of double posts since you'd overwrite the last one

[04:05:00.0000] <asmodai>
I still find the names of PUT and POST confusing. My mind is also nagging me about missing implementations of DELETE in some webservers or so since it is hardly used. Good chance I'm confusing it with something else though.

[04:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
now I am curious how control values affect the request for a PUT or DELETE form

[04:06:01.0000] <meledin>
It would be useful if people doing forms subscribe to REST. Otherwise, no, not really. So to me that's the question to ask.

[04:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it looks like per HTML5, method=DELETE ignores the contents of form controls and just makes a DELETE method request to the action URI

[04:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that would make DELETE as a form action kind of useless

[04:11:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm, IETF fail

[04:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for PUT, the form contents are encoded into the body, but it seems unlikely that you'd want to upload a resource using any of the three formats...

[04:12:01.0000] <annevk>
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646 says it is bcp47 but http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47 says it is http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647 which is not obsoleted by the first URL...

[04:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for BCP stability

[04:13:00.0000] <meledin>
Well, for DELETE I would assume if there were form contents (such as a list of items to delete) you could encode it in the URL like for GET.

[04:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, but HTML5 does not say to do that, and it's not clear that would be a good behavior anyway

[04:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because then you could only delete resources that have a query in their URI

[04:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah it'd make no sense to do that

[04:15:01.0000] <meledin>
I don't see why? Isn't the query ignored if the remote side isn't interested in it?

[04:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
DELETE would only make sense in the context of a <button> with a formaction="" attribute

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
PUT doesn't really make any sense at all

[04:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
both were mostly added for parity wiht xforms back in the day

[04:16:02.0000] <annevk>
lots of people seemed to want them

[04:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
PUT would make sense if you could upload the contents of a file (from <input type=file>) without any other junk prepended or appended

[04:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or upload the contents of a text field or contentEditable area

[04:17:01.0000] <meledin>
PUT doesn't literally mean what the form PUTS to the resource is the end result, though?

[04:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
uploading urlencoded or multipart form data does not seem very useful

[04:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
meledin: that's what http PUT is supposed to mean

[04:17:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(roughly)

[04:17:05.0000] <meledin>
My understanding is it just means it overwrites the previous data and it's deterministic in its behaviour

[04:18:00.0000] <annevk>
how the data is encoded has no relevance to PUT afaict

[04:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
for PUT wouldn't you normally want to submit something in a form that could make sense to serve as a resource?

[04:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's certainly how atompub uses it

[04:19:01.0000] <meledin>
Creating a thread on a forum, for example? PUT-ing the same form several times (e.g. reload/back/forward) doesn't create multiple threads

[04:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
meledin: Why doesn't it?

[04:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
How does the HTTP method make any difference to that, in particular?

[04:21:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, but the server could take the data out of the multipart and use it as resource, no?

[04:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like you could do it with POST if you just add some unique form identifier each time you generate the editing form

[04:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is the same as you'd have to do with PUT except there you'd put the unique ID in the URL to make it point at a new resource, I guess

[04:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: could in theory - but that doesn't seem to be the intent of PUT as I understand it

[04:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: for example it seems like you might want to be able to use PUT to talk to an atompub service, but PUT from a form HTML5-style would make that impossible

[04:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I do think PUT could make sense if you could identify a single control and PUT its value

[04:24:02.0000] <meledin>
"Unless otherwise specified for a particular entity-header, the entity-headers in the PUT request SHOULD be applied to the resource created or modified by the PUT." -- othermaciej seems right.

[04:25:00.0000] <meledin>
Don't see any mention of "servers can/should ignore content-type on PUT".

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk>
entity-header != entity body

[04:28:01.0000] <annevk>
but I don't really care either way :)

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe not allowing them is better because they have this awkward same-origin restriction

[04:30:00.0000] <meledin>
Philip`: Basically, you're right. The end result is the same. In the PUT case, though, the end result is forced as part of the programming model, while in the POST case the programmer has to think. Being a dumb monkey, I like not thinking.

[04:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like the actual implementation requires the same amount of thinking in either case

[04:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
The conceptual model of resources and identifiers might make the solution easier to discover, though

[04:33:00.0000] <meledin>
For you and me? Yeah. For someone who hasn't encountered this particular issue before? ... what you said in fancier words.

[04:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
but you can use that conceptual model regardless of the implementation details

[04:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
and the HTML spec/language is not an effective way to teach people that model

[04:35:00.0000] <meledin>
I've no strong opinions on the last point. I just jumped in as devil's advocate on the reasoning "it's useless because it can be done with XHR"

[04:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't have strong opinions on any points, because he doesn't actually care about any of it

[04:38:01.0000] <meledin>
Apparently enough to correct someone who's wrong on the Internet ;-)

[04:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh it's not useless because it can be done with XHR

[04:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's useless in general, and, because it can be done with XHR, the use cases that remain are already possible anyway.

[04:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
that would be a better way to put it.

[04:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
changes to the design could potentially make it useful, but it's not clear if they are worthwhile, given that you can do it with XHR

[04:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
at least, now that XHR can upload a file

[04:42:00.0000] <annevk>
I now and then think we should value scriptless solutions a bit more, but maybe that's old school

[04:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think scriptless solutions for common use cases are valuable

[04:44:01.0000] <meledin>
Scriptless is awesome, especially for stuff end-users never need to see

[04:44:02.0000] <meledin>
Because it is highly improbable it can go wrong

[04:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure what distinction you are making

[04:46:00.0000] <meledin>
Then take it that it's worthless I guess :-) I just meant it's useful (to me) to make admin views, and debug views and such in plain HTML without JS or even CSS because it's trivial (to me). Add JS to the equation and now I have to debug

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me doubts the wisdom of making isindex a parser macro

[05:28:00.0000] <annevk>
isn't it like that in other browsers?

[05:28:01.0000] <annevk>
e.g. Opera

[05:28:02.0000] <annevk>
and IE too I believe

[05:29:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
there's so little isindex compat that we could do the sane thing

[05:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Would anyone notice if we coated isindex in concrete and dumped it in the harbour in the middle of the night?

[05:30:01.0000] <annevk>
sane being dropping it altogether?

[05:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in Opera, the macro is rooted in an isindex element

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in WebKit, the text field in the macro is an element with the name isindex

[05:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
well, I'll remove the isindex tests from the DOM Level 2 HTML test suite and see if I can get r+

[05:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
isindex being a macro has caused me disproportionate grief compared to its usefulness

[05:34:01.0000] <annevk>
don't you need to implement the special processing semantics for isindex form submission?

[05:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: Yes! there's more grief ahead of me before the parser can be shipped!

[05:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me gestures angrily in the general direction of isindex

[05:35:01.0000] <annevk>
<keygen> might be tricky too

[05:35:02.0000] <annevk>
given how that's implemented in Gecko

[05:35:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
sane being parsing it like a proper void element

[05:35:04.0000] <annevk>
somewhat unfortunate how a disproportionate amount of time goes to bogus features of the past 

[05:36:00.0000] <jcranmer>
if people dropped support for isindex, who would break?

[05:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sent email. I wasn't particularly eloquent, because I'm pretty annoyed with isindex right now

[05:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Seriously do we have any examples of actual sites that break due to <isindex> being broken?

[05:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/broken/missing/

[05:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm even more angered when I consider the Concorde effect and how much effort I've already put into isindex

[05:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://likelylotusblue.com/cgi-bin/webglimpse/

[05:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
You'd break that kind of thing if <isindex> wasn't supported at all

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oops, that one's broken anyway

[05:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://likelylotusblue.com/cgi-bin/webglimpse/home/llbadmin/likelylotusblue-www

[05:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
That's slightly less broken but still broken

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk>
not very convincing examples :)

[05:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://costard.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/man/man2html - there's one

[05:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
It works if you enter something like "cat"

[05:57:00.0000] <annevk>
sweet

[06:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me fails to find any other examples that actually work

[07:05:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh, am I being tentatively accused of FUD on public-html?

[07:05:01.0000] <annevk>
I wonder how depressing it would be to find the last useful email on that list

[07:07:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, there was exactly 1 non-process related email today

[07:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
How did that get through?

[07:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe the process needs to be improved to prevent that from happening

[07:08:01.0000] <annevk>
and yesterday around 3 or 4

[07:09:00.0000] <annevk>
it's sad, though for sure the Process moguls can declare victory for now

[07:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have GMail use nearly identical colors for whatwg, htmlwg, and webapps list emails, so I can't tell which is which without specifically looking for it.

[07:17:00.0000] <annevk>
also, http://twitter.com/shelleypowers/status/8296745940 didn't last very long

[07:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
And you are surprised why?

[07:19:00.0000] <annevk>
was that in reply to TabAtkins?

[07:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
someone should raise a objection about the violation of process that allowed that non-process related e-mail to get through.

[07:20:00.0000] <annevk>
you might upset the Process moguls

[07:24:00.0000] <asmodai>
Hixie: Well, your post made it to the front of reddit ;)

[07:24:01.0000] <asmodai>
oh wait, second page

[07:25:00.0000] <annevk>
it's really no wonder people prefer the WHATWG list if you study the numbers a bit

[07:29:00.0000] <annevk>
link to the reddit entry?

[07:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, just challenged Lawson to a drink-off.

[07:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Now just have to find an excuse to be in the same place as him.

[07:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, it seems like a drink-off is a reasonable excuse.

[07:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Tell my wife that.  ^_^

[07:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok, is she in IRC?

[07:37:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
No.

[07:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, then pass on my message for me :-)

[07:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I will direct you to her soonest.  ^_^

[07:41:00.0000] <a-ja>
anyone happen to have a xbl binding for details/summary, properly styled, that works with xbl2.js google code?

[07:41:01.0000] <a-ja>
/me is not holding his breath

[07:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nope.

[07:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe the idea is to split the HTML5 language into as many tiny pieces as possible, and then you can block every one of the pieces except the tiny core that still has the name "HTML5" attached to it, and then you can claim you're not blocking HTML5

[07:46:01.0000] <a-ja>
tks anyway....(wasn't *even* gonna include "accessible" in that question)

[07:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't think of any reasonable and common meaning of "HTML5" by which the 2D canvas context is not part of HTML5

[07:49:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, you didn't finish your sentence on public-webapps

[07:50:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, also, that test seems very pointless to optimize for

[07:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: apparently Mozilla and Microsoft both thought it was sufficiently common to do getElementsByTagName in a loop that they optimized for it years before this test existed

[07:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(in fact, with caching it's not even that much of a perf hit to do it in a loop)

[07:53:01.0000] <annevk>
exposing the gc seems very wrong

[07:53:02.0000] <annevk>
also you can optimize by creating small js objects

[07:54:00.0000] <annevk>
and doing other tricks

[07:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the overhead is in doing a GC allocation at all

[07:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there is no trick you can use to get the speed back

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.hotelgoal.com/city/vn/hotel-in-bai-chay.htm

[07:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
        for(i=0; i< document.getElementById(frm).getElementsByTagName('SELECT').length; i++){

[07:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
            if(document.getElementById(frm).getElementsByTagName('SELECT')[i].value==0){

[07:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
Is that what the optimisation is for?

[07:57:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: yes

[07:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: there's only 4 select elements in that page afaict so the effect in this case would be small

[07:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
It looks a very common pattern

[07:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=fr&id=280&portrait_ID=66&function=print

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
   while (document.getElementsByTagName("span")[i] != null) {

[07:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
     if (document.getElementsByTagName("span")[i].className

[07:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
                                                   == "fn") {

[07:59:03.0000] <Philip`>
   ...

[07:59:04.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, you don't think the gc issue is a problem?

[08:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I dont think setting custom properties on NodeLists is at all common, so I don't think it's an issue in practice, even though it is theoretically nondeterministic behavior

[08:00:01.0000] <annevk>
we could forbid custom properties on nodelists

[08:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: if we really wanted to avoid it, we could require returning the same object, which to the level of observational equivalence would require caching it so long as it is live, or if it has ever had a custom property set

[08:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but I don't think that is worth the effort

[08:01:01.0000] <annevk>
or pin objects

[08:01:02.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[08:01:03.0000] <Philip`>
Lots seem to be looping over 'a' and 'img', so I imagine there's going to be quite a few of those

[08:01:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: thanks for finding actual examples

[08:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
See also http://google.com/codesearch?q=getElementsByTagName%5C%28%5B%5E%29%5D%2B%5C%29%5C%5B%5Ba-zA-Z%5D

[08:02:01.0000] <annevk>
it seems somewhat dangerous to me

[08:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: clever search regexp

[08:04:01.0000] <annevk>
time for a beer

[08:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there is probably a small risk of depending on nondeterministic behavior in the unlikely case someone really does set custom properties

[08:33:00.0000] <openstandards>
Hi, have i came to the right place to ask about semantic mark up involving html 5?

[08:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, basically

[08:39:00.0000] <openstandards>
do you get any benefit from using input=search i'm aware of the other new fields which offer validation

[08:40:00.0000] <miketaylr>
you get a neat little x button to clear the field (in chrome/safari)

[08:43:00.0000] <openstandards>
ahhh ok thank you, these new ui widgets are much better for making web apps 

[08:43:01.0000] <NickRiviera>
Hixie, Hi.

[08:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
openstandards, http://diveintohtml5.org/forms.html

[08:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That mentions how most browsers implement the various input types.

[08:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
type="search" mainly just looks more like a native search box on Macs.

[08:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it's conceivable that browsers will treat it cleverly in other ways in the future, so why not.

[08:59:00.0000] <paul_irish>
and these are proposals for others, but not implemented quite yet http://docs.google.com/View?id=dch3zh37_0cf8kc8c4

[08:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Actually, it looks wrong on Chrome on Windows/Linux, IMO: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21560 )

[08:59:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
paul_irish, well, those are proposals for WebKit, yeah.

[08:59:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Opera and iPhone already implement some of that.

[09:00:00.0000] <paul_irish>
aye

[09:00:01.0000] <openstandards>
AryehGregor, i've been playing about with the html 5 spec for sometime opera seems to be leading the way

[09:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
openstandards, in some parts yes, some parts no.

[09:00:03.0000] <paul_irish>
with webforms definitely

[09:00:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
For instance, it's only just getting localStorage support in 10.50, IIRC.

[09:00:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
But yeah, it's had a pretty complete Web Forms implementation for a long time now, it's neat.

[09:01:00.0000] <openstandards>
i do like the datepicker function thats been added to the spec, thats extremely neat 

[09:06:00.0000] <openstandards>
i haven't seen much info on <menu> yet hows that treated? 

[09:11:00.0000] <openstandards>
aroben, thank you for that rather interesting article never knew the iphone's browser was that good

[09:11:01.0000] <aroben>
openstandards: I think you might have the wrong person

[09:12:00.0000] <openstandards>
grrrrr sorry i never tabbed enough 

[09:13:00.0000] <openstandards>
tab complete very useful function when used correctly 

[09:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
With the html5lib serialiser, how can I make it not output doctypes?

[09:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
tail -n +2

[09:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
In the token serialiser loop: if text != '<!DOCTYPE html>'

[09:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
That works well enough for me

[09:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
w3c-archive is accessible to who?  Not people who are just HTMLWG Invited Experts, right?

[09:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
No

[09:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hurrah.

[09:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Members only, I think

[09:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's it used for?

[09:29:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I'm a "member" of the HTMLWG, just I only have public access, I think.  Or something.

[09:29:05.0000] <Philip`>
For hiding things from mere invited experts, I guess

[09:29:06.0000] <Philip`>
but I don't know since I can't see it

[09:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can't even find a public list description.

[09:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: But you're not a Member

[09:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, maybe I'm a Participant but not a Member?  http://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=40318&public=1

[09:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It says "(public)" next to my name, I guess that means I don't get to see the cool secret stuff.

[09:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think Members are only employees of http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List

[09:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
For some people it says "(public) Invited expert", and for some it says "W3C Invited Experts".

[09:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like Tantek is a W3C Invited Expert.

[09:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe I should bug someone to get Wikimedia joining the W3C and make me their representative.

[09:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Doesn't seem worth it.  I guess I'll have to if I become a full-time employee at any point, though.

[09:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
Would that be a good use of $8000 of Wikimedia's money?

[09:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably, it has "advancing open standards" as part of its mission.

[09:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Values "We believe that this mission requires thriving open formats and open standards on the web to allow the creation of content not subject to restrictions on creation, use, and reuse."

[09:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
Would W3C membership help advance open standards?

[09:34:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh.

[09:34:04.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: if you get invited as an Invited Expert to any group but HTML WG, you'd probably become a real Invited Expert

[09:34:05.0000] <Philip`>
more than spending the money/resources on other things

[09:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, because in most groups, Invited Experts are actually invited experts?  :)

[09:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
and contributing from a non-Member perspective

[09:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I dunno, that's not my decision.

[09:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think that if I get employed by them, though, they have to become a member if I'm to remain part of the HTMLWG, or something?

[09:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: in most groups, yeah, you have to be actually invited

[09:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the $8k fee for nonprofits seems kinda steep

[09:42:00.0000] <openstandards>
othermaciej, that it does

[09:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikimedia has about $8.6m in revenue for FY2008, so I guess they'd be able to afford it if necessary.  Dunno.

[09:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
They plan to make $10.6m in 2009-10.

[09:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: I don't believe they do - you can be an Invited Expert as long as your employer is not a Member, though it seems they don't like IE status being used as a way to circumvent membership fees

[09:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/they do/they do have to become a member/

[09:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, when I signed up, I was asked if my employer had anything to do with the web, or something like that.

[09:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know how strict they are about nonprofits

[09:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's a point, maybe they'd be nice.  Dunno.

[09:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
I'd expect that if you're contributing as an individual then that's okay

[09:44:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll deal with that when I come to it.

[09:44:05.0000] <Philip`>
rather than contributing as effectively an official representative of your employer

[09:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
See, this is what WF2 is good for: http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/201002/errord/linkedinwtf.png

[09:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Wikimedia being a W3C Member would probably be a good thing for marginally improving the quality of AC decisions

[09:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, yeah, I was thinking it would be a good thing to have more members whose interests actually lie with a free web.

[09:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I was thinking from the POV of caring about open source issues, and also just a large content publisher that cares about advancing the web platform

[09:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right.

[09:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if the list at <http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List> is actually current

[09:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You'd think $7,900 would be enough to pay someone to update the list.

[09:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I thought I'd heard that Yahoo! is not a member any more

[09:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would be pretty interesting.

[09:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
It is sad though that there aren't more large content publishers represented (and ideally active in the HTML WG)

[09:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be nice to hear direct from e.g. Facebook or Twitter or Amazon what they'd like to see

[09:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, kind of funny that none of them are part of the W3C.

[09:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does the HTMLWG have any private media of communication?  Ian's latest blog post seems to suggest Adobe was raising objections in secret.  Do these count for anything until they're filed as bugs or whatnot?

[09:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
w3c could probably improve their financial situation a lot if they could convince big Web content companies that W3C membership is relevant to them

[09:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the HTML WG does not have any private mailing lists or the like

[09:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So what is w3c-archive?

[09:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
The WHATWG has $0 membership fees and still doesn't seem to attract any people from big Web content companies

[09:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
so why would the W3C be more successful at getting them involved?

[09:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
w3c-archive is like www-archive, but restricted to member-only access

[09:54:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: I'm surprised the WHATWG hasn't been successful at it either

[09:54:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It is kind of weird.

[09:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: maybe getting improvements to specs to ultimately get improvements to browsers is beyond their time horizon

[09:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Whereas I guess implementers have a more short-term interest.

[09:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: the objection I am aware of was first mailed to some members of the W3C Team, and subsequently some related emails were sent to the Member-only w3c-archive list

[09:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
why that person thought it was appropriate to raise an objection about a fully public Working Group through private channels, I don't know

[09:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it will have to be posted publicly before anyone is required to address it or it can impede the spec's progress in any way, I guess?

[09:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am also not entirely sure what said person is objecting to, whether it's a Formal Objection, or what

[09:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
since the objection was addressed to the W3C Team and not to the Chairs at all, I think it's for the W3C to take care of it

[09:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and the Chairs are going to proceed as if it doesn't exist until we hear otherwise

[09:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
k.

[10:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
>_<  I hate the member-only lists.  Is there anything *actually* binding me to 'secrecy' about them?  Did I agree to something when I became an IE that I'm not aware of?  Or is it just a cultural thing?

[10:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/comm.html#confidentiality-levels

[10:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Annoying, but ok.  This is frankly an abuse of the member-only list, and I'm disappointed in the author.

[10:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's fun watching arguments on public lists about what was said on private lists, where the participants know what was said but can't actually say what it was

[10:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: there's a particular person who has started quite a few html-wg-related threads on w3c-archive recently, and I must say I do not fully understand why

[10:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
(...watching from the perspective of someone who doesn't know what was said, and can just reconstruct a vague outline and apply imagination to guess the rest)

[10:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
A Formal Objection has to be publicly available per the Process: http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/policies.html#WGArchiveMinorityViews

[10:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe they want to see if they can apply enough pressure to get something changed without anyone being able to pin it on them?

[10:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or they want to test reactions privately before committing to it publicly?

[10:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like for PR sort of reasons.

[10:14:03.0000] <othermaciej>
however, there is also the option to appeal a chair's decision if a member feels they are not getting due process: http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/policies.html#WGAppeals

[10:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I really haven't noticed anything obnoxious from Adobe on the public lists, or at least not related to Flash or related technologies that HTML5 threatens.

[10:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There were some posts about how Flash interacts with sandboxes, but nothing terribly unreasonable.

[10:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(sorry, I mean "plugins", not "Flash")

[10:15:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(to be fair, it would be Acrobat as much as Flash)

[10:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AC reps can also appeal certain decisions in a way that is only Member-visible, but I am not sure that applies here: http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/acreview.html#ACAppeal

[10:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, I've registered my disapproval in any case.

[10:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm.  Why don't I see w3c-archive on the lists.w3.org page?

[10:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there's a separate page of Member-only lists

[10:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/

[10:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
Sadly that list of Member-only lists is Member-only

[10:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is reminded a bit of The Castle.

[10:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
those of you who are permitted Member-only  access may wish to view this Member-only post where someone reminds me of the importance of transparency: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2010Feb/0082.html

[10:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We should all just follow the example of, I think, David Baron and refuse to post on private lists (unless absolutely required).

[10:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I'm currently following that policy with the magnanimous assistance of the W3C, which doesn't let me post on private lists to begin with.)

[10:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Heehee.

[10:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: The only relevant member-only list I participate in is the CSSWG's one, and all we use it for is posting agendas and coordinating meetups.  This is the maximum extent to which I think private lists should be used.

[10:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why does that need to be private?

[10:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because there's no particular need for it to be public; it just clutters up the public list with useless stuff.  No actual discussion takes place over there.

[10:37:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's an answer for "why is it a separate list?", not for why it's private

[10:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then you could have it on a separate public list.

[10:37:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, but no one would read it.  Shrug.

[10:37:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's really irrelevant where that sort of stuff goes.

[10:37:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
You should err on the side of transparency.

[10:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The thing is, nobody on the outside knows what happens on a private list

[10:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
So you _might_ be discussing all kinds of things there

[10:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That too.

[10:38:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It creates the appearance of hiding things.

[10:38:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
We do giggle over pictures of you, Dashiva.

[10:38:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've heard that it used to be used more often, no?

[10:38:06.0000] <Dashiva>
There's more than one picture of me?

[10:38:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, it did.  And that was a bad idea.

[10:38:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm sure I heard that some CSSWG members used to never post on the public list at all.

[10:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
From reading othermaciej's link, though, it looks like the W3C treats Members-only areas as a perk of membership.  I wonder what the procedure would be to convert a WG to all-public like the HTMLWG?

[10:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Web Apps WG is almost all-public

[10:39:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suppose something like "Hey, could you kill our private list?  We don't need it any more."

[10:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there is a member-only list that is only occasionally used for administrative matters

[10:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
confidentiality level for a group is defined by the charter

[10:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which you just said is really hard to change.

[10:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or said recently.

[10:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think the two ancestors of webapps were as open as webapps is

[10:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: the webapps charter was intentionally written to be more open

[10:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: it's a pain in the ass to change it, but charters do expire periodically

[11:17:00.0000] <karlushi>
[12:54]  <othermaciej> I wonder if the list at <http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List> is actually current

[11:17:01.0000] <karlushi>
 the list is dynamic

[11:17:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: what's all this about Adobe :P

[11:17:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
wycats, he can't say, it's secret.

[11:19:00.0000] <wycats>
AryehGregor: I know :P

[11:20:00.0000] <wycats>
I'm on one of the sekrit lists -- /me looks

[11:21:00.0000] <wycats>
AryehGregor: I was just ribbing

[11:23:00.0000] <karlushi>
Member lists sometimes give the possibility to share information which is private but need to be archived. It could be phone numbers, addresses, etc. 

[11:23:01.0000] <karlushi>
The Member lists come from a time where closed doors helped to solve conflicts that participants failed to resolve in public (transition ietf to w3c)

[11:23:02.0000] <wycats>
karlushi: I know I know

[11:23:03.0000] <karlushi>
/me replying to previous comments on irc. not yours wycats 

[11:24:00.0000] <wycats>
karlushi: :)

[11:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
karlushi: Pretty sure all our public information exists on the web anyway.  Anyone could find out where I live and what my phone number is without too much difficult, frex.

[11:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, you could just e-mail it to a bunch of people directly without a mailing list.  You're not going to be communicating that kind of stuff very often.

[11:25:02.0000] <karlushi>
TabAtkins, well if you published it

[11:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean that that sort of info tends to get published *anyway*.  It's usually public info, even if you *do* have to dig for it.

[11:27:00.0000] <wycats>
TabAtkins: this brush-up over private lists reminds of the "omg Pelosi and Reid are having a private conversation not on CSPAN"

[11:27:01.0000] <wycats>
the idea that there will be private communications period is not unreasonable

[11:27:02.0000] <wycats>
are you going to ban W3C members from any email that is not through the public lists?

[11:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, private communications period are fine, but there shouldn't be official W3C fora for them.

[11:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Official business should all be in public.

[11:28:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Of course not.  I would like to discourage w3c members from making important arguments about w3c products on private lists.

[11:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
We're developing open standards.  Doing anything like this behind closed doors is inappropriate.

[11:32:00.0000] <wycats>
AryehGregor, TabAtkins: all the "official fora" does is provide an alternative to reply-all

[11:33:00.0000] <karlushi>
/me notes that he has no access to member lists 

[11:33:01.0000] <Dashiva>
wycats: They also legitimize it

[11:33:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
wycats: What?  It also provides publicly-available archives, and an obvious way to both read and write to the relevant group.

[11:34:00.0000] <wycats>
TabAtkins: I'm not in favor of conducting public business in private, but the idea that private communication shouldn't occur is just asking for problems

[11:34:01.0000] <wycats>
not everything can be done under the glare of the cameras

[11:34:02.0000] <wycats>
sometimes people need to be able to make candid arguments to each other

[11:34:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I didn't say that private communication shouldn't occur.

[11:34:04.0000] <karlushi>
TabAtkins, that is true that open is good, but it also creates challenges sometimes. There are issues on both styles. I have seen both at work and none are perfect.

[11:34:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I said that public brusiness shouldn't occur in private.

[11:34:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Pretty much everything can be done in public.

[11:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's how many open-source projects operate, and it works fine.

[11:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
In this case, public business *is* occurring in private.  That's inappropriate.

[11:35:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
People are just candid in public.

[11:35:03.0000] <Dashiva>
There's also a difference between "private" and "only for people who pay"

[11:35:04.0000] <karlushi>
Dashiva, here it is also a question of history

[11:36:00.0000] <karlushi>
moving from one financing model to another one is very very very hard

[11:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That seems unrelated

[11:36:02.0000] <karlushi>
Dashiva, nope. The full structure of the organization was based on a model which is now challenged by the new trend and the new culture.

[11:37:00.0000] <karlushi>
But the employees, aka *people*, are still a reality you have to deal with

[11:37:01.0000] <karlushi>
and W3C has not a big budget

[11:38:00.0000] <karlushi>
You can decide to open everything, and make a donation plan, but this is a full reorganization.

[11:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That seems unrelated still

[11:38:02.0000] <karlushi>
switching from one model to the other takes time, a lot of time

[11:38:03.0000] <Dashiva>
It's possible to have members without letting them run everything in hidden fora

[11:38:04.0000] <karlushi>
Dashiva, but some members who pay may not want to do it in public.

[11:39:00.0000] <karlushi>
and if they say, public = no money

[11:39:01.0000] <karlushi>
how do you deal with it? aka the reality

[11:39:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Has anyone said that?

[11:39:03.0000] <karlushi>
same difficulty for Mozilla-Google

[11:39:04.0000] <Dashiva>
You respond by making their claims public?

[11:39:05.0000] <karlushi>
nope

[11:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me has to bow out and go get his license renewed.  bbs

[11:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
karlushi, has any of this been a problem for the HTMLWG?

[11:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because that's completely open.

[11:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some other WGs are almost completely open at this point, reportedly, like CSSWG or Web Apps.

[11:40:04.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Well, except the w3c-member stuff...

[11:40:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Doesn't seem like it needs "a full reorganization".

[11:40:06.0000] <karlushi>
just being logical. Make a concert in an open area draw a circle line, inside the circle line, you pay, outside you don't pay. 

[11:40:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, that's outside the WG.

[11:40:08.0000] <karlushi>
I bet you will not get a lot of money

[11:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
karlushi, the W3C can require membership for organizations whose employees post to the list, as I think is the case for the HTMLWG.

[11:41:01.0000] <karlushi>
AryehGregor, the htmlwg is part of an organization which has 15 years of existence. 

[11:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you can read, but not influence unless you pay.

[11:41:03.0000] <karlushi>
history history

[11:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
karlushi: Well, actually, the winter sports arena in Oslo had a hill just outside called "the free hill"

[11:42:01.0000] <karlushi>
AryehGregor, that doesn't work very well. People can hide behind email addresses. Having been the first staff contact for the new htmlwg, I can tell you that it's almost impossible to detect

[11:42:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And for some strange reason, people still paid to get inside

[11:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
karlushi, sure.  Now how many members does the HTMLWG have?

[11:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Quite a few.

[11:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So a few cheat.

[11:43:02.0000] <karlushi>
they were more when it started

[11:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
This reminds me of arguments about DRM.

[11:44:00.0000] <karlushi>
htmlwg is public. And I'm very happy that it is public and open. It has been a long discussion for it to be.

[11:44:01.0000] <karlushi>
do not shoot the messenger. 

[11:44:02.0000] <karlushi>
I advocate for it.

[11:44:03.0000] <karlushi>
BUT there is financial reality of a structure too.

[11:44:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe the W3C could manage with less money if it cut down on bureaucracy, too.  The WHATWG doesn't have to charge membership fees, and it's arguably producing a superior spec to the W3C version of HTML5.

[11:45:00.0000] <karlushi>
/me is not replying to that. 

[11:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
:)

[11:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You could argue that the reason WHATWG is so efficient is because W3C serves as a pressure release valve :)

[11:46:01.0000] <karlushi>
I do not think whatwg is efficient. period.

[11:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, no, people don't do things like argue about process here because there is no process.  If they disagree with a decision, they don't argue incessantly because it's pointless, they're just going to get ignored.

[11:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can see why some perceive it as unequitable, but I don't see how it could be considered inefficient at its goal -- namely, coordinating and standardizing implementation of new web features.

[11:48:01.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Yes, but you also have an alternate forum more open to your complaints. If that didn't exist, you'd have to choose between silence or trying harder

[11:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe.  But I suspect that kind of behavior wouldn't be tolerated if it started to make the list less useful.  A lot like most open-source projects' communications media -- you can make whatever arguments you like until you get in the way.

[11:49:01.0000] <karlushi>
Shoutocracy

[11:50:00.0000] <karlushi>
it is very hard to find the right equilibrium

[11:50:01.0000] <karlushi>
in terms of listening people, and making the project healthy without people derailing it

[11:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, it's impossible to find something that everyone will agree is the right equilibrium.  For a given opinion on what constitutes the right equilibrium, it can be pretty easy to find the right one.

[11:52:00.0000] <karlushi>
whatever the chosen system, there will be benefits and issues. And some projects tend to ignore some voices for more velocity, but at the same time avoiding certain realities. But this is a discussion that philosophers have discussed for ages. I don't think we'll find the solutions today ;)

[11:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nope, not likely.  Everyone has to do whatever they think will be best.

[11:56:00.0000] <karlushi>
AryehGregor, first reasonable sentence of this chat.

[11:56:01.0000] <karlushi>
;)

[11:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unfortunately, some people (including sometimes me) are not as considerate as they could be of other people's opinions on what course is best, and that's exacerbated by the WHATWG/W3C split.  But we are where we are.

[12:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
look, our little spat made Ajaxian: http://ajaxian.com/archives/adobe-html5-standards-blocking-and-the-evil-of-the-private-backroom

[12:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, so was the objection that canvas wasn't in scope?

[12:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, that was the formal objection being referred to?

[12:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(et al.)

[12:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
honestly I am not entirely sure of the content or form of the objection

[12:25:00.0000] <wycats>
to be honest, I hope that's the argument

[12:26:00.0000] <wycats>
because it will expose Adobe to serious hurt

[12:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, Larry has made a lot of objections personally that seem unrelated to Adobe's interests.

[12:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Mostly they seem to be procedural, like this.

[12:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If the real idea was to try throwing a spanner into canvas standardization to avoid competition with Flash or something, it seems pretty well disguised.

[12:27:01.0000] <wycats>
AryehGregor: "canvas is out of scope" is not procedural

[12:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me will continue to assume good faith.

[12:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd call it procedural.  It's not saying there's anything *technically* wrong with the spec, just that its existence doesn't conform to some policy somewhere.

[12:28:00.0000] <wycats>
AryehGregor: it's procedural like saying HCR doesn't conform to reconciliation rules

[12:28:01.0000] <wycats>
it's TRUE

[12:28:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Er, what's HCR?

[12:28:03.0000] <wycats>
but you don't bring it up unless you want to block it for some other reason

[12:28:04.0000] <wycats>
health care reform

[12:28:05.0000] <wycats>
sorry

[12:28:06.0000] <wycats>
political analogy ;)

[12:28:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh.

[12:28:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . .What are reconciliation rules?

[12:29:00.0000] <wycats>
ha

[12:29:01.0000] <wycats>
there are rules in the Senate that allow you to bypass the 60-vote filibuster rules for items related to the budget

[12:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah.

[12:29:03.0000] <wycats>
there was some talk of trying to pass healthcare through those rules

[12:29:04.0000] <wycats>
but too much of it was unrelated to budget

[12:29:05.0000] <wycats>
but if someone objected on those grounds, they were really objecting to the bill

[13:06:00.0000] <karlushi>
[proposed] Web Fonts Working Group Charter

[13:06:01.0000] <karlushi>
http://www.w3.org/2009/08/WebFonts/charter.html

[13:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
karlushi: Man, where did *that* come from?  I haven't seen any activity on the www-font list for some time.

[13:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Looks good, though.  Just what we discussed at the planning meeting.

[13:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
2009/08? Sounds obsolete already

[13:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's definitely a strange date, since we didn't actually pin down any details until 09/11

[13:14:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
2009/11, that is.

[13:21:00.0000] <karlushi>
Philip`, dated space are identifiers not date.

[13:22:00.0000] <karlushi>
look at the bottom of the document $Date: 2010/02/11 19:43:34 $

[13:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Wasn't there talk about finally getting rid of dates in the URLs?

[13:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Since it doesn't actually do anything except confuse people...

[13:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(same with dates in namespaces)

[13:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
looks like that Ajaxian article made reddit

[13:27:03.0000] <othermaciej>
"are we having fun yet?"

[13:28:00.0000] <karlushi>
Dashiva, what do you replace them with?

[13:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
Nothing

[13:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
Just choose names that are unique within all names forever, rather than names that only have to be unique within all names chosen in that month

[13:28:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Or a generic group name, e.g. /ns/ for namespaces

[13:29:00.0000] <karlushi>
Philip`, http://w3.org/Nothing you mean ?

[13:29:01.0000] <wycats>
othermaciej: of course

[13:29:02.0000] <karlushi>
Philip`, on a long term no name is forever

[13:29:03.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.w3.org/WebFonts/charter.html etc

[13:30:00.0000] <karlushi>
then in 2014, a new WebFonts WG. what do you do you had on top ? you call it WebFonts2/charter or Webfonts/charters2 ?

[13:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
You don't call it the WebFonts WG

[13:31:00.0000] <karlushi>
hehe

[13:31:01.0000] <karlushi>
ok

[13:31:02.0000] <karlushi>
next one is WWWFonts

[13:31:03.0000] <karlushi>
then next one is

[13:31:04.0000] <karlushi>
WWWPolice

[13:31:05.0000] <karlushi>
and then… :)

[13:32:00.0000] <karlushi>
btw, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2010Feb/0002

[13:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Or you just reuse the name, and say that the group has had several incarnations

[13:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Sort of like /html works today

[13:43:00.0000] <karlushi>
html didn't reuse the name

[13:43:01.0000] <karlushi>
it was previously http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/ ;)

[13:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
A demonstration of how easy it is to find non-conflicting names that make sense :-)

[13:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
karlushi: Well, the current /html manages the multi-capacity role just fine

[13:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that const char* foo = "<bar baz=""/>"; doesn't do quite what he expected, even though the compiler is perfectly happy with it

[13:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: it's a feature!

[13:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
me wonders what that does

[13:53:01.0000] <ment>
it really is :)

[13:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
s////

[13:54:00.0000] <ment>
0 == strcmp("a" "b", "ab")

[13:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
two string literals that are adjacent to each other get concatenated

[13:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's useful because of macros

[13:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but it is kind of evil

[13:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's useful for splitting long strings over multiple lines too

[14:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'd think a line-terminating \ is a lesser evil there, or a heredoc syntax

[14:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
The line-terminating \ should, ideally, be unnecessary. It's really inconvenient

[14:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I think the only reason it exists is to ensure the author really meant for the string to continue, rather than an accidentally omitted quote

[14:06:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Makes error messages nicer :)

[14:06:02.0000] <Dashiva>
But I agree it's horrible to use

[14:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it'd be better to have a compile-time-string-concatenation operator

[14:12:00.0000] <Hixie>

the objection situation also made it to Hacker News http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1120394

[16:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(more discussion there than on reddit it seems; maybe all the cool kids left proggit)

[16:20:00.0000] <rektide>
chrome you anger me

[16:21:00.0000] <rektide>
even after window.name = "foo",  from another tab doing window.open(sameUrl,"foo",null,false) tries to open a new window

[16:21:01.0000] <rektide>
i use this as my final contention for postMessage() being utterly and completely worthless.  unless you open it, you cant talk to it.

[16:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
rektide: It ought to work in any situation where you already have a reference to another window, I believe

[16:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's no guarantee that window names are unique within a browser session, so you can't use them as way to acquire references

[16:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess you have to use something like localStorage if you want some shared communication medium between otherwise-independent windows

[16:38:00.0000] <rektide>
Philip`: theres no guarantee window names are unique, so you cant _rely_ on them to acquire references

[16:39:00.0000] <rektide>
however you should be able to acquire references to other windows, according to the window.open() spec

[16:40:00.0000] <rektide>
and according to my own testing, and google chrome bug 8751, chrome is currently in violation of the spec

[16:40:01.0000] <rektide>
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8751

[16:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think HTML5 allows Chrome's behaviour

[16:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/browsers.html#dom-open - "the user agent must first select a browsing context to navigate by applying the rules for choosing a browsing context given a browsing context name using the target argument as the name"

[16:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/browsers.html#the-rules-for-choosing-a-browsing-context-given-a-browsing-context-name

[16:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
"If the given browsing context name is not _blank and there exists a browsing context whose name is the same as the given browsing context name, and the current browsing context is allowed to navigate that browsing context, and the user agent determines that the two browsing contexts are related enough that it is ok if they reach each other, then that browsing context must be the chosen one."

[16:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
The "related enough" bit allows Chrome to consider browsing contexts associated with separate browser windows to be unrelated

[16:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, that bug points at SharedWorker which is possibly a reasonable way to communicate between independent windows)

[16:52:00.0000] <rektide>
yeah i'm catching up on the SharedWorker work now

[16:56:00.0000] <rektide>
where is SharedWorkers spec being worked on?

[17:01:00.0000] <rektide>
are SharedWorkers implemented anywhere yet ?

[17:01:01.0000] <rektide>
it'd be nice if i didnt have to kludge together some monstrosity that polls the session store

[17:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/Overview.html

[17:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/

[17:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has no idea about implementations

[17:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
rektide: they are implemented in WebKit nightlies

[17:08:00.0000] <dimich>
rektide: SharedWorkers are enabled in chrome 4

[17:10:00.0000] <rektide>
well, at least i have no excuse to stop coding

[17:10:01.0000] <rektide>
i still think is silly postMessage can only talk to child documents

[17:11:00.0000] <rektide>
but i can at least keep going

[18:43:00.0000] <Traveler-->
hello

[18:43:01.0000] <Traveler-->
Anybody online in here?

[21:51:00.0000] <TheOutlawTorn>
Good morning.

[01:53:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: ye be aboot?

[01:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey

[01:55:00.0000] <wycats>
I'm working on a project to create an OSS book toolchain and I got a (long) email from a guy in the Ruby community who suggests just using HTML5

[01:55:01.0000] <wycats>
was curious if you consider such a thing an actual goal of HTML5

[01:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
you're asking if HTML would be an adequate authoring format for a book?

[01:56:01.0000] <wycats>
yes

[01:56:02.0000] <wycats>
HTML4 is not

[01:57:00.0000] <wycats>
I had started to build my own markup and this guy (rightly) pointed out that perhaps HTML5 is already suitable

[01:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why not use something that's designed for that purpose?

[01:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
like LaTeX or DocBook or Word or whatever

[01:58:02.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: LaTeX is unpleasant to work with

[01:58:03.0000] <wycats>
Word is not suitable for version control

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
I was about to say that I thought HTML4 was fine for writing a book, personally

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
Hakon and Bert wrote their CSS book in HTML

[02:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
Mark is writing his HTML5 book in HTML

[02:03:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: there are a number of new HTML5 elements that are particularly helpful

[02:04:00.0000] <wycats>
the one thing I'm missing -- perhaps you can provide guidance -- is a way to say that some <code> is actually stored elsewhere

[02:04:01.0000] <wycats>
so I can stick my code in a VCS and have a build process pull them in

[02:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
i just use <!--INCLUDE ...path...-->

[02:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
or some such

[02:04:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: hm

[02:04:05.0000] <Hixie>
for example the HTML5 spec pulls in the examples from http://whatwg.org/demos/

[02:05:00.0000] <wycats>
seems non-semantic :P

[02:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
(not all of them, but some)

[02:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
"semantic"?

[02:05:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I was just being annoying for no reason

[02:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[02:05:05.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: there's no way to express it without comments?

[02:05:06.0000] <wycats>
perhaps an <a>?

[02:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
if it's an authoring format that you preprocess before you publish, you can express it however you like

[02:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
because it's effectively just your proprietary format

[02:06:02.0000] <wycats>
yep

[02:06:03.0000] <wycats>
I'm my own UA ;)

[02:08:00.0000] <wycats>
<pre data-ref=... data-file=...> or somesuch

[02:09:00.0000] <wycats>
I know! I can use RDFa ;) ;)

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
RDFa and microdata wouldn't be good for this because they don't correspond to specific parts of the document

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
data-* wouldn't be bad

[02:12:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: yeah

[02:12:02.0000] <wycats>
esp. in combo with the pre tag

[02:12:03.0000] <wycats>
which I could use for inline stuff if I didn't want to bother with linking to a file

[02:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use <xmp> :-)

[02:22:00.0000] <wycats>
<xmp>?

[02:22:01.0000] <wycats>
omg adobe

[03:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
wycats: It's just like <pre> but without having to escape the content

[03:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
Nothing to do with Adobe

[03:03:00.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: It's in HTML5?

[03:03:01.0000] <wycats>
I don't see it

[03:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's been deprecated for decades

[03:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
damn, mjs left

[03:03:04.0000] <wycats>
apparently deprecated since 3.2

[03:03:05.0000] <wycats>
:P

[03:03:06.0000] <Philip`>
(but still works)

[03:04:00.0000] <wycats>
hm... it actually seems good

[03:04:01.0000] <wycats>
why was it deprecated?

[03:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe because you can't put the string "</xmp>" inside an xmp element, and so the HTML people preferred to go with the more powerful <pre> instead

[03:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's still kind of useful for quick tests and private documents and things, though :-)

[03:07:00.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: having to escape <pre>s makes them much less useful

[03:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
and much easier to remember than XML's <![CDATA[...]]>

[03:07:02.0000] <wycats>
because you can't copy/paste large chunks of code

[03:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose <pre> is okay if you have a text editor with an "escape selected text" feature

[03:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
which any decent HTML editing environment ought to have

[03:08:02.0000] <wycats>
hehe

[03:08:03.0000] <wycats>
sure

[03:08:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me has never had a decent HTML editing environment

[03:09:00.0000] <wycats>
you have to unescape to edit though

[03:09:01.0000] <wycats>
and it's less readable in raw form

[03:37:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I'm going to bang out a bunch more comments over the weekend -- any luck on getting the comment form to open tickets as me?

[03:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
i made it so that if you have an account with the specification annotation system it'll mention your e-mail address and CC you on the bug

[05:51:00.0000] <virtuelv>
/me uses a couple of komodo macros to escape/unescape

[05:53:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the other convenient thing about it is that it's based on XUL, so I have a DOM I can wrangle

[06:59:00.0000] <s|k>
komodo macros?

[08:11:00.0000] <asmodai>
mitsuhiko: So what brings you here? :P

[15:48:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
asmodai: html5lib :)


2010-02-14
[17:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
can anyone find the enumerated attribute which allows the empty string as a valid keyword?

[17:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've looked all over with no luck

[17:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
i know there was one once... did we remove it?

[17:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I remember there being a bug about this - did it not mention the affected attribute?

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems not

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, contenteditable

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
spellcheck to

[18:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
o

[19:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
so you can get and set cookies on the document returned by XHR?

[19:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think in Firefox you can

[19:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in IE the cookie property is not present

[19:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
in WebKit it fails, unless we already changed to match Firefox

[19:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
what should html5 require?

[19:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I vaguely recall discussing this before

[19:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
firefox doesn't seem to have a .cookie actually

[19:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh let me try an xhtml doc

[19:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the WebKit bug had a bunch of data

[19:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
xhtml doesn't seem to have .cookie either

[19:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
i get an XMLDocument in both cases

[19:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32115

[19:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure if all the test cases were posted

[19:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
someone claimed the following behavior for FF3.5:

[19:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
  * deleted iframe: no exception, setting and getting allowed

[19:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
  * createDocument: no exception, setting and getting allowed

[19:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
  * XMLHttpRequest: no exception, setting and getting allowed

[19:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i commented

[19:43:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
does draggable not allow the empty string as a keyword?

[19:44:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
and/or can't it be specified using empty-attribute syntax

[19:56:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
Hixie: ↑

[19:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
is the spec ambiguous?

[19:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
if it is please file a bug, i'm in the middle of a complicated edit :-)

[19:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hai

[20:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8837 is a pain

[22:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Massive bug activity lately...

[22:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
people keep filing new ones

[22:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
makes it hard to get the count down!

[22:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
somehow people only file new ones when i'm working on fixing them

[23:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's not so strange

[23:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It feels more useful then since you see other people get responses

[23:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[23:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Current bug counts:

[23:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>

Hixie: I'm closing some obvious INVALIDs and DUPLICATEs for you

[23:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool, thanks

[23:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just go through them in order of last modified

[23:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
119 now

[00:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
XML syntax for CSS... *shudder*

[01:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[01:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
three browsers

[01:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
three results

[01:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
gotta love the web

[01:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
(http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/373)

[01:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
firefox passes the arguments in the order a,c,b

[01:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
sorry, firefox passes the arguments in the order a,c,b,type

[01:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
safari passes the arguments in the order b,c,a,type

[01:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
and opera does a,b,c,type,pluginspace

[01:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Attribute order is relevant? Wow

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/374 -- gecko: type,e,a,d,b; webkit: b,d,a,e,type; opera: a,b,c,d,e,type,pluginspace

[01:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
wtf is opera doing

[01:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me decides opera is disqualified from this round of testing

[01:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't that what IE would do?

[01:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno what IE would do, I don't have a way to test IE

[01:12:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Preserving attribute ordering even when removed for compat with COM references or whatnot

[01:12:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Not specific to <object>, just in general

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/375 -- webkit: x,b,d,a,e,type;  gecko: doesn't launch plugin at all

[01:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
preserving attribute ordering is one thing. Sending attributes that aren't even on the element is another.

[01:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
what webkit does makes complete sense

[01:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
and is self-consistent

[01:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think we'll go with that

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
can <wbr> be expressed in CSS?

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
101 bugs, oldest one was changed less than a week ago

[02:41:01.0000] <annevk>
wbr{ white-space: nowrap } iirc

[02:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
um

[02:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me passes annevk some coffee

[02:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, some of these bugs are like brain teasers in terms of trying to work out wtf the bug is about

[02:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I think that's <nobr>, annevk

[02:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
<wbr> seems more like "End previous [anonymous] inline box. Start a new anonymous inline box."

[02:53:00.0000] <annevk>
oh lol

[02:53:01.0000] <annevk>
lots of adobe email on public-html

[02:53:02.0000] <annevk>
aah, shelley powers

[02:54:00.0000] <annevk>
of course

[02:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
it must be march

[02:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
how time flies!

[02:54:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe she's a precog, so she knew she would be busy with Adobe posts beforehand

[02:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: That was an attempted answer earlier, by the way.

[02:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
the <wbr> thing?

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[02:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
i went with a somewhat different approach, but also prose

[02:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
i was hoping there was a pure-css solution

[02:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
(if anyone finds one, please file a bug)

[03:01:00.0000] <annevk>
omg, whining over the sotd

[03:02:00.0000] <annevk>
public-html is such a waste of my time :/

[03:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
multiple independent whinings over the sotd

[03:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: What do you mean by pure-css, by the way?

[03:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: as in, something you could put in a text/css file

[03:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
specifically, ua.css

[03:03:04.0000] <Dashiva>
And the problem is <nobr>x<wbr>x</nobr>, right?

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's one of the things that we would need to resolve, yes

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
aw man

[03:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
bug 8911

[03:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me glares at anne

[03:07:00.0000] <annevk>
oh heh

[03:07:01.0000] <annevk>
I filed the same problem twice

[03:07:02.0000] <annevk>
see also http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8904

[03:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
excellent

[03:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me marks 8911 as a dupe of 8904, thus modifying both of them and moving them both off the top of the bug list

[03:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What a copout

[03:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-D

[03:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
i have to deal with 8904 anyway sometime this weekend

[03:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's the P1 i promised anne i'd fix

[03:09:04.0000] <annevk>
it's blocking any work on XHR, including AnonXMLHttpRequest

[03:09:05.0000] <annevk>
I can wait another week

[03:09:06.0000] <annevk>
if you want

[03:10:00.0000] <annevk>
i'll work on CSSOM instead

[03:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll do it sometime this weekend

[03:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
(which ends on tuesday morning for you, since it's a long weekend for me)

[03:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8924 seems like an interesting idea, though it would cause problems in XHTML

[03:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How so?

[03:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
node.dataset.doquery.range

[03:19:02.0000] <annevk>
yeah, what Philip` said would be neat

[03:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
plus some IDL magic to make it reconstruct it to an attribute name with "-"

[03:19:04.0000] <Philip`>
The problem is you'd want node.dataset.doquery to also act like a string for the attribute data-doquery

[03:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, we don't want more magic, really...

[03:20:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The location object is bad enough

[03:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes magic

[03:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But how is camelcase accessors problematic in XHTML?

[03:23:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe the API is case-sensitive in XHTML currently?

[03:23:01.0000] <annevk>
camelcase wfm too

[03:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh actually there's no xhtml problem

[03:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
:)

[03:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
because data-aBc is explicitly not exposed in dataset

[03:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
sweet

[03:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh, no, i'm wrong

[03:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
but i can be right

[03:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
just have to change the spec a little

[03:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
/me is still wondering what the (possibly false) problem was

[03:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
data-aa-bb clashing with data-aaBb

[03:28:00.0000] <annevk>
though those were disallowed

[03:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but they're still exposed in dataset currently

[03:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll just exclude any with capital letters from dataset and we'll be golden

[03:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
A custom data attribute is an attribute in no namespace whose name starts with the string "data-", has at least one character after the hyphen, is XML-compatible, and contains no characters in the range U+0041 to U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z).

[03:29:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Doesn't that already exclude it?

[03:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's the authoring conformance requirement

[03:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't say jack about what dataset does

[03:30:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
for example, with dataset properties set programatically

[03:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So make the access algorithm replace capital letter with - followed by lowercase letter? That way it can't map to invalid attributes at all

[03:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, no... initial capital letter would give data--... but it wouldn't map to a uppercase letter 

[03:33:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
is data--foo invalid?

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: so data-aB="" would become dataset['a-b']? Then it would clash with data-a-b="".

[03:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
GarethAdams|Home: the definition of what's valid is what Dashiva quoted above

[03:33:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: data-aB wouldn't become anything, it would just be an attribute that's never used

[03:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused as to what you're suggesting

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
the solution i'm following is trivial

[03:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
just exclude content attributes with a capital letter from the API

[03:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
and then do the adjustments

[03:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm suggesting you change the "Let name be the concatenation" steps to also replace uppercase letters with hyphen followed by lowercase equivalent

[03:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
datalist.doQuery would map to data-do-query

[03:36:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
Dashiva is saying that dataset['aB'] would be identical to dataset['a-b'] - with the data-aB attribute still being invalid

[03:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes, that has to be part of the solution also

[03:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
except dataset['a-b'] wouldn't be there

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
not sure whether to make setting that throw an exception, silently fail, or silently passthrough

[03:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm leaning towards exception

[03:37:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Why not allow it?

[03:37:03.0000] <annevk>
yeah, SYNTAX_ERR

[03:38:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, enforce some consistency

[03:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
allowing it leads to a confusing situation where you can compare two strings, be sure they're not the same, then set both and trample each other

[03:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
very bad

[03:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Although WebIDL would make it fail anyhow, since a-b wouldn't be in the supported property name list

[03:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Could make dataset['a-b'] map onto attribute data-a--b

[03:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
because that should avoid conflicts and avoid forbidding certain strings

[03:41:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
I was about to say, transparently switching a-b and aB wouldn't help with multiple consecutive -

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: i use the same algorithm for creation

[03:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
although actually that probably wouldn't work

[03:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: and map ---x to --x when reading? that way leads madness

[03:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
because you'd need to do something with data-a-0 attributes, which presumably can only can be dataset["a-0"], and that needs to be reversible

[03:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Map - followed by non-uppercase to _? :)

[03:43:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Um, non-lowercase

[03:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Does IE have some rules for mapping '-'-separated strings onto camelCase strings?

[03:43:03.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
well not all dataset keys are mappable to DOM properties, so you don't need to provide for all possibilities

[03:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
for expandos or whatever they are

[03:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what the exact rules are

[03:46:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
for most CSS properties, the rule is -[a-z] maps to [A-Z] - that's all. Trying to cover multiple hyphens, numbers etc isn't going to be possible because NameChar in HTML isn't the same as e.g. Javascript

[03:50:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, by the way, in XHR I said that .cookie returns the empty string and does nothing on setting

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, but it would prolly be slightly better if HTML5 defined that

[03:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool, i can do that

[03:51:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, or gave me a way to mark the document in a certain way

[03:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
can you comment on the bug to that effect?

[03:53:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
maybe of interest? http://www.webdevout.net/test?0a&raw

[03:53:01.0000] <annevk>
oh actually, it seems it just does it for non same-origin, that seems broken because we disallow access to cookie headers

[03:53:02.0000] <annevk>
i'll comment on the bug

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
is Csaba a common name in some locale?

[03:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
we have two people named that in the spec's acks

[03:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
and i've never met anyone with that name as far as i recall

[03:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
but i've only lived in western locales

[03:54:04.0000] <Philip`>
Wikipedia says Hungarian

[03:55:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, you just closed the bug

[03:55:01.0000] <annevk>
was it not about http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8924 ?

[03:56:00.0000] <annevk>
oops

[03:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

i wonder in that caching thread if there is any observable difference

"It would need to be stated that if autoplay is used, loadhint is automatically set to autobuffer."

[05:57:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't buffering at all rather redundant when you start playing immediately?

[06:36:00.0000] <annevk>
this atom:id concept utterly failed in practice

Someone at Google really needs to sort out the problem where emails from Google employees to public mailing lists are very commonly marked by Gmail as "Due to a filter you created, this message was not sent to Spam." and often "Warning: This message may not be from whom it claims to be."

[09:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Man, I know.  I get bit by that all the time.

[09:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or rather, it did, until I set up my filter to never send them to spam.

[11:30:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: reviewing your comments

[11:45:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I think what I was really asking for wrt same-origin-policy was the use of "same-origin", not "same-origin-policy"

[12:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
othermaciej: if your findings on issue-30 are relevant, I think posting them to the list would be helpful

[12:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
More than that I would be interesting to see your analysis

Seriously I've strted sounding like I have been through Google translate a few times

[12:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I took the relevant variables to be "longdescs attributes per img" and "valid longdesc values per longdesc attribute", assumed values were only 0 or 1, and reverse-engineered the mean, standard deviation, and standard error

[12:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
But with more typos

[12:13:03.0000] <wycats>
jgraham: is that possible?

[12:13:04.0000] <othermaciej>
writing it out in enough detail to stand up to scrutiny might be more work than the value we'd get out of it

[12:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Sure, if ou don't want the bother, don't do it on my account

[12:15:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the question asked should be a different one, though

[12:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
my most interesting conclusion is that if in fact 75% of longdesc values are useful, then Ian would have had to oversample bad longdesc values by a factor of around 400 relative to good longdesc values to get his result

[12:16:01.0000] <virtuelv>
even with longdesc being used in a useful manner in 75% of the cases used, why is longdesc used on less than 1% of pages?

[12:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
400x oversampling seems like it would be unlikely short of outright research fraud, given the reported methodology

[12:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Ian's study concluded that of the longdesc values that are provided, less than 1% are useful

[12:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think that's potentially the more relevant point - if longdesc were rare, but very often useful rather than bogus when provided, then one could argue it does more good than harm, despite being obscure

[12:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I should also mention that because of the very large sample sizes, the standard error is ridiculously small, so some form of systematic error is the only way the study's conclusion could be wrong

[12:20:00.0000] <wycats>
what's the background :/

[12:21:00.0000] <wycats>
sorry for asking that in the middle of an existing discussion :/

[12:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Shelley's claim that Ian's research study on longdesc suffers from some sort of bias that makes it invalid

[12:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but apparently sample bias wasn't what she had in mind

[12:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The data for the second analysis was made public, so anyone could verify the results if they don't believe there's sample bias

[12:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Shelley did claim that one had a sample bias (she said it is "not representative of the web, at large")

[12:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That would be bias _against_ longdesc, though

[12:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Since most the longdesc advocacy I've seen has been "Yes, it isn't used normally, but professionals on professional sites use it, and that's enough to make it useful"

[12:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Shelley did claim that the dmoz data wasn't representative.

[12:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If I believed she was actually honestly engaging the list, I'd argue that it's breadth means it's still likely reasonably representative, and suggest comparing results from it to results from a random web sampling to verify.

[12:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can't do a "random web sampling".  Random how?

[12:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
she also said that the dotnetdotcom.org data was "anecdotal" because "we don't have access to the methodology determining the web bots path, we have no idea how often its blocked, it doesn't take into count the use of intranet data" 

[12:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.  And again, if I felt she was actually being honest in bringing that up, I'd ask why she believed that the bot, when it is blocked, would bias the result in a particular direction (and again, one could compare its results to other studies that are more reliably representative to look for bias).

[12:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Make a statement of what the web is like, then change your sample methodology until it matches

[12:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
her use of "anecdotal" to refer to large data sets where she is not fully confident that the methodology provides a representative random sample is an unusual use of the term, I think

[12:42:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Um, why not?  First approach: unifoermly sample from Google's cache of pages.

[12:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one could form a hypothesis that certain things missed by the bot would be more likely to contain longdesc attributes, and more likely to contain valid longdesc values in those cases where the attribute is present

[12:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Second approach: take a large directory, wide enough to remove many forms of systemic bias, and uniformly sample from all linked pages.

[12:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, "random" isn't well-defined.  You have to further specify.  See also: Bertrand's paradox.

[12:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: In the absence of further clarification, lay usage of "random" means "sampled from a uniform distribution".  Assuming otherwise is being uselessly pedantic.

[12:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure.  Uniform over what set?

[12:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
The same is true in Betrand's paradox.

[12:44:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Over some representatively large set of pages.

[12:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you mean uniform over all pages, with no weighting?  All pages everyone has viewed in the last X days, maybe?  Including if it was only viewed by search spiders, or also humans?  Including intranets too, or only the public Internet?  How large is X?

[12:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some of those considerations will materially affect the resulting set, especially whether you include intranet pages.

[12:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
X is sufficiently large.  For most of your questions I would hypothesize that it would not affect the sample for the types of variables we're testing.

[12:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hypotheses about intranet contents tend not to be falsifiable

[12:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There are well-established methods of figuring out how large is "sufficient" based on the desired strength of the test you're performing.

[12:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not if you don't define the set in the first place.

[12:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, "a billion" is pretty much always large enough.

[12:47:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not if it's nowhere close to representative.

[12:47:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Do you believe that the sets that have been sampled are non-representative for the relevant variables?

[12:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't believe they're non-representative enough to create such a skewed result incorrectly, no.  But if you're trying to convince me, you're wasting your time, because I already agree with you.

[12:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not trying to establish a new test here, just defend the existing tests as being acceptable in their methodology.

[12:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's defintiely possible for a sample to be very large, but still not random with respect to the variable under study

[12:48:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, I was objecting to your use of the term "random" as though there were only one way to sample a "random" set of pages.

[12:48:04.0000] <othermaciej>
there is a limit to how much you can control for that

[12:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one possibility is to guess what variables may be correlated, and try to sample from subpopulations to preserve the right ratio

[12:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: You were being pedantic.  ^_^  Like I said, you *know* what "random" means when used like that, and you also know roughly what sort of page distribution we're talking about, and have at least some idea of how to construct a reasonably "representative" set of pages.

[12:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
calling something a "random sample" doesn't imply that there is only one way to do it, at least not in any statistics I've heard of

[12:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Indeed.

[12:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But still, unless one has reason to believe that the used population *is* biased in that variable, one cannot reasonably suggest that the study sampling from that population is biased.

[12:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
For some definitions of "random" there's no feasible way to construct a random selection of pages, particularly not if you include intranets.

[12:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
intranets are for practical purposes outside the realm of science

[12:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
We typically don't include intranets for that reason.

[12:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's my point.  :)

[12:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
because general hypotheses about intranets are for practical purposes not falsifiable

[12:52:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
There may be a bias introduced through that, but one must also consider the population of disabled web users as a whole and ask if this bias is likely to affect them.

[12:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway.

[12:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is, is an average disabled web user going to be affected by a higher or lower prevalance of correct @longdesc usage in intranets?

[12:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd argue not.

[12:53:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Counterargument: disabled users aren't average

[12:53:04.0000] <othermaciej>
you don't have to assume anything about intranets really, just accurately state the result as being about publicly available web content

[12:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Are they non-average in a way that would bias them strongly towards using intranets, and thus being more highly affected by them than a normal web user?

[12:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
then anyone who wants to make a separate hypothesis about intranet content has the burden of proof to demonstrate their hypothesis

[12:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if they feel that would provide relevant evidence

[12:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
TabAtkins: If the assumption is that intranets are better at longdesc, I'd assume there would be a similar assumption about disabled users

[12:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But nobody is of course providing any data, just complaints about the data that does exist

[12:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that disabled users are more likely to use intranets?

[12:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: You would assume that, given that assumption, disabled users are more affected by intranets than non-disabled people?

[12:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that might be a testable hypothesis

[12:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That sounds testable, yeah.

[12:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I doubt it's true, and don't believe it's relevant for our purposes, though.

[12:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I think the strongest argument against sample bias is that nobody has produced a sample biased the opposite direction

[12:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Rather, I doubt it's true, and *strongly* doubt it's true *enough* to matter to us.)

[12:57:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: I'll bet Shelley could produce one.

[12:57:03.0000] <Dashiva>
And a real sample, not just a dozen sites

[12:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well like I said before - for studies to be getting these results through sample bias, if the true situation is much different, the oversampling factor for bad longdesc values would have to be huge

[13:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There might not be enough longdescs in existence :)

[13:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, 1 in 1000 pages contain @longdesc, apparently.  That's a decent population.

[13:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Rather, that's the proportion given by one study.)

[13:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, given the estimated 1e12 pages on the web, about 1e9 of them contain a @longdesc attribute.

[13:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one study specifically identified 1.3e6 img elements as having a longdesc attribute

[13:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, out of roughly 1e9 pages sampled.

[13:03:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hey, HTML WG made daringfireball

[13:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, but that's just attribute presence

[13:04:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Conforming, useful instances are a tiny fraction of that again

[13:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
point being - that's a lotta longdesc, most of it apparently bogus

[13:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Ian's study estimates that something like one in a million images have a potentially useful longdesc

[13:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Bertrand's paradox doesn't apply here.  In there you have a continuous variable that you're attempting to sample, and so the distribution you use to sample it matters quite a lot.  A discrete variable, on the other hand, can be given a very simple uniform distribution.  The example given by Bertrand matters because there *is* no uniform distribution over all possible chords of a...

[13:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
...circle.

[13:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
However, I unfortunately will have to leave before I see a rebuttal, as I've got to head out to meet with my parents.  Feel free to disagree with me, though, and I'll see it when I get back.  ^_^

[13:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's correct, but you have no feasible algorithm for uniformly sampling pages on the web.

[13:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If I have all the pages, I certainly do.  I don't have all the pages, of course, so we can then argue over whether the pages I have access to are representative, but that's a different issue I think.

[13:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So the same general principle applies: you're suggesting someone sample something at random, but since uniform sampling is impossible (practically in this case, logically in Bertrand's), it's not clear what distribution you're asking for.

[13:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The obvious algorithm would be to collect all the pages and then sample in a usual fashion, yes.  But presumably you were not suggesting that Shelley do that.

[13:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
studies do random samples of persons residing in the United States, but I am not sure anyone has an accurate, up-to-date and complete list

[13:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nor is every person in the United States equally convenient to reach

[13:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They try to find representative cross-sections, but only by carefully controlling certain variables and hoping those are the relevant ones.  The people who agree to participate in studies aren't representative, after all.

[13:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
usually you try to estimate how much your sampling methodology might correlate with the variable of interest

[13:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and apply that to your error estimates

[13:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably this all sounds more reasonable to a scientist than to a mathematician.

[13:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you don't generally say "I am not sure if my sample is perfectly representative, therefore I assume my error bar is unbounded"

[13:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(a pure mathematician, specifically)

[13:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, no, that's a silly thing to say.

[13:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
perhaps Ian should have reported an estimated error for his study, then one could debate the size of the confidence interval rather than the statistically dubious question of "valid or invalid"

[13:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe he studied physics so I assume he knows how to do that sort of thing

[13:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: It is worth noting that "all the pages on the internet" is a countably infinite set of pages

[13:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, naturally you have to define it as something like "all pages viewed in the last X days".

[13:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Theoretically, yes.

[13:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although that's not a very practical thing to do

[13:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Instead you get samples like "all the pages in the Google index" and assume that doesn't contain, say, 50% identical pages from a single calendar site that has an infinite number of possible pages

[13:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Which is a reasonable assumption because an index that did have that kind of bias would be utterly useless as the basis for a search engine

[13:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder how Google actually handles that. A maximum number of pages per domain, maybe?

[13:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I imagine it's complicated.

[13:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess their bots only go so deep

[13:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
is there really such a thing as a server that could produce an infinite number of pages, even in theory?

[13:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Well it depends what you mean by "pages" presumably

[13:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
surely there are resource limits that fall short of the infinity point

[13:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, if you allow an unlimited amount of time, sure.

[13:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Assuming there's no reason the server can't exist for an unlimited amount of time.

[13:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
E.g., no heat death of the universe or anything like that.

[13:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
If you take a HTTP view of the universe where each thing at  given URL is the same even if it is actually different then you are limited by the number of unique urls

[13:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, what about POST?

[13:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I was going to say at the very least it has to fit the whole URL in memory, thus can serve resources for only a finite number of URLs, but I suppose it could stream the URL

[13:39:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, also pages can have different representations.

[13:39:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean: <?php while (true) { echo rand(); }

[13:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: In what context?

[13:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or for more elegance: <?php while (true) { echo rand(0, 9); }

[13:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's a lot of different pages.

[13:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Clearly we must be talking about the actual streams of bits, not just the URLs.

[13:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but a finite number

[13:40:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
After all, one document at the URL might contain longdesc, and another not.

[13:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why is it a finite number, if there's no buffering and the server is given unlimited time?

[13:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heat death of the universe?

[13:41:02.0000] <Dashiva>
The number of URLs is only limited by server restrictions, though

[13:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
ah, I failed to think of the while(true)

[13:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think to have a definition suitable for a study, you need to sample pages as they are at the time you visit a URL, because even normal pages can change and you don't want to sample over and over til the Web stops changing

[13:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that would likely be a long wait

[13:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: "the size of the confidence interval" - if I remember correctly that's proportional to 1/sqrt(n), and if n=1e9 then it's going to be pretty close to zero and uninteresting and completely insignificant compared to even tiny systematic biases

[13:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: yes, the standard error is tiny if you assume no sample bias

[13:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or rather, I should say, the standard error is tiny, and if you don't assume sample bias or measurement error or something of that nature, that's about the only thing that factors into your confidence interval

[13:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think that is almost always true though, in the sense that if you are in a regime where your measurement is only just significant within random errors, it is almost certianly insignificant due to systematic errors you weren't accounting for

[13:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: I did compute the standard error, and both with the 1 billion sample of pages and the 13 billion subsample of pages containing longdesc it is very small

[13:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
Is it possible to come up with a confidence interval based on any other kind of error, that is not completely meaningless?

[13:57:03.0000] <jgraham>
("90% of 2 sigma results are noise")

[13:57:04.0000] <othermaciej>
well, you could assume a statistical distribution of sample bias, but I have no idea if that is meaningful

[13:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: "longdesc value is bogus" seems to be a 6025 sigma result

[13:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Sure, I am not suggesting this result is in that regime

[13:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or rather, longdesc value is bogus more often than it is useful

[13:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems the more fundamental problem is that nobody can even define what population they care about bias from

[13:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sorry, 6525 sigma or so

[13:59:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: That itself may be telling

[14:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
6525 sigma?  Seriously?

[14:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
except for some easily definable populations ("all the pages in Google's cache", "all the pages in dmoz.org", etc) where it's trivial (and in some cases you don't even need random sampling because you can test the entire population)

[14:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
which by the way, if you compute the confidence level for that sigma level, I think the number by which it is less than 100% probably doesn't have a name

[14:00:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Five sigmas is enough

[14:00:04.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: that's the number of standard errors out 50% valid londesc would be, given Hixie's study

[14:00:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've heard that five sigmas is enough for particle physicists.

[14:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not really sure how you statistically model the possibility of sample bias

[14:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/trivial/trivial to get a uniform random sample/

[14:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Yeah, that sounds about right

[14:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
(well people will believe 3 sigma results too but not really be that surprised if they vanish)

[14:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
(so if you were to propose for funding on the basis "we could measure X to 3 sigma given ideal performance" there might be some skepticism)

[14:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
In fact I think I might have had applications for telescope timed down on roughly that basis

[14:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/timed/time turned/

[14:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
how do physicists deal with the fact that there may be systematic bias?

[14:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
assume irrelevant if you've got enough sigmas? try to eliminate? guess and account for in calculations?

[14:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: If you know about it, I think it is close to "guess and try to account for it"

[14:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Bug tracker down?  http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8784

[14:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
But often you simply don't know; I remember being told that if you plot the best measurement of the speed of light over time it is flat wihin error bars for short periods, then jumps by more than the nominal error bars then is flat again, and so on

[14:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
I seem to remember not being able to find a URL to back that up though

[14:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've heard similar things about Millikan's oil-drop experiment.

[14:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
this talk of experimental error reminds me of this old joke: http://www.gdargaud.net/Humor/OddPrime.html

[14:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: That sounds like proof that the speed of light is changing

[14:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: I think the measurement of the fundamental charge too a slow crawl from Milikan's measurement to the current value

[14:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, that's the kind of page that should have stopped after about five lines.

[14:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
all the versions of the joke I have heard stop at the engineer

[14:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is ashamed he knew waht the joke was just by reading the URL

[14:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me isn't

[14:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, me too.

[14:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
although I like the Programmer entry on that page

[14:11:04.0000] <jgraham>
And you heard that URLs are just opaque strings...

[14:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I had also only seen the first three)

[14:35:00.0000] <hober>
I've made a bunch of progress on my zero-edit counter proposal for ISSUE-95 (hidden="").

[16:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
this style sheets blocking scripts stuff is a huge pain

[16:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
should they block appendChild()ed scripts?

[16:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
or only parser-inserted scripts?

[16:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hober: linking the design principles will be persuasive to some but may just set off others, so if your goal is persuasion I'd suggest dropping those

[16:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
someone objected to hidden=""?! o_O

[16:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
the one thing that is clearly and unambiguously an accessibility improvement?

[16:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is it?  I mean, in real life, don't UAs for blind users screen-scrape graphical browsers and therefore ignore display:none anyway?

[16:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, ignore things that are display:none, as visual browsers do.

[16:25:00.0000] <NickYoung>
one would hope so

[16:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some people actually believe in aural stylesheets, don't they?  :)

[16:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: relying on the style sheet for anything that critical is not a long-term solution

[16:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not sure why not, since realistically, that's what authors do.  So everyone will have to support it anyway.  Not that I object to the attribute, it's one of the syntactic-sugar things in HTML5 that it's nice to think about actually being able to use in ten years or so.

[16:29:00.0000] <daedb_>
Are there *any* new features that hasn't had any objections?

[16:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's circular thinking. Authors can't do anything _but_ use CSS at the moment.

[16:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
daedb_: there's a lot of them that haven't been noticed by the people complaining, i think

[16:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I mean, so many authors rely so heavily on CSS to make their sites even basically functional that I can't imagine assistive technology would ever be able to get away with ignoring it.

[16:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, in well-written HTML, you're better off just ignoring the CSS.  I once had a blind user in #mediawiki asking how to turn off all CSS on his wiki for blind users.

[16:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
HTML5 has added numerous features to try to reduce the need for CSS

[16:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
(for that kind of semantic-level stuff)

[16:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I got into a discussion with him about AT, actually.  He said Windows AT is horrible and ridiculously expensive, Linux AT is horrible but at least free, and Mac AT is awesome and comes with the OS, IIRC.

[16:32:01.0000] <daedb_>
Hixie: Maybe that's true, I've just become even more cynical after seeing all the "remove X new feature/element" bugs and discussions that I have a complete lack of surprise when new objections come up.

[16:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: don't say that near the accessibility people, they'll say your blind user was biased against AT users

[16:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
(seriously, any time VO is brought up, the "experts" dismiss it as a toy)

[16:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
VO?  Is that Mac's accessibility thing?

[16:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I would expect Mac to have good built-in accessibility, actually.  It's the sort of thing Apple does well.

[16:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
VoiceOver

[16:34:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Whereas I'd also totally expect Windows to have cruddy built-in stuff so everyone has to pay a fortune to get their OS working at a basic level.

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i agree

[16:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And I'd also expect Linux to have something built-in that's sort of workable but not really very good.  So my expectations were totally satisfied.  :P

[16:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
and that has totally been my experience in practice, playing with the various ATs, too

[16:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
but we're not "experts", so our experiences and opinions are worthless

[16:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yt?

[16:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: yt?

[18:00:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: currently datetime in HTML requires the colon in timezone. In uF wiki it’s recommended to drop colon to avoid confusing timezone and time

[18:00:01.0000] <boblet>
http://microformats.org/wiki/value-class-pattern#Date_and_time_parsing

[18:02:00.0000] <boblet>
I’m guessing that HTML spec won’t include colonless style…

[18:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've never seen this happen in a Google cache result: http://74.125.113.132/search?q=cache:6v10d8GH4KEJ:aryeh.name/+aryeh+gregor&cd=7&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us

[18:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The thing at the top sort of got squished into the page.

[18:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, I see, it's not an iframe or anything, they just inject everything into the page as a div.

[18:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So my styling of <body> threw it off.

[18:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Freaky.

[18:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Great use-case for srcdoc="".  ;)

[19:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Huh, that's new.  Cache results always *used* to be iframed, iirc.

[20:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie, here now

[20:09:00.0000] <jcranmer>
wait, Hixie's a cat now?

[22:48:00.0000] <hober>
Hixie: "someone objected to hidden=""?! o_O" yeah, that's what I said. It's why I volunteered to write the counter-proposal--hidden="" is one of the most no-brainer of HTML5 improvements over HTML4.

[22:54:00.0000] <hober>
othermaciej: hmm. I aim to be persuasive to those who can be persuaded. I'd like to think that, regardless of someone's stance on the Design Principles document *as a whole*, that they still find the specific principles I cite to be reasonable.

[22:54:01.0000] <hober>
If not, I'm not sure if anything I can write will have any effect.

[22:55:00.0000] <hober>
That said, if I can reword things so that I make the same points in a way where I don't have to cite the principles, and if that's worth doing in the first place, I could do that, sure.

[22:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>

http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#serialize-a-css-value

[01:04:01.0000] <annevk>
anyone with ideas how to rewrite that in a more extensible way?

[01:05:00.0000] <annevk>
there's value primitives, e.g. CSS <uri> value, CSS <number> value, etc.

[01:05:01.0000] <annevk>
then properties combine those in weird ways

[01:06:00.0000] <annevk>
e.g. comma-separated, space-separated

[01:06:01.0000] <annevk>
some values nest in function-like values, e.g. rect(<number>, ...)

[01:33:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess I could just declare CSS a mess and do something else :)

[01:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Then you'd just be moving onto a less important mess :-)

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like the W3C is still in the mobile adaptation land: http://www.w3.org/2010/02/mbui/cfp

does anyone have keygen test cases?

[01:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>

Hixie: I like "James Graham did most of the work [...] the system is relatively fragile" :)

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone have an example of great video use in a Wikipedia article?

[02:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear is the best example I've found so far (the play-fight video; the nursing video is badly encoded)

[03:18:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, it seems implementations preserve more information than needed

[03:18:01.0000] <annevk>
e.g. absolute length values are not normalized

[03:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay. http://jilion.com/sublime/video now works in Firefox

[03:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
doesn't work in Opera :-(

[03:36:00.0000] <Necrathex>
hsivonen: very nice :o

[03:36:01.0000] <Necrathex>
firefox seems rather slow though (compared to chromium)

[03:45:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: also works on the iPhone - that's nice!

[03:46:00.0000] <nessy>
though I'm not sure how the source selection picks it since there is no media query or anything else on it 

[03:47:00.0000] <nessy>
works fine for me on Firefox 3.7

[03:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
nessy, it seems to use a script, presumably with UA sniffing, for the source selection.

[04:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
since it's using <source title="http://..."> rather than <source src="http://...">. I'm guessing it changes the title attributes to src attributes based on the detection

[04:00:01.0000] <nessy>
thanks for tracking it down - I admit I couldn't be bothered ;-)

[04:00:02.0000] <nessy>
ah, that's a good point

[04:00:03.0000] <Lachy>
that might explain why it doesn't work in Opera, if they haven't done good UA sniffing

[04:00:04.0000] <nessy>
I wonder if media queries would really help in this case

[04:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
they also aren't using whatever prefix Opera supports for rounder corners

[04:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
vendor prefixes for the lose

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so I've promised to give my lecture about HTML5 again tomorrow at my alma mater

[04:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how much I should edit my slides from the last year...

[04:02:02.0000] <nessy>
:)

[04:03:00.0000] <nessy>
I'm going to have a similar challenge next week :)

[04:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I'll zap the drag&drop demo

[04:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe I should also zap the postMessage demo and show pieces of code instead

[04:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, it would be nice to have a less violent canvas demo than Wolf3D

[04:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should talk and show more <video> stuff

[04:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and I should say something about microdata and RDFa

[04:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but I don't really know what to say without getting too much into politics

[04:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
just talk about the benefits of Microdata, and don't focus on RDFa much at all

[04:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
that reminds me, I need to write up my proposal for Web Directions South later. The deadline for that is coming up soon

[04:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me 's canvas demo is entirely non-violent, because he was too lazy to implement guns

[04:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I thought you at least had a multiplayer version somewhere?

[04:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes, on my hard disk somewhere, but that didn't have guns either

[04:14:00.0000] <ment>
hsivonen: what's wrong with violent demos? :)

[04:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Just walking, and text chat)

[04:14:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I thought you hadn't implemented that.

[04:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But what the use of a multiplayer FPS without guns is I'm not sure

[04:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Second life in the browser?

[04:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
You could have an FPS with only melee weapons

[04:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what canvas 3D demo should I show?

[04:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
Could do something like Second Life, but I'm not sure what the point would be

[04:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(preferrably something that doesn't hang my Intel GPU)

[04:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
(since Second Life already exists)

[04:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so no complex shaders

[04:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and being in a web browser would just make it technologically worse)

[04:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: You mean WebGL, rather than 3D emulated in the 2D context?

[04:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: WebGL, yes

[04:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
Does it work at all on your GPU?

[04:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe I should have a 2D game demo for the 2D context instead of Wolf3D

[04:18:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it does

[04:18:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't remember when Intel started having GLSL support

[04:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: sicking's shader-based fractals hang the intel GPU, though

[04:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Aren't you already working on some game that is quite like a number of existing games?

[04:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe there are some X3DOM examples that could work? (since they don't rely on fancy shaders, and demonstrate the ability to provide APIs that are more user-friendly than raw OpenGL)

[04:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
does Opera support Drag&Drop yet?

[04:20:03.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: No

[04:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Yes, but it's not being artificially worsened by putting it in a web browser for no reason :-)

[04:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Maybe I'll throw in geolocation and Web Workers now that HTML5 proper doesn't contain everything I talked about last year anyway

[04:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me hasn't used SL-style programs since Alpha World on a dialup modem, where they hadn't even implemented teleportation so he had to run 10km to reach his house on the outskirts of the city, and where one day somebody discovered the .ini file that controls your avatar so everyone in the world changed themselves into chess pieces and lamp posts and floor tiles

[04:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they're a bit more advanced now?

[04:26:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, where are you presenting?

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: https://noppa.tkk.fi/noppa/kurssi/t-111.5360/esite

[04:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Floor tiles? How does that work?

[04:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: The world consisted entirely of a flat infinite plane of grass, plus a load of objects (textured meshes) that users could create and move and rotate and slightly script

[04:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
so floors were built out of lots and lots of flat square floor tiles

[04:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
and there was nothing stopping you picking one of those objects as your avatar

[04:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: So your avatar was a bunch of flat squares?

[04:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, a single flat square

[04:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's what I thought when you first mentioned it.

[04:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That must make seeing other people fun

[04:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
The developers fixed it after a few days, sadly :-(

[04:32:04.0000] <Philip`>
so you could only be the normal human shape

[04:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I have trouble finding WebGL demos that show something that's obviously not 2D canvas emulating 3D

[04:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
device-min-width makes some sense for <source media>

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/sdk/demos/google/shiny-teapot/index.html is probably most obviously using WebGL and not just emulating stuff in the 2D API

[05:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
For all of Shelley's talk about FUD, this message seems like a quite good candidate: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0423.html

[05:02:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, <canvas> exposes system colors, is that a privacy leak?

[05:05:00.0000] <workmad3>
annevk: it may be, if you set your system colours to hex-encoded versions of your credit-card numbers and SSN

[05:07:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems system colors are lost with .fillStyle

[05:07:01.0000] <annevk>
at least per spec

[05:07:02.0000] <annevk>
in opera they're always lost it seems

[05:07:03.0000] <Dashiva>
What about the text api?

[05:09:00.0000] <annevk>
system colors can presumably be used via fillStyle as another means to uniquely pin down people

[05:10:00.0000] <annevk>
unless we somehow forbid them in <canvas> and always return them as keywords through DOM APIs

[05:10:01.0000] <annevk>
it's annoying that when you try to do something relatively simple (serialization of <color>) so many side-issues come up

[05:12:00.0000] <workmad3>
I'm not sure how much of a privacy leak it is tbh

[05:13:00.0000] <annevk>
not a whole lot for sure

[05:13:01.0000] <workmad3>
you could possibly pin down the identity of some people with system colours, but you couldn't pin down the identity of everybody

[05:13:02.0000] <annevk>
no, but lots of other variables can be used

[05:13:03.0000] <workmad3>
as most people don't bother changing system colours or use one of a set of pre-defined defaults

[05:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wouldn't worry about privacy leak, rather that it lets people create more authentic-looking fake chrome

[05:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But I suppose they can do that already?

[05:15:01.0000] <zcorpan>
they can do that by just using the system colors

[05:15:02.0000] <annevk>
that's the whole point of system colors

[05:33:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: looking at http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/ and noticed 3.1 figure example has <legend> (plus <figcaption> should be in the list)

[05:33:01.0000] <boblet>
annevk: want me to file a bug somewhere?

[05:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
boblet: TR/ means out-of-date (unless we published very recently)

[05:35:00.0000] <boblet>
zcorpan: yeah, it’s Aug 2009 :) no similar use of bugtracker for TR/ stuff then huh?

[05:35:01.0000] <annevk>
we don't fix /TR/ drafts

[05:35:02.0000] <annevk>
see the editor's draft

[05:35:03.0000] <boblet>
annevk: ok

[05:36:00.0000] <annevk>
(not even typos are fixed, though sometimes that happens and it will be annotated with "edited in place" or some such, mostly restricted to actual RECs)

[05:36:01.0000] <boblet>
thanks for explaining the distinction—I trusted the Googl & it let me down

[05:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a feature, really

[05:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
At least that's what W3C says

[05:40:02.0000] <boblet>
I should have read the header more carefully

[05:41:00.0000] <annevk>
it's a bit annoying really

[05:41:01.0000] <annevk>
snapshots work when you do things in private

[05:42:00.0000] <annevk>
but when everything is in public and process happens daily, it's sort of a weird thing

[05:42:01.0000] <annevk>
and rather arbitrary

[05:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Especially when there are multiple drafts that need to be in sync

[05:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
It only works for private things if you don't care about the fact that all external feedback will be out of date

[05:46:01.0000] <annevk>
protecting against system colors would be rather hard for the canvas case btw

[05:46:02.0000] <annevk>
it would either have to forbid them completely or mark the <canvas> as unsafe or some such

[05:49:00.0000] <workmad3>
could the canvas spec not mandate that the user is informed when system colours are accessed and can allow/deny it when it occurs?

[05:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
No

[05:49:02.0000] <workmad3>
fair enough :)

[05:49:03.0000] <jgraham>
(becuase in general you can't mandate UI)

[05:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: People can make perfectly authentic-looking fake chrome by screenshotting Windows

[05:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
But in this specific case it would also be bad because, well, who wants to be asked a question like that

[05:50:02.0000] <workmad3>
'warning, this page is trying to look authentic, which may compromise your system security. Do you wish the page to look half decent? <yes>, <no>'

[05:50:03.0000] <annevk>
this stuff is such a mess

[05:51:00.0000] <workmad3>
I guess that wouldn't go down well :)

[05:51:01.0000] <annevk>
anyway, hopefully webkit/gecko people have something to say about it: http://www.w3.org/mid/op.u758kvnh64w2qv@annevk-t60

[05:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since this kind of attack is only statistical anyway and most people have UIs that look like the default windows UI you may as well just use the default windows UI look

[05:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/use/fake/

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can check their UA string if you want to be more specific about which version of Windows they use

[05:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed. And if for some reason you want to invest more effort than will result in payback you can determine OS X from the UA string too

[05:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
and fake than when needed

[05:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
But colours seem like one of the less important parts of UI spoofing - modern UI doesn't even use flat colours, so you care about gradients and shapes and hover effects and fonts

[05:56:00.0000] <boblet>
/me is following foolip’s Chinese proverb

[05:59:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, instead of #rrggbbaa we'll get .color.red .color.alpha etc. hopefully

[05:59:01.0000] <annevk>
(which can be set as well)

[05:59:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum, so the camelData supports multiple hyphens

[05:59:03.0000] <annevk>
camel?

[05:59:04.0000] <Philip`>
Like two-hump camels?

[05:59:05.0000] <Dashiva>
data--whatnot------doquery

[05:59:06.0000] <Dashiva>
data-Whatnot-----Doquery

[06:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That'll work too.  I'd still like to be able use #rrggbbaa in my stylesheets, though, rather than having to swap over to rgba() syntax and spend a few seconds converting from hex to dec.

[06:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Wouldn't #rrggbbaa conflict with the current required parsing of bogus colour strings?

[06:00:02.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, i see, no real opinion on adding extra syntax

[06:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Possibly.  Nuts to them, though.e

[06:01:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, it would fail in older browsers and work in newer

[06:01:02.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, which is how CSS extensions are supposed to work so that seems ok

[06:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Interestingly, in some cases it would "fail" by parsing as a different color.  Though I think it likely that it would just parse as the non-a version.

[06:02:01.0000] <boblet>
foolip: do you have any advice about hcard in microdata when you want to link the name? itemprop="fn" on separate wrapper?

[06:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though :gasp: :shock: :horror: that might require some grammar changes.

[06:02:03.0000] <annevk>
i don't see why changing the grammar is such a huge deal

[06:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's totally not.  Bert's just stupid conservative.  >_<

[06:03:01.0000] <annevk>
we should just do it when it makes sense

[06:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I mean that <body bgcolor=#aabbccdd> already has a specific meaning, which presumably is relied on by some pages and can't be changed, and it would be weird if CSS specified a different meaning for the same colour syntax

[06:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Seems it's equivalent to #aabcdd)

[06:08:00.0000] <annevk>
it doesn't seem too weird to me given that's just legacy

[06:12:00.0000] <boblet>
has anyone done microformats in microdata? <meta content=""> in spec’s hcard example isn’t working for me in foolip’s interpreter…

[06:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You have a name on it, right?

[06:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sorry, not name.  itemprop.

[06:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
What browser?

[06:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
Some move <meta> into <head> so it won't parse right

[06:16:00.0000] <boblet>
TabAtkins: yep <meta itemprop="type" content="work"> for hcard

[06:16:01.0000] <boblet>
Philip`: Chrome 5 Mac

[06:16:02.0000] <boblet>
will check dom…

[06:17:00.0000] <boblet>
(although hold on, this is in http://foolip.org/microdatajs/live/ so that shouldn’t matter, no?)

[06:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I assume it still uses your browser to parse the HTML)

[06:18:00.0000] <boblet>
Philip`: ah, you’re right

[06:18:01.0000] <boblet>
the doc currently has 12 <head>s O_o

[06:19:00.0000] <boblet>
Philip`: is there a way around that? apart from not using content=""?

[06:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could wait until everyone fixes their parsers

[06:20:01.0000] <annevk>
would be nice if CSS made it more clear what was syntax-level and what's part of the model

[06:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
otherwise you have to not use <meta>, as far as I'm aware

[06:20:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
You can use <span itemprop style=display:none;>content</span> for now, if you have to.

[06:21:00.0000] <boblet>
hrm, sucks that there’s no equivalent of uF’s value-title pattern

[06:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
The equivalent is <meta>, I thought

[06:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[06:21:03.0000] <boblet>
this is kind of a common need once you’re not using English

[06:22:00.0000] <boblet>
heh. I want to reply ‘a method that works,’ but half the uF tools can’t use value-title either

[06:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It works in the future!

[06:22:02.0000] <boblet>
TabAtkins: thanks for that :P

[06:22:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And a method that works now is what I just described with <span>.

[06:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
It works in browsers with HTML5 parsers

[06:23:01.0000] <boblet>
srsly thank you both for the info and the workaround

[06:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
which is, admittedly, none

[06:23:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, 1 if you set a pref.

[06:23:04.0000] <Philip`>
That doesn't count :-p

[06:23:05.0000] <boblet>
living in the future is harder than the 1960’s made it out to be

[06:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Really? Everyone here today managed it

[06:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And we don't even get flying cars.  HUUUUGE disappointment.

[06:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if people predicting flying cars ever looked at traffic accident statistics

[06:25:00.0000] <boblet>
one more q, are there any other tools for microdata apart from foolip’s that you know of?

[06:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
where's the htmlwg wiki again?

[06:26:00.0000] <boblet>
bookmarklets, H2VX-equivalent convertors etc…

[06:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
boblet: http://philip.html5.org/demos/microdata/demo.html

[06:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
boblet: Would you be happy with ancient obsolete ones?

[06:26:03.0000] <boblet>
Philip`: I’m always happy with your stuff

[06:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
I never am :-)

[06:27:00.0000] <boblet>
heh, know the feeling

[06:27:01.0000] <boblet>
cool that gives me another data point. no converting tools that output a vcard file for download yet tho huh

[06:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
As far as I can tell, Microdata was invented by people named Philip.

[06:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think Hixie is named Philip

[06:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not ones that take Microdata, unless by "download" you mean "copypasta from foolip's tool".

[06:28:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Shows what you know.  Philip is his middle name!

[06:28:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie Philip Hickson.

[06:28:04.0000] <Philip`>
I never knew that :-o

[06:28:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie Hickson

[06:30:00.0000] <boblet>
lol

[06:30:01.0000] <boblet>
well, if someone whips one up in the next 2 days let me know :)

[06:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could always whip up one yourself :-)

[06:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Go find one of the Microformat ones and mod it.

[06:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
Microdata should be simple enough that that wouldn't be much work

[06:32:02.0000] <boblet>
unfortunately I’m working on whipping up a preso on uF & microdata in HTML5

[06:32:03.0000] <boblet>
in Japanese :|

[06:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
If it's for a presentation then you could just fake it

[06:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
Nobody would know

[06:33:02.0000] <boblet>
with a download tool they might ;-)

[06:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What do you call microformats in Japanese?

[06:34:01.0000] <annevk>
because without a model it's unclear e.g. whether an <identifier> is internally represented as <string> and can be serialized as such...

[06:34:02.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: Maikurofo-matto (マイクロフォーマット)

[06:35:00.0000] <boblet>
but often just written as Microformat (that previous one was pronunciation & katakana)

[06:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
How many specs do have decent models, separating the semantics and syntax?

[06:36:00.0000] <boblet>
thanks for your help, all. nn

[06:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: What else would an identifier be serialized as?  JS doesn't have a concept of 'symbol'.

[06:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how long it'll be until Japanese has adopted enough words that it'll effectively be English in an unusual accent

[06:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, hey, htmlwg wiki.  The esw thing.  Where is it?

[06:37:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Has?

[06:37:04.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/Main_Page

[06:37:05.0000] <Dashiva>
It isn't esw anymore, luckily

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: (See http://www.w3.org/html/wg/, click on "Wiki")

[06:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That would explain why i wasn't finding it.

[06:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Maybe the question is whether the strings "test" and "te\st" and "TEST" all have the same internal representation (because they are specified to be "exactly the same identifier") and thus the same serialisation (in which case which one?)

[06:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Those are valid questions, and should indeed be specified precisely.

[06:46:02.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, strings are serialized with quotes

[06:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me guesses there's also questions like whether the string "\7B" should be serialized as "\7B" or as "{"

[06:47:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, for identifiers, yes

[06:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: ah, gotcha.  I read you as saying something subtly different.

[06:47:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if the fact that HTML 5 disallows all Unicode code characters causes issues by disallowing General_Category Cf

[06:47:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Reminds me of that horrible feature of JSON...

[06:47:05.0000] <annevk>
so e.g. [attr=ident] turns into [attr="ident"] in most browsers

[06:47:06.0000] <annevk>
but there's no Selectors model that defines that

[06:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Which of the horrible features?

[06:48:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The one that lets you use both \/ and /

[06:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
How will I live without U+1D177 MUSICAL SYMBOL BEGIN SLUR?

[06:48:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Or more seriously, what about something like U+0600 ARABIC NUMBER SIGN?

[06:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Why is that any worse than the feature that you can use both "\u0078" and "x"?

[06:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Because some python libs only supported one of them

[06:49:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And I had to work around it

[06:50:00.0000] <annevk>
identifiers are especially complicated, because they cannot start with numbers either unless prefixed with -, etc.

[06:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is it JSON's fault that implementations are buggy?

[06:50:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it not just the fault of implementors who can't read a trivial grammar spec?

[06:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that in javascript, escaped identifiers are not equivalent to unescaped ones despite what the spec says

[06:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
(in particular you can use reserved words in identifiers by cunning/evil use of escapes even though that is forbidden)

[06:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can escape identifiers in JS?

[06:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me somehow failed to notice that

[07:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Well of course, it's a brilliant feature

[07:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What is an undercount?

[07:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
A count that is too small?

[07:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Google is not helping me.

[07:02:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, it has something to do with polling, but everything I'm finding is talking about undercounts like I already understand what they are.

[07:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
"To record fewer than the actual number of (persons in a census, for example)." ?

[07:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
like if you lose/ignore half the votes, or something

[07:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That makes sense.  It makes what I'm reading sort of nonsensical, but shrug.  That's to be expected given the author.

[07:05:00.0000] <meledin>
It could be a misrepresentation

[07:05:01.0000] <meledin>
e.g. say "video games have a 10% market share (when polling adult females aged 60 and up)"

[07:07:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, e.g. with counter-reset or so you want to know the model

[07:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Indeed, it's very important to know whether an escaped counter identifier is the same as the unescaped.  Complete agreement there.

[07:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me blames XML for being too successful and encouraging people to believe it's good to specify just syntax and not the interpretation of the syntax

[07:12:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, oh, that is pretty clear

[07:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, ok.  Man, I don't even know then.  ^_^  I don't have enough impl experience yet.

[07:13:01.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, though maybe not, is <string> "test" the same as <identifier> test, and what do they serialize as?

[07:13:02.0000] <annevk>
it's mostly what happens in serialization that I was worried about

[07:13:03.0000] <annevk>
e.g. is it all <string> internally or not

[07:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd have to go read the spec, since it treats strings and identifiers inconsistently.  >_<

[07:14:01.0000] <annevk>
it seems most impl just do whatever

[07:14:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Javascript needs a symbol type.  Like a string but you can just do pointer comparisons to check equality.

[07:14:03.0000] <annevk>
CSS just falls apart as spec when you look at API stuff

[07:14:04.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like most specs

[07:14:05.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, hmm, impl could do that internally

[07:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: I wonder how much perf you'd gain from that though

[07:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think they *do*.  At least, that the impression I get from some things I've heard dbaron saying.

[07:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks that will almost certainly be the wrong place to optimize

[07:15:03.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, yeah, HTML4/DOM2HTML had the same issue

[07:15:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: In a tight loop, string comparison is expensive.  >_<

[07:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
You don't need a special symbol type, you just need interned strings

[07:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
Don't you hate it when you are about to say something and then Philip` speaks

[07:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
True, but it's nice to reflect that in a user-visible way.  A symbol *is* an interned string.

[07:16:03.0000] <jgraham>
because he always says whatever you were about to say

[07:16:04.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I sure do

[07:16:05.0000] <Philip`>
(Hate it, I mean)

[07:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least, for the one language I have experience with that has a symbol type (lisp).  (intern "foo") returns the symbol foo.

[07:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ruby has a symbol type too

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
C++ has boost::flyweight<std::wstring>, which seems to be the same idea

[07:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Not the snappiest name, though

[07:27:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought I was before Philip`, though I guess I didn't mention interned strings explicitly

[07:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah but Philip` always does it :)

[07:31:00.0000] <annevk>
interesting definition of always then :p

[07:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is clearly too predictable

[07:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
I reserve the right to be interesting

[07:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay for people assembling all the information I needed for my counter proposal for me!

[07:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, what counter proposal are you writing?

[07:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
For issues 1 and 2.  Just posted it to the list.

[07:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: boost calls interned stuff "flyweight"?

[07:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
as in weighing as much as an insect?

[07:50:02.0000] <annevk>
we could just use a PING method instead

[07:51:00.0000] <annevk>
custom methods are quite well supported nowadays

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
as in weighing between 49kg and 51kg :-)

[07:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: clearly, I haven't read enough Design Patterns literature to know the lingo

[07:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Are they?

[07:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me has no idea if php supports new methods well.

[07:59:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: It treats all methods identically

[07:59:03.0000] <Philip`>
Do proxies support them?

[07:59:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
That wouldn't actually resolve the objection, though.  The PING method would still be 'unsafe'.

[08:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: It just sets $_SERVER['HTTP_METHOD'] or some other key to the method of the request

[08:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Thanks for the info!

[08:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I think Squid doesn't by default, which is why it breaks Subversion

[08:00:03.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, not necessarily

[08:00:04.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, new methods can be safe

[08:00:05.0000] <Lachy>
the only really relevant question reagarding ping is whether or not browsers will implement it, and if they do, then it should be specced. (Of course, browsers should choose whether or not to implement the feature on its own merits, none of which should affect whether or not it should be specced)

[08:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: I think they're using "unsafe" to mean "not idempotent", and @ping is inherently not idempotent.

[08:02:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, I don't think that's quite true

[08:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Elaborate?

[08:03:00.0000] <annevk>
by not holding the user accountable it is acceptable afaict

[08:04:00.0000] <annevk>
though using GET would be just as fine in that case, though presumably does not work well with caching and all

[08:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Can't you just set some request header to make sure it doesn't get cached?

[08:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems like bad design to require special overrides to ensure the request is not cached when caching is never the right thing to do

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems like bad design to rely on certain side-effects of the request method, rather than on the explicit cache control headers, when the primary aim is to affect the request's cache behaviour

[08:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there some echo service that I POST a form to and get it echoed to me?

[08:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Well with my approach ("right by default") people will typically get it right whereas with the "be explicit but fail wrong" approach people will typically get it wrong

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: "people" here are web browser developers and they can be expected to largely get it right

[08:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
and it's easy to test

[08:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
(If it was something authors would have to do, then I'd find it more compelling to make it harder to make mistakes)

[08:26:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, hixie has that

[08:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: where?

[08:26:02.0000] <annevk>
not sure, looking it up

[08:27:00.0000] <annevk>
his site is somewhat slow

[08:28:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/cgi/test-tools/echo

[08:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: thanks

[08:30:00.0000] <annevk>
for whoever is in the CSS-<number>-values-need-to-support-a-significand camp it would make writing down how to serialize a <number> value easier

[08:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
There's a thread for that, annevk.

[08:31:00.0000] <annevk>
I deleted that thread

[08:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hehe.  Why not just mute it?

[08:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me deletes NOTHING.

[08:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I can has bogo-keygen

[08:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
one item less on my todolist

[08:33:01.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, cause I delete

[08:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Fine.  Could you explain your reasoning more fully?  I'll send it to the list.

[08:34:01.0000] <annevk>
HTML5 uses ToString() for real numbers, from ECMA

[08:34:02.0000] <annevk>
it seems some browsers already use that too

[08:35:00.0000] <annevk>
using that for serializing CSS <number> values too would unify things a little more

[08:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[08:35:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So we'd be harmonizing with HTML5 as well as SVG.

[08:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
HTML5 seems to bounce between different serialisation/parsing definitions quite frequently

[08:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Strangely it seems to happen whenever I complain about the previous definition

[08:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
(even if that's a definition I suggested)

[08:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Ping would never be capable of proving undercounts" - s/proving/preventing/ ?

[08:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
The sentence seems to make more sense with that change

[08:45:00.0000] <smaug>
Hixie: why does the websocket protocol have the optional binary-frames?

[08:46:00.0000] <smaug>
or why are they optional?

[08:47:00.0000] <annevk>
they're not optional

[08:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: I think it's meant to be "providing"?

[08:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think that would make sense

[08:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
Do you mean "lower bounds"?

[08:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
I think the meaning was that ping would never provide a perfectly accurate count that never misses any clicks

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
(because it's be easy for the ping server to be down, etc)

[08:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not at all confident in my thinking, though

[08:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suppose that makes sense too.  Honestly, that objection is incoherent anyway, because there is no perfectly accurate auditing method.

[08:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Even with no perfect method, if current methods had 99% accuracy and a new method had 50% accuracy then nobody would use the new method

[08:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I don't think the impossibility of perfection means there's no need to debate accuracy

[08:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
They might if the loss in accuracy had some positive side effect

[08:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
(so there is equally no use ssaying that accuracy alone is the only significant variable)

[08:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Well, no

[08:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe the new method has 50% accuracy but it kills a puppy every time someone clicks on the link, and you hate puppies

[08:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
so I'd agree it's not the only factor

[08:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
but it is a valid factor to discuss

[08:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but preferably it should be discussed with data and specific cases, rather than handwavey claims that it won't be accurate enough)

[09:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: True.  However, I'd be willing to argue that @ping will be no less accurate than existing similar methods.

[09:04:00.0000] <annevk>
oh sweet, the grammar uses octal references

[09:04:01.0000] <annevk>
gotta love that

[09:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
omg

[09:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
wtf are we using octal.  wtf is *anyone* using octal?

[09:05:02.0000] <annevk>
I seriously dislike the CSS grammar

[09:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What feature, in the history of computers, has ever gained more benefit from using octal than it suffered from confusion caused by it?

[09:06:01.0000] <annevk>
fortunately CSS itself uses unicode escapes

[09:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Unix file permissions?

[09:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Are those octal?  I always figured they were just chars.

[09:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
"0755" etc

[09:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I just never really thought of that as a number.

[09:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
More like 0,7,7,5.

[09:08:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Four separate flags.

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
You need three bits for each number (rwx), so octal makes sense

[09:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be awfully wasteful to devote 8 bits when you only need 3

[09:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Shrug.

[09:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
and it'd be a pain for a program to process character strings

[09:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
compared to just &ing with a mask to extract the desired permission bits

[09:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have no idea how the permission bits are actually exposed.

[09:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
With C code like mkdir("foo", 0755);

[09:14:00.0000] <annodomini>
Interesting comment re the W3C HTML standards process: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1126640

[09:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suppose C treats numbers starting with 0 as octal there?

[09:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
annodomini: Urm, wow.

[09:16:00.0000] <annodomini>
Yeah, the resemblance is scary, isn't it?

[09:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Yes

[09:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
It treats numbers starting with 0 as octal everywhere, in fact :-p

[09:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, yeah.  Bad use of "there" there.  ^_^

[09:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
annodomini: Already incorporated into http://ian.hixie.ch/bible/handling-people :-)

[09:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annodomini: the awesome part is that people imply Hixie practices that because Hixie has a copy of that text on his site

[09:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annodomini: see http://ian.hixie.ch/bible/handling-people

[09:19:00.0000] <annodomini>
Philip`: Ah, I hadn't seen that.

[09:19:01.0000] <annodomini>
hsivonen: Heh.

[09:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annodomini: it's an interesting exercise to try to see who appears to be practicing those points in which W3C WGs

[09:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
You should watch out for people sneaking about the W3C server room and dropping iron filings into the machines, too

[09:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
(That sabotage manual has lots of great ideas)

[09:22:00.0000] <annodomini>
It's definitely a good rebuttal to the people who claim that they are not trying to sabotage HTML5 (or fill in any other standard) but instead are just trying to improve the process.

[09:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1126555

[10:01:00.0000] <workmad3>
hah :) I was reading the handling people thing and was thinking "I'm sure something like this was in Yes Minister"... and then saw the reference at the bottom :)

[11:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithXX: yt?

[11:34:00.0000] <smaug>
Hixie:now that you're here,  why does the websocket protocol have the optional binary-frames?

[11:34:01.0000] <smaug>
or what to call them, semi-optional

[11:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
so that we can add support for binary in the future

[11:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
they're not optional, they're invalid at the moment

[11:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
the support is just error handling

[11:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
and you can handle them by either ignoring them or failing the connection

[11:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
(only ignoring them if you're a browser client)

[11:36:01.0000] <smaug>
well, might be better to define that they are really invalid now

[11:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it did

[11:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
where does it say they are alid?

[11:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
valid

[11:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
neither the server nor the client is allowed to send them

[11:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
they're only allowed to send 0x00 frames currently

[11:38:00.0000] <smaug>
well, the server side part says that "If /type/ is not a 0x00 byte, then the server may disconnect from

[11:38:01.0000] <smaug>
       the client."

[11:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
right

[11:38:03.0000] <smaug>
it is just "may"

[11:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[11:38:05.0000] <Hixie>
that's the right thing to do as far as i can tell

[11:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
the server knows the subprotocol that the conneciton is using

[11:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it can know that if it sees a binary frame it can disconnect since it's not valid

[11:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
and it can equally know that it might want to use binary frames in the future and will therefore know that it can try to be future-compatible and not disconnect, but just ignore the packet

[11:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
s/packet/frame/

[11:40:01.0000] <smaug>
server may not really know the subprotocol. I'd assume the subprotocol was implemented by some cgi-like script

[11:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's still the server

[11:42:00.0000] <smaug>
and anyway, the client can't handle binary data at all

[11:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
today, right

[11:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
but in the future we'll add binary frames

[11:42:03.0000] <smaug>
yeah

[11:42:04.0000] <smaug>
so why define some sort of server side support for binary, but not client side

[11:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
the clients ignore binary frames just like the server does

[11:43:01.0000] <smaug>
not the same way

[11:43:02.0000] <smaug>
client does always "Discard the read bytes."

[11:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
well the clients aren't allowed to disconnect, sure

[11:43:04.0000] <smaug>
server just may close the connection

[11:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
right

[11:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
the server knows the protocol, the client doesn't (it's running JS that does the protocol)

[11:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
so the server can know if it's expecting binary frames or not

[11:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
the clients on the other hand have to all interoperate exactly

[11:44:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: doesn't object send a PARAM:null parameter to plugins (commented out in the spec)?

[11:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: only firefox seems to do that

[11:44:05.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: hmm i thought opera also does

[11:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
nope

[11:45:01.0000] <smaug>
currently websockets api is text based

[11:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
smaug: yes

[11:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
no binary support in JS :-(

[11:45:04.0000] <smaug>
could the protocol say something that if the API to handle protocol supports binary, then the data shouldn't be discarded

[11:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
once the API handles binary, I'll update the protocol.

[11:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
(they're the same source document, I edit them as one spec)

[11:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
(they're both part of http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html)

[11:46:03.0000] <smaug>
why can't you write the protocol so that it supports that already?

[11:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
no point, the API doesn't do it

[11:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
what would you do with the data?

[11:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
the client can neither send nor receive binary

[11:47:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
you could implement a server now that will work in the future when clients support binary

[11:47:03.0000] <smaug>
currently it can receive binary

[11:47:04.0000] <smaug>
it just discards the data immediately 

[11:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
right

[11:48:01.0000] <smaug>
in the future the protocol will need backwards incompatible change

[11:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: that'd be unwise, since we don't know exactly what the conventions will be

[11:49:00.0000] <smaug>
client may not discard the data anymore

[11:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
how is that not backwards compatible?

[11:50:00.0000] <smaug>
for some reason server could send some random data to client to keep the connection open or something....

[11:50:01.0000] <smaug>
and rely on that client doesn't handle that

[11:50:02.0000] <smaug>
but suddenly client starts to handle the data

[11:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
that would work fine, since the JS would also ignore the binary frames

[11:51:00.0000] <smaug>
I assume JS can handle binary frames in the future

[11:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes, but the script the author wrote isn't going to suddenly support it without the server being fixed to not send those frames

[11:53:00.0000] <smaug>
right

[11:53:01.0000] <smaug>
so why not say now that client may use the binary frames

[11:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
JS doesn't support binary

[11:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
so what are we supposed to do with the binary frames?

[11:54:01.0000] <smaug>
I assume there can be other than WebSockets API which use the protocol

[11:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh, no, that would be silly

[11:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
if you're not a browser just use TCP

[11:54:04.0000] <smaug>
huh

[11:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
the only things WebSockets gives you are an origin-based security model (only helpful for browsers) and basic framing

[11:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
basic framing is so trivial to do that you can do it in your own protocol, you don't need websockets

[11:55:02.0000] <smaug>
if you have some service which already uses websockets, why not use the same protocol everywhere?

[11:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
well i guess you could, but then you have to worry about JS clients again

[11:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
my point is you'd only ever use websockets if at least one of your clients is going to be a browser

[11:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
and if that's the case, then you can't use binary frames

[11:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
until we add binary to the protocol

[11:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
er, to JS I mean

[11:57:00.0000] <smaug>
right

[11:58:00.0000] <smaug>
but since the binary frames are defined already, server-to-server (or server-to-C++) communication could start use binary-frames already

[11:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
personally i'd strongly recommend that if your client isn't a browser, you just use a custom protocol

[11:58:02.0000] <smaug>
and once the JS API is ready, it can just start use the same (binary) subprotocol

[11:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
it might look very similar to websockets, but it needn't be websockets itself

[11:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
for example the whole handshake is a waste of time if you're not a browser

[11:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
and if you're not using websockets, you can write your own spec that uses whatever frames you want

[11:59:01.0000] <smaug>
yet you mention in the draft that not all communication is server-to-browser

[11:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, people keep telling me to make the spec more generic

[11:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
i think it's a mistake

[12:01:00.0000] <smaug>
I still don't see why the draft couldn't say that if the API supports binary, then client may not discard the data

[12:01:01.0000] <smaug>
not a big change

[12:02:00.0000] <smaug>
but would allow server-to-C++ etc

[12:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
same reason it doesn't say you can use frame 0x01

[12:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
we don't know what the conventions will be yet

[12:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe binary frames will be [mimetype][data]

[12:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
or maybe they'll be [data][checksum][data][checksum] etc

[12:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
and there's no need for it -- if you want to speak a custom protocol to a server, you don't need this spec

[12:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
just write your own

[12:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What. The. Hell.  Something is going *terribly* wrong here.  Either the server or the browser is cutting off my post request after a minute or two and just navigating to the form's @action instead.

[12:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
tcpdump

[12:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
find out what's actually going on :-)

[12:09:00.0000] <smaug>
the protocol does say what part of the frame is binary

[12:09:01.0000] <smaug>
so why the client couldn't use that?

[12:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
no, it says how to skip length-prefixed frames

[12:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't say what 0x80-0xFF frames actually mean

[12:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
in fact, case in point, we're thinking of defining 0xFE and 0xFF to be a disconnect handshake

[12:11:00.0000] <smaug>
would server send those?

[12:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
we don't know yet

[12:11:02.0000] <smaug>
...since currently client must just discard the binary data

[12:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we make 0xFF do something, then we'd change the client and server rules accordingly

[12:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's my point

[12:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
as we make frames do new things, we'll update the spec

[12:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
you know, the spec also says to discard 0x01 frames

[12:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
which aren't binary

[12:12:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's not just binary frames it discards

[12:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
it discards 99.6% of possible frame types

[12:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
only 0x00 frames get processed currently without discarding

[12:15:00.0000] <smaug>
rigth

[12:15:01.0000] <smaug>
I just wish the wording would be something else than "discard data"

[12:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
"this frame is invalid, discard the data"?

[12:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
"if you ever see this, you're either speaking to a buggy peer or a peer from the future"

[12:16:01.0000] <smaug>
since the idea is anyway that in the future the data may be used for something

[12:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
in the future we'll update the spec

[12:16:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  I have no idea how to tell tcpdump how to only report on traffic from the webserver.

[12:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
are you running it on the client or the server?

[12:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
server.

[12:18:00.0000] <smaug>
so a server based on Feb 15 2010 draft can rely on that everything else than 0x00 frames are discarded, because the spec says so

[12:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me basically doesn't know what he's doing.

[12:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
tcpdump ... 'src post 80'

[12:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
er

[12:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
src port 80

[12:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
smaug: a server based on feb 15 2010 draft can't send anything but 0x00 frames, because the spec says so

[12:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: actually

[12:19:01.0000] <smaug>
ah, that is ture

[12:19:02.0000] <smaug>
true

[12:20:00.0000] <smaug>
yet,  the spec should say something (even in normative section) about reserving frame types for future use

[12:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: you want '((src host web.server.address) && (src port 80)) || ((dst host web.server.address) && (dst port 80))' or something

[12:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
smaug: Something like:

[12:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
   The protocol is designed to support other frame types in future.

[12:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
   Instead of the 0x00 byte, other bytes might in future be defined.

[12:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
...?

[12:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
(from 10.3.4.1.2 Protocol overview)

[12:23:05.0000] <smaug>
that is non-normative

[12:24:00.0000] <smaug>
er, which chapter

[12:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#protocol-overview

[12:24:02.0000] <smaug>
/me reads the one in ietf, since the API draft points to there

[12:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
wait, what normative conformance criteria do you want?

[12:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
the API draft is also in complete.html

[12:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
(http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#network)

[12:26:00.0000] <smaug>
Something that in the future servers and clients may need to support other than 0x00 frames

[12:26:01.0000] <smaug>
not sure about the wording

[12:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
I don't understand what the requirement would be

[12:27:01.0000] <smaug>
currently the requirement is that server always sends 0x00 frames

[12:27:02.0000] <smaug>
*always* only 0x00 frames

[12:28:00.0000] <smaug>
in the future we want to support something else too

[12:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure. in the future we'll update teh spec.

[12:28:02.0000] <smaug>
/me doesn't like non-stable specs

[12:29:00.0000] <smaug>
which are always just drafts

[12:31:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
why not?

[12:31:01.0000] <smaug>
in general? because of backwards compatibility problems

[12:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
smaug: improving a spec over time doesn't mean it's not stable

[12:40:00.0000] <smaug>
right. I think, so far I haven't see a stable spec which has been just "improved"

[12:41:00.0000] <smaug>
I admin, W3C has tried to do that with erratas

[12:41:01.0000] <smaug>
admit

[12:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
so HTML has been unstable?

[12:42:00.0000] <smaug>
you mean html5

[12:42:01.0000] <smaug>
yes, unstable

[12:42:02.0000] <smaug>
just an example: hashchange

[12:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
i mean HTML 1-4

[12:43:00.0000] <smaug>
they are new versions

[12:43:01.0000] <smaug>
new specs

[12:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's what i mean we'll do with websockets

[12:44:01.0000] <smaug>
ah

[12:44:02.0000] <smaug>
I thought something like with html5

[12:44:03.0000] <smaug>
never-ever stable

[12:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see the difference

[12:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I too am curious as to the difference between minting a new version identifier for changes, and just changing the existing spec.

[12:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg html is on "version 4745"

[12:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you go by subversion revisions

[12:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
HTML 5.4745

[12:46:01.0000] <smaug>
so browser x may support version 4733 and some other browser version 4655 and they have conflicting behavior, yet both say that they support HTML5

[12:47:00.0000] <smaug>
not the perfect situation

[12:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Welcome to the web?

[12:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least they can't claim to support the same edition of the spec and still be conflicting (if we've done things right).

[12:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
smaug: um, that's no worse than what happened with html 1-4

[12:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
This TCPdump output just tells me that there is regular communication for almost exactly 4 minutes between browser and server, and then it suddenly cuts out (at which point the browser navigates to the form's action).  I can't decipher anything special happening near the end that could cause problems.

[12:49:00.0000] <smaug>
there browser x was saying it support v4, and y supports v3

[12:49:01.0000] <smaug>
there is clear possibility for API breakage 

[12:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, Browser X would claim to support v4, Browser Y would claim to support v4, and yet they would have conflicting behavior.

[12:50:00.0000] <smaug>
that is different thing

[12:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's the same thing

[12:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
in practice browsers don't claim to implement a particular version

[12:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
not in any meaningful way

[12:51:01.0000] <smaug>
they do in the API documentation

[12:52:00.0000] <smaug>
or whatever the documentation for web devs is called

[12:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
not in a meaningful way

[12:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hi everyone

[12:52:03.0000] <smaug>
pretty often the comment is that this and that HTML5 feature is supported ...

[12:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
there's going to be more delta between browser x and html5 version 4733 in your example than between html5 version 4733 and html5 version 4655

[12:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
smaug: sure, and often people say this and that DOM2 HTML or CSS2 or HTML4 feature is supported, and it's just as different between browsers

[12:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
at least with a regularly updated spec, the browsers have a chance of converging on something

[12:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
hey maciej

[12:53:03.0000] <smaug>
not necessarily if the web dev is interested only in one particular feature

[12:54:00.0000] <smaug>
anyway, this is pretty useless discussion :)

[12:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, I'm supposed to be on vacation today but I just got a call to explain to my management what's going on with HTML5

[12:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me checks his e-mail to make sure he's not also being dragged into work

[13:00:00.0000] <smaug>
Hixie: oh, one thing still

[13:00:01.0000] <smaug>
the back/forward discussion didn't continue for some reason

[13:00:02.0000] <smaug>
the draft was just changed to what chromium wants it to be

[13:01:00.0000] <smaug>
and that's it

[13:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
and what mozilla wanted

[13:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i think i have more e-mails in that folder

[13:03:02.0000] <smaug>
?

[13:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's not finished yet

[13:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
(739 e-mails remaining)

[13:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
(so it takes a while to go through them)

[13:05:00.0000] <smaug>
I know it is kind of hard to say what Mozilla wants when Mozilla is a group of people which may have quite different opinions

[13:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
true

[13:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking said that he thought making it async would help mozilla, though, and sicking is pretty representative :-)

[13:11:01.0000] <smaug>
but sicking is not the one who has been hacking session history lately ;)

[13:13:00.0000] <smaug>
I'd just like to understand the reasoning behind making API async. So far the reasoning has been mainly just that in chromium's architecture sync might be a bit harder to implement

[13:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
not just chrome's architecture, pretty much any multi-process model

[13:13:02.0000] <smaug>
no

[13:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
Justin's e-mail is the only one i seem to have in the history pile

[13:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that's about pushState

[13:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
did i miss one?

[13:14:03.0000] <smaug>
as far as I see session history could live in a process between ui and the tab process

[13:15:00.0000] <smaug>
Hixie: oops, seems like I've missed

[13:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but any IPC basically has to be async

[13:15:02.0000] <smaug>
sorry

[13:15:03.0000] <smaug>
IPC doesn't have to be async

[13:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you try doing sync IPC with the kind of model a browser implies, you're very likely to end up with either deadlocks or EXTREMELY complicated code

[13:17:00.0000] <roc>
you just force the event loops into a directed acyclic graph and then require all calls in one direction to be async

[13:18:00.0000] <smaug>
IPC from client process to parent doesn't have to be async

[13:18:01.0000] <smaug>
and especially if there was a separate process for a "tab", that could handle session history

[13:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
history traversal requires two-way communication

[13:19:00.0000] <smaug>
if there was some problem with it, the main process could kill it

[13:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you can come up with a model that has each iframe in a different process, and can do sync history traversal, I'm certainly eager to hear how it would work.

[13:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
please do e-mail such proposals to the list

[13:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
currently, i'm not aware of any plausible way to do it that isn't insanely complicated compared to just making history traversal async

[13:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
and since history traversal has to be mostly async anyway when you're doing cross-page traversal, it seems simple enough to do it async

[13:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
(generally we want everything async anyway)

[13:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
(so that e.g. script doesn't block on disk I/O)

[13:21:01.0000] <smaug>
I'll think about the sync sh

[13:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
frankly the best argument for keeping the same-page session history sync would be evidence that it's needed for back compat

[13:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
lacking that, making it trigger based on queueing a task seems like a big win all round

[13:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i wish we could make location.href async too, but that one clearly does have back compat requirmenets)

[13:32:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
should there be a dimensionchange event for <video>?

[13:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
probably in some future version, yeah

[13:34:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
whatwg.org is down

[13:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[13:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, googlebot is using a lot of slots

[13:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
let me reduce the indexing frequency

[13:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: fixed

[13:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: i had a couple of CGI scripts that never finished, and as googlebot indexed them it was taking progressively more and more slots

[13:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
they now terminate after 60s

[14:20:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: nice

[14:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
also dramatically reduced the indexing frequency :-)

[14:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
not much point indexing tests every 5 seconds

[14:21:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: apparently opera does send PARAM:"", but only since last week :)

[14:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wish i had a way to test IE

[14:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Isn't there some existing plugin you could use and modify for testing?

[14:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
(assuming that's what the problem was)

[14:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
well on mac i just wrote my own plugin to dump the data out

[14:23:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
do you have that plugin around somewhere?

[14:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[14:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
source or binary?

[14:24:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
can i has both? :)

[14:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[14:24:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
awesome

[14:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: ^

[14:35:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: thanks!

[14:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
let me know if you find anything in there that i shouldn't have put in public :-)

[14:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't look closley

[14:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
closely

[14:37:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
still loading...

[14:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
also, that code is a mess. It has memory leaks and the like. I didn't do anything to fix it because all I wanted was the data, and once I had it I was done and threw it out

[14:37:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
connection timed out

[14:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
(i wouldn't be surprised if it had security bugs and stuff)

[14:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
(so don't install it on a production machine)

[14:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
wfm

[14:41:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i can't reach it from here for some reason. i'll try at the office tomorrow

[14:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
can you get to hixie.ch?

[14:41:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
no

[14:41:03.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan__: wfm

[14:41:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can reach it, fwiw.

[14:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: odd

[14:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: can you ping hixie.ch?

[14:42:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
ping times out too

[14:43:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
maybe park hotel has blocked hixie.ch

[14:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
can you ping 69.163.222.251 ?

[14:43:02.0000] <jgraham>
Too many Opera employees trying to reach it :)

[14:45:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: times out

[14:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[14:45:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
dns lookup for hixie.ch is successful

[14:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
if you traceroute it, where does the route fail?

[14:48:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
 3  sar-l1.se.thecloud.net (10.5.24.134)  97.385 ms  28.379 ms  26.584 ms

[14:49:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
all others say * * * *

[14:49:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
er

[14:49:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
* * *

[14:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
then the problem is definitely at your ewnd

[14:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
end

[14:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
because i doubt very much dreamhost peer with thecloud.net :-)

[14:49:06.0000] <zcorpan__>
yeah

[14:50:00.0000] <jcranmer>
dump a bgp route advertisement and check the ASN path?

[14:50:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
time to sleep

[14:50:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
dump eyelocks

[14:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me would have no idea how to dump route advertisements or check ASN paths :-)

[14:53:00.0000] <boblet>
Microdata q: wondering why this doesn’t work in microdatajs; <li itemprop="location" itemscope itemtype="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard">

[14:54:00.0000] <boblet>
but this does <li itemprop="location"><span itemscope itemtype="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard">

[14:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
when you say "Work", what are you looking for?

[14:55:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: atm “work” = card data in http://foolip.org/microdatajs/live/

[14:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the complete document?

[14:56:01.0000] <boblet>
so I realise it might be a problem there. just sanity-checking I’m not making a mistake

[14:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
I'm not 100% sure I understand what you're trying to do

[14:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
(in particular, I'm curious what the itemprop="location" is intended to be part of)

[14:57:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: converting uF to Microdata. this is an hcard embedded in hcalendar

[14:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
in microdata, <li itemprop="location"><span itemscope itemtype="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard"> means the same as <li itemprop="location"></li> ... <span itemscope itemtype="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard">

[14:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
that is, there's no link between the itemprop=location and the vcard in that case

[14:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you have an hCalendar and it contains a vCard, then I don't think foolip's tool will show you the nested vCard

[14:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
(the spec only says to extract the top-level vCards)

[14:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
(e.g. it won't exact Agents either)

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
technically the vEvent vocabulary doesn't allow nested vCards currently iirc

[14:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#md-vevent-location says "The value must be text."

[15:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
(as opposed to "The value must be either an item with the type http://microformats.org/profile/hcard, or an absolute URL, or text." which is what the spec for vCard "agent" says)

[15:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
hth

[15:02:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: sorry, uploaded code http://oli-studio.com/temp/uf/microdata.html

[15:02:01.0000] <boblet>
and that “value must be text” part is a bit limiting if it means no contained elements

[15:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
the "value" there is the value of the itemprop="" property

[15:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
which can generally be either text, or a URL, or a datetime, or a nested itemscope="" item,

[15:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/,$//

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't preclude nested markup, but nested markup doesn't affect microdata

[15:05:00.0000] <boblet>
by that do you mean any text in nested markup isn’t included, eg as the location value in this case?

[15:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's flattened

[15:06:00.0000] <boblet>
or that the markup is ignored but the contained text is used?

[15:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
in:

[15:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
<div itemscope><span itemprop="a">hello <em>world</em> how <em>are</em> you</span></div>

[15:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
...there is a singel item, and it has a single property named "a", and its value os "hello world how are you" with no markup.

[15:06:04.0000] <boblet>
ok, that’s what I hoped

[15:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
in:

[15:08:00.0000] <boblet>
so when you say “technically the vEvent vocabulary doesn't allow nested vCards currently” is that in Microdata or uF?

[15:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
<div itemscope><span itemprop="a"><em itemscope><span itemprop="b">B</span></em></span></div>

[15:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
...tehre are two _top-level_ microdata items

[15:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
one has a property "a" with the value "B"

[15:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
the other has the property "b" with the value "B"

[15:09:02.0000] <boblet>
(I kinda thought that each itemtype instance wouldn’t affect the others)

[15:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
they are not related items -- there's no link between them in the microdata model

[15:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
however, in:

[15:09:05.0000] <Hixie>
<div itemscope><span itemprop="a" itemscope><span itemprop="b">B</span></span></div>

[15:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
there is _one_ top-level microdata item, and it has a property "a" whose value is a nested item, which itself has one property "b" whose value is "B".

[15:10:01.0000] <boblet>
aaah

[15:10:02.0000] <boblet>
a bit more rigor than uF classes

[15:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that was one of the main goals of microdata

[15:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
the above and itemref="" are basically the two complicated parts of microdata

[15:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i recommend ignoring itemref="" for now)

[15:11:02.0000] <boblet>
am ignoring itemref="" for now :)

[15:11:03.0000] <boblet>
snap

[15:12:00.0000] <boblet>
have yet to make the slides, but will post here when I’m done for feedback (hopefully before the event :| )

[15:12:01.0000] <boblet>
thanks for explaining

[15:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is playing with a rough first-cut javascript library implementing @onlyreplace.

[15:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: my pleasure. I'd be happy to review any slides.

[15:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: for <form>?

[15:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<form>, <a>, and <base>.

[15:23:02.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: thank you. much appreciated

[15:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: we had something like that in a previous version, if it's what I think you mean

[15:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There was a thread about it a while back that ended up as "well, it should be easy to implement in JS, especially once XHR2 is out, so no change to the spec".

[15:24:01.0000] <boblet>
damn you foolip, swanning off to China to get married when I want to ask you questions! sheesh

[15:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is this an error or expected?  I'm trying to replace an element with another element I've cloned from an <iframe>.  It works fine for normal elements, but fails for <style>.

[15:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I can, however, wrap the <style> in a <div> and replace *that* instead.)

[15:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Specifically, this is in Chrome 4 for windows.

[15:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
"error" and "expected" are not mutually exclusive

[15:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
do you have a minimised test case?

[15:32:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, but I could produce one.  (Right now it's me testing it on a copy of my production site.)

[15:33:00.0000] <roc>
that sounds like a bug to me

[15:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's almost certainly a bug, yes

[15:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
roc: Does Firefox not obey dynamic changes to <base target>?

[15:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(That appears to be what's stopping this from working in FF.)

[15:41:02.0000] <roc>
I think we do, but there could be a bug

[15:41:03.0000] <roc>
(it's a huge pain)

[15:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, kk.

[15:42:01.0000] <roc>
oh hmm

[15:42:02.0000] <roc>
<base target>

[15:42:03.0000] <roc>
I dunno

[15:42:04.0000] <roc>
I've never even heard of that, so I dunno :-)

[15:42:05.0000] <roc>
if it doesn't, it's probably easy to fix

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
iirc html5 defines <base target> not quite how firefox does it anyway

[15:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
so at some point we should file bugs and have that fixed

[15:43:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haha.  Well, this @onlyreplace impl works in Chrome.  It fails in Firefox, but if I manually add the appropriate @target to <base>, it works.  So that suggests <base target> isn't being honored when changed dynamically by script.

[15:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's not a high priority though


2010-02-16
[16:02:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Are IDs allowed to start with numbers now?

[16:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes.

[16:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They can be arbitrary nonempty strings that don't contain whitespace.

[16:07:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
k

[18:00:00.0000] <mikl0>
HTML5 is no longer an XML vocabulary?  Just making sure I understand.

[18:03:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Hixie: here now

[18:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
mikl0: it's a DOM vocabulary, and there's an XML serialisation and a text/html serialisation

[18:10:00.0000] <mikl0>
Hixie: If I wanted to use an XML application like MathML I would do what to make everything valid use XML serialisation? MIME type of application/xhtml+xml or application/xml ?

[18:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
text/html (as of HTML5) supports the MathML, SVG, and HTML vocabularies

[18:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
for XML, you can use any MIME type text/xml, application/xml, or */*+xml

[18:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
as far as HTML5 goes

[18:13:00.0000] <mikl0>
Hixie: ah, that clears my confusion so HTML5 text/html is fine with MathML, SVG and HTML perfect!  Thank you.

[18:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
mikl0: Just be careful when using namespaced elements.  IIRC they sometimes don't act as you'd expect in the text/html serialization.

[18:25:00.0000] <mikl0>
TabAtkins: ok i will be and i plan on being here in the channel frequently as i work, to give back for others who have questions and to ask some of my own i'm sure.

[18:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, so, elementary TCP questions ahoy.

[18:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
if i want to initiate a graceful close, it seems relatively easy

[18:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
I send a FIN (shutdown with SHUT_WR), then I wait until the socket is ready to read and recv() returns zero, then I call close().

[18:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
but what does the other side do?

[18:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
If I'm in full swing of a connection, and my peer sends a FIN (recv() returns zero), what do I do to make sure that all my sent data gets to the other side?

[18:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
I can't call close(), because that will empty the send buffer and send a RST, as far as I can tell.

[18:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
I can't call shutdown() with SHUT_WR, because I'll have no way to know to move on to the next step, since recv() has already returned zero.

[18:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, it seems i'm wrong about close() clearing the _send_ buffer

[18:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's going on is normally it sends an RST if there's any pending data to _read_, and _that_ causes the other side to throw away _its_ read buffer

[18:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
so

[18:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
a simple graceful shutdown can be done just by one side or the other sending a FIN

[18:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
then it waiting for recv()=0 and calling close()

[18:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the other side just calling close()

[18:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
when it gets recv()=0

[19:06:00.0000] <foolip>
so where did this boblet fellow go?

[19:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
foolip: boblet comes and goes.. he's usually not on IRC, but mostly pops on when he has a question

[19:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
foolip: he's boblet on twitter as well, if you want to ping him there

[19:20:00.0000] <foolip>
MikeSmith: thanks

[19:33:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i don't understand why we're still arguing about @longdesc

[19:33:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
richard schwerdtfeger said months ago that "longdesc was a disaster" ( http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Sep/0596.html )

[19:33:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
and his preferred replacement (ARIA) is already in html5

[19:35:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
yet the same people who claim that data is irrelevant and that all decisions should be based on respect

[19:36:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
are still arguing that longdesc was not, in fact, a disaster

[19:39:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
it's almost as if appeals to authority only count when the authority shares your position

[19:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or maybe it's a bit more subtle, people who don't share your position don't count as authorities :)

[19:40:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me                 

[22:33:00.0000] <boblet>
hey foolip, popping in ’cos I have a question :)

[22:34:00.0000] <foolip>
boblet: shoot

[22:34:01.0000] <boblet>
first thanks for Live Microdata—great stuff

[22:35:00.0000] <boblet>
main q is do you have any plans to make an auto-conversion service for downloading vcards a la X2V? or do you know of such a thing?

[22:36:00.0000] <foolip>
boblet: sorry, what's X2V?

[22:36:01.0000] <foolip>
do you mean pasting a URL and getting a vcard for download?

[22:37:00.0000] <boblet>
yep. sorry it’s prolly http://h2vx.com/ now

[22:38:00.0000] <foolip>
that would require some server-side stuff

[22:38:01.0000] <foolip>
I'd really like to have a python implementation to do that kind of thing

[22:39:00.0000] <foolip>
but I don't have a concrete plan to do it in the immediate future

[22:39:01.0000] <boblet>
ok, that’s good to know

[22:40:00.0000] <boblet>
there might be enough microdata support in html5lib btw

[22:40:01.0000] <foolip>
it would also be useful to e.g. let people see the microdata output (other than vcard) from their live sites

[22:40:02.0000] <foolip>
has someone been working on that?

[22:40:03.0000] <boblet>
I’m the wrong person to ask sorry

[22:40:04.0000] <boblet>
:)

[22:40:05.0000] <foolip>
jgraham, gsnedders?

[22:41:00.0000] <boblet>
I agree re: showing microdata output

[22:41:01.0000] <foolip>
in any case it should be layered on top of html5lib, that's for sure

[22:41:02.0000] <boblet>
I asked earlier when Tab & Philip were around, and they hadn’t heard of anything

[22:41:03.0000] <foolip>
boblet: if you have any bugs or patches for live microdata, feel free to send them (per mail or otherwise)

[22:42:00.0000] <foolip>
I'd like it to be able to validate known itemtypes, but haven't done so yet

[22:42:01.0000] <boblet>
foolip: well actually, itemprop="description" didn’t seem to work for me: http://oli-studio.com/temp/uf/microdata.html

[22:43:00.0000] <boblet>
no vevent output, but remove desc and it works

[22:43:01.0000] <foolip>
boblet: having a look

[22:44:00.0000] <boblet>
thanks

[22:45:00.0000] <foolip>
yep, there's a bug

[22:45:01.0000] <foolip>
one sec

[22:49:00.0000] <boblet>
yay! I helped

[22:51:00.0000] <foolip>
boblet: fixed a typo, try again now (make sure you reload properly)

[22:51:01.0000] <foolip>
s/subStr/substr/ was the trick :)

[22:52:00.0000] <foolip>
I also pushed some changes for RDF extraction that are in violation of the spec (but better :)

[22:52:01.0000] <boblet>
heh, oh that all bugs were that easy

[22:52:02.0000] <boblet>
thanks—it works great here

[22:53:00.0000] <foolip>
it only happened with description because only then was the line long enough to trigger the line wrapping code

[22:56:00.0000] <boblet>
one more q but need to check specs first…

[22:56:01.0000] <foolip>
/me will be loitering

[23:00:00.0000] <boblet>
foolip: nope, just mistaken expectations.

[23:01:00.0000] <boblet>
although I’ll definitely ping you if I come across anything else. Thanks again for your help!

[23:05:00.0000] <foolip>
good luck!

[23:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: it's clear from the spec that <p spellcheck=""> and <p contenteditable=""> are conforming, but the spec seems to be ambiguous about whether <p spellcheck> and <p contenteditable> are conforming.

[23:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
where is a difference between the two expressed?

[23:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: the difference is that in the first case the empty string is explicitly specified

[23:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's explicitly specified in the second case also

[23:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
unless we're talkign about different parts of the spec

[23:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
is there a place in the spec that says using empty-attribute syntax is equivalent to explictly including '=""' ?

[23:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: the spec defines empty-attribute syntax but does not say it's equivalent to including =""

[23:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I realize that parsing algorithm makes it clear that empty attributes get assigned the empty string as values

[23:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: hm, yeah, the syntax could be clearer about that. i'll file a bug, thanks.

[23:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I'm happy to file the bug if you want

[23:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, I think it's clear enough for those who read the parsing algorithm, just not for those who don't

[23:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the statistical charset detection situation in WebKit like these days?

[23:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does it have a statistical detector? how much data is fed to it?

[23:56:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: isn't charset conversion delegated to the platform layer, so each Webkit port has its own?

[23:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: that's possible. if so, I'm interested in what Safari on Mac and Chrome on Windows do

[23:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
what timezone is document.lastModified supposed to be in?

[00:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: most WebKit ports use libicu for charset conversion

[00:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not sure if they all have it configured the same way though

[00:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
user's local timezone, it seems

[00:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh look, that's what the spec says

[00:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
excellent

[00:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm ahead of myself

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: btw dunno if you saw but i made the algoriothm support sync fetch

[00:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: is the ICU detector used, too? Is it always on? Does it look at the first 1K or the whole page?

[00:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I do not know that offhand

[00:23:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, yeah thanks

[00:23:01.0000] <annevk>
Unicode characters include control points, no?

[00:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have to look it up each time

[00:29:00.0000] <annevk>
oh well, I guess I won't care about whether somewhat informative CSS descriptions are accurate

[00:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: ?

[00:43:00.0000] <annevk>
they're not configured in the same way, fwiw

[00:43:01.0000] <annevk>
e.g. Chrome has a lot of custom patches to ICU

[00:43:02.0000] <annevk>
Web Encodings is currently very low-priority though

[00:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
boblet: FWIW html5lib doesn't support microdata but I have a partial, buggy, implementation of an old version of the spec based on hml5lib

[00:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
"based on" meaning "that uses html5lib to parse the html"

[00:59:00.0000] <boblet>
jgraham: thanks for letting me know

[01:01:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: i can access hixie.ch from here

[01:01:01.0000] <boblet>
I don’t think I’ll a chance to play with anything soon, but good to know for speech

[01:43:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: great job with my comments so far :)

[01:43:01.0000] <wycats>
I have a few flagged to come back to but almost everything looks great

[01:47:00.0000] <annevk>
bah

[01:48:00.0000] <annevk>
all that fetch gains me is no longer defining cookie semantics and referrer

[01:49:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought I could merge stuff

[01:49:01.0000] <annevk>
oh well, at least everything will use the same

[01:49:02.0000] <annevk>
oh, seems like CORS will need to depend on HTML5 again

[01:49:03.0000] <annevk>
people will be so pleased

[01:50:00.0000] <annevk>
getting things done vs getting things done perfect in infinite time is always an interesting discussion to have I suppose

[02:09:00.0000] <Huvet_>
is there an example somewhere of how to sanitize some random html?

[02:10:00.0000] <Huvet_>
http://dpaste.com/159820/ <- what I have so far

[02:10:01.0000] <Huvet_>
http://dpaste.com/159821/ <- my stacktrace

[02:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses it may just be broken

[02:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Yes, chars includes characters whose General_Category is C*

[02:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
Huvet_: That looks odd. I don't have time to dig into it right now though

[02:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
(sorry)

[02:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
But gsnedders guess looks quite reasonable

[02:15:03.0000] <Huvet_>
don't be sorry :)

[02:15:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Nor do I

[02:15:05.0000] <jgraham>
Try a different tree type?

[02:15:06.0000] <gsnedders>
I can just make mostly blind guesses from what people actually use and what we have lots of tests for

[02:15:07.0000] <Huvet_>
you don't have a working sanitizon sample handy?

[02:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Also I may have added a sanitize function to the top level API...

[02:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
"may".

[02:16:02.0000] <jgraham>
(but I'm not sure. I remember thinking it would be a good idea)

[02:16:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Awesome.

[02:16:04.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[02:16:05.0000] <Huvet_>
:D

[02:16:06.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, thanks, that's what I thought

[02:16:07.0000] <Huvet_>
yeah, that code is just messy, a toplevel API would be great

[02:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Basically any code point that is assigned and is neither a non-character nor a surrogate is a character

[02:17:01.0000] <annevk>
right, that's what I thought (and just said in email)

[02:50:00.0000] <annevk>
whoa, last TR/ version of CORS was in March

[02:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
TR/++

[02:50:02.0000] <annevk>
this UM debacle stalled things quite a bit

[04:38:00.0000] <annevk>
omg

[04:38:01.0000] <annevk>
well, it's not that bad, but I'm yet again looking at this security consideration request for XHR and I've no idea what to put in

[04:40:00.0000] <asmodai>
annevk: "unnecessary"? :)

[04:41:00.0000] <annevk>
that has been my argument so far, yes :)

[04:42:00.0000] <annevk>
security requirements are made throughout the specification and I see no reason to explain those more than other kind of requirement

[04:42:01.0000] <annevk>
(besides that I've no idea how to explain some of them)

[04:43:00.0000] <annevk>
(if you read this in the logs and you think this is all wrong, please instead of thinking that propose how to fix it on public-webapps⊙wo, cheerio)

[04:43:01.0000] <smaug>
Hixie: in which way should websocket send buffered messages; I mean if someone is doing for (i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) socket.send("Somedata"); should there be 100000 websocket frames, or can the client merge messages and have fewer frames?

[04:44:00.0000] <annevk>
there should be 100000 frames

[04:45:00.0000] <smaug>
annevk: based on what?

[04:45:01.0000] <smaug>
I do agree that 100000 sounds  better

[04:45:02.0000] <annevk>
the spec? it would be annoying if e.g. send("+1"); send("+2") turns into a single frame "+1+2"

[04:45:03.0000] <annevk>
/me looks at spec

[04:45:04.0000] <smaug>
that way server can handle messages the same way, even if client needs to buffer

[04:46:00.0000] <smaug>
but I don't see anything in Websockets API that requires that behavior

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk>
I do

[04:47:01.0000] <annevk>
see definition of *send /data/ using the Web Socket*

[04:48:00.0000] <annevk>
it's very explicit

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the questions I got after my lecture were about Microdata and RDF, then Microdata and RDFa

[04:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems the students perceived Microdata/RDFa as the most controversial thing in HTML5 above video codecs

[04:50:01.0000] <annevk>
lots of RDF classes?

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk>
and not so much on open Web?

[04:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
possibly. or RDFa assigned as an exercise topic maybe

[04:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
geolocation is one of the exercise topics

[04:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
pairs of students get an assigned topic to prepare a 20-minute presentation on

[04:53:00.0000] <Yudai>
hi guys, may i ask a question?

[04:54:00.0000] <Yudai>
is it ok to add a fragment id to a URI with data scheme?

[04:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: IIRC, no

[04:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
unfortunately

[04:54:03.0000] <Yudai>
oh, really? let me know why

[04:54:04.0000] <smaug>
annevk: send data using web socket, how is that explicitly saying that a frame is generated?

[04:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't think it's defined what a data URI with a scheme means, nor whether it's valid

[04:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: what looks like a fragment gets treated as content data

[04:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Browsers treat # within a data URI as part of the data though, AFAIK

[04:56:00.0000] <annevk>
smaug, it's a term defined in the protocol spec

[04:56:01.0000] <annevk>
smaug, where it says in three steps how to construct the frame

[04:57:00.0000] <smaug>
annevk: right. but how do you interpret "send data using web socket" to mean that it creates one frame 

[04:58:00.0000] <smaug>
I read it so that "send data" just says that data is sent in some way using web socket

[04:58:01.0000] <annevk>
i just told you

[04:58:02.0000] <smaug>
maybe even 1 char at time

[04:58:03.0000] <annevk>
i guess i need to give a pointer...

[04:59:00.0000] <smaug>
annevk: ah

[04:59:01.0000] <annevk>
see the end of this section http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-75#section-4.2

[04:59:02.0000] <smaug>
I found it in the protocol

[04:59:03.0000] <smaug>
very annoying way to define it

[04:59:04.0000] <annevk>
that's what I said :/

[04:59:05.0000] <Yudai>
hsvinoen: however, a "#" character should be escaped if it is on the data part, I think

[04:59:06.0000] <smaug>
wording should be improved

[05:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yudai: Per spec, yes

[05:00:01.0000] <annevk>
i guess

[05:01:00.0000] <annevk>
i'm sure Hixie is not out to get you so if you find something is confusing constructive feedback would help

[05:01:01.0000] <Yudai>
gsnedders: so it's the end of data part if a parser find "#" on a URI

[05:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yudai: Theoretically per spec, yes.

[05:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yudai: In terms of what impls do and what the web requires, no

[05:05:00.0000] <Yudai>
gsnedders: ok, i see

[05:05:01.0000] <Yudai>
validator.nu raises an error in this case

[05:06:00.0000] <Yudai>
it might get people confused

[05:10:00.0000] <Yudai>
gsnedders: btw, I could not understand what you mean with your message on 22:01 because of my poor english

[05:13:00.0000] <Yudai>
i'm sorry. let me know the meaning with other words if possible

[05:16:00.0000] <Yudai>
MikeSmith: could you show me the way to add a new bug to the tracker of validator.nu?

[05:29:00.0000] <annevk>
so new Anon[XMLHttp]Request() or new XMLHttpRequest(anon=true)

[05:30:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie seemed to have a preference for the latter and since I don't really care I'm leaning towards that too, but if anyone has input?

[05:33:00.0000] <asmodai>
I'd lean to the latter, but I am one of those evil Python programmers. :)

[05:35:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, the way it would work is new XMLHttpRequest() makes it default to false, whereas new XMLHttpRequest(true) gives you anonymous requests

[05:36:00.0000] <annevk>
i guess that is good enough; it also does not introduce much API clutter

[05:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: new XMLHttpRequest({anon:true})

[05:38:00.0000] <annevk>
no

[05:39:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, it would be sort of neat to hide certain functionality but I guess throwing some exceptions is better

[05:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
>_<  We'll never get the object-argument pattern into apis is nobody starts them.  >_<

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk>
true words

[05:56:00.0000] <smaug>
annevk: I'd prefet the first one. That explicitly says that an AnonXHR is being created

[05:56:01.0000] <smaug>
prefer

[05:57:00.0000] <annevk>
it's exactly the same object, just with a flag set differently

[05:57:01.0000] <annevk>
internal flag, that is

[05:57:02.0000] <smaug>
ah, the difference will be so small

[05:57:03.0000] <smaug>
then a flag is perhaps better

[05:58:00.0000] <smaug>
optional flag, ofc

[05:58:01.0000] <annevk>
yes, the internal flag affects the last two arguments of open(), withCredentials, and the XMLHttpRequest origin 

[05:58:02.0000] <annevk>
basically, my plan is throw for the last two arguments of open, to throw for withCredentials, and to set the XMLHttpRequest origin to a unique identifier

[05:59:00.0000] <annevk>
I think that deals with everything and obsoletes the need for UM

[06:05:00.0000] <annevk>
lets try to spec this

[06:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: you around?

[06:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wanted to ask about a potential bug that Yudai has been looking at

[06:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I'm around for a few minutes still

[06:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Yudai: can you please explain your test case to hsivonen ?

[06:29:01.0000] <Yudai>
ok, i see

[06:30:00.0000] <Yudai>
the validator raises an error when an data: URI with a fragment id (like data:....#id) is in the page

[06:31:00.0000] <Yudai>
s/an data:/a data:/

[06:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>

[06:31:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: is #id allowed per the data: URL spec? at least given browser behavior, it seems useful to treat it as an error

[06:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
oops

[06:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: validator.nu seems to be down at the moment

[06:33:01.0000] <myakura>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243917

[06:33:02.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: perhaps yes

[06:33:03.0000] <Yudai>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243917

[06:34:00.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: and i agree with that

[06:34:01.0000] <Yudai>
however i found a person confused by that behavior

[06:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it's confusing, sure

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: thanks. that's odd

[06:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: maybe I crashed it with that test case

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: back up now

[06:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool

[06:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
myakura, Yudai - from my reading of the Mozilla bug, the only use case mentioned for XBL, and comments in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366770 seem to indicate it's no longer needed for XBL

[06:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so are there other use cases?

[06:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes back to read the blog post

[06:38:00.0000] <Yudai>
MikeSmith: the person myakura (and I) found wanted to access to the fragment of html in data: uri

[06:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Yudai: I see. But I guess the next question is why does he want to do that and/or why does he think others would want to do that?

[06:40:01.0000] <Yudai>
hmm, RFC2396 says: This document defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URI, such that an implementation can parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier type. 

[06:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me goes away

[06:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Yudai: it seems pretty clear that fragment IDs in data: URIs are not valid

[06:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that doesn't mean browsers can't handle them if they choose to

[06:42:00.0000] <Yudai>
yes, i agree

[06:43:00.0000] <myakura>
he was just trying to show that opera does *right* about data: uri so i don't think that doesn't convey any use cases

[06:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[06:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
myakura: Our behaviour has changed in 10.50 anyway

[06:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, because it seems that not all browsers handle fragment IDs in URIs, validator.nu is doing the right thing by reporting it as an error, both in terms of what the RFCs/specs say and in terms of best practice

[06:46:00.0000] <myakura>
hmm, that still seems to work with my 10.50 Beta http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/377

[06:46:01.0000] <Yudai>
MikeSmith: I think validator should work according to specs not to implementation

[06:47:00.0000] <Yudai>
/me is not sure it is valid or not

[06:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think specs should work according to implementations

[06:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
myakura: Uh, what's that testing?

[06:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
myakura: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/378 is what I mean

[06:52:00.0000] <Yudai>
i thought  RFC2397 defines  a "absoluteURI" part in RFC2045

[06:53:00.0000] <Yudai>
but it seems wrong. RFC2397 seems define whole URI

[06:53:01.0000] <myakura>
gsnedders: ah!

[06:54:00.0000] <annevk>
Yudai, those RFCs are out of date

[06:54:01.0000] <annevk>
well, some of those

[06:54:02.0000] <annevk>
use http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfcXXXX to see which

[06:55:00.0000] <myakura>
well, Yudai and I were talking about Opera points to "Welcome ..." when clicking "Hello!" http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/379

[06:55:01.0000] <myakura>
and wondered whether it should or not.

[06:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"Fragment identifier semantics are independent of the URI scheme and thus cannot be redefined by scheme specifications."

[06:56:01.0000] <annevk>
yes, that ought to work

[06:56:02.0000] <annevk>
Gecko/WebKit have bugs

[06:56:03.0000] <Yudai>
annevk: oops. thanks

[06:56:04.0000] <myakura>
interesting.

[06:57:00.0000] <Yudai>
oooh?

[06:57:01.0000] <jre>
RFC 2396 is obsoleted by RFC 3986

[06:57:02.0000] <jre>
fragment identifier syntax is completely orthogonal to URI schemes

[06:58:00.0000] <myakura>
Hmm. RFC 2397 says 'where "urlchar" is imported from [RFC2396]' but there's no such in 2396...

[06:58:01.0000] <jre>
so a URI scheme definition shouldn't mention fragment identifiers at all

[06:59:00.0000] <Yudai>
2396 is older...3986 is newer... i mistake them everytime :(

[07:00:00.0000] <jre>
higher numbers usually are newer

[07:03:00.0000] <Yudai>
yes, i know. the problem is when given only 2396.

[07:03:01.0000] <Yudai>
2396 and 3986 are similar for me...

[07:04:00.0000] <Yudai>
then, data: uri with a fragment id is valid?

[07:04:01.0000] <jre>
of course

[07:05:00.0000] <Yudai>
i see

[07:07:00.0000] <Yudai>
MikeSmith: it is better to change the error to warning, i think

[07:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Yudai: changing it to a warning is technically doable, but it's not clear yet it's the right thing is this case

[07:12:00.0000] <Yudai>
MikeSmith: hmm, i think that people believe that a validator suits specs

[07:18:00.0000] <Yudai>
Philip's remark might be right, but the RFC is already issued

[07:19:00.0000] <Yudai>
anyway, we need hsivonen's comments

[07:22:00.0000] <annevk>
is dev.w3.org offline or so?

[07:22:01.0000] <annevk>
cvs diff seems to be very very slow

[07:26:00.0000] <myakura>
MikeSmith: btw have you found anyone who can do some interpretation work for you (and Oli) tomorrow night?

[07:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
myakura: I've not, but if you will be there and can do it, I'd be happy if you could

[07:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I have had very little time to do as much preparation as I would have liked to

[07:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
there's been a few other things going on the last few days...

[07:30:00.0000] <myakura>
MikeSmith: Sure I'd love to do, so that I can sneak into the place :) (I'd totally missed registering for the event)

[07:32:00.0000] <danbri>
from elsewhere on the internet, 'the minute I see the first porn site switch to HTML5 I know Flash has lost...'

[07:32:01.0000] <danbri>
any progress on that front?

[07:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
myakura: can you please e-mail Shiraishi-san and Cc me and let him know I requested that you be there to do interpretation for me as needed?

[07:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, damn you float-based layouts!  ::shakes fist::

[07:42:00.0000] <annevk>
ok

[07:42:01.0000] <annevk>
new XMLHttpRequest(anon) is defined now

[07:42:02.0000] <annevk>
I had a few people asking other questions which is why it was somewhat delayed

[07:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: In the IDL, shouldn't "Constructor(anon)" be "Constructor(bool anon)" or similar?

[07:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also, shouldn't the IDL have "in" in front of every function argument?

[07:47:00.0000] <annevk>
yes, no

[07:49:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, boolean added

[07:56:00.0000] <karlushi>
ooops validator.nu seems to be down. 

[07:57:00.0000] <annevk>
you can still use http://html5.validator.nu/ it seems

[07:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think beacuse those are actually two different instances

[07:58:00.0000] <karlushi>
annevk, ah thanks.

[07:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/ works too, but is running unstable code

[08:03:00.0000] <karlushi>
was looking at http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/form.html#form.attrs.accept-charset

[08:04:00.0000] <karlushi>
and it doesn't seem there is an explanation in which order you should process the space separated values list of encoding

[08:05:00.0000] <karlushi>
/me is going to the spec

[08:05:01.0000] <karlushi>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/forms.html#attr-form-accept-charset

[08:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
karlushi: http://whatwg.org/html#url-encoded-form-data

[08:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
Step 2 is where it defines the processing of accept-charset

[08:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
i.e. UAs can pick whichever they think is going to work best

[08:08:01.0000] <karlushi>
hmmm 

[08:08:02.0000] <karlushi>
I thought the order was meaningful

[08:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
It has no meaning defined by the spec, it seems

[08:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's just a list of charsets that the server will accept

[08:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
and there's no reason for the server to have preferences, since it'll decode them all equally into Unicode

[08:10:01.0000] <karlushi>
If specified, the value must be an ordered set of unique space-separated tokens

[08:10:02.0000] <karlushi>
-- quote from the spec

[08:10:03.0000] <Philip`>
The UA might choose to derive some meaning from the order

[08:10:04.0000] <annevk>
we should obsolete accept-charset

[08:10:05.0000] <karlushi>
ok

[08:11:00.0000] <annevk>
people ought to use UTF-8

[08:11:01.0000] <karlushi>
so if I understood well: accept-charset="ISO-8859-1 utf-8" == accept-charset="utf-8 iso-8859-1"

[08:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: People might want to migrate their site to UTF-8 gradually, by making their forms accept UTF-8 even if the outer page is stuck on Win1252

[08:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
in which case they need to use accept-charset

[08:13:00.0000] <karlushi>
/me is trying to figure out the issues/benefits of <form … accept-charset="ISO-8859-1 utf-8">

[08:13:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, we could make it like border= with only one allowed value

[08:13:02.0000] <annevk>
karlushi, why?

[08:13:03.0000] <annevk>
karlushi, use UTF-8, much superior

[08:13:04.0000] <Philip`>
karlushi: Not necessarily equal - a UA might choose to prefer ones that are earlier in the list, and the spec doesn't forbid or require that

[08:13:05.0000] <karlushi>
because it is confusing for developers right now, and we found that in legacy code. 

[08:14:00.0000] <annevk>
sounds like a good reason to make it obsolete but conforming or some such

[08:14:01.0000] <karlushi>
annevk, I'm entirely for utf-8, but my own client real world for now makes it difficult ;)

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Comma separate accept-charsets look much more common than space-separated

[08:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
*separated

[08:17:02.0000] <karlushi>
Philip`, indeed. Right now the form is with comma separated values

[08:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/data/form-accept-charset.txt

[08:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Interestingly, the people using "windows-1252,iso-8859-1" are going to get UTF-8)

[09:07:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, my email appears not to arrive at the W3C or something

[09:07:01.0000] <annevk>
weird

[09:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've been getting your emails, annevk.

[09:09:00.0000] <annevk>
I realize that, 'cause I do get replies :)

[09:09:01.0000] <annevk>
it's just they don't appear on the list

[09:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, huh.

[09:10:00.0000] <annevk>
indeed

[09:10:01.0000] <annevk>
time for conspiracy theories!

[09:10:02.0000] <annevk>
or a break... I guess I'll take a break

[09:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Either option sounds reasonable to me.

[09:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me headdesks.

[09:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Of *course* a transparent background image won't look transparent *if you use an opaque background color*.

[09:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
Huh?

[09:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I am dumb, jgraham.

[09:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: That's self-evident.

[09:13:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Fuck you, gsnedders ^_^

[09:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Don't swear in front of the children

[09:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or at them, rather :)

[09:14:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh right, sorry.  Would you like a lollipop, gsnedders?

[09:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay, I get to use my gradients in a production site!

[09:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
As the final background rule in a series of 3, targetting various levels of support, but still!

[09:19:00.0000] <annevk>
oh lol, first comment on http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1126460

[09:19:01.0000] <annevk>
seems also very true

[09:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup, we were discussing that from a different source yesterday.  ^_^

[09:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's kinda curious that Hixie gets so much grief for having a "Yes Minister" quote on his site when there are so many actual examples of people engaging in behaviour that fits that mould (one assumes unintentionally)

[09:24:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, email is getting through again

[09:27:00.0000] <annevk>
(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision -- raise the

[09:27:01.0000] <annevk>
question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the

[09:27:02.0000] <annevk>
jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy

[09:27:03.0000] <annevk>
of some higher echelon.

[09:27:04.0000] <annevk>
seems applicable

[10:01:00.0000] <karlushi>
annevk, coming from http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/26184-8.txt

[10:04:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[10:04:01.0000] <annevk>
forgot attribution, ta

[10:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
This is probably the most fun project I've ever done, because it's full of a lot of simple, cool visual effects that I can do really easily while maintaining accessibility.

[10:19:00.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if Adobe threatened to leave the W3C or something... Larry did far more than raise "procedural concerns"

[10:20:00.0000] <annevk>
HTML minutes say FO, his own public email says "object" and what he needs to do to record it formally...

[10:20:01.0000] <annevk>
in response to http://www.w3.org/QA/2010/02/working_group_publication_requ.html

[10:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[10:27:00.0000] <wycats>
annevk: also, weren't these issues raised AAAAAGES ago?

[10:27:01.0000] <wycats>
there are some emails on the public list that indicate that it went all the way up to the director

[10:27:02.0000] <wycats>
(already)

[10:30:00.0000] <annevk>
well yeah, I pointed out part of that

[10:30:01.0000] <annevk>
he seems to know want that either the SotD is changed or that we are re-chartered

[10:32:00.0000] <annevk>
if everyone acted this way we would not get very far

[10:32:01.0000] <annevk>
and now it's taking way too much time of everyone

[10:34:00.0000] <wycats>
annevk: but that exact point was already raised

[10:34:01.0000] <wycats>
like a year ago

[10:34:02.0000] <wycats>
and it was decided that rechartering was not needed

[10:35:00.0000] <wycats>
people are taking the opportunity to impugn Hixie and WHATWG

[10:46:00.0000] <annevk>
wycats, yeah, those twats always do

[10:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unfortunately, sometimes WHATWG contributors aren't as diplomatic as they could be.

[10:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Nor are the people who disagree with them, but still.)

[10:50:00.0000] <wycats>
:/

[10:50:01.0000] <wycats>
I feel the people touting the awesomeness of the W3C process forget why this situation came to pass in the first place

[10:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I feel the WHATWG's creation sort of parallels the W3C's creation, after reading TBL's "Weaving the Web".  IETF -> W3C -> WHATWG.

[11:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
wycats: The canvas charter decision was at the end of 2007

[11:10:01.0000] <wycats>
sorry... I should have said yeeeears ago ;)

[11:10:02.0000] <wycats>
AryehGregor: yah

[11:10:03.0000] <wycats>
great book

[12:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
smaug: the websocket spec in complete.html is a better experience (the cross-references work, for one), if you don't mind the size of that file

[12:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
smaug: i totally agree that splitting up the API and the protocol is dumb

[12:22:00.0000] <smaug>
Hixie: indeed. I wish there was  just one specification

[12:23:00.0000] <smaug>
/me doesn't remember why the protocol is in hybi wg

[12:25:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
smaug: because the standards-development fun needs to be spread out as widely as possible

Hum...

[13:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There doesn't seem to be anything about math and svg in the UA stylesheet section. Doesn't that mean a UA that doesn't support them will render all the contents as text?

[13:08:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
/me held a presentation today on html5 video; slides at http://simon.html5.org/presentations/html5-video/ (in swedish)

[13:12:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
wonder if i need to pay royalties for having an mpeg4/h.264/aac file on my server

[13:13:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
well, annevk's server

[13:15:00.0000] <jwalden>
I believe the current answer to that question is "no"

[13:16:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
because my use is non-commercial?

[13:17:00.0000] <jwalden>
because payment's not required to view it

[13:18:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i thought payment was required for distribution

[13:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not if you don't charge for it

[13:19:01.0000] <jwalden>
^

[13:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Internet broadcast" category

[13:20:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
ah

[13:21:00.0000] <jwalden>
what's "spela baklänges " mean?

[13:21:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
play backwards

[13:22:00.0000] <jwalden>
<video> really mandates backwards-playing support?  color me surprised

[13:23:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
it does

[13:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what significant differences Martin Kliehm thinks exist between the two canvas split drafts

[13:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jwalden: Yeah, but sound is optional

http://www.thehistorian.org/2010/02/15/historians-social-media-party/

[13:31:02.0000] <jwalden>
that only makes it slightly less surprising :-)

[15:43:00.0000] <hober>
Philip`: the bit under "Editors:" in the front-matter, I'm guessing

[15:46:00.0000] <carllerche>
Is there any way to do canvas style composting but with CSS in webkit / FF?


2010-02-17
[16:49:00.0000] <carllerche>
webkit-background-composite seems to be making up some black space

[17:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone have any opinions on what i should include in a section teaching people about form controls?

[17:32:00.0000] <miketaylr>
graphics of shiny new UIs :)

[17:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
well that'll be up to volunteers to provide :-)

[17:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i suck at making pictures

[17:33:02.0000] <miketaylr>
heh

[17:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
everyone is welcome to contribute images though

[17:35:00.0000] <miketaylr>
is this section in addition to what's in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#forms?

[17:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm adding an intro section after that first paragraph

[17:37:00.0000] <miketaylr>
hmm, not really sure. but i've got a test page that could possible be added, or repurposed

[17:37:01.0000] <miketaylr>
http://www.miketaylr.com/code/input-type-attr.html

[17:38:00.0000] <miketaylr>
s/added/linked to somewhere

[17:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm thinking more a tutorial-like thing

[17:40:00.0000] <miketaylr>
gotcha

[17:40:01.0000] <fantasai>
When html5lib serializes to HTML, it includes a namespace declaration. (And uses the XHTML document's DOCTYPE, if any.) Is that intentional?

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i think i need an equivalent of #file and #line in the validator

[17:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i'm trying to validate the post-merge (but pre-anolis) file and the line numbers are very confusing

[17:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
miketaylr: here's what i have so far: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#forms

[17:49:00.0000] <miketaylr>
hmm, i'm seeing the same thing as in the non-kitchen sink spec.

[17:49:01.0000] <miketaylr>
/me clears cache

[17:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
there should be two new sections that say "This section is non-normative"

[17:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
at the top of the Forms section

[17:51:00.0000] <miketaylr>
ah yes, chromium is caching aggressively, apparently

[17:54:00.0000] <miketaylr>
mmm pizza

[17:54:01.0000] <miketaylr>
that looks good to me. with <label> is it worth mentioning the for='' attribute as well?

[17:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
maybe in due course

[17:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to stay relatively simple

[17:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
one could write a book about just this section

[17:55:01.0000] <miketaylr>
indeed

[17:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
what pizza toppings should we offer

[17:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
so far i have bacon, extra cheese, and onion.

[17:55:04.0000] <miketaylr>
mushroom, por favor

[17:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
mushroom it is.

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
should i suggest the toppings be sent as topping=a&topping=b&topping=c, or toppingA=on&toppingB=on&toppingC=on?

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
the former means explaining the value="" attribute on type=checkbox

[18:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
the latter means explaining that it has a default

[18:19:00.0000] <miketaylr>
i think i prefer the first, but that's probably just an arbitrary personal preference

[18:19:01.0000] <ment>
uh... but topping=a&topping=b would get parsed by webserver as topping=b ...?

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
ment: only if the webserver is buggy

[18:24:00.0000] <ment>
how it should be passed to application then? like an array?

[18:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's up to the application

[18:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
webservers that implement CGI just pass the data to the script unparsed

[18:27:00.0000] <ment>
i understand html 5 doesn't cover this, i'm just curious about the standard behaviour of scripting languages

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
in perl, CGI.pm seems to offer it in a variety of forms, including an array form

[18:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
PHP has a special behavior to handle it.  name="topping[]" makes it collect the values into a $_POST['topping'] array.

[18:28:02.0000] <ment>
for example, let's say some binding parses those multiple key=val1&key=val2 as an array

[18:28:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Without the [] on the name, though, it just gives you the last one.

[18:29:00.0000] <ment>
then key=a is is string, key=a&key=b is an array

[18:29:01.0000] <ment>
TabAtkins: that seems reasonable

[18:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#forms

[18:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
now with more pizza

[18:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
er wait

[18:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
my script failed

[18:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries again

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[18:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#forms

[18:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
now with actual more pizza

[18:54:00.0000] <miketaylr>
just read it. looking good.

[18:57:00.0000] <miketaylr>
and not just because i'm hungry. i think.

[18:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[21:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone have any ideas on what http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8936 should look like?

[21:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
(summary table of content models)

[21:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and what elements are in each)

[21:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not sure how best to present the information

[22:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so I'm trying to see how good a version of <details> I can implement with just CSS and JavaScript

[22:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
can anyone spare me some CSS clues?

[22:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am trying to figure out how to style things so that the summary element is visible but other children of details are not

[22:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
in the default closed state

[22:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
having trouble with this for text children of details, since there's no way to address them with a selector other than via details itself

[23:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: you need xbl to do that

[23:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I decided to fake it just enough for purposes of a demo

[23:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/mid/4B7B9700.10302⊙gd - shouldn't the question be "how can we fix the obviously broken process?"

[23:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
it seems like "education" doesn't really work in this kind of situation

[23:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Apple has nothing to do with the iPhone FaceBook app

[23:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
i made the diagram at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#kinds-of-content interactive

[23:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
it only seems to work in chrome though :-(

[23:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
seems to do what I assume is intended in my recent(ish) WebKit trunk build inside Safari

[23:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
huh. validator.nu has crashed again

[23:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
works in safari too

[23:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
but not in firefox

[23:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so far, I'd be inclined to continue to treat # in a data: URL as a validation error

[23:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
and opera seems quite buggy with it

[23:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[23:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
2/4 ain't bad

[23:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
i guess

[23:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
though really it's 1/3

[23:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i kinda like it, it's pretty

[23:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
the shadow is maybe a bit out of place

[23:34:00.0000] <nessy>
testing browser support through the spec? hehe

[23:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I have a favor to ask of you

[23:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: what kind of favor?

[23:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: Accessibility TF is working on a Change Proposal to replace table @summary with a recommendation to use <details>, and I noticed it may have an impact on HTML parsing

[23:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
uh oh

[23:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: was wondering if you could review with that in mind, and send your comments to the TF list (or send them to me to pass along)

[23:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ok

[23:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
looking for the URL now...

[23:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Details_element_as_a_replacement_for_summary_attribute%2C_Feb_15%2C_2010

[23:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I pointed out to them that replacing <details><summary> with <button> would effectively reopen a closed issue, but on a technical level I also noticed that they suggest allowing <details> as a direct child of <table>

[23:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I love how Negative Effects tend to be "?" or "None I can think of" in Change Proposals

[23:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
which I thought might be problematic, though I am not a parsing expert

[23:39:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: not here http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_TextAssociations#Negative_Impact

[23:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am more trusting of a Change Proposal if it does mention some negative impacts because I find it unlikely anything is 100% good

[23:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i wasn't sure what negative effects not having longdesc="" would have... i'm certainly open to suggestions :-)

[00:04:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, when I looked at your examples this morning the controls did not have values?

[00:04:01.0000] <annevk>
surely they don't take it from labels

[00:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
where's the current status of Change Proposals maintained these days?

[00:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me fails to locate them on the HTML WG wiki front page

[00:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: http://dev.w3.org/html5/status/issue-status.html

[00:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: thanks

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: so if Larry doesn't retract the doctype/versioning proposal by tomorrow, the clock for counter proposals starts tomorrow if the chairs agree the ACTION-172 conformed to the requirements of the Change Process?

[00:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/the ACTION/the output of ACTION/

[00:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: it doesn't start automatically

[00:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[00:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: the owner would revert to Chairs and we are supposed to decide what to do next

[00:25:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I see

[00:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: no clocks ever start automatically without intervention of the Chairs (to avoid flooding)

[00:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[00:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
we avoided issuing any new calls for proposals or the like this week because we want the publication question to be settled first

[00:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's still unsettled about publication?

[00:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the CfC is pending, and the chairs are unclear on the effect of the pending objection/appeal/whatever on our ability to publish

[00:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the CfC goes through tomorrow (inclusive), at that point we'll need the W3C Team to tell us the status

[00:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I thought an objection/appeal/whatever was retracted if it ever existed

[00:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so far as I know, it has not been retracted

[00:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting. I'm losing track of what's going on in the WG. clearly, I spend too much time on mochitests these days

[00:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I wish I were more clear on what is actually going on

[00:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
since it is in theory my job to be clear on such things

[00:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: the forms stuff? look at it again, i changed it since this morning, it's longer now.

[00:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I made some examples of how <details> could work for table summaries without being visible by default, per the A11Y TF's suggestions: http://webkit.org/demos/hover-summary/example1.html http://webkit.org/demos/hover-summary/example2.html

[00:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(the difference is the second one doesn't even have a visible caption by default)

[00:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyone care to critique the markup or CSS in the <style> elements in those pages?

[00:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(don't worry about the contents of details.js and details.css, I know they are very sloppy; they are just my best attempts to implement details)

[00:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the <details> in each case will appear if you hover the <table>, or tab into the <details> element

[00:35:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I meant the introduction you just added

[00:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
the forms intro?

[00:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hmm, my example breaks really bad in Firefox

[00:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it does not like the idea of a table being a containing block :-/

[00:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
looks nice in webkit

[00:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you can even use space to toggle the details element if you tab into it

[00:37:01.0000] <annevk>
<label> <input type=radio name=size> Small </label>

[00:37:02.0000] <annevk>
there's no value attribute

[00:37:03.0000] <annevk>
ooh

[00:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: keep reading

[00:37:05.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[00:38:00.0000] <annevk>
as somebody mentioned that might not work in PHP

[00:38:01.0000] <annevk>
PHP requires name=...[] for array stuff :/

[00:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure how to make this example work in Firefox without adding a gratuitous <div>

[00:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: it's just an intro, i'm sure someone using php will read a php intro too

[00:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
looks like only WebKit lets you tab into a display: none element with tabindex=0

[00:44:00.0000] <annevk>
i guess

[00:44:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, does WebKit even implement withCredentials?

[00:44:02.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, ap was complaining (quite a while ago) that having withCredentials was silly and WebKit would not have it for the foreseeable future

[00:44:03.0000] <annevk>
because of some impl difficulty with the network stack

[00:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: we do have withCredentials

[00:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: are your demos stable for use as bug report test cases?

[00:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: it was a pain to get the network stack to truly respect not sending as credentials

[00:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I was planning to tweak them a little to behave a little better in other browsers (by slightly defeating the original design intent)

[00:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: but I can refrain from checking in that change, or check in new versions under different URLs

[00:46:02.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, bugger

[00:47:00.0000] <annevk>
/me would love to nuke it

[00:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I think part of the reason we added it in the first place is that we didn't want cross-site requests with credentials to be the default

[00:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I guess it does seem a little silly to have three modes, but no-credentials with-Origin mode is mildly useful for semi-public data sources

[00:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: where you don't have to be a specific user but they would like to log what domains are accessing it and perhaps limit that

[00:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: nevermind, I'm not going to change these, too hard to make it perfect in all browsers

[00:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it looks like Opera and Firefox won't focus elements that are visibility: hidden either

[00:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ok. I'll file a bug about the hover thing

[00:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I'm not 100% sure if it's even a bug per CSS that a relative positioned table doesn't count as a containing block for its absolute positioned descendants

[00:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: ok, after checking the CSS spec, I think it is: <http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#containing-block-details>

[00:57:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, in that case you might as well accept credentials too and just ignore them

[00:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I don't even properly remember the full debate we had about this

[00:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: but I remember we argued about it a long time

[00:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would be very hesitant to change it now, because anyone who has coded against the current spec has a potential security hole if we transparently change the default on sending credentials

[00:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I think parts of the reasons for the original decision are:

[00:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
- if a server responds with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, it can't use Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * it has to echo back the specific origin

[00:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so servers that allow credentials can't use *, which would be inconvenient

[01:00:00.0000] <annevk>
but they can use null

[01:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
- you can't talk to a server that doesn't use Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true if you send credentials

[01:00:02.0000] <annevk>
which works for the globally unique identifier origin

[01:00:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: filed https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=546596

[01:01:00.0000] <annevk>
that's true

[01:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: if you had to use anon to talk to any server that doesn't allow credentials, that would break any existing use of cross-site XHR without the credentials flag, and it would make it impossible to have semi-public resources

[01:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: commented

[01:04:01.0000] <annevk>
it does not limit anything on the server side of things afaict

[01:04:02.0000] <annevk>
it might break some existing usage of the API, yes

[01:04:03.0000] <annevk>
but not everyone implements it yet so I'm not sure how much weight we should give that

[01:05:00.0000] <annevk>
preferably not much

[01:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the third mode has some value, for one thing it matches exactly what XDR does

[01:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it might not be a huge amount of value, but it doesn't seem so terrible that we should risk breaking compat to remove it

[01:11:00.0000] <annevk>
boo

[01:11:01.0000] <annevk>
oh well

[01:11:02.0000] <annevk>
I think I will throw for non same-origin username/password parameters

[01:11:03.0000] <annevk>
that makes a lot of sense

[01:25:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, hey

[01:25:01.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, can I use your Windows box for Skype later today?

[01:25:02.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, I'd like to attend the CSS WG meeting

[01:26:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/mid/4B7B2919.5050804⊙no is exactly why registries should be wikis or simple web services

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
personally i don't understand why all the people who care about this stuff don't just do the registrations themselves

[01:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
instead of "educating" the people who don't

[01:27:02.0000] <asmodai>
annevk: To at least have the info somewhere?

[01:27:03.0000] <asmodai>
Hixie: Easier to moan and bitch I'd wager

[01:28:00.0000] <annevk>
asmodai, basically

[01:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
if they cared about making things easy, they wouldn't do registries

[01:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
at least not these complicated ones with forms and e-mails and experts

[01:29:00.0000] <annevk>
I was a bit surprised that you thought using a rel-registry was suddenly ok

[01:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
fantasai: Do you have some sample code?

[01:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
these custom URIs would be unnecessary if all apps on a system agreed to use one shared HTTP stack and dispatched on MIME type

[01:30:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, then you'd have custom MIME types

[01:30:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, just moves the problem elsewhere, since MIME type registries also suck (surprise surprise)

[01:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, sure

[01:31:00.0000] <annevk>
sweet

[01:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: :-)

[01:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: the MIME registry has the vnd stuff, though

[01:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and URLs so far don't

[01:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but then, there are types that don't use vnd

[01:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i didn't say it was ok, i said we should test it to see if it's ok

[01:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
so yeah, registries FAIL

[01:32:04.0000] <annevk>
we ended up with application/x-widget or something because the vnd stuff seemed to complicated

[01:33:00.0000] <annevk>
I argued we should do vnd, but I didn't have the bandwidth to make it all happen

[01:33:01.0000] <annevk>
if it was just a wiki I'm sure we would have done the right thing

[01:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dispatching on MIME type wouldn't help this application intercept requests to http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=4

[01:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
The developers would have to set up their own server on its own domain that responds with their custom MIME type and returns some custom format that tells the application what's the real URL to load

[01:34:00.0000] <annevk>
IETF is just too hard to get into with all the annoying text/plain documents that are not really straightforward to read

[01:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: sure it would if facebook UA-sniffed and returned application/vnd.facebook to Mobile Safari

[01:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
which doesn't seem much better than using a custom protocol handler, and requires a lot more network traffic

[01:34:03.0000] <asmodai>
And then there's magnet: -- which is not officially registered either ;)

[01:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: What would it do on devices that use Mobile Safari but don't have the Facebook iPhone application installed?

[01:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
Would it need some way to sniff that too?

[01:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: how does fb: work in that case?

[01:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: People without the application won't see fb: links anywhere (I presume)

[01:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
whereas they will often see links to normal HTTP Facebook profile pages

[01:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: so when does a user receive an fb: URL?

[01:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose they could make a special /profile-iphone-app.php?id=... that the application uses for this

[01:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(the solution to this seems to be making Web apps instead of native apps)

[01:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Sounds like the application inserts the URLs into your iPhone's contacts list

[01:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
AIUI, the use of fb: URLs is supposed to be entirely transparent to the user. They are never exposed in the App's UI

[01:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, maybe I'm wrong.

[01:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
is http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/image/ not up to date?

[01:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't have image/svg+xml

[01:48:00.0000] <annevk>
they still haven't been able to register it

[01:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: image/svg+xml pretty much sums up what's wrong with registries

[01:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe IANA5 should be next on the list

[01:51:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it's called wiki.whatwg.org

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders why hsivonen posted that link

[01:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
/me too

[01:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: to point out that the meme that the modularized parts aren't "HTML5" is catching on

[01:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
I don't think David Orchard is really representative of what most web developers consider HTML5 :-)

[01:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
most people think geolocation and sql are part of html5

[01:53:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, he at least has a modest level of "W3C bias"

[01:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
he mentions a private list that the W3C set up for the HTML Working Group, I hope someone tells me about that list

[01:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it would be interesting to find out how arguing that the canvas context spec isn't HTML5 correlates with previously arguing for parts to be split out based on spec modularity concerns

[01:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tries to buy a PC

[01:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's so hard compared to buying a Mac

[01:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I personally don't care if they "are" or "are not" HTML5 as long as we get to publish them, and are not forced to add disclaimers saying we're not really supposed to publish them

[01:55:03.0000] <hsivonen>
in the Mac case, it's so easy to see that Apple doesn't sell the kind of box I want

[01:56:00.0000] <annevk>
has anyone read http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/15/HTML5 yet?

[01:56:01.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if it's worth it

[01:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I just read the first half and commented about two seeming factual errors

[01:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me found it interesting, and submitted an essay of a comment that hasn't been moderated yet

[01:56:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(comment waiting for moderation)

[01:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
things I thought were inaccurate: "One of the distinguishing features of the Web is that it has never specified APIs or Object Models."

[01:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"The http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/ ... provides detailed algorithms for parsing HTML, even in the face of severe syntax errors, and specifies how the results of parsing should be used to construct the Object Model. Thus, the syntax is ephemeral; the Object Model, interoperable across the network, is what matters."

[01:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(second sentence of the latter)

[01:57:03.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: you're an animal :)

[01:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
DOM Level 1 Core is a clear counter-example to the former

[01:58:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8936

[01:59:00.0000] <wycats>
what I mean is just to take the info in each of the sections, like "metadata content = base command link meta noscript script style title", and put it in a table

[01:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
comment in the bug please :-)

[01:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
otherwise i'll lose track of your feedback

[01:59:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: isn't tbray married to a DOM Level 1 WG chair?

[02:00:00.0000] <wycats>
<table><thead><tr><th>category</th><th>elements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Metadata</td><td>base command link meta noscript script style title</td></tr>...</table>

[02:00:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: sure

[02:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: thanks!

[02:00:03.0000] <wycats>
was just checking if it made sense :)

[02:00:04.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I was not aware of that, but that would make it extra hilarious

[02:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: listing the columns you want in the table would be ideal for me

[02:00:06.0000] <wycats>
Just those two :)

[02:00:07.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[02:00:08.0000] <Hixie>
make sure to mention them in the bug :-)

[02:01:00.0000] <wycats>
ok

[02:01:01.0000] <wycats>
maybe also an "exceptions" column

[02:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[02:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
that might be a fat column

[02:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh if you use safari or chrome btw i made the pretty picture showing how some of the categories are related be more interactive

[02:01:05.0000] <wycats>
yeah I saw :)

[02:01:06.0000] <wycats>
svg?

[02:01:07.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[02:01:08.0000] <Hixie>
not sure why it doesn't work in firefox or opera

[02:05:00.0000] <wycats>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8936

[02:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool, thanks

[02:06:01.0000] <wycats>
my lack of general response to your ticket closing should be construed as approval :P

[02:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can mark them CLOSED if you care to actually go through them

[02:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
or else just leave them, that's what I tend to do

[02:08:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: any further progress on being able to use the inline form but have it marked as a ticket I opened?

[02:08:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: ha

[02:09:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
wycats: you get cc-ed if you're logged in to the status annotation system

[02:09:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
wycats: you need to use the same email address as your bugzilla account

[02:09:02.0000] <wycats>
status annotation system?

[02:09:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
top right of the spec

[02:09:04.0000] <wycats>
when I log in it says: "Error: OK (403)."

[02:10:00.0000] <wycats>
403 OK seems incorrect :P

[02:10:01.0000] <wycats>
I know this isn't the HTTP spec, but ... ;)

[02:10:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
the status message is just advisory :)

[02:11:00.0000] <wycats>
zcorpan__: how do I know if I'm logged in?

[02:11:01.0000] <wycats>
it always says 403 OK

[02:11:02.0000] <wycats>
ah I need to request an account

[02:11:03.0000] <wycats>
and I should use the same email

[02:11:04.0000] <wycats>
and then it'll work?

[02:11:05.0000] <zcorpan__>
yes

[02:12:00.0000] <wycats>
w00t

[02:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I believe he is

[02:12:02.0000] <wycats>
can I change my password?

[02:12:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
no

[02:14:00.0000] <wycats>
meh... still no clear-after-submitting :P

[02:16:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
file a bug

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: it should select the text after submitting now

[02:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: at least if you hit enter

[02:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is almost as good

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't clear because i sometimes file a bunch of identical bugs on a bunch of different sections

[02:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
and it would be a huge pain if it cleared

[02:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
why do i get the crash-recovery dialog every time i open opera?

[02:29:01.0000] <wycats>
:/

[02:29:02.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: "Contexts in which this element may be used" for <base> should not include the idea that "A base element, if it has a target attribute, must come before any elements in the tree that represent http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#hyperlink"

[02:29:03.0000] <wycats>
I'm not sure what the rules are for that section

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[02:30:01.0000] <wycats>
the <base> element has a more restrictive context than that specified in "Contexts in which this element may be used"

[02:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Dunno. Does it crash every time you open Opera or?

[02:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
no

[02:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
i quit normally

[02:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
and then i open it again

[02:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
i get the "how do you want to open opera" dialog

[02:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
with no "never ask me" checkbox

[02:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: file a bug, i'll figure it out :-)

[02:31:06.0000] <jgraham>
/me tries to reproduce

[02:31:07.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: ok

[02:32:00.0000] <wycats>
huh... I didn't know about <base target>... claims to be well implemented

[02:32:01.0000] <wycats>
cool beans

[02:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: huh. I changed prefs from "start form last time" to the homepage option and now it starts normally

[02:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Ah, I was just about to point out that pref

[02:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
it wasn't on the last option in that list, dunno if it just wasn't set and two parts of opera have different defaults or something

[02:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[02:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
afk

[02:41:00.0000] <annevk>
not having rel=feed sort of sucks

[02:41:01.0000] <annevk>
my archived pages currently use it, e.g. http://annevankesteren.nl/2010/02/sabotage

[02:41:02.0000] <annevk>
to point to the main feed

[02:41:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: not worth the trouble

[02:41:04.0000] <annevk>
replacing it with rel=alternate would be wrong

[02:41:05.0000] <annevk>
per spec

[02:41:06.0000] <annevk>
what to do?

[02:41:07.0000] <annevk>
fix the spec i guess?

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that would be my choice

[02:42:01.0000] <annevk>
it's important for the archived pages to include some link to the main feed because if people wanna subscribe from just seeing that page they expect it to work

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
speak to mark if you want something figured out for this

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
he did a ton of research on this

[02:49:01.0000] <annevk>
i just want the spec to say that in case of rel=alternate + type=application/atom+xml it might not be for the current page, but also for the main page

[02:50:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe a combination of up and alternate would do?

[02:50:01.0000] <annevk>
or top and alternate

[02:50:02.0000] <annevk>
though that would not be quite backwards compatible

[02:50:03.0000] <annevk>
though top and alternate for the link would be uncommon

[02:51:00.0000] <annevk>
same link*

[03:03:00.0000] <annevk>
oh google/on2, today

[03:07:00.0000] <asmodai>
http://clientsfromhell.tumblr.com/post/392772921/client-indian-outsourcer-says-he-can-do-this

[03:49:00.0000] <csarven>
So, catching up on Storage. Is there any way to implement something like globalStorage?

[03:50:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
cookies?

[03:50:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
window.name can be used to simulate sessionStorage

[03:51:00.0000] <csarven>
Well, cookies won't allow site A to access a cookie set by site B

[03:51:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
true

[03:52:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
does globalStorage allow that?

[03:52:01.0000] <csarven>
I was thinking of being able to store a non-sensitive data that can be accessed globally

[03:52:02.0000] <csarven>
AFAIK, yes

[03:52:03.0000] <csarven>
However, globalStorage is obsolete

[03:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
globalStorage was renamed localStorage and had its API changed a bit

[03:53:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
there's localStorage

[03:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
but it's basically the same thing

[03:55:00.0000] <csarven>
localStorage.setItem('foo', 'bar') from site A. localStorage.getItem('foo') from site B return null

[03:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah it's per-domain for security reasons

[03:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
(globalStorage was too, though you had to specify the domain and there was some level of sharing)

[03:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
you can simulate it using localStorage if you provide a cross-site API using postMessage()

[03:57:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
or CORS?

[03:57:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
or does cors not enable dom access?

[03:58:00.0000] <csarven>
CORS only allows the data for recognized servers

[03:59:00.0000] <csarven>
For open distributed systems, I don't think it will work

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, time for me to sleep

[04:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:00:02.0000] <csarven>
I don't think postMessage() helps me

[04:01:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
cors can do allow: *, no?

[04:01:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan__, it doesn't

[04:01:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
annevk: ok

[04:01:03.0000] <csarven>
Simply wanted site A to set a value and let any other site use that value

[04:01:04.0000] <annevk>
CORS gives access to a single resource, giving access to the DOM would give access to all resources of that origin

[04:01:05.0000] <annevk>
would be quite a big difference

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk>
(plus a bunch of other issues)

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk>
csarven, you could define a postMessage() API that other sites can use, no?

[04:08:00.0000] <csarven>
That follows a centralised model no?

[04:09:00.0000] <annevk>
i suppose

[04:09:01.0000] <csarven>
That is, the other sites shouldn't have to be aware of the site that created the key/value.

[04:09:02.0000] <csarven>
Consider this:

[04:10:00.0000] <csarven>
Site A tries to set a key/value for person's username if there isn't already one in use. If there is one, it can reuse it

[04:12:00.0000] <csarven>
This is sort of like putting some data in your browser so wherever you go, you can carry it around with you. Fill forms etc

[04:13:00.0000] <csarven>
If site A wants to modify the existing key, it can throw a dialog box for the user to decide whether to update it or not. Similar to storing a new password value

[04:15:00.0000] <annevk>
I still don't see the problem

[04:17:00.0000] <csarven>
Do you mean to say that this is a non-issue and that it can be done or that you don't acknowledge this to be a valid problem

[04:18:00.0000] <annevk>
I mean to say that I don't see the problem

[04:19:00.0000] <annevk>
for instance, is there a site B?

[04:19:01.0000] <annevk>
the scenario is not very clear

[04:19:02.0000] <csarven>
heh

[04:20:00.0000] <csarven>
Site A looks for the key, if found, it will use it, otherwise it sets it. Site B looks for the key, if found, it will use it... Site C looks for the key..

[04:21:00.0000] <annevk>
where do they look for this key?

[04:21:01.0000] <csarven>
Wherever the UA is storing it

[04:21:02.0000] <annevk>
what would prevent A from doing something bad with it?

[04:21:03.0000] <csarven>
Site A, B, C .. need not be aware of each other

[04:21:04.0000] <csarven>
That's relative based on the data stored

[04:21:05.0000] <annevk>
I think you need site X that is the storage-broker

[04:22:00.0000] <annevk>
and otherwise, yeah, not possible

[04:22:01.0000] <csarven>
As I've said, if site A wants to update the key, UA can prompt the user.. like it does for passwords

[04:22:02.0000] <annevk>
o_O

[04:23:00.0000] <csarven>
Storage-broker is a centralised model. It doesn't scale well.

[04:24:00.0000] <annevk>
UA is also centralized

[04:24:01.0000] <annevk>
storage-broker would actually work across UAs

[04:24:02.0000] <annevk>
euh, no it wouldn't

[04:24:03.0000] <annevk>
nm

[04:25:00.0000] <csarven>
Even if it did, it would requires site 1...n to be aware of the storage-broker

[04:27:00.0000] <csarven>
So, do you see the problem now?

[04:27:01.0000] <annevk>
sure

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk>
but I don't really think this is something worth solving

[04:28:01.0000] <csarven>
Really?

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk>
really

[04:30:00.0000] <csarven>
Consider your UA having profile data can be used by sites for registration or authentication

[04:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Would people want to share that data automatically with every web site that chooses to ask for it?

[04:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like it'd be either very restricted data, or else a significant privacy concern

[04:32:00.0000] <csarven>
You can put whatever you want to share in your profile data

[04:32:01.0000] <csarven>
The problem is no different than Geolocation

[04:32:02.0000] <annevk>
sounds like openid

[04:32:03.0000] <csarven>
Site asks for your location and the UA prompts the user if they want to share it or not

[04:32:04.0000] <annevk>
anyway, my mom would never understand this

[04:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
csarven: So the prompt is on reading, not just on writing?

[04:33:01.0000] <csarven>
It can be both

[04:34:00.0000] <csarven>
Writing is obviously opens up potential issues but I think that can be solved by UA's UI

[04:34:01.0000] <csarven>
For instance, the user marks their fullname, username fields to never be asked to be written by a site

[04:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd expect users would get pretty annoyed with prompts popping up every time an ad iframe tries to read the email addresses from their global profile data, in order to spam them

[04:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
and even more annoyed if it didn't pop up a prompt first

[04:36:00.0000] <csarven>
How do users deal with storing passwords when they login?

[04:36:01.0000] <csarven>
Same problem

[04:36:02.0000] <annevk>
not at all

[04:36:03.0000] <Philip`>
Browsers do it automatically, and don't expose any password storage API to pages

[04:37:00.0000] <csarven>
My response was in respect to user's dealing with UA's prompt

[04:39:00.0000] <csarven>
or even SSL warnings

[04:39:01.0000] <csarven>
Users can manage how they want to deal with that information globally from their UA's settings

[04:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is Opera's approach (where you can enter some standard personal information in a settings page, and it fills in forms based on input names or something like that, maybe automatically or when you click a button) insufficient for this?

[04:41:01.0000] <csarven>
The point is to let users store data they want in their UA and have that accessible without any middle-man, storage-brokers, central systems..

[04:42:00.0000] <annevk>
not sure why websites have to get involved in such a feature

[04:44:00.0000] <csarven>
Philip`:  I would say in some ways, yes. What's different is that say you create an account on a federated system, that account username could be accessible by any site in that system (or anyone for that matter)

[04:47:00.0000] <csarven>
Web sites, UA and users wants to get involved in such a feature because it can automate a lot of mundane tasks

[04:48:00.0000] <csarven>
Even entering your email or OpenID URL for some identification

[04:48:01.0000] <csarven>
s/URL/URI

[04:49:00.0000] <csarven>
It helps data to flow in decentralized systems.

[04:49:01.0000] <csarven>
I'm not sure what else I need to say on top of this.. :)

[05:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: thanks for supporting publication

[05:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'm at an event here in Tokyo tonight and my friend Shiraishi-san gave me a copy of a printed book he wrote which just got published by a major publisher here

[05:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
title translates to "Intoduction to HTML5 & (related) APIs"

[05:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
subtitle: "From canvas and video to Web Sockets" 

[05:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think this is the first full book about HTML5 that's actually been published as a printed book

[05:10:00.0000] <annevk>
cool MikeSmith

[05:10:01.0000] <annevk>
funny that of canvas, video, and Web Sockets, one is in HTML5, one is half in HTML5, and one is not :p

[05:10:02.0000] <annevk>
well, per W3C definitions anyway

[05:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: what's not in HTML5 is (related) :-)

[05:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
At least it doesn't mention geolocation in the subtitle

[05:16:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
annevk: hmm, didn't we have a test for [>] in doctype?

[05:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I mentioned geolocation, Workers, the File API and WebGL yesterday in my talk, since with the recent splits, it doesn't matter so much what has been in a draft titled "HTML5" at some point

[05:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(I did mention that those haven't been in a draft titled HTML5, though)

[05:18:02.0000] <Philip`>

Oh dear

[05:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tries to parse that in his head

[05:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me waits for cranial explosion

[05:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
>]> is what it is without the comments?

[05:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(per SGML)

[05:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
Don't ask me

[05:21:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
comment in the attlist decl with data "><!><!"

[05:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Ask Leif, since he said it is "easy")

[05:21:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
comment after doctype with data "><!!"

[05:21:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
another comment with data " > "

[05:21:04.0000] <Lachy>
per SGML rules, that's easy to parse. Per HTML's rules, I'm not so sure without looking at the spec

[05:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I combined it onto a single line - don't know if that'll break the SGML parsing)

[05:22:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan__, http://tc.labs.opera.com/html/parsing/doctype/001.htm ?

[05:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Per HTML 5? It just ends after the first >.

[05:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, up to the first ">" is fine. It's the stuff after that with the bogus comment parsing that's not so easy

[05:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
<!> just vanishes

[05:23:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
annevk: yeah. it seems it only has <!doctype html [ x ]>

[05:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
<!-- >]><!--> is a comment with data " >]><!-"

[05:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Then I need to look at the spec

[05:24:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
we don't close the doctype for <!doctype html [>]>

[05:24:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan__, I honestly couldn't care less

[05:25:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm tired of the SGML nonsense. SGML has been dead since the first version of HTML.

[05:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/380

[05:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
(in Opera)

[05:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmm, it seems to have changed a bit in 10.50 (vs 10.10) - it now shows nothing instead of treating the doctype as text, when it's not properly closed)

[05:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but it still does the crazy '['/']' counting thing)

[05:31:00.0000] <asmodai>
SGML should die already.

[05:31:01.0000] <asmodai>
Even DocBook moved to XML a long time ago ;)

[05:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
It has died already

[05:31:03.0000] <Philip`>
but some people like poking its corpse

[05:32:00.0000] <asmodai>
Flogging a dead horse so that its legs twitch does not make it alive.

[05:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
Indeed, but some people do it anyway because they don't want to believe it's dead, and others do it because it's fun

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yet others do it as a matter of principle that nothing can ever be obsoleted

[05:34:00.0000] <asmodai>
SGMl served its purpose. Time to move on.

[05:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't care about hiding the ]> from a bogus doctype, but it does seem potentially risky to make fake internal subset doctypes trigger quirks mode when they used to trigger standards in most browsers

[05:35:00.0000] <annevk>
filed http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9051 on feed autodisco

[05:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
If the page author has any kind of concern at all about the quality of their page's rendering, they're not going to accept a ]> at the top-left corner of the page

[05:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
so they're not going to use fake internal subset doctypes

[05:36:00.0000] <annevk>
mpilgrim, http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9051

[05:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.alistapart.com/articles/customdtd/ - "when you display the file in a browser, the ]> shows up on the screen. There’s no way around this bug, so this approach is right out."

[05:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
so even people following that article will use the safe approach of editing the .dtd file instead

[05:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Safe in terms of parsing, anyway)

[05:38:02.0000] <annevk>
still a shame that feed autodisco requires so much markup

[05:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes ALA didn't promote custom DTDs

[05:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.marlowe.co.uk/epages/Store2_Shop1549.sf - yikes

[05:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: that's so sad

[05:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: hahahahaha

[05:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand what Leif is trying to gain by trying to use an internal subset. It does nothing that can't be achieved with a system identifier and an external DTD, and even the utility of that is questionable.

[05:54:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
annevk: i agree, that should definitely be conforming

[05:54:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
if only because a billion pages use it that way

[05:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Aw crap, we jumped over 9k while I wasn't looking.

[05:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
>_<

[05:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
9k?

[05:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's OVER 9 THOUSAAAAAAND!

[05:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It?

The current bug number for the spec.

[05:57:01.0000] <annevk>
"This video contains content from Funimation Entertainment, who has blocked it in your country on copyright grounds." omg

[05:57:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
o_O

[05:57:03.0000] <hsivonen>
same thing for my country, too

[05:57:04.0000] <annevk>
I'm starting to dislike copyright

[05:57:05.0000] <hsivonen>
starting?

[05:57:06.0000] <annevk>
true

US?

[05:58:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
america, at least.

[05:58:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[05:58:06.0000] <Lachy>
/me connects to a vpn there

[05:59:00.0000] <mpilgrim>

[05:59:01.0000] <asmodai>

[05:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
In America, VPN connect you!

[05:59:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
(and disconnects everything else)

[06:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://symptomresearch.nih.gov/index.htm

[06:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
That one goes into quirks mode with html5.enable

[06:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
and looks a bit different

[06:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, right. I've seen that video before

[06:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
but pages like http://symptomresearch.nih.gov/preface/index.htm look *better* in quirks mode

[06:01:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, silly internet meme.  But still stuck in my head.

[06:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though it's probably inappropriate to post "It's over NINE THOUSAAAAAND!" in bug 9001.

[06:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Conclusion? The coders are morons.

[06:02:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
sigh

[06:02:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
some days, it's amazing the internet works at all

[06:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The internet works?

[06:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh.

[06:03:02.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, no, not really

[06:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes Leif didn't post flamebaits like "What kind of theoretical points are these?"

[06:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Everybody else (~0.002% of pages) puts their [...] junk after the system identifier, where it doesn't force quirks mode

[06:06:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
"note, though, that I can count pretty high on two hands" <-- snort

[06:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
so I think the (unsurprising) conclusion is that there's no significant compatibility problem in practice

[06:08:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
looking forward to having "can not use internal subset" escalated to a tracker issue

[06:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like the context is at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2010Feb/

[06:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's strange how people really do want their non-standard syntax to successfully validate against standards

[06:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's sad that there will probably be a tracker issue on this

[06:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Maybe they do government work

[06:40:00.0000] <karlcow>
tim bray created an alternate version of Web Sockets following his reading of the original one. From the article about html5

http://www.tbray.org/drafts/wsock-00

[06:43:00.0000] <mile>
hello

[06:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hi

[06:57:00.0000] <Crash2108>
Will/does  <video> support streaming video?

[06:57:01.0000] <Crash2108>
And what about webcam and microphone access?

[06:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
As far as I'm aware, the spec supports streaming

[06:58:00.0000] <annevk>
webcam/microphone is post-HTML5

[06:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it's up to browser developers to implement whatever streaming protocols are useful

[06:58:02.0000] <Crash2108>
Flash will stick around for that.

[06:59:00.0000] <Crash2108>
What about multicasting?

[07:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
That seems like just a detail of the streaming protocol, that doesn't have any effect at the <video> level

[07:01:00.0000] <Crash2108>
It's in the IPv4-6 spec, but doesn't the application have to support it?

[07:01:01.0000] <Crash2108>
Or is it up to the server and network to support it?

[07:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
It has to be supported everywhere

[07:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
You can't use TCP, so you need some other transport protocol

[07:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
and then you can't use HTTP

[07:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
The network needs to support IP multicast, and the server and client need to support whatever new protocols you put on top of it

[07:04:01.0000] <Crash2108>
That's what I'm saying, shouldn't that be built in to the spec so that servers can relieve some pressure for IPTV?

[07:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
but from HTML's perspective it's just a <video> and a <source> with a non-HTTP URL

[07:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
It should be in some spec (and probably is already in lots), but HTML doesn't seem a relevant place for it

[07:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Crash2108: multicast on the Internet scale hasn't been a success so far with non-HTML solutions that support multicast

[07:05:02.0000] <Crash2108>
So it's being open for interpretation just like the actual video codecs.

[07:06:00.0000] <Crash2108>
Key words: so far.

[07:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
The first step is convincing every ISP in the world to enable IP multicasting :-)

[07:06:02.0000] <Crash2108>
IPv6 has better support and it's waiting to be tapped.

[07:06:03.0000] <Philip`>
(and the second step is probably apologising when their networks collapse)

[07:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
If/when people sort out the problems and get it implemented and deployed, it should work without any changes to HTML

[07:09:00.0000] <Crash2108>
ASsuming the browser supports it.

[07:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[07:10:00.0000] <Crash2108>
So we're back in the 90s in that regard to just hope they all support similar features.

[07:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Crash2108: you'll have better luck convincing browsers to support multicast when some proprietary product has pioneered multicasting and showed it works on the Internet scale

[07:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Crash2108: how do you mean "back"?

[07:11:00.0000] <Crash2108>
I mean by being forced to design for every browser individually instead of just designing for THE browser.

[07:11:01.0000] <annevk>
oh shit

[07:11:02.0000] <annevk>
forgot to review ARIA comments

[07:11:03.0000] <annevk>
too fricking busy :/

[07:11:04.0000] <Crash2108>
You can say shit but not fucking?

[07:12:00.0000] <annevk>
?

[07:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Would you rather support javascript... or HITLER?

[07:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
Crash2108: HTML can't mandate any particular solution because the world does not have any acceptable solutions yet

[07:13:02.0000] <Crash2108>
Godwin's law

[07:13:03.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Well, Hitler did have some nice uniforms...

[07:13:04.0000] <Dashiva>
It always comes down to the uniforms

[07:13:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me is torn between the two

[07:14:00.0000] <Crash2108>
I forget what we're talking about.

[07:14:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm just baffled by the never-ending list of people going "HTML only needs to support documents, javascript is evil and you don't need it anyway"

[07:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
I'm just baffled

[07:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Javascript is an aberration, it'll go away in a few years

[07:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
That attitude is so 2004

[07:19:01.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: http://www.google.com/search?btnG=Google+Search&q=%22javascript+is+%22

[07:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: That just shows we're now closer than ever to the point where it'll go away

[07:20:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me wonders what happened to jgraham in 2004. :p

[07:20:01.0000] <annevk>
#whatwg doh

[07:20:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: True. I guess it probably has gone away already and we just haven't noticed yet

[07:21:00.0000] <karlcow>
jgraham: you forget that it might also have never happened in some universes

[07:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps-cdf-discuss/2004Jun/att-0004/2004jun01.html#topic3

[07:26:00.0000] <karlcow>
I think Bert is advocating for a separation between two layers, and then Javascript is indeed not in his model of thoughts.

[07:26:01.0000] <karlcow>
"In my mind, separating the program from the logic is the most important thing, just as we did for HTML, separating the style from the content."

[07:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And then you have people who think cookies (and localstorage) should instead be markup included in every page

[07:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: what are you reading?

[07:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/15/HTML5#c1266395267.500515

[07:38:00.0000] <karlcow>
I have the feeling that Tim Bray article is doomed to get useless discussions more than constructive comments about writing style of specifications

[07:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wasn't expecting a call for reviving XHTML2, though

[07:41:00.0000] <annevk>
karlcow, most of the more detailed comments (exception of the first) seem pretty good

[07:41:01.0000] <karlcow>
first part of hixie comment is about writing style. On spot

[07:42:00.0000] <annevk>
what he says pretty much matches my experience

[07:42:01.0000] <annevk>
XHR was much more declarative initially

[07:42:02.0000] <annevk>
didn't work out

[07:42:03.0000] <karlcow>
Maciej's one is not about the writing style but facts of the blog posts, which I classify in I know better (then kind of useless)

[07:43:00.0000] <karlcow>
rimantas and gretar not very useful either.

[07:44:00.0000] <karlcow>
Dorian Taylor's one is also off, mostly poetic troll prose.

[07:46:00.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
hello :)

[07:46:01.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
can you recommend any books for html5 that are already out?

[07:47:00.0000] <karlcow>
Liwaaaaa: maybe http://www.google.com/search?btnG=Google+Search&q=html5

[07:48:00.0000] <Liwaaaaa>

[07:50:00.0000] <annevk>
I pre-ordered that last one

[07:50:01.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
my team and I we are developing a online massive multiplayer game. We first thought about flash and we encountered html5 now and we are not familiar with anything html5, so we are trying to get information to compare with technologies

[07:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Neither is very appropriate for an mmorpg, imo, but if you're looking at something that is roughly Flash-capable, you want <canvas>.  We don't yet have a useful 3d context for it, though, so it's probably not useful enough for you yet.

[07:51:01.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
to compare the technologies and find out the (dis)advantages :)

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: The experimental 3D one seems to be getting implemented pretty widely and quickly

[07:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's cool, then.  I really have no clue about it.

[07:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and now is probably a good time to try experimenting with it, to influence the direction of the spec)

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Liwaaaaa: You'll probably find more useful and up-to-date information by reading things on the web, and the spec itself

[07:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
particularly if there's specific areas you're interested in

[07:54:00.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
thank you :)

[07:54:01.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
we are trying to gather the information for now

[07:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
If you want to e.g. do graphical stuff that works in IE then there's not really any alternative to Flash, though

[07:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Silverlight?

[07:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hides

[07:55:02.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
no it shouldn't be 3d or anything fancy... but it should also work in e.g. mobile devices

[07:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, if you want to work on mobile devices that don't support Flash then that narrows the options :-)

[07:56:00.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
also we considered that apple doesn't support flash ;)

[08:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Liwaaaaa: If it's something meant to work on mobile devices too, then it's lower-powered than I had assumed.  In that case, <canvas> is pretty likely to meet your needs.  WebSockets would be perfect as well, but that's not widely-supported yet.

[08:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So I suppose you're stuck with normal long-polling XHR or similar.

[08:13:00.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
sorry what do you mean by XHR?

[08:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
XMLHttpRequest

[08:15:00.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
thanks, yes its supposed to be "real" realtime...

[08:15:01.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
we can live with latencies :)

[08:15:02.0000] <Liwaaaaa>
not supposed to be i mean :P

[08:28:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, doctype thread

[08:46:00.0000] <annevk>
making progress with CSSOM, yay

[08:47:00.0000] <annevk>
guess i can start filling in some more dots tomorrow; it's like a big puzzle

[08:47:01.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: do you mean this ?

[08:47:02.0000] <karlcow>
 <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" 

[08:47:03.0000] <karlcow>
 [<!ATTLIST P myattr CDATA #implied  >]> 

[08:47:04.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[08:48:00.0000] <annevk>
no idea why we're even discussing invalid HTML4

[08:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
It would matter if some pages used invalid HTML4 and broke because of changes in HTML5

[08:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it seems they don't break

[08:52:00.0000] <karlcow>
last time I have seen this discussion, it was about xhtml 1.1 and the missing target attributes

[08:52:01.0000] <karlcow>
some people experimented by by modifying the doctype

[08:52:02.0000] <karlcow>
Jacques Distler went the farther with http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/files/zeldman.html

[08:54:00.0000] <karlcow>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/stuff/html/strict-doctype-target/

[08:55:00.0000] <karlcow>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" [ <!ATTLIST a target CDATA #IMPLIED> ]>

[08:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
The right solution is for HTML to make <a target> conforming

[08:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
which, happily, HTML5 does

[08:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/15/HTML5#c1266424056.47300

[08:58:01.0000] <karlcow>
the interesting thing is that in application/xhtml+xml

[08:59:00.0000] <karlcow>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" [ <!ATTLIST a target CDATA #IMPLIED> ]> 

[08:59:01.0000] <karlcow>
this is working but

[08:59:02.0000] <karlcow>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" [ <!ATTLIST a target CDATA #IMPLIED> ]>

[08:59:03.0000] <karlcow>
is not working at all.

[08:59:04.0000] <karlcow>
XML Parsing Error: syntax error

[09:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why is that interesting?

[09:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's just http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-ExternalID

[09:07:00.0000] <karlcow>
interesting to me. I didn't think systemid was required when pubid was there. constraint on well formedness.

[09:08:00.0000] <karlcow>
reading xml prose

[09:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
karlcow: Required in XML, not required in SGML.

[09:10:01.0000] <karlcow>
yep yep

[09:16:00.0000] <spikku>
Does anyone know details about HTML5 video tag? I'm confused about how it plays flash video without a plugin...

[09:16:01.0000] <wycats>
spikku: the browser has native support for playing videos using supported encodings

[09:17:00.0000] <wycats>
it only works in browsers that have added support for it

[09:45:00.0000] <spikku>
wycats: Thanks that's what I thought.

[09:45:01.0000] <spikku>
:)

[12:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wow.  Check out the shirt on girl + reflection.  What's going on here? http://googlesightseeing.com/maps?tw=914&p=&c=&t=h&hl=en&ll=51.515887,-0.076647&z=16&layer=c&cbll=51.517349,-0.083157&cbp=12,54.33,,2,10.09

[12:12:01.0000] <miketaylr>
oh they have mirrors like that at coney island

[12:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Requires Flash, kthxbai

[12:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: The photo of her itself is overexposed, the reflection of her isn't

[12:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, maybe.

[12:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: (so her skin becomes white because of overexposure)

[12:17:00.0000] <gavin>
that doesn't look like overexposure

[12:17:01.0000] <miketaylr>
was that a pun?

[12:32:00.0000] <Lerc>
not to mention the arm is on the wrong side for a reflection

[12:35:00.0000] <Necrathex>
i can see her necklace still

[12:35:01.0000] <Necrathex>
i'd say simply overexposed

[12:36:00.0000] <Lerc>
a bilateral inversion overexposure 

[12:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
gavin_: it's over-exposure, she has two shirts on

[12:43:00.0000] <Lerc>
Am I seeing it wrong?  The raised arm is on the side facing the camera in both images isn't it?

[12:44:00.0000] <Necrathex>
both arms are

[12:44:01.0000] <Necrathex>
she has her hands together

[12:46:00.0000] <Lerc>
/me whips out screen magnifier.

[12:47:00.0000] <Lerc>
oh righty.  I see that now.

[12:51:00.0000] <Lerc>
anyone what to trade some working retinas for some corrugated ones?

[14:38:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: is it ok to request features to be added to HTML-next on whatwg? I'm adding support for FormData, and i'm adding API for getting a pre-populated FormData from a <form>

[14:38:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: i.e. i'm adding HTMLFormElement.getFormData()

[14:39:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: it'd be "nice" to get that into a spec so that people can bikeshed about the syntax (for a loose definition of "nice" ;) )

[14:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
absolutely

[14:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
my rate of responding to e-mails is a bit slow currently

[14:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
which i'm not happy about

[14:40:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: cool, i'll shoot the list a mail

[14:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i will definitely respond to any mail sent to whatwg in due course, and am happy to add new features especially with vendor interest

[14:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
btw what's the advantage of PING over POST?

[14:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have no idea what advantage it might confer.  Anne just mentioned it yesterday.

[14:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems like POST has exactly the semantics we want

[14:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
sicking: You looked at the mail from the Sidney dude a week or two ago about a similar proposal?

[14:43:01.0000] <rektide>
is it possible for a Worker to create a MessageChannel to a page?

[14:46:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: oh, i don't care about PING vs. POST

[14:46:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: file a bug... you seem to be moving quickly at those

[14:46:02.0000] <wycats>
:P

[14:46:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: i guess you could argue that having a specific http-method that's somewhere inbetween "safe" and "unsafe" is a good idea

[14:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: yeah, that's why i'm not moving quickly at the mails :-)

[14:47:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: so I should stop filing bugs? :P

[14:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: somewhere between? not sure what that would mean

[14:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: no, no, you filing them is separate from my responding to them :-)

[14:48:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: Hmmm... i guess there is a lot that happens server-side with each tracked click. I.e. there is actually money changing hands, not just a counter increasing

[14:49:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: so i guess see my earlier reply; "Hixie: oh, i don't care about PING vs. POST" ;)

[14:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup, it's very clearly a POST from semantics, or a similar unsafe method.  Julian is arguing solely from a UI perspective.

[14:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which seems unwise.

[14:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: fair enough

[14:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think if we don't care if it's PING or POST, we shouldn't bother arguing for PING since nobody seems to actively want that so it wouldn't actually help make progress and certainly wouldn't help get the best possible spec :-)

[14:50:01.0000] <sicking>
sorry, i thought PING was what the spec currently said

[14:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sounds good.  I think I'm the only one who actually mentioned it in-thread.

[14:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh is it? i thought it said POST. maybe i'm out of date.

[14:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks.

[14:51:02.0000] <sicking>
so in order to reduce the number of options people are arguing between i figured i'd back that proposal

[14:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
nah it's POST, with a body consisting of just "PING"

[14:51:04.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: but i could very well be out of date

[14:51:05.0000] <sicking>
ah

[14:51:06.0000] <Hixie>
ok glad we sorted that out :-)

[14:53:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: btw, when you wrote the HTML5 form submission stuff. Did you do a lot of testing for things like calling form.submit() from a "submit" event handler? And calling form.submit() twice in a row? Or submitting while another submission had already started

[14:53:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: our form submission code is *ugly*. Would like to rewrite but I know we need to support a lot of quirks

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: i did a lot of testing. Whether I did _enough_ is a different matter.

[14:54:01.0000] <sicking>
ok

[14:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: but yeah, i did do a ton of testing

[14:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i saw your feedback recently, looked like good stuff.

[14:55:01.0000] <sicking>
cool

[14:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
hopefully will get to it in the next few weeks

[14:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
i really want to get through some of these bugs to get that pile down, then do web sockets

[14:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
then it's back to the e-mail grind, probably wf2 first

[14:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
(wf2=forms)

[14:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe canvas and video, too, there's lots pending on those

[14:57:00.0000] <sicking>
i have a backlog of emails i need to write :(

[14:57:01.0000] <sicking>
such as getting rid of the 'title' argument on pushState

[14:57:02.0000] <sicking>
and modifying <script> parsing

[14:57:03.0000] <sicking>
really behind on that one :(

[14:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you want long enough, you won't have to send the e-mails anymore, either because someone else did or because it's too late :-)

[15:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
As far as I can tell the only reason to advocate PING is that some of the people who think that links making POST requests is bad might be confused by having something that acts like POST but is spelled differently

[15:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Which doesn't seem like a good reason, but does seem like the sort of reason that is attractive in a consensus based process

[15:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, "to confuse the opposition" doesn't seem like a great idea to suggest anything, at least if we're actually trying to make good specs.

[15:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: anyone who thinks that is clearly not familiar with how easy it is to trick users into doing POSTs, even HTTP experts (see e.g. the demos in http://damowmow.com/playground/demos/http/002/)

[15:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, I hate having to deal with a customer who is clearly making a bad decision.  >_<

[15:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Indeed. I think the UI argument is nonsense, not least because it is trivial (and common) to design UIs that don't enforce the distinction

[15:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway, sleep

[15:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
who all implements pushState and such so far?

[15:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me wants to throw some pushState at this ajax effect so it'll actually work with back/forward.

[15:17:00.0000] <sicking>
TabAtkins: firefox nightlies support it

[15:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, I was hoping it had made it to a public build already.  Never mind, then.

[15:18:01.0000] <sicking>
pushState and replaceState

[15:18:02.0000] <sicking>
TabAtkins: our nightlies are public

[15:18:03.0000] <sicking>
TabAtkins: oh, the latest "developer alpha preview" has it

[15:18:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean a build that's been pushed out in an auto-update.

[15:18:05.0000] <sicking>
TabAtkins: our nightlies are in auto-update ;)

[15:18:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
You know what I mean.  >_<

[15:19:00.0000] <sicking>
actually i don't

[15:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
A build that normal people will have.

[15:19:02.0000] <sicking>
oh, like a final release? Don't wait that long to start playing with new features

[15:19:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not playing, I'm attempting to use it on a production site.

[15:20:00.0000] <sicking>
well, you should play with it before then to know that it meets your requirements

[15:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, to be fair, I tend to *use* production sites to play with things.

[15:20:02.0000] <sicking>
we need spec feedback before final shipping

[15:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
k, i'll play with it a bit.  I'll make sure it would actually be usable for my purposes.

[15:21:01.0000] <sicking>
yay! Sweet! Thanks :)

[15:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Fwiw, I'll be trying it out on www.igofigure.com/spinnergy to make the ajaxified navigation actually play nicely with history.

[15:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Where are the nightly builds downloadable from again?

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i'm considering parsing changes in http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8767 -- your input would be very welcome


2010-02-18
[16:00:00.0000] <sicking>
TabAtkins: http://nightly.mozilla.org/

[16:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That makes too much sense to be true.e

[16:00:02.0000] <sicking>
it'll even update you to the new nightly every day

[16:01:00.0000] <sicking>
it's the only thing i use

[16:01:01.0000] <sicking>
the only thing that is sad is that the release of new versions of firefox is much less exciting, since you've been using all the features for months already

[16:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think I'll survive.  ^_^  I have nightlies here on my laptop, but I do most of my dev work on my work computer.

[16:05:00.0000] <karlcow>
sicking: you could download only the 6 months old nightly build as a rule ;)

[16:05:01.0000] <sicking>
heh :)

[16:06:00.0000] <sicking>
maybe we should set up a channel for that

[16:06:01.0000] <karlcow>
or a nightlyRoulette. Download a random nightly build 

[16:37:00.0000] <sicking>
karlcow: hah, *that* would be awesome. And would likely generate a swarm of bugs from confused people

[17:49:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
How do I counter the argument that "IE doesn't support HTML5"?

[17:50:00.0000] <karlcow>
GPHemsley: which part of html5

[17:50:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
there is no qualifier; it's just a blanket statement

[17:51:00.0000] <karlcow>
no browsers support the full stack of *proposed* features of html5 specifications and related

[17:52:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
right, but switching from HTML4 to HTML5 (primarily with the doctype, and then changing the code to validate) doesn't break anything, correct?

[17:55:00.0000] <miketaylr>
nope, unless you start putting in new elements, which won't be styled

[17:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Correct

[17:55:02.0000] <miketaylr>
but a little document.createElement('nav'), etc will fix that

[17:55:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
right

[17:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: ask them if it supports HTML4... IE supports more parts of HTML5 than of HTML4. :-)

[17:56:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: You're in the channel :P

[17:56:01.0000] <karlcow>
<!doctype html> should activate the strict mode in ie8, if I had my last browser class right. (if I'm wrong, it will be quickly rectified)

[17:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: you didn't tell me what discussion it was :-P

[17:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me is in a ton of channels :-P

[17:56:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
:P

[17:58:00.0000] <karlcow>
then support also depends on what's in your pages. 

[21:49:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Is it possible for Bad Things™ to happen when simply switching an HTML4 doctype to HTML5?

[21:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can find people send you angry e-mails for no apparent reason

[21:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
does that count?

[21:50:02.0000] <wycats>
like what?

[21:51:00.0000] <wycats>
this was a fun commit: http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/01d92021e69f54def1ec8103b2b99f907dd88ec4

[21:51:01.0000] <wycats>
look at the comments :)

[21:51:02.0000] <wycats>
"Holy crap!"

[21:52:00.0000] <wycats>
"mm, opinionated!"

[21:52:01.0000] <miketaylr>
omg _so_ opinionated

[21:53:00.0000] <wycats>
we should include a manifest by default ;)

[21:53:01.0000] <miketaylr>
:)

[22:08:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: No, that doesn't count. :)

[22:09:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
wycats: I hope you later reinstated @lang?

[22:10:00.0000] <wycats>
GPHemsley: nope

[22:10:01.0000] <wycats>
should we have?

[22:11:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Yeah, you should have a default language, especially if you already did before. ;)

[22:11:01.0000] <wycats>
this is master: http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/generators/rails/app/templates/public/404.html

[22:11:02.0000] <wycats>
patches accepted :P

[22:11:03.0000] <wycats>
I kid I kid

[22:12:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
I'd recommend it, but it doesn't matter to me... I don't use RoR ;)

[22:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: you can simplify the charset declaration to (using <meta charset="">)

[22:24:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: ya

[22:24:01.0000] <wycats>
that works on old browsers?

[22:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[22:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's why we allowed it

[22:24:04.0000] <wycats>
:-D

[22:24:05.0000] <wycats>
will fix

[22:25:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: what's your opinion about lang?

[22:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
it works because browsers had to support <meta name=http-equiv content=text/html; charset=...> where, if you look closely, you'll see that there are three tatributes

[22:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
and so browsers have to look for charset="" as an ottribute

[22:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
if you know the language, then set it

[22:25:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: lulz

[22:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
also apparently my typing sucks today

[22:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
As opposed to when you try to type gauge? :P

[22:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
gauge

[22:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
woooo!

[22:26:04.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: that's hilarious

[22:26:05.0000] <Hixie>
i typed it right first time!

[22:27:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I love these hax

[22:27:01.0000] <wycats>
like <!DOCTYPE html> turning on standards mode

[22:27:02.0000] <wycats>
in IE

[22:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[22:27:04.0000] <wycats>
I don't know why, but it makes me warm and fuzzy

[22:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum

[22:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Wasn't there some discussion about early use of HTML5 doctype potentially leading to a "IE8 mode" lock in IE9?

[22:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well when google started using it on google.com I kinda gave up trying to stop it

[22:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, I used it myself too. Didn't seem like a winnable fight to begin with.

[22:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The @ping messages are informative, if only on unrelated things. I didn't know HTTP mandated UI.

[22:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
good evening folks

[22:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: hey

[22:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I got a copy of this book last night - http://www.amazon.co.jp/HTML5-API入門-白石-俊平/dp/4822284220

[22:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think it's the first printed book that's exclusively about HTML5 and related APIs

[22:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the author, Shumpei Shiraishi, would like to mail you a copy of it

[22:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
he knows i can't read japanese, right? :-)

[22:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, sure

[22:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder what revision of the spec it was made for

[22:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
just thought it would be nice for you to have

[22:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: if he does want to mail me a copy, please thank him profusely on my behalf... he can mail it to any google office, c/o me, and it'll eventually get to me.

[22:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.google.com/corporate/address.html

[22:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
we were joking that he should just address it, "Hixie, Google, Mountain View, California"

[22:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll pass on the address info to him

[22:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
"Hixie", i don't guarantee wull get to me :-)

[22:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
the rest would :-)

[22:49:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
hai

[22:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
but he's probably better off mailing it to tokyo or something

[22:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
since mailing books internationally can't be cheap

[22:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
especially books about html5, i mean, what is it, 20000 pages? :-)

[22:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
325 pages

[22:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, I'll suggest to him that he get a copy to Takuya Oikawa and I guess either he could get it to you next time he's in Mountain View, or maybe pass it on to Ian Fette to bring back

[22:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
that works too

[22:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
though seriously

[22:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
we have inter-office mail

[22:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[22:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[22:53:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: dunno what rev, but I know there are already a couple places where it's now out of sync with the spec

[22:53:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., it has a <details> example that uses <dt> and <dd>

[22:53:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
but anyway, he knew that going into it

[22:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and the intro of the book of course warns that the spec is still under development and some things are still likely to change 

[22:54:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm sure he'll be fine. He can release updated versions too. I'm thinking more about to what degree the books will stick around and confuse later.

[22:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, true

[22:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe they should be Mission Impossible style self-destruct capability

[22:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[22:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's called "Kindle"

[22:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's called "Kindle"

[22:56:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
oops

[22:56:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's why they picked that name

[22:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me tries to remember which actual book it was that Amazon unilaterally self-destructed from users' kindles last year

[22:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah

[22:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Orwell's 1984

[22:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyone have any idea what i meant in http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8999 ?

[22:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh maybe i meant that i should check if the origin is a tuple

[22:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
and if it's not, fail

[22:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
instead of failing if it's sandboxed

[22:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
that would make sense

[22:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
let's assume that's what i meant

[23:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how many bugs he's filed that later got marked NEEDSINFO before he made the script annotate who filed the bug

[23:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Looks like you wanted to split it up so sandboxing determines origin, and (only) origin determines .cookie

[23:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
preload=autobuffer/playthrough doesn't help non-linear video (e.g. youtube choose-your-own adventure videos), or video where you expect the user to skip ahead for other reasons.

[23:19:00.0000] <annevk>
so XHR basically needs to return a special kind of Document

[23:19:01.0000] <annevk>
why was Document followed by object? seems redundant *shrug*

[23:24:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#resource-metadata-management

[23:24:01.0000] <wycats>
what do you mean by "miscellaneous"?

[23:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
"other"

[23:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
"things that didn't fit elsewhere"

[23:26:00.0000] <wycats>
don't they pretty much all reflect things about the HTTP request?

[23:26:01.0000] <wycats>
headers mostly?

[23:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: Document is an interface

[23:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
wycats: yeah, hence resource metadata management -- managing the metadata of resources

[23:27:01.0000] <annevk>
yay, feedback from dbaron

[23:28:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I don't see how that matters here, but ok

[23:29:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: I guess it's fine :)

[23:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
if whoever filed http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9000 is here, can you tell me what "and so on" refers to?

[23:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I guess it's referring to the attributes that were listed in the HTML 4.01 DTD as being reserved for future use, but which are still undefined and non-conforming

[23:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
and whoever filed the bug thinks they should be listed in that section

[23:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
...HTML4 reserves an attribute "dataformatas" [sic]

[23:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's awesome

[23:47:02.0000] <annevk>
might have been some IE stuff

[23:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's the typo i was referring to

[23:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
<table datapagesize> is reserved in HTML4, too

[23:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe it wasn't a typo. Maybe it really is meant to be DataFormatAs which makes some sense given the allowed values are "plaintext" and "html"

[23:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
oohhhh

[23:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
valid

[23:50:00.0000] <annevk>
agreed that DataFormatas is cooler

[23:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just wonder what possible use it was meant for. It's supposedly reserved on a whole bunch of seemingly unrelated elements

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually they're not reserved if you examine the DTD closely

[23:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
but IE did implement datasrc and datafld, iirc

[23:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: regarding the SVG <font> but: are you also looking at the SVG in table in SVG case heycam found?

[23:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
wasn't that fixed already?

[23:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe

[23:53:02.0000] <Lachy>
looks like http://www.html5reference.com/ has turned into a potentially useful site now. Last time I looked at it, it looked more like a spam site.

[23:53:03.0000] <hsivonen>
my mental snapshot of bug state could be stale

[23:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i seem to recall i fixed the "reset the insertion mode" algorithm a while back

[23:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
to handle that case

[23:53:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok

[23:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
if i'm right, and didn't screw it up, it ended up being way simpler than i expected

[23:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
iirc there was even a comment in the source or something saying "oh yeah i should fix this"

[23:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
or maybe it was in some of my notes

[23:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway i think it's fixed

[23:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
for the </font> and </a> thing unless you object i think i'll do it the way i described in the bug

[23:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I need to think a bit

[23:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[23:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
you have until i get back to that bug :-)

[23:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
probably a few days at least

[23:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
maybe a month or so

[23:56:05.0000] <hsivonen>
so far, the end tag handling hasn't had to dispatch on foreigness

[23:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
on foreigness of the current node you mean?

[23:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see a way around that particular problem

[23:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I meant the mode

[23:57:03.0000] <hsivonen>
currently, the end tag just looks at the secondary mode 

[23:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[23:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
well

[23:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's the bug :-)

[23:58:03.0000] <hsivonen>
so...

[23:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the solution is a bit annoying, because it goes back and forth between being 'in foreign' -specific at step 2

[23:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and using the secondary mode in step 4

[23:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm not hugely fond of the solution

[00:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm very open to a solution that just fails for foreign end tags that don't match the current node, btw

[00:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
wtf? "The xml declaration and indicates that the content is a HTML document. The name parameter of the xml declaration must be html, matching the name of the top element an HTML document." -- http://www.html5reference.com/tags/xml-declaration/

[00:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: dude now my head hurts

[00:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I think what's happened is the author has copied and pasted from the DOCTYPE page to make it, and just done a search and replace. it says basically the same thing here http://www.html5reference.com/tags/doctype-declaration/

[00:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tries to think of cases where step 4 has to walk a lot of stack nodes

[00:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what's the purpose of "but there is no element in scope that has a namespace other than the

[00:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
HTML namespace"

[00:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[00:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I applied Carey Evan's build.py patch and just now got it working.. I now have a working v.nu instance running on my windows VM and everything seems to be working as expected

[00:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: awesome. 

[00:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it's a poor-man's "reset the insertion mode"

[00:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK if I go ahead and commit his patch?

[00:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok

[00:07:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool, thanks

[00:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it's to make <table><svg></table> drop out of foreign content, while leaving <svg><table><svg></table> in foreign content.

[00:07:05.0000] <Hixie>
(that same text is already in the spec)

[00:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[00:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if there are some bad time-complexity properties here with repeated stack walking with deep stacks

[00:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it really does appear to be undefined what URL decomposition attributes return on <a href="http://a[b].example.org/">, looking at HTML5 plus its normative references

[00:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the WEBADDRESSES parsing algorithm doesn't always return values for the components, but HTML5 assumes it does

[00:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/href/draft#parsing-urls vs http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#terminology-0

[00:10:02.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[00:10:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I *think* having the loop start in 'in foreign', go to secondary and loop back is going to suck

[00:11:00.0000] <annevk>
I was just about to reopen that bug and clarify, but something came up inbetween

[00:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I don't have any better ideas to suggest though

[00:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I just did reopen the bug but feel free to add more info

[00:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: because I have the modes as switch-cases and not as function pointers

[00:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: no, the url decomposition attributes in that case all return the empty string, it's well-defined.

[00:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: specifically, this is because of the "Otherwise, the attribute must return the empty string" in the "On getting" paragraph.

[00:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I see

[00:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: (because if it doesn't parse, it can't be an absolute URL, by definition)

[00:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I missed that since it's separate from the definitions

[00:13:03.0000] <annevk>
is that what UAs do?

[00:13:04.0000] <annevk>
guess that works

[00:13:05.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: it's what Safari and Chrome do for the example URL that Julian gave

[00:13:06.0000] <annevk>
wfm then

[00:13:07.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: but not Firefox or Opera, I think because they actually do successfully parse that URL

[00:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: the table is meaningless without the paragraph from which i just quoted :-)

[00:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah

[00:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: definitely open to better ideas

[00:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: not sure what to do though

[00:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: how do you jump to the secondary mode for end tags today?

[00:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the mode is always the secondary mode and 'in foreign' is a separate flag

[00:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[00:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so the end tag handler switches directly on mode

[00:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and at the end checks if it needs to flip 'in foreign' off

[00:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It's interesting how https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214476 gets a lot of dupes

[00:18:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, ok, guess it depends on how we define parsing then

[00:18:01.0000] <annevk>
(and when that gets implemented... I'm guessing that'll take a while)

[00:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how actively is AIR tracking WebKit trunk?

[00:20:00.0000] <fantasai>
annevk: What are the rules and conventions for writing / submitting patches to html5lib?

[00:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
no idea

[00:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
AIR has not fed the vast majority of their changes upstream

[00:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
they have their own perforce repostiory somewhere

[00:20:04.0000] <fantasai>
/me couldn't find anything about How to submit a patch or What a patch must contain before it's accepted

[00:20:05.0000] <annevk>
fantasai, prolly filing a bug

[00:20:06.0000] <fantasai>
ok, done

[00:20:07.0000] <annevk>
I haven't been involved for a while

[00:21:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham can prolly help you out more, or maybe Philip`

btw google/on2: http://on2.com/index.php?id=472&news_id=698

hsivonen: ↑ seems they finally got around to not adjourning the shareholders meeting early..

[00:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yeah. nice.

[00:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is also interested in Google stating what they are up to now

[00:25:00.0000] <fantasai>
jgraham: Can you comment on html5lib bugs 47, 52, and 135 wrt what remains to be done to finish off their patches?

[00:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyone have any suggestions on how to fix http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9014 ?

[00:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
we can't hook it into the parser, since the actual end tag might be missing

[00:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
not to mention what happens if the element is moved around while still on the stack

[00:27:01.0000] <annevk>
if the end tag is missing, should it be instantiated at all?

[00:28:00.0000] <annevk>
isn't that much like <script> without end tag?

[00:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me tests

chrome plays it

[00:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
firefox doesn't even with an end tag...

[00:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
opera plays it

[00:30:01.0000] <annevk>
in theory it could be dangerous or something, no?

[00:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
IE plays it

[00:30:03.0000] <annevk>
with the ddos thing and certain parameters not making it

[00:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose in theory, maybe, but i can't see how in practice

[00:32:00.0000] <annevk>
could do end tag or EOF

[00:32:01.0000] <annevk>
oh well

[00:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
firefox plays it as well (at least, it plays my debug plugin, i couldn't get it to work with flash)

hsivonen: by inspection, can you figure out when <object>s are instantiated in gecko? (i assume there's some parser magic involved)

[00:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do you mean with the old parser?

[00:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
either probably

[00:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
unless you broke plugins

[00:41:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I've done that but I thought I'd fixed it :-)

[00:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: there are two code paths, it seems

[00:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: one for parser-inserted case and one for the rest

[00:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so in the parser-inserted case, this code runs http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/html/content/src/nsHTMLSharedObjectElement.cpp#196

[00:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and per the comment, BindToTree takes care of the other case

[00:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
and this "done adding children" thing fires when?

[00:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
any time you pop it off the stack?

[00:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yeah

[00:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[00:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
fantasai: 47 and 52 require me (or someone else) to look at the sanitizer code again and verify that the patch is correct. 135 doesn't seem to have a patch

[00:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the "have notified" argument depends on whether the parser has returned control out of the parser between the start tag and the end tag

[00:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me goes back to studying http://mxr-test.konigsberg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/intl/chardet/src/nsMetaCharsetObserver.cpp

[00:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
fantasai: Sadly html5lib and the sanitizer in particular have no been top priority recently

[00:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
for me at least

[00:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that's basically an implementation detail, right?

[00:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
something to do with creating frames or something?

[00:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yeah, but I figured I'd mention it just in case you walk through the code

[00:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[00:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan, you make my life hard

[00:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
(specifically in this instance because of http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9014 )

[00:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit makes an effort to do something along those lines

[00:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
everyone seems to

[00:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
we have a finishParsingChildren() method

[00:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
though now I wonder what happens w/ an <object> element created purely through dom calls

[00:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
what stops you from instantiating a plugin when you set an orphan <div>'s innerHTML to something that includes an <object>?

[00:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess the code checks that it's in a document

[00:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
hmm...

[00:59:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it does

[00:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
innerHTML in the spec uses a document

[00:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i need to check for a document with a browsing context

[01:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder if plugins are instantiated sync while scripts are running or not

[01:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah that should work

[01:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
given how much time i'm spending trying to make flash work in the spec, you'd think adobe would be more supportive

[01:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: btw it would be really useful if you could send any review comments you have about the impact on table parsing of that Change Proposal I linked in the next 7 hours or so, so the A11Y TF has them by their telecon time (since they will be discussing it), but if you don't have time today that's fine

[01:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: as much time as Apple has spent trying to make Flash run really well in Safari (and other Mac browsers)?

[01:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: oh. ok. I didn't realize it was so time-sensitive

[01:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: probably less time than that, but, indeed

[01:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: which list should I address my comments to?

[01:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: <public-html-a11y⊙wo>

[01:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ok

[01:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.w3.org/mid/4B7C91AC.4020301⊙ac - i wonder if it's because no-one cares about said xhtml spec

[01:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
so um

[01:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen, othermaciej: about this <object> thing

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen, othermaciej: do browsers also have this magic for XML parsers?

[01:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the only magic we have at the parser level afaik is notifying an element when all its children have been parsed, and I believe we do that in both HTML and XML parsing

[01:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: given how often people complain to me about colour schemes i pick, i'm sure that's it :-)

[01:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well, the other bit of magic being that the element knows if it was created by the parser

[01:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: this is actually the exact same two pieces of magic we use for <script> elements

[01:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
k

[01:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting. in Opera, unknown elements don't uppercase their tagName

[01:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: that has been fixed

[01:13:02.0000] <zcorpan>
though we don't have localName and namespaceURI right yet

[01:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: ok. I have an old build

[01:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: and it keeps telling me that an update was downloaded but not applied

[01:17:00.0000] <annevk>
What is Larry talking about? He revealed his own private emails before: http://masinter.blogspot.com/2010/02/html5-and-w3c-priorities.html

[01:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. IE8 does that too for elements enabled with document.createElement

[01:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: what's Larry talking about where?

[01:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ie also supports /> for such elements

[01:19:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0622.html

[01:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is amused how @othermaciej misspelled @johnallsopp and now various people are tweeting to the nonexistent "johallsop" twitter account

[01:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think he was might have been implying anyone citing the URLs of archive messages or implying anything about their relevance to the matter at hand (e.g. me) had failed to meet the W3C Member confidentiality policy

[01:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: oops

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: a propos of nothing, notice how on my blog post i carefully didn't imply anything about the three e-mails i cited.

[01:23:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, ah I see, but by posting that he violated the rules too o_O

[01:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
https://twitter.com/mattmay/status/9143644762

[01:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
the whole secret list thing is such a joke

[01:24:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, well, "too", not sure who else did

[01:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
w3c should just be public

[01:24:03.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, that's bs

[01:24:04.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, but I can't say why :/

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can understand having a secret list for minor administrative affairs, but for anything to do with objections, charters, etc, it's just so last-decade

[01:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
more than last-decade

[01:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's last-century

[01:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
since we're now in a new decade!

[01:25:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, if it's last century it's also last millennium!

[01:25:05.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: doesn't the email by Larry that you cited appear to refute the twitter that hsivonen just linked?

[01:25:06.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: that reminds me. Are there any objections outstanding at this point, now that adobe has retracted theirs?

[01:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: indeed!

[01:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: yes

[01:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well, let me rephrase

[01:26:03.0000] <othermaciej>
there is at least one claimed Formal Objection outstanding

[01:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
i saw one that sam essentially said was going to be ignored

[01:26:05.0000] <othermaciej>
there are a number of objections outstanding (including Adobe's) which were not raised as Formal Objections

[01:26:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I think the intention is that the list _is_ for administrative affairs. However, the list existing at all allows for other uses, and nobody on the outside will be able to tell.

[01:26:07.0000] <othermaciej>
I just made a list of all objections raised and whether they had been addressed to the satisfaction of the objector

[01:26:08.0000] <Dashiva>
(With regard to html-wg practices)

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: there are hundreds of private lists

[01:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the chairs will go over it tomorrow

[01:27:02.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, true

[01:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: at w3c

[01:27:04.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, though it doesn't explain the reason

[01:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so we're missing the thursday publication window?

[01:27:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: Added a qualifier about html-wg

[01:27:07.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i can redate them for tuesday if so

[01:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: we're going to go over them at 10 AM tomorrow, right after the telecon, can't say definitively whether we are missing the window until we've done that

[01:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[01:28:02.0000] <Dashiva>
The main argument for private lists seems to be that the people paying for them want them private, which is a real-world concern as real as they come

[01:28:03.0000] <othermaciej>
we will post our conclusions publicly

[01:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'll be offline til 1pm, i think, but i'll make sure to get online promptly after my meeting then so i can do any tweaks that pubteam need if we do publish tomorrow

[01:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: yeah the paying thing is another problem...

[01:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But even getting them to admit that is a step forward, IMO

[01:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
our conclusions may include such things as requests to make minor changes to the document, explanations of why we would proceed over objections, perhaps suggested publication dates to put on the drafts if that ends up != Feb 18, and any other relevant information

[01:32:00.0000] <annevk>
i will likely not be around to make any edits

[01:32:01.0000] <annevk>
to html5-diff

[01:32:02.0000] <annevk>
i can also not attend the telcon

[01:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
opera is delaying html5!!!!!111oneone

[01:33:01.0000] <annevk>
well I could, but I want to go skiing on my new skis before I leave Norway

[01:33:02.0000] <annevk>
would make a great headline

[01:33:03.0000] <zcorpan>
s/delaying/blocking/

[01:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh right, sorry

[01:34:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And in a private, secret forum such as IRC

[01:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
opera prefers skiing over publishing html5

[01:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I sent email to the accessibility TF

[01:35:02.0000] <annevk>
i updated XHR to prevent documents from giving or eating cookies

[01:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
thank you sir

[01:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me now wants to eat a cookie

[01:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: is the list of objections at a URL?

[01:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: what does http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9017 mean?

[01:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: all the ones I noted are in this month's archive of public-html, I strongly suspect the chairs will post a list of all of them tomorrow

[01:38:02.0000] <zcorpan>
mmm, good thing my fiancee is a confectioner

[01:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me always has home baked cookies available

[01:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I'm not 100% sure yet if my list is complete and correct

[01:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ok

[01:40:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, your doc says "If the origin of the appropriate Document is not a scheme/host/port tuple"

[01:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
basically the ones I spotted are various comments about status sections, Larry's scope objections, Martin's objections to canvas based on accessibility, and Krzysztof's duplication objections to Microdata

[01:40:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, well a) there might not be a document (see bug on workers) and b) the doc origin and xhr origin can differ I believe

[01:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(plus a few that I think are already resolved)

[01:41:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, so using the origin parameter of the fetch algorithm would be nicer

[01:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh i see

[01:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[01:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[01:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
that means going through and actually setting origin everywhere

[01:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
that would break the Origin header stuff

[01:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok well i'll deal with it later

[01:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[01:43:02.0000] <annevk>
you could let it default to the Doc origin if it was not given

[01:43:03.0000] <annevk>
kk

[01:43:04.0000] <annevk>
for CORS I use the origin arg too btw, same concerns

[01:43:05.0000] <annevk>
(CORS is using fetch)

[01:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the user agent must act as if the element was

[01:46:01.0000] <zcorpan>
+  a <a href=#stack-of-open-elements>stack of open elements</a>.</p>

[01:46:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: is the word "in" missing there?

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: are you about?

[01:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yup

[01:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I suspect Henri's email to public-html-a11y may be stuck in moderation

[01:47:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me checks

[01:47:04.0000] <othermaciej>
do you have the power to unstick, or do you know someone who can?

[01:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
If it turns out it needs moderation, I can

[01:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: it is stuck

[01:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I got a note from a bot)

[01:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, it seems I can't actually unstick it.

[01:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: the subscriber list is auto-generated from the W3C group DB

[01:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and you are not in the DB for the group

[01:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
there's no way to authorize a post by a non-subscriber?

[01:54:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
apparently not

[01:54:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I had some discussion with systems team when this happened before

[01:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Should I just resend to public-html?

[01:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can't remember the reason why it doesn't show up in the moderation interface

[01:55:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yeah, either that or I can add you to the group

[01:55:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: sure, or you can send it to me and I can forward

[01:55:04.0000] <othermaciej>
or what MikeSmith said

[01:55:05.0000] <hsivonen>
It seems simplest if I just resend to public-html

[01:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[01:56:01.0000] <annevk>
annoying set up for a list...

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sent

[01:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll just send an FYI link to the TF list so they don't miss it

[02:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: thanks for the r4783 change (about value of empty attributes implicitly being the empty string)

[02:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
meta charset is weirder than I had thought

[03:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Meh. My stomach aches as if of nervousness, yet I think it's just air in it making it sore. Peh.

[03:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And this isn't the right window.

[03:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: what's with meta charset?

[03:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders why the sublime player doesn't work in opera

[03:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me files https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=546905

[03:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: the interaction with document's script-examinable charset, document.write and location.reload()

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and scripts blocking the parsing of document.written content

[03:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in Gecko (old parser), meta charset in synchronously-parsed document.write doesn't cause renavigation 

[03:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but if an external script has blocked parsing and the document.written meta charset is parsed as an event loop task later, it can cause a charset renavigation

[03:31:01.0000] <zcorpan>
renavigation really sucks

[03:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
to a stream that contains the concatenation of the document.write arguments

[03:31:03.0000] <hsivonen>
it sure does

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I was told Gecko ignored meta charset in document.write, so I implemented that

[03:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but things are a bit more complicated

[03:32:02.0000] <zcorpan>
do you log in the error console when you do renavigation?

[03:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
nope

[03:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
renavigating a document.open()ed stream implicitly scares me

[03:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but changing things scares me too

[03:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>

[05:36:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, but my skiing plans will throw it all of the rails

[05:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: what kind of disruptive skiing plans do you have?

[05:45:00.0000] <annevk>
apparently the plan is to publish later today while I'm trying to improve my downhill skiing skills

[05:46:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe I'll drop by the office after skiing for a few minutes to see if anything needs to be done

/me looks at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3803 and https://trac.annodex.net/wiki/HttpHeaders

[05:47:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder if mozilla plan to support those sans x-

[05:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How can the time value be exact if it only supports integer seconds?

[05:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
it can't

[05:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Configuring_servers_for_Ogg_media indicates mozilla supports float values

[05:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: How can a time value be exact if it is restricted to any non-fractional set?

[05:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"The time value should be exact" seems like a useless requirement, considering

[05:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: If the frame time divides into a power of ten, it will work at some point of increased resolution :)

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there no way to distinguish unknown duration from infinite duration?

[05:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Indeed, but that isn't exact for something 1/3s long

[05:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: in the dom api, NaN means unknown and Infinite means infinite. but a browser can't tell the difference between a streaming resource and a normal resource when the server doesn't support byte range requests, i think

[05:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like a Content-Duration header ought to handle that case

[05:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
so that UAs do have some way to know

[05:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
1*DIGIT | 'Infinity' | 'NaN'

[05:56:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[05:56:02.0000] <zcorpan>
1*DIGIT ["." 1*DIGIT]? | ...

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
You don't need anything explicit for unknown, you can just not send the header

[05:58:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What if the web server is misconfigured to send a content-duration always, and you need to override it?

[05:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
You get a better web server

[05:58:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Opera had a bug like that

[05:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
text-overflow only supported ellipsis, not clip

[05:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
So once it was set, it was impossible to override it to return to the default

[06:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Going by the arguments that using @ping on links is bad because a) link implies safe and b) link tracking is non-safe, doesn't that mean anyone doing link tracking is already violating it?

[06:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
People already doing link tracking are using GET, so it must be safe

[06:46:00.0000] <danbri>
whatwg wiki seems super-slow today, some problem with it?

[06:46:01.0000] <danbri>
(who hosts it btw?)

[06:46:02.0000] <gsnedders>
danbri: hixie

[06:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
danbri: It's a Dreamhost dedicated server, AFAIK

[06:47:01.0000] <danbri>
oh, dreamhost ... my commiserations

[06:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
The dedicated servers are fine, from what I've been told

[06:47:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It's only if your on the shared servers that Dreamhost is diabolical

[06:47:04.0000] <Philip`>
Apparently not, given the performance of the site :-p

[06:47:05.0000] <gsnedders>
(in general; there seem to be a few that are fine)

[06:48:00.0000] <paul_irish>
gsnedders: i have the inverse view, actually. hate the VPS's and love the Shared, which they try so very hard to move you off of

[06:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
although probably any dedicated server would have the same problems

[06:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has a VPS with screen, irssi, and Apache serving thereshouldbenored.com on it

[06:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I need to move gsnedders.com on to it, but I haven't got round to that

[06:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(but not on Dreamhost, either)

[06:49:02.0000] <danbri>
i moved most of my stuff onto ec2 but didn't finish completely the dreamhost exodus yet :(

[06:50:00.0000] <danbri>
ec2 is expensive but likeable

[06:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
EC2 doesn't seem like good value if you want a constant amount of server power

[06:51:00.0000] <danbri>
i'd like to record rel="meta" in the whatwg wiki, since it has been used in html to link to foaf files for years ... would that be ok?

[06:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though it's good for flexibility)

[06:51:02.0000] <danbri>
the smallprint in wiki says either go thru Microformats process or be in a w3c cr or REC, ... which it is via http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-rdfa-syntax-20081014/#relValues

[06:51:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me has an EC2 server that he runs for approximately one hour per week

[06:51:04.0000] <danbri>
but rather than pull in all those values it's really just meta i care about, to document existing practice 

[06:51:05.0000] <hsivonen>
gandi.net provides Xen VMs at a competitive price

[06:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
they are subject to French law though

[06:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me has been happy with gandi.net for irssi and web hosting

[06:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
dunno how big a problem it is in practice if you host a public wiki in France and someone posts Nazi stuff on the wiki

[06:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.gandibar.net/post/2010/01/05/An-active-new-year - "We are surely going to open more data centers, notably in the United States, which is the world's largest market for this technology (cloud infrastructure), and the UK."

[06:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
danbri: You can always put rel=meta there as "Proposal", regardless of whether there's a spec

[06:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is probably a good first step

[06:57:02.0000] <danbri>
i'll do that

[06:58:00.0000] <danbri>
i don't have the energy for one of those giant blahblah rdfa blahblah microdata threads that arise, so i'm a bit wary of putting a foot in the crossover zone

[06:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
I wouldn't personally consider that #relValues thing to be a definition of the feature

[06:58:02.0000] <danbri>
but i think it needs documenting and has been used in good faith over the years

[06:58:03.0000] <mhausenblas>
ahm, what is the status of http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/RelExtensions anyway - will this be taken up or is this for documentation only?

[06:58:04.0000] <Philip`>
since "Refers to a resource that provides metadata, for instance in RDF." is really quite vague

[06:59:00.0000] <danbri>
the concept of metadata is inherently vague

[06:59:01.0000] <danbri>
but people still go to conferences about it ;)

[07:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
It could be less vague by saying what kind of data format consumers are likely to expect, and how it's meant to be related to the linking page, or something, I guess

[07:01:00.0000] <danbri>
ah i remember now, http://wiki.foaf-project.org/w/Autodiscovery ... tantek dug out some old history

[07:02:00.0000] <danbri>
i won't add it now, but will make a tidier doc to link to

[07:02:01.0000] <danbri>
/me makes notes

[07:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
If I look for <link rel=media type=?> then I see

[07:02:03.0000] <Philip`>
   3306 application/rdf+xml

[07:02:04.0000] <Philip`>
     99 application/rdf xml

[07:02:05.0000] <Philip`>
     18 application/xbel+xml

[07:02:06.0000] <Philip`>
     13 application/rss+xml

[07:02:07.0000] <Philip`>
      2 application/apml+xml

[07:02:08.0000] <Philip`>
      1 application/xml

[07:02:09.0000] <Philip`>
So it looks quite like it's really RDF

[07:03:00.0000] <danbri>
yes

[07:03:01.0000] <mhausenblas>
/me adds a pointer from http://wiki.foaf-project.org/w/Autodiscovery to  http://esw.w3.org/topic/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData/AutoDiscovery

[07:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
except for a small number of exceptions and larger number of typos

[07:03:03.0000] <danbri>
from that foaf wiki page, "It makes a (previously unarticulated) assumption: information about the author of a document can also be considered metadata about the document itself. So long as the RDF/XML describes some relationship between Person and Document, it should be true that everything we learn about the Person also adds to our indirect knowledge of the document."

[07:04:00.0000] <danbri>
in http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#transport "The recommended relation type for this purpose is REL="meta""

[07:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
mhausenblas: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/27

[07:05:01.0000] <mhausenblas>
thanks Philip` 

[07:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
mhausenblas: I think the idea in the related discussions was to switch to http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-link-header-07#section-6.2 perhaps

[07:07:00.0000] <mhausenblas>
+1

[07:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I don't remember if anything was concluded yet

[07:07:02.0000] <mhausenblas>
can you check back with someone in charge, Philip`, please?

[07:07:03.0000] <mhausenblas>
/me would be very interested 

[07:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think anybody is in charge here :-)

[07:09:00.0000] <mhausenblas>
hehe, Philip`, very funny :P

[07:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Besides, nobody knows the trouble I've seen.

[07:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
So being in charge wouldn't help

[07:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me typed that, then forgot how he was going to make it a relevant and witty comment

[07:09:04.0000] <Philip`>
mhausenblas: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/1006.html

[07:09:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me fails at humour

[07:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
mhausenblas: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0225.html

[07:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think those are the most relevant posts

[07:10:02.0000] <mhausenblas>
thanks

[07:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
danbri: I guess adding things to the RelExtensions page isn't incredibly useful now, since it seems it'll be obsoleted

[07:14:00.0000] <danbri>
it will?

[07:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[07:14:02.0000] <danbri>
ah, the rollercoaster ride that is standards

[07:14:03.0000] <Philip`>
See previous dozen lines :-)

[07:14:04.0000] <danbri>
/me clickin'

[07:14:05.0000] <Philip`>
about switching to a non-HTML-specific rel registry

[07:16:00.0000] <danbri>
seems a good idea to me

[07:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
.me wonders if anybody here done much with Hadoop

[07:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it looks pretty interesting

[07:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you have a few thousand nodes to work with :)

[07:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I got my spam botnet

[07:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I could always repurpose that for other things

[08:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
So if you have <img src=""> its complete attribute should be false per spec, right?

[08:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
What about <img> (no src attribute)

[08:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: I use Opera dragonfly, I suppose other browsers' inspection tools are similar

[08:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: 

[08:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[08:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
though I think the UI in Web Inspector is maybe better than most

[08:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe it's just because I've just become most used to it

[08:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: I'm not sure what Norm means by "complex CSS interactions"

[08:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I assume which styles override which, and which apply at all

[08:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[08:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: so I would think that anything that showed the computed style and also indicated where the styles were built from (external stylesheets, embedded ones, inline styles, UA stylesheet) would make that doable

[08:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And also useful to show which styles might have applied, but were overridden by other styles

[08:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: yeah

[08:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Your JS is broken :(

[08:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: "Running a script" isn't clickable. Nothing happens. No list of instances.

[08:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Are there any instances?

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Clicking on http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/scripting-1.html#running-a-script works for me

[08:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
and shows one reference

[08:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
in Opera 10.10

[08:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if the next versions will be 10.11 and 10.100

[08:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wasn't using the multipage version

[08:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
WFM in multipage

[08:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe your browser hasn't finished loading the single-page one yet

[08:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It has

[08:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Reproduces in 10.10, Chromium god-knows-what-version-they're-on-now-on

[08:57:00.0000] <drclue>
With the On2 thing done , any word on the plan for VP8 and such?

[08:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
None yet

[08:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The merger isn't quite done yet, it was just approved)

[08:58:02.0000] <drclue>
I'll be happy to see this thing done , but patient enough to see it done well

[09:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Has Google ever explicitly hinted at what they want to do with it?

[09:01:00.0000] <drclue>
AFAIK Google has been pretty mum , but I like anyone else can conjecture that in order to be of value , they are going to have to release it somehow

[09:02:00.0000] <drclue>
I know he Mozilla folks are waiting for the cake to go ding too

[09:03:00.0000] <drclue>
Rupert Murdoch and M$ can't be too happy

[09:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, http://www.on2.com/docs/on2-google-merger-faq.pdf says interesting things

[09:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
"based on prior discussions, we assume that if the merger is not consummated Google may undertake to build or acquire its own codec that would compete with On2 rather than pursue a significant license or other material relationship with On2."

[09:04:02.0000] <drclue>
Of course Adobe is probably getting the welcome wagon from beta-max 

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Google has informed us, and has asked that we tell our customers and partners, that it will continue to make VP8 available after the merger is consummated."

[09:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also "As previously disclosed, On2 has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications." so it sounds like On2 is valuable for its IP, not for its employees

[09:05:02.0000] <drclue>
That's a non-announcement announcement

[09:06:00.0000] <drclue>
The VP8 thing I mean

[09:07:00.0000] <drclue>
Google has long ago said they have a home for the engineers

[09:10:00.0000] <drclue>
Google will need to satisfy the content vendors with a DRM wrapper, and probably need to figure a way to keep the OGG hood ornament or otherwise get the recognition going. I'm sure they have been working on all this since last year. I'm still like a kid waiting for the opening of christmas gifts

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why DRM? Lots of people seem happy with H.264 which doesn't have any

[09:12:00.0000] <drclue>
Well, I think there is a larger picture to CODEC life and while I personally dislike DRM , displacing H.264 will be easier with a DRM option that I hope nobody uses

[09:14:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Like EPUB, which Apple's now using for its bookstore with DRM.

[09:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Would being better quality than H.264, and free from patent licensing requirements, and supported by the top video web site and one of the top few browsers, not be sufficient to displace it in this context?

[09:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If Google say no-DRM or it's not on YouTube, that may have an effect.

[09:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anybody know if there's any existing hardware support for VP8 (or VP6 or 7) on mobile-device chipsets?

[09:17:00.0000] <drclue>
Being 40% better than h.264 and un-encumbered are all good things, but I'm sorta curious how this will play out when Rupert has to take of the latex of the MPEG-LA patent pool members 

[09:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Rupert?

[09:17:02.0000] <drclue>
Yes Rupert is always hiding in the corners

[09:19:00.0000] <drclue>
[MikeSmith] I noticed on On2's site that they do have interactions in the mobile market , but actually having the CODEC embedded widely is something that having Google's stamp on it will make occur

[09:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: http://www.on2.com/index.php?id=439&news_id=641 - "On2 has worked closely with ARM to ensure suitability for porting to current and future ARM single and multi-core processors in mobile devices."

[09:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
makes it sound like they're focused on improving software support, rather than expecting hardware support

[09:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm

[09:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: http://www.mckinnonsc.vic.edu.au/la/it/rupert/rupert.gif

[09:20:02.0000] <drclue>
Well, On2 had no market clout like h.264 , but Google changes that

[09:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
the "It's so good it doesn't need hardware support" pitch

[09:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I was presuming that Rupert wasn't the intended one

[09:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which I think falls into the "Let's believe that when we see it" category

[09:21:02.0000] <drclue>
[Phillip] That Ruppert image needs some fangs and some simpsons burns features

[09:21:03.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Do they make that pitch explicitly?

[09:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
I interpreted it as meaning "We're not going to mention that we're not going to have widespread hardware support, because that's obvious and not something to dwell on, so we're making the best of the situation by optimising for mobile CPUs"

[09:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
stated in a way that focuses on the positive parts but without lying about it

[09:24:00.0000] <drclue>
I don't think they have made the  we so good we don't need hardware pitch , but I think that it will happen as a natural part of evolution 

[09:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I meant the "It's so good it doesn't need hardware support"  thing is just a general response that's made any time the question about hardware support is asked about something that doesn't have hardware support

[09:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I much hope that it is usable on average mobile devices without hardware support

[09:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it will certainly make things easier

[09:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how much specialised hardware support actually helps H.264, compared to general purpose CPUs with decent SIMD instruction sets

[09:30:01.0000] <drclue>
Well , considering that OGG is basically  VP3 and Flash (.flv) is basically VP6 , and that H.264 is weaker than VP8 , chances are pretty good that it would work fine in mobiles

[09:32:00.0000] <drclue>
Anyways , I gotta jet folks , got to get out of my bus and hook up the garbage trailer for a dump run. I think I have room for Adobe in there still :)

[09:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, my impression is that the specialized hardware is cheaper and/or uses less power than a good enough CPU.

[09:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you already have a good enough CPU, how significant is the difference in power?

[09:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me assumes people will have plenty of other reasons for getting CPUs that are fast enough for software video decoding

[09:45:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Is the behavior of the enter key in form inputs standardized? I'm not finding it.

[09:46:00.0000] <drclue>
A few more moments I have while I wait for the truck to get here.  Anytime one has to emulate a procedure that could have been implemented in hardware , there is going to be some overhead, but a lot depends on the usage pattern. We are quickly heading towards new usage patterns that will be making more use of video but at present the battery life trade off is minimal

[09:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Sidnicious: No

[09:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Sidnicious: That's UA behaviour, nothing that should be spec'd, as it has no effect on interoperability

[09:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, sure it does.  Authors want to know what will happen when users hit enter.

[09:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've seen crazy stuff like display:none submit buttons to try to get browsers to submit forms when the user hits enter.

[09:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what happens on devices where you have no enter button

[09:49:01.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: aboot/

[09:49:02.0000] <wycats>
?

[09:49:03.0000] <wycats>
AryehGregor: sweet

[09:49:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
What happens to onclick events if you have no mouse?  :)

[09:49:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses Hixie is still asleep

[09:50:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
gsnedders: Hurm. I'm not sure that I totally agree. Right now, testing in WebKit at least, pressing enter when an input is focused submits the form by activating the next input type submit in the document, including its value. button elements with type submit are skipped.

[09:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't see why this shouldn't be specced, personally.

[09:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is clearly user-/author-visible behavior that affects functionality.

[09:51:02.0000] <wycats>
I think we should explicitly mention at data-* that it's supported by legacy browsers

[09:52:00.0000] <drclue>
I have always wished that there was an attribute on forms for specifying field advance keys

[09:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: onclick isn't for clicks, it's for activation

[09:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
as far as I'm aware

[09:52:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's my point.

[09:52:04.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[09:52:05.0000] <Philip`>
I missed gsnedders question

[09:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I didn't realise yours was rhetorical

[09:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
s//'/

[09:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
wycats: Almost all of data-* isn't supported by legacy browsers

[09:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
(i.e. the element.dataset API)

[09:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it doesn't seem useful to promote its use now

[09:54:02.0000] <wycats>
wrong ;)

[09:54:03.0000] <wycats>
Rails added support for UJS

[09:54:04.0000] <wycats>
and we use data-*

[09:54:05.0000] <wycats>
and people constantly ask "will it work in IE6"

[09:54:06.0000] <Philip`>
If people are going to use custom attributes anyway, they'll know that custom attributes work, so they'll know that data-* works in exactly the same way

[09:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
What do they mean by "work"?

[09:55:01.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: exactly

[09:55:02.0000] <drclue>
Shovels dirt on IE6's grave and hucks a loogy

[09:55:03.0000] <wycats>
people are just burned by IE6

[09:55:04.0000] <wycats>
and they're like "omg HTML5... that won't work for a million years"

[09:55:05.0000] <wycats>
they're scared we're doing something bad

[09:55:06.0000] <wycats>
:P

[09:56:00.0000] <drclue>
The HTML5 won't work for a million years thing of late seems to come mostly from the Adobe propaganda machine. 

[09:56:01.0000] <wycats>
drclue: nah

[09:56:02.0000] <wycats>
people are just burned

[09:57:00.0000] <drclue>
I for one will cry not , when I kick IE6 off my Ubuntu desktop. Always a lot of extra work to keep it in the audiance

[09:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
wycats: Seems like it'd be easy for you to say that the extra markup won't affect anything at all, and scripts that want to use it will work fine as long as they use getAttribute instead of dataset

[09:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
and that's more likely to answer their question than a statement in the HTML spec which nobody reads

[09:59:00.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: I say it all the time

[09:59:01.0000] <wycats>
just saying it's a common question

[09:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
Do those people say they've read the HTML5 spec?

[10:01:00.0000] <drclue>
I think the really nice thing about HTML5 is that what it brings to the table will put web experiences so far ahead of where they are that IE will either have to fish or cut bait becoming to web browsing what their paint program is to desktop publishing

[10:02:00.0000] <wycats>
"does anybody know who was responsible for putting rails3 on HTML5? When was the decision made?"

[10:02:01.0000] <wycats>
we also switched to the HTML5 doctype

[10:02:02.0000] <wycats>
lulz

[10:02:03.0000] <paul_irish>
hahah

[10:02:04.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: I would be able to link to it

[10:02:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: sorry. I missed your question about object in XML. yes, it uses the same doneaddingchildren call.

[10:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
wycats: Seems like it'd be better to link to some kind of wiki page that can describe the current implementation status

[10:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
since anything the spec said would be quickly obsolete

[10:04:00.0000] <paul_irish>
hsivonen: you really need to subset the fonts you're using with @font-face

[10:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which I expect is why it currently says approximately nothing at all about browser support for any feature)

[10:04:02.0000] <paul_irish>
like really bad. :)

[10:04:03.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: in this case, the choice was made in order to have support with older browsers

[10:04:04.0000] <wycats>
but sure

[10:04:05.0000] <wycats>
that would be fine

[10:04:06.0000] <Philip`>
wycats: Well, the implementation status in what are currently considered older browsers :-)

[10:04:07.0000] <hsivonen>
paul_irish: work over the atlsntic and back in firefox. webkit needs a fix

[10:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
works, even

[10:05:01.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: sure :)

[10:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Atlantic

[10:05:03.0000] <paul_irish>
hsivonen: you think webkit shouldnt do the invis-text?  most designers implementing @font-face tend to disagree, fwiw.

[10:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
paul_irish: I think the webkit behavior is bad

[10:06:01.0000] <paul_irish>
i think the 'right' solution is bandwidth dependent.

[10:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
I think it should default to a standard font while it's downloading, and then automatically morph each glyph into its new shape over a second or two once it's downloaded

[10:06:03.0000] <paul_irish>
but regardless you shouldnt have 2MB of fonts required to download every time i want to view your 40k page :)

[10:07:00.0000] <paul_irish>
Philip`: yah!! transition: glyph-morph 4s ease-in-bounce;

[10:07:01.0000] <wycats>
paul_irish: it's great for mobile!

[10:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Use transitions for whole reflows! What could be better!

[10:07:03.0000] <wycats>
paul_irish: just use the cache manifest :P

[10:08:00.0000] <wycats>
gsnedders: AMAZING

[10:23:00.0000] <drclue>
While I have some misgivings about some of the HTML5 spec (did not make a list) , overall I like it, and look forward to the hours I'll spend with it

[10:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Feedback on misgivings may be appreciated :-)

[10:27:00.0000] <wycats>
drclue: what specifically?

[10:29:00.0000] <drclue>
One of these moments I'll pull the spec back in front of me and put the lead in my pencil. It just seemed that some of the spec goes off in an odd direction. I would rather see the spec go forward as it is than to keep it bottled up.  My opinions on the spec were formed during an evenings read and I really did not internalize it. It seemed to try and please so many people that it sorta went over the edges of what I figure the boundries of

[10:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, irony

[10:29:02.0000] <Dashiva>
>it sorta went over the edges of what I figure the boundries of [cut off]

[10:30:00.0000] <wycats>
luuuuulz

[10:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
Pencil?

[10:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
I hope you didn't print out the spec :-p

[10:31:00.0000] <drclue>
There are separation points between the various standards that give each it's realm and certain separations of function , data and presentation that form the minor misgivings , but like I said as a whole I like it and think it should go forward

[10:32:00.0000] <drclue>
Anyways , the ruck is here the trailer hooked up so I gotta jet

[10:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That sounds like a mixed metaphor.  Or, perhaps, a mixed half-metaphor.

[10:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe the truck has a jet pack

[10:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to stop trying to understand Dijkstra's algorithm and go home

[10:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dijkstra's algorithm is fun

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
You just add into your set whatever vertex is closest to your current set, and then repeat until finished - it's not that complicated really :-)

[10:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So if I know the distance of every node from the initial, and I ahve a specific destination, how do I get the shortest path from it?

[10:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess I just follow the path of the shortest distance

[10:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
You need to know which node from each node gives the shortest distance, though

[10:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Right?

[10:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me should just steal someone at work tomorrow with a CS degree who thinks they understand it?

[10:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
Every time you add a new node into the set, or reduce its cost, you store a link to its predecessor node

[10:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[10:54:03.0000] <Philip`>
and when you reach the destination you trace backwards over those links

[10:54:04.0000] <gsnedders>
That's what I mean

[10:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
At the first time you reach the destination?

[11:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes, I think

[11:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Is that right?

[11:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
You only ever 'reach' a node when it's the closest unvisited node to your current visited nodes

[11:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
so when you first reach the destination, all other unvisited nodes must be further away

[11:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
so a path through them cannot be better

[11:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Indeed

[11:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
That's what I thought

[11:02:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Yay

[11:32:00.0000] <franksalim>
who knows the latest about ByteArray in ECMAScript?

[11:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Do you understand the A* algorithm?

[11:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dijkstra's is just A* with the heuristic always returning 0.

[11:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Which, since 0 will always underestimate the actual distance, is guaranteed to find a shortest path, per normal A* rules.)

[11:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some Wikipedia article like "Software bloat" used to have a screenshot of Microsoft Word with all menus enabled, so there was like twenty pixels to actually write in.

[11:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can't find it now.  I want that picture.  :(

[11:55:00.0000] <miketaylr>
AryehGregor: somewhat related, http://blogs.law.emory.edu/elsit/files/2009/02/iemess211.jpg

[11:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
franksalim: http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Binary

[11:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
(if you've not already seen it)

[12:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: I think trying to understand algorithm X by first understanding algorithm Y which is more complex than X and has X as a special case, does not seem like the easiest approach :-)

[12:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: For some reason I found A* to be really simple and intuitive, so it was actually easier for me to understand than Dijkstra's.

[12:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Plus, it parallel's the joke:

[12:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
"A physicist and a mathematician were at a physics conference.  The physicist turned to the mathematician and said 'Man, I just can't follow all this talk about 4-dimensional stuff.'.  The mathematician replied 'Ah, it's quite easy!  First imagine an n-dimensional space, then just set n to 4!'"

[12:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, dammit, extraneous apostrophe in the line before.

[12:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
>_<

[12:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me usually encounters A* in the context of 2D tile grids, and Dijkstra in the context of matrices over abstract algebras, so they feel like very different things even though they're not

[13:08:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
I was just most of the way through writing to the list when I realized that that form submission issue I was asking about is already in the spec <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#implicit-submission> :)

[13:10:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
I'm a bit miffed that there's no way to specify a default button, though.

[13:12:00.0000] <franksalim>
MikeSmithX, thanks. I had seen that page. I didn't realize that was now the most active discussion on the topic

[13:18:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Actually, other than backwards compat, is there a reason there should be a default button at all?

[13:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sidnicious: Is there a reason there *shouldn't* be a default button?  I use the fact that forms will submit with their default button all the time when I'm cruising the web.

[13:29:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
TabAtkins: Submit, yes, use a default button, no. Especially if default means first-in-tree-order, not the-one-that-the-developer-decides-is-default.

[13:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And if the developer doesn't know how to set a default/doesn't know you can/doesn't care/doesn't exist anymore?

[13:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I see the appeal of being *able* to specify a default button, but you shouldn't *rely* on such a specification when we already have a perfectly serviceable default behavior.

[13:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
Authors will be less surprised if everyone submits the form via the button - it stops them forgetting about the case where the user hits enter instead of clicking

[13:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and so e.g. it works as expected if they have <input type=submit disable> in the form)

[13:31:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
I like the behavior of forms without submit buttons: just submit the darn thing without pretending that a button was clicked.

[13:32:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
The current behavior just takes away information, makes it impossible to tell the difference without nasty JavaScript hacks.

[13:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What difference?  Between the user hitting Enter, and them clicking the first-submit-input-in-tree-order?

[13:35:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
Correct.

[13:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Why do you care about that difference?  (I understand caring about *which* submit button was pressed in javascript, which you've brought up before.)

[13:38:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Google has the "Google Search" button on the left, and the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the right of their search page, but what if the designer had wanted them the other way around?

[13:39:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
The Mac OS traditionally has the default button in a form on the right, with the alternate buttons filling in to the left.

[13:39:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
Linux, too.

[13:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
default button will likely be in a future version

[13:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
baby steps!

[13:42:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Heh, all right. As long as you consider not assuming a default button when it isn't specified.

[13:45:00.0000] <beowulf>
evening

[13:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sidnicious: I don't understand your objections.  Again, why shouldn't you assume a default button when it's not specified explicitly?

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sidnicious: Seems unlikely the current behaviour could change, because it'd break compatibility

[13:51:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
I know.

[13:56:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
TabAtkins: I just don't think it's author-friendly behavior. Being handed the value of a button that wasn't clicked is not intuitive.

[13:57:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
I can't find any benefit to that behavior.

[13:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Really?  I rely on submit buttons to signal to scripts that they're receiving the result of a form submission, not a normal page navigation.

[13:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
At the moment, if I have multiple submits I just make sure that the best default one comes first, though I would appreciate being able to specify the default explicitly.

[13:59:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, oh please do write HTTP5

[13:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Aren't we very nearly just writing Internet5 then?

[13:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TCP5!

[13:59:03.0000] <Sidnicious>
TabAtkins: Really? IE 6 and 7 don't submit a default button.

[14:00:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
So if you're relying on that...

[14:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
!_! Really?  In that case, I've got some potentially broken forms.

[14:00:02.0000] <Sidnicious>
http://dev.deeptechinc.com/sidney/share/submit_button_roulette.html

[14:00:03.0000] <Sidnicious>
(test page I've been using to test different browsers' current behavior)

[14:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i was reading about TCP recently... apparently the spec for TCP is pretty far from actual implementations too, much like HTTP and HTML4 are

[14:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
>_<

[14:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so maybe we do need a TCP5!

[14:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
not my expertise though

[14:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
so i ain't doing it

[14:01:05.0000] <Sidnicious>
TabAtkins: Actually, wait, that was a different behavior.

[14:02:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
No versions of IE submit a default button :)

[14:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: or we could just move to SCTP

[14:02:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(though I don't actually know if SCTP reflects reality)

[14:02:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
If no versions of IE do that, then why is it specced, precisely?

[14:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: SCTP isn't backwards compatible, is it?

[14:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: fair enough, it would be an XHTML2 type solution

[14:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And... yup, no version of IE sends a submit button if you hit Enter.

[14:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, um, Hixie, how was that the behavior that made it into html5?

[14:04:00.0000] <Necrathex>
what happens with just <button>s and no <input type="submit"> ?

[14:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: hm?

[14:04:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
IE doesn't submit a default submit button if you submit a form with Enter.  The spec says to submit the first submit button you find in tree order.

[14:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes?

[14:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, I'm wondering how that behavior got specced?  Did everyone else submit the default submit input or something?

[14:06:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Necrathex: Same thing in IE8. 6 and 7 send the name and content (not value) of <button>s and <button type=button>s all the time, treat <button type=submit>s like <input type=submit> as far as I can tell.

[14:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: i disagree with the first statement

[14:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: <!DOCTYPE html>...<form><input><input type=submit></form>

[14:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
focus the input

[14:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
hit enter

[14:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
the form submits

[14:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes it does.  But if you put a name on the submit, it doesn't show up in the submitted data.

[14:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh, i see

[14:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
that was so that disabling the first button stopped submission

[14:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Was there any compat testing to make sure that pages don't depend on nothing being submitted there?

[14:09:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I happen to have many scripts which *do* depend on the default input getting included in the submitted data, so this is good for me, but still...)

[14:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
opera and firefox do what the spec says, so i assume so

[14:12:00.0000] <Necrathex>
Sidnicious: i don't see the name of any button or submit when i press enter in IE with your test page

[14:12:01.0000] <Necrathex>
only appears when i click it

[14:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Necrathex: That's the expected behavior, yes.

[14:17:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, whether or not the trickery is justified, the proposal is for a pseudo-element, not pseudo-class

[14:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Yes?  That's what's appropriate here, after all.

[14:19:00.0000] <annevk>
I think :placeholder::value or some such would make more sense

[14:19:01.0000] <annevk>
it's the same box

[14:19:02.0000] <annevk>
after all

[14:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: I suppose if you think of the input itself being in a placeholder state, that makes sense.  Most of us are thinking of the placeholder itself being an element *within* the input.

[14:24:00.0000] <annevk>
"most of us", really?

[14:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Apparently.

[14:24:02.0000] <annevk>
adele from webkit disliked changing it to a pseudo-element

[14:24:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Going by the talk on the list.)

[14:24:04.0000] <annevk>
most people on the web when Apple first announced this feature didn't say it should've been a pseudo-element...

[14:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think most people on the web don't understand the difference between pseudoclasses and pseudoelements.  ^_^

[14:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
On the other hand... the ::value pseudoelem is from the UI Module, right?

[14:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It might indeed be nice to just lean on that, and allow full styling of the input based on whether or not it's in the placeholder state.

[14:27:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
So, silly question to Hixie et. al... I like the versionless doctype, but what do you plan to do when, some day, you want to make a backwards-incompatible change to the spec?

[14:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sidnicious: Either *don't* make a backwards-incompatible change, or fully break compat and make a new language.

[14:27:02.0000] <Sidnicious>
Don't make a backwards-incompatible change *ever*?

[14:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ideally, yes.  In practice, don't make backwards-incompatible changes that would affect enough pages to be a problem for implementors.

[14:28:01.0000] <annevk>
in practice we can make certain changes

[14:28:02.0000] <annevk>
HTML is pretty flexible

[14:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
Sidnicious: we can't make changes that are backwards-incompatible with deployed content anyway

[14:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
Sidnicious: (and we don't need to worry about backwards-incompatible changes that don't break any deployed content, so we just make them)

[14:34:00.0000] <annevk>
time to gome; nn

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
oops, i just repeated exactly what sicking said, but in less eloquent terms

[14:54:01.0000] <Traveler1>
Hello.

[14:54:02.0000] <Traveler1>
Do you guys recommend to add a header tag around the hgroup?

[14:55:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: no worries, it happens all the time ;)

[14:55:01.0000] <sicking>
just kidding

[14:55:02.0000] <Traveler1>
<hgroup> <h1>title</h1> <h2>subtitle</h2> </hgroup>

[14:55:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: where at?

[14:55:04.0000] <Traveler1>
Should I add an extra header tag?

[14:55:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you don't need it, don't add it.

[14:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Most <hgroup>s aren't part of a <header>

[14:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
.

[14:56:02.0000] <Traveler1>
Hm

[14:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, <header> isn't needed most of the time.  It's just for when you are grouping a bunch of stuff into a "header".

[14:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Generally speaking, don't use extra tags unless you have some particular reason.  It's largely pointless.

[14:57:01.0000] <Traveler1>
Right.

[14:57:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
On the other hand, if you're going to end up putting in a <div id=header> or similar, might as well use <header> there.

[14:57:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Exactly.

[14:57:04.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: the websocket thing

[14:57:05.0000] <Traveler1>
No way, as AryehGregor said, no point.

[14:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not saying definitely do it.  Just if you are planning on grouping things like that, then use <header> rather than a <div>.  <header> was introduced *precisely* to replace that sort of <div> usage.

[14:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So for instance, I use a <header> on aryeh.name because I want to have possibly a few headings at the top of the page, with a particular background and such, so I need an extra element.  So I made it <header> instead of <div id=header> or something.

[14:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, looks like I can swap from using this single display table (to get a good two-column layout) to using display:table pretty painlessly.  It handles itself pretty well in IE7 when I patch it with float.

[15:00:00.0000] <Traveler1>
What about if I have two links on the header? Should I use a nav tag? Btw the links are just for viewing the page in english or another lang

[15:01:00.0000] <Traveler1>
nvm

[15:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If they are navigation for the site, use <nav>.  If not, don't.  ^_^

[15:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, why didn't I do this earlier?  The layout table is now officially banished from my company's site.  I just need to push a bit further and do the new sectioning elements rather than divs, and I'll be happy leaving this company.

[16:07:00.0000] <conley>
In html5, If I have a <nav></nav> and I want div-like elments inside...what should those be?  <nav> or <section>?

[16:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
<div>?

[16:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
depends what you mean by div-like :-)

[16:09:00.0000] <conley>
hixie: I consider all those div-like...i wasn't sure if div was still valid in html5...

[16:09:01.0000] <conley>
I did a ton of googling and ironically, right after I posted here I finally found http://html5doctor.com/the-section-element/

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's a pretty good overview, yeah

[16:28:00.0000] <conley>
so is it ok to put a <nav> inside a header?

[16:29:00.0000] <conley>
like, if I have a big banner at the top of my site and some links inside, is that fine to label them that way?

[16:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure.

[16:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
<header> can contain any flow content.

[16:31:00.0000] <conley>
thanks

[18:15:00.0000] <drclue>
Long day today , just refueled the jet packs on the truck :)

[18:29:00.0000] <drclue>
I really would like a method to from within HTML to create some sort of XML data island and use entities like &name; sequences for in page templating. 

[18:29:01.0000] <drclue>
Figure if one can annoy the world with a marquee element , there might be room for something like this too

[18:33:00.0000] <drclue>
Any particular reason we need embed , applet and object as opposed to merging them into object?

[18:34:00.0000] <drclue>
For that matter , iframe could be rolled into object too

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
applet is gone

[18:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
embed, iframe, and img are basically specialised versions of object

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
(object has all kinds of problems -- it turns out overloading elements to do lots of similar things isn't a good design after all)

[18:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
(<input> is similarly a problem)

[18:40:02.0000] <drclue>
I understand they are specialized , but why keep them around?

[18:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
they work better

[18:40:04.0000] <drclue>
emmm how so?

[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
have you tried using <object>? browsers implement it in all kinds of buggy ways

[18:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
just compare the spec for <object> to the spec for iframe, img, and embed -- the object one is way more complicated for what it does

[18:43:00.0000] <drclue>
I understand that in use in the current ways things are done that some things work better than others , but in rolling things together

[18:43:01.0000] <drclue>
it would just be a matter of vectoring existing code so in their rolls the code would still be the same

[18:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
you'd think

[18:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
yet it seems not

[18:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
in practice <object> has had way more bugs than the other three put together

[18:44:01.0000] <drclue>
I'm just kicking thoughts around. I've been enjoying the show since mosiac

[18:45:00.0000] <drclue>
How about my other thought of XML data islands and linkages to entities for in page templating. I've been using that approach server side since old netscape

[18:46:00.0000] <drclue>
"yet it seems not"  That one I just find hard to believe , but I'll take your word for it

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
just test the browsers -- <object> is more buggy

[18:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
or look in the bug databases for mozilla and webkit

[18:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
<object> has way more bugs than the others

[18:47:03.0000] <drclue>
I know what your saying is true, but that really was not my point.

[18:49:00.0000] <drclue>
I figure you have been messing about with browsers probably as long as I have

[18:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
since 1998 :-)

[18:49:02.0000] <drclue>
I started about Mosiac

[18:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
well, since 1995, but i started doing standards stuff in 98

[18:50:00.0000] <drclue>
Started programming before PC's came with screens and keyboards as options

[18:51:00.0000] <drclue>
So basically neither of us is new to this.

[18:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
indeed :-)

[18:52:00.0000] <drclue>
I tend to believe that while object is sorta buggy that there might be a way to spec our way out of the buggy into those places that work better

[18:53:00.0000] <drclue>
Thats the fun thing about specs is that you can make demands and if those demands leverage the existing code base , they can be reasonable

[18:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
well we tried that with html4, for embed/img/applet/iframe -> object

[18:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
and it didn't work :-)

[18:56:00.0000] <drclue>
Thats because the spec did the migration incorrectly

[18:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
does html5 do it correctly?

[18:57:00.0000] <drclue>
You tell me , will object as a result of the spec behave?

[18:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think the bugs is more of a result of the element being overloaded with multiple roles than the spec being poor, in this particular case, so i disagree with the premise of your question :-)

[18:59:00.0000] <drclue>
Maybe the question is better asked this way. Of all the object flavored elements , which do you think works most correctly cross-browser?

[19:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
img, them iframe, then embed, then applet, then object, i think

[19:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it's hard to say

[19:01:02.0000] <drclue>
img does not really do anything comparable, which next in order brings us to iframe

[19:02:00.0000] <drclue>
iframe is a possible key to this , even if it were called object

[19:03:00.0000] <drclue>
Leveraging existing good behaviors is something I would encourage 

[19:04:00.0000] <drclue>
Not much to changing an element name in a table

[19:06:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Hixie: I agree completely with what you said about overloading elements to do lots of similar things being bad design -- especially the case of the input element -- but I think command is also an instance of that same kind of pattern

[19:06:01.0000] <drclue>
As you said object has so many issues , so just call iframe object and back fill it with the object element.  

[19:08:00.0000] <drclue>
[MikeSmithX] I really take issue with having a bunch of different elements that do basically the same thing drifting about in disparate implementations 

[19:08:01.0000] <drclue>
I would rather leverage what browsers do well 

[19:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithX: how so?

[19:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithX: oh the whole radio/checkbox/option thing?

[19:09:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
drclue: we don't always get that choice.. in some cases where are stuck also with retaining what browsers do not so well, and what existing content uses (how every inappropriately it might be using it)

[19:09:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Hixie: yeah

[19:10:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
basically, I think every place where the spec says, "If the foo element is in the bar state.." is a red flag

[19:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
the spec never says that :-P

[19:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
elements aren't in states :-P

[19:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's attributes that are in states :-P

[19:10:04.0000] <MikeSmithX>
heho

[19:10:05.0000] <MikeSmithX>
yeah, you know what I mean

[19:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithX: i suppose we could have <command>, <command-checkable>, and <command-radio>, or something, but really they're all just menu items (maybe <menuitem> would be a better name)

[19:11:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
drclue: there is a rational argument to be made for retaining applet event

[19:11:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
*even

[19:11:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
the applet element

[19:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithX: i looked at existing designs when doing <command> and most just have a single type of element for that (e.g. xul just has <menuitem>, iirc)

[19:12:00.0000] <drclue>
[MSX] I know about legacy, we all know about legacy. In pulling this stuff together I figure one leverages what they do well , so that those having to code it are less resistant

[19:12:01.0000] <drclue>
I'm a coder of many decades, and and internet type of many many years too, and I write parsers, so I feel that while it is but an opinion , I can contribute one from the vantage point of having worn all the shoes 

[19:13:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Hixie: then I would consider a flaw in those specs as well, and an anti-pattern that shouldn't be further perpetuated

[19:13:01.0000] <drclue>
BRB smoke break

[19:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithX: i don't know that i agree that in this case it's really overloading... especially if you consider the way that commands ended up being specced out, it's not clear to me that they are that different from each other

[19:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithX: they are far more similar to each other than, say, the various input types

[19:18:00.0000] <drclue>
I'm back

[19:18:01.0000] <fantasai>
jgraham: sorry, I meant bug 137

[19:18:02.0000] <fantasai>
jgraham: not 135

[19:19:00.0000] <drclue>
My thought really is that the specification related to the multiple object types should try and flow from the object that currently works best cross browser

[19:20:00.0000] <drclue>
The other objects should then back fill into that one object

[19:21:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Hixie: yeah, agreed in command case they are more similar and certainly less confusing than input

[19:21:01.0000] <drclue>
Coding wise that would be easier and hopefully provide better acceptance

[19:22:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
as far as input, it's not really accurate to say the language has *an* input element.. instead it has 15 or more different input elements

[19:22:01.0000] <drclue>
It would also give coders an excuse to fix what aint broken (tongue in cheek) 

[19:22:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
fantasai: hey, so it seems like there has recently been some forward movement on the CSS ruby spec

[19:24:00.0000] <fantasai>
MikeSmithX: yeah, I hear ishida wants to edit

[19:24:01.0000] <fantasai>
:)

[19:24:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
yeah, I was chatting with him about it earlier

[19:25:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Hixie: btw, can you recall what is the use-case for having multiple ruby bases and texts in a single ruby element?

[19:25:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
as the HTML5 spec currently allows

[19:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
"it works in IE", i think

[19:25:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
ah

[19:25:04.0000] <fantasai>
MikeSmithX: well, the CSSWG approved his editorship if that helps :)

[19:25:05.0000] <fantasai>
MikeSmithX: I don't think the editor's draft is on dev.w3.org yet

[19:25:06.0000] <Hixie>
also advanced ruby or whatever it was called allowed something equivalent

[19:26:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
fantasai: OK. I hope he might consider a co-editor, but I think we will be able to get him help with it regardless

[19:27:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
anyway, I am just glad that it's actually being worked on actively

[19:27:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Hixie: I asked because it's my understanding that the original ruby spec did not allow it

[19:27:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/ I mean

[19:28:00.0000] <drclue>
So let's say that iframe is the most reliable object for instance. We claim that all objects to be named object take as their basis iframe accept where otherwise noted and expand out from there adding back in the details of object , sorta in spec suggesting one really just goto the element table and write "object" where it says "iframe" and inject the additional details of object to the spec of iframe

[19:29:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
but if IE does allow multiple ruby bases and especially if there is existing content that relies on it, well, it would seem hard to justify not allowing it simply for reasons of keeping it aligned with that ca. 2001 spec

[19:30:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
that original ruby spec is one that I'm not clear on whether it went to Rec without there actually having been any implementations at the time

[19:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
this isn't my area of expertise

[19:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, gotta go

[19:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[19:31:00.0000] <drclue>
ruby is so far afield of HTML , I have a hard time understanding it's presence in the conversation

[19:33:00.0000] <fantasai>
MikeSmithX: just trace back the versions and see if there was a CR stage :)

[19:34:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
drclue: http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/text-level-semantics.html#the-ruby-element and http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-ruby

[19:35:00.0000] <drclue>
Yes , I know it has made inroads , but that is another matter

[19:35:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
fantasai: well, even HTML4 had a CR stage... I just think it lasted for a week or two or something

[19:36:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
or maybe it didn't even have a CR

[19:36:01.0000] <fantasai>
MikeSmithX: I thought the old process didn't have a CR stage

[19:36:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I believe HTML4 went from FPWD to Rec in 5 months

[19:36:03.0000] <fantasai>
MikeSmithX: LC -> PR

[19:36:04.0000] <fantasai>
?

[19:36:05.0000] <MikeSmithX>
fantasai: ah, OK

[19:37:00.0000] <drclue>
function,data,presentation    one should never mix these drugs 

[19:44:00.0000] <drclue>
Even in reading the cited spec, it still seems warped. Perhaps this would be better served with a CSS pseudo like :before :after  and be :above

[19:47:00.0000] <drclue>
Hard to say , but I don't care for the Ruby thing, but I would not throw a fit about it I guess. Once I saw marquee , I had to just say "Elvis has left the building"

[19:47:01.0000] <drclue>
and keep in mind that this is a collaborative effort that requires a lot of patience or else nothing will actually get done. 

[19:55:00.0000] <drclue>
Another issue that puzzles me is how multi-col layouts are ending up in CSS and not in layout. I really would like to see the multicol element return

[19:56:00.0000] <drclue>
I do like the return of the table layout elements , and while I got used to writing CSS for table layouts never could understand how tables were considered style

[20:00:00.0000] <drclue>
I've seen a lot of weird stuff since 1994 when I switched from general programing to Internet based development and I'm sure I'll see a lot more .

[20:01:00.0000] <drclue>
whatever spec gets laid down , I'll just code for it and back patch as best I can like always, but some days I just have to scratch my head

[20:05:00.0000] <drclue>
Can anyone explain to me why an HTML specification would have "5.4 Microdata vocabularies"?

[20:06:00.0000] <drclue>
Why would layout care about the microdata vocabularies of the moment?

[20:07:00.0000] <drclue>
It would almost seem like caring about "dBase III" 

[20:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
1) HTML is not "layout"

[20:08:01.0000] <drclue>
HTML should be what then?

[20:08:02.0000] <othermaciej>
2) The W3C HTML5 spec does not include them, but they are in the all-inclusive WHATWG copy (which includes many other things like WebSocket)

[20:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
3) dBase III? huh?

[20:08:04.0000] <drclue>
My point exactly

[20:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML is a markup language for hypertext documents and applications on the Web

[20:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it is not a layout language

[20:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
CSS is a layout/styling language

[20:09:03.0000] <drclue>
Of course it is 

[20:09:04.0000] <drclue>
CSS is styling

[20:10:00.0000] <drclue>
making reference to particular fixed widths and such anywhere is a bad idea in general

[20:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
p { display: block; margin: 1.0em 0px; }

[20:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that is the line of CSS that gives the <p> element its default layout behavior in WebKit

[20:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it comes from the file html.css

[20:12:02.0000] <drclue>
The style of that P element is that it is a block with a margin, and is indeed style

[20:12:03.0000] <boblet>
foolip: I’ve got some more Live Microdata feedback…

[20:12:04.0000] <othermaciej>
drclue: that style is what controls its layout

[20:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you put that same style on a <div> or <span>, and it lays out the same

[20:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the way <p> is different is semantics, not layout

[20:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
<p> means the contents are a paragraph, but <div> or <span> would not indicate anything specific about the contents

[20:14:00.0000] <drclue>
I could with layout indicate that the order of appearance and placement in the tree of the P element involved is one thing while the style of tha rendering is another

[20:14:01.0000] <boblet>
foolip: when I use the card/ical download links the file has a .part extension, so isn’t recognised by relevant apps

[20:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the appearance and placement of the P element on screen is completely controlled by CSS

[20:14:03.0000] <boblet>
foolip: also the download link doesn’t work in Chrome 5

[20:14:04.0000] <drclue>
There is a devision of labor

[20:14:05.0000] <drclue>
There is some overlap

[20:15:00.0000] <drclue>
but the primary roles should be separate

[20:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the primary role of HTML markup is semantics

[20:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the primary role of CSS is controlling styling and layout

[20:16:00.0000] <drclue>
CSS = Cascading "style" sheets. 

[20:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in case this means anything to you, my day job is as a WebKit developer, and I am pretty sure I know what our code does

[20:18:00.0000] <boblet>
foolip: if I change the extension the vcard files downloaded by FF load fine

foolip: however the .ics file appears to load but doesn’t show up (iCal being screwy most probably)

[20:18:02.0000] <drclue>
Well if we are flipping our peckers on the table to lay a ruler next to , I have been programming since before PC's had keyboards and screens as options and working the Internet since Mosiac.  I don't think penis wars makes one right or wrong and should not be something by which to decry the merits of ones position

[20:21:00.0000] <boblet>
drclue: re: you example about style overriding layout, if CSS is disabled then the user agent will indicate what the element is to the user based on the element’s semantics (eg screen reader will pronounce words wrapped in <strong> differently)

[20:27:00.0000] <drclue>
Having written screen reader code for the blind and participated in the sun conferences , I can say that font-weight and other CSS styling s should indeed effect the

[20:27:01.0000] <drclue>
style in which content is rendered verbally. 

[20:30:00.0000] <drclue>
The failures of software aimed at the visual market should in no way be used as an excuse , just as penis wars should not be used , but rather the devision of labor in the standards should win out in this regard

[20:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not sure why the current division of labor is inadequate.  It's split differently from how you expect, apparently, but HTML is semantics and structure, CSS is style and layout, and Javascript is behavior.

[20:34:00.0000] <drclue>
Standards wise , while there may be some overlap javascript = function , XML = data , HTML = layout , CSS=style 

[20:34:01.0000] <drclue>
There are indeed overlaps and accepted abuses and pseudo standards to augment actual standards , but they is what they is 

[20:34:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's not the division that currently exists, or is reflected in current standards.

[20:34:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
It may be how things were intended to be divided in the past, I dunno.

[20:35:00.0000] <drclue>
I guess we are each free to view the standards from our own vantage point 

[20:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I see you arguing previously that HTML's role is 'layout'.  Why do you say this?  At what point was HTML ever any sort of layout language, except by default (because CSS wasn't mature enough to do so yet)?

[20:41:00.0000] <drclue>
HTML is a structural beast as relates to it's nature , CSS is the paint or style you apply to that structure. At times the lines can blur a bit as one reaches into the realm of the other, but they really do have their basic natures. At times , even in spec they have over-reached, like for example tables. When the spec changed , I complied but it was wrong , which is why it has never really worked all that well. TABLES belong to HTML, just

[20:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed, tables do belong to HTML, because "tabular data" is a unique semantic that doesn't exist elsewhere.  It's very useful to be able to indicate that a set of data is correlated along two different axes.

[20:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
On the other hand, table *layout* is part of a CSS module, and capable of being used on any element to provide the layout you want.  Grid-like constraint-based layout is useful outside of presenting tabular data.

[20:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I use the table layout module, for example, to produce an attractive two-column layout on my company's site.)

[20:53:00.0000] <drclue>
Well , that two column layout IMHO should have been the MULTICOL tag introduced originally as the vendor specific offering of Netscape.

[20:53:01.0000] <drclue>
This was a structural layout item and made sense. No matter the size of the display device the general layout was consistent. Using tables or kin

[20:53:02.0000] <drclue>
sorta requires one to decide the size and dimensions of the display which is really wrong. If one takes their time and distributes the work load properly the desktop rendering should by and large work just as well in almost any other medium

[20:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, multicol is wrong.  For example, I want in some cases to be able to control the number of column based on the screen width - 1 column for small screens, 2 or 3 columns for wider screens.  This has *nothing* to do with the document itself; it's entirely a styling issue.

[20:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In fact, excellent example, the translation application for my company's software can list over 20 languages.  The name of a language isn't very wide, so it's ideal to present in multiple columns, but obviously you don't want to make the column too small so it starts wrapping the name.  That's just silly.

[20:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So I do a little "ul.lang-list{ column-width: 20em; }" or whatever, and it automatically adjusts.

[20:57:01.0000] <drclue>
OK , so you want to contrive several versions of your output or inject function into presentation. I myself would not do same. I might have a collapse option on the multicol  but other than that I would rather have the multicol element

[20:57:02.0000] <foolip>
boblet: hi there

[20:58:00.0000] <boblet>
hey hey

[20:58:01.0000] <foolip>
which browser appends a .part extension?

[20:58:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
If I were to change how I do this column-izing, though, that doesn't change the meaning of the document at all.  I shouldn't be changing the document just because I'm presenting it differently.

[20:59:00.0000] <boblet>
foolip: FF 3.5x

[20:59:01.0000] <drclue>
OF course you should be able to have one well crafted presentation work across multiple platforms and dimensions which is where I always try to stand 

[20:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So yes, I do want to present several versions of my output, based on the output device.

[20:59:03.0000] <boblet>
foolip: also tested in Chrome 5.0x, but it didn’t seem to download the file (both Mac)

[20:59:04.0000] <foolip>
boblet: and iCal, is that on mac?

[21:00:00.0000] <roc>
FF appends a .part extension while the file is downloading

[21:00:01.0000] <roc>
when the download is complete, the .part extension is removed

[21:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
In many cases, sure, you want a single presentation because it's just easier.  But there are also cases when the best/most natural/prettiest presentation is well-suited for a particular class of output devices, but needs some tweaks for otheer ones.

[21:00:03.0000] <boblet>
foolip: yes. renaming vcard to .vcs worked fine for Address Book

[21:00:04.0000] <foolip>
roc: this is a data: URL

[21:00:05.0000] <drclue>
I just want to have one presentation that through proper design renders well desktop , laptop,cellphone , audio

[21:00:06.0000] <boblet>
roc: the file is from a data url, and it’s not removing .part for me

[21:00:07.0000] <roc>
that sounds like just a bug

[21:01:00.0000] <foolip>
boblet: file bug at mozilla :)

[21:01:01.0000] <drclue>
I want that one presentation to occur within the standards

[21:01:02.0000] <boblet>
foolip: will add it to the todo pile :)

[21:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You can certainly put together that one presentation.  But that doesn't mean that one should be limited to that.

[21:02:01.0000] <foolip>
boblet: if either the vcard or ical output doesn't work in some major software, that may be a bug in the spec (assuming I follow it)

[21:02:02.0000] <boblet>
drclue: given the state of browsers across those devices, I think you’re going to be making something that’s lowest common denominator. <p> is well-supported :|

[21:02:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
For example, for a screen reader it's best to have the content come first, and all the miscellaneous navigation and such come afterwards.  But if you do that with HTML and relatively basic CSS, you're forced to have the nav stuff either on the right column, or below the content.

[21:03:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
othermaciej: fwiw, I just revived the twitter @html5 account (which had gone dormant since December when twitter apparently changed their rest API to reject any messages longer than 140, instead of auto-truncating them as it used to)

[21:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmithX: neat

[21:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you want it on the left column, you simply *can't*.  You need to turn to CSS (right now employing some dirty hacks, in the future being able to use stuff like Template Layout to arrange things easily).

[21:04:00.0000] <drclue>
Your more than welcome to make as many presentations as you like ,and via media selectors in CSS you can make the subtle changes required to render a single presentation in multiple ways or as you prefer make multiple renderings. Specs need not make that choice for you

[21:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
What do you mean by "Specs need not make that choice for you"?

[21:06:00.0000] <foolip>
boblet: chrome seems to work if you right click and save as

[21:06:01.0000] <boblet>
foolip: oh, doh. didn’t try that

[21:07:00.0000] <foolip>
boblet: problem with data URLs is that they don't have a name, to make this sane one would have to bounce the data to a server-side script with the wanted name

[21:07:01.0000] <boblet>
foolip: probably not a new feature that’ll happen anytime soon huh ;-)

[21:07:02.0000] <drclue>
Specs should allow one to avoid having to make multiple base audience presentations but rather through as afforded via media selectors make common changes to multiple singular presentations  via subtle suggestions in style

[21:07:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm confused.  That's the current state of affairs.  What do you think is wrong?

[21:08:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
othermaciej: along with watching for changes to the dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html (the HTML5 spec) and the drafts split out from it (microdata, 2dcontext, etc.) it also watches and notifies about changes to the h:tml draft, the html4-differences, rdfa, the alt-techniques doc from Steve Faulkner, the decision-policy doc, and the issue-status doc

[21:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmithX: sounds like a useful data source

[21:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmithX: Yay, thanks!  I was sad when @html5 stopped broadcasting.

[21:09:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
othermaciej: if you want me to have it un-watch the decision-policy doc or issue-status doc, I can turn that off

[21:09:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
TabAtkins: thank Twitter for changing their API :)

[21:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmithX: I'd say not the decision policy doc, but watching issue-status is good

[21:09:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
OK

[21:09:04.0000] <MikeSmithX>
/me turns off decision-policy watching

[21:09:05.0000] <foolip>
boblet: well, no :) the main use for the tool is the "live" part after all. but do try importing the output into various software (I only tried gmail and google calendar)

[21:11:00.0000] <boblet>
ok!

[21:11:01.0000] <drclue>
What I think is wrong currently is that forays from the realms of one specification are reaching past reasonable overlap into the realms of others ,and  that the established and proven separations of data, function and presentation formerly considered and proven to be good programming practice are being forgotten

[21:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think you're misunderstanding just what the specs are doing, and what roles they're playing.  Likely you have a slightly out-of-date view of what each language is supposed to address, and thus are seeing more overreaching than actually exists.

[21:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
From what I can tell, you think along roughly the right lines, and the specs agree with you.

[21:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is going to bed now.  ;_;

[21:14:00.0000] <drclue>
After 40 years of watching the world go by , I notice these things. Not to be a penis war type of comment , but just a citation of the scars.

[21:14:01.0000] <drclue>
Those who have not learned from history are doomed to repeat it and it that repetition is something I think your missing. 

[21:15:00.0000] <drclue>
No matter , I figure we are doomed to never actually agree and that is OK, diverse opinions ar ewhat make for the diversity the web is built upon

[21:23:00.0000] <drclue>
I should clarify the 40 years relates to the computing experience not my actual age, but whats a decade or so among friends :)

[21:34:00.0000] <drclue>
By and large I think that the HTML5 specification is viable and should despite it's issues move forward. If we waited for it to be perfect , no progress would be made at all in a time when we really do need progress. Old crutches like Adobe Flash need to be cast aside. Vacillations over minutia while great conversation and perhaps valid conversation for HTML5.1 or such pale in consideration of larger issues like the threats posed by Ruper

[21:34:01.0000] <drclue>
confines of HTML5 we can fix with respct to the various code bases the remaining issues

[22:07:00.0000] <boblet>
first peek at Microformats & Microdata slides from a talk I gave recently: http://oli.jp/slides/microformats-microdata/

[22:08:00.0000] <boblet>
if anyone checks it out and has comments please leave here & I’ll check the logs later

[22:08:01.0000] <boblet>
otherwise via twitter @boblet

[22:08:02.0000] <drclue>
I'll buy into this conversation. Why would any microformat be a valid HTML spec conversation?

[22:09:00.0000] <boblet>
drclue: slides = presentation, not conversation :P

[22:10:00.0000] <boblet>
I’ve gotta go—conversational ticket sales will resume the next time I’m on

[22:10:01.0000] <boblet>
feel free to ask me again then

[22:10:02.0000] <drclue>
OK , you say it is a presentation , but I in looking at the specification still ask the question why any microformat would be a valid

[22:10:03.0000] <drclue>
component of an HTML specification 

[22:11:00.0000] <boblet>
sigh

[22:11:01.0000] <boblet>
quickly

[22:11:02.0000] <boblet>
uF are not part of any HTML specification

[22:11:03.0000] <drclue>
sigh all ya like , I think it is valid conversation

[22:11:04.0000] <boblet>
sigh = I’m late

[22:12:00.0000] <boblet>
the closest uF have come to integration in HTML spec is microdata chapter

[22:12:01.0000] <boblet>
code examples of using vcard and vevent

[22:12:02.0000] <drclue>
There should be no reference to any spec of the moment , be it ones you cite or dBas III

[22:12:03.0000] <boblet>
uF specs themselves are made by microformats.org community = completely different

[22:13:00.0000] <drclue>
This discussion area is about HTML5 so why would any format be it vcard , dBase III or cobalt be relevant

[22:13:01.0000] <boblet>
as to why spec uF to start with, because they’re useful, in the same way that the HTML spec is useful

[22:13:02.0000] <boblet>
following it gives common ground on which to build

[22:13:03.0000] <boblet>
eg Google Rich Snippets

[22:13:04.0000] <boblet>
eg Technorati uF search

[22:14:00.0000] <boblet>
if uF don’t float your boat, there’s no requirement to use em

[22:14:01.0000] <boblet>
and I’m out

[22:14:02.0000] <boblet>
l8r all

[22:14:03.0000] <drclue>
Useful and spec related are not the same thing despite any inroads one might have made

[22:14:04.0000] <boblet>
again—next time

[22:15:00.0000] <drclue>
OK next time as you like, but HTML should not in any way be tied to a non w3.org spec which itself is not related to the spec in a timeless manner. 

[22:18:00.0000] <drclue>
There could be any number of hangers on that might want to promote a standard by tying it to a rising star. This should in no way be allowed.

[22:18:01.0000] <drclue>
in general true w3.org standards are timeless and as should be immune from specs of the momment

[22:21:00.0000] <foolip>
drclue: HTML makes no reference to microformats

[22:22:00.0000] <foolip>
drclue: microformats piggyback on the class attribute mostly

[22:22:01.0000] <drclue>
Most w3 standards can cite years if not decades of service and interact with other standards proven not only by the moment but years and decades of service

[22:22:02.0000] <drclue>
to lower the bar of admission lowers the quality and consideration of the standards themselves and makes them but a of the moment straw poll of the latest music artist or movie star and totally underming the value of having specifications at all

[22:23:00.0000] <drclue>
I was reading the standard just today and saw such references , so while I may be wrong , they are indeed referenced and in no way should be

[22:24:00.0000] <foolip>
drclue: please file specific bugs on those sections

[22:25:00.0000] <foolip>
drclue: if you want good flame material "microdata"is the keyword, not microformats

[22:28:00.0000] <drclue>
It is a shame that your position should rely on minor typos or terms of reference. These are not bugs but rather invalid intermingling of outside standards of the moment with official standards

[22:32:00.0000] <foolip>
All problems in the spec are treated as bugs.

[22:32:01.0000] <foolip>
Still, please list which "outside standards" it is "invalid" to reference

[22:34:00.0000] <drclue>
Well , if you prefer that problems in th spec be called bugs , I will most certainly allow for that, but I will not waste my time parsing it in that fashion which is my choice just as it is your choice to send to committee that point 

[22:35:00.0000] <drclue>
A reference to a spec that is not in itself a valid w3.org spec is in my opinion invalid

[22:35:01.0000] <foolip>
how about RFCs?

[22:36:00.0000] <foolip>
lots of W3C specs I've read reference RFCs

[22:37:00.0000] <drclue>
If the w3.org should allow a non spec to masquerade as spec that would be invalid too , and as to the RFC's , it should be as valid as  RFC 1149

[22:38:00.0000] <foolip>
what constitutes a "non spec"?

[22:39:00.0000] <drclue>
That is up to interpretation but IMHO a true spec is timeless and not effected by the moment

[22:40:00.0000] <foolip>
an you give an example of a true spec and a false spec?

[22:40:01.0000] <drclue>
citing RFC's is like citing the Avion carrier protocool 

[22:40:02.0000] <foolip>
anyway, please file bugs for the specific things in the spec you think are wrong, it's not possible to make spec changes based on general notions like this.

[22:41:00.0000] <drclue>
The IP protocol is a true spec, in which a gaol is achieved and no axe is ground. A false spec is pretty much the rest

[22:44:00.0000] <drclue>
Spec changes can indeed be made by the beliefs I hold and which have been both derived and reflected by the historical authorings of the w3.org and the attempts to send such perceptions to committee just make me laugh

[22:45:00.0000] <foolip>
which committee?

[22:46:00.0000] <drclue>
IF you [foolip] are in a position to undermine the w3.org , I'm stuck , and as I have since 1994 will comply. Otherwise your opinon does not hold a dime more value than mine and we are both free to express our opinions

[22:47:00.0000] <foolip>
drclue: you greatly overestimate my power to undermine much of anything

[22:48:00.0000] <drclue>
Hey than you are just like me , someone with an opinion. You have yours , I have mine

[22:49:00.0000] <foolip>
drclue: you're in the IRC channel of the WHATWG, if you think something in the spec is in violation of some W3C policy then bring it to the W3C (participtation is open to the public)

[22:49:01.0000] <drclue>
You want to debate your opinion versus mine , great , lets do it. It's not a mater of anything but dueling opinions

[22:50:00.0000] <drclue>
Lets ask Hixie if it is fair game to discuss our opinions here, what you thing the answer will be?

[22:51:00.0000] <foolip>
of course it's OK, but we're not getting anywhere

[22:52:00.0000] <foolip>
which is why I encourage you to be specific, so that other can understand your position.

[22:52:01.0000] <drclue>
I was not asking if we were getting anywhere , but rather addressing your opinion that I must express such opinions elswhere. Are you done in that regard?

[22:53:00.0000] <drclue>
What do you think I have not been specific about?

[22:53:01.0000] <foolip>
you don't *have* to do anything, I'm only telling you what ways of leaving feedback are more likely to have a result

[22:54:00.0000] <drclue>
I've had conversation with Hixie and while I do not demand he do anything , I am inded allowed to express myself

[22:55:00.0000] <drclue>
If you want to debate a point , hixie reads the conversation so lets indeed debate

[22:56:00.0000] <foolip>
You haven't said anything specific enough to be possible to debate, so I will decline the offer.

[22:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I still have no idea what you're talking about either

[22:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It does remind me of the talk about letting page authors set the accept header...

[23:00:00.0000] <drclue>
Well , I said what I have said , which prompted you to respond , if indeed you have no position on the issue I expressed than indeed that is what you have to say

[23:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
things would be so much easier if html had an intelligently designed internal encoding declaration mechanism instead of an evolved one

[23:06:00.0000] <drclue>
It would be nice if in hind site that the original HTML allowing scientist to exchange ideas had the for site to address the applications it evolved to. 

[23:06:01.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Kind of like, not letting HTTP headers override document metadata?

[23:07:00.0000] <drclue>
If wishes were horses beggars would ride

[23:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
like not being able to have charset-sensitive stuff before the declaration

[23:09:00.0000] <drclue>
If your on a totally different vein then that I'm discussing asking if the broader scope should override the specific scope I disagree. a More specific scope should override a broader scope

[23:10:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
geez.. http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=4781&to=4782

[23:11:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
is it really worth going to the trouble of having warnings emitted for the "dataformatas" attribute?

[23:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Warnings will be emitted anyway

[23:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
This way the warning makes more sense

[23:12:01.0000] <drclue>
Not even sure what that cited link has to do with my opinions other than wasting my time

[23:12:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
that and whatever the hell these other bizarro phantom attributes are

[23:12:03.0000] <Dashiva>
event and for are IE-isms

[23:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Although I think other browsers support event=load for=window

[23:13:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I see

[23:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: I think only IE supports <script for>

[23:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe Opera too

[23:13:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I know Safari doesn't

[23:13:05.0000] <drclue>
Discussing IE in regard to specs is like discussing freedom in a jail cell

[23:13:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Not the general case, but onload

[23:13:07.0000] <hsivonen>
which other browsers?

[23:13:08.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[23:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
i thought gecko had support but no longer

[23:14:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
/me only just now notices Hixie "yes, we're scraping the bottom of the barrel now" comment in that commit description

Any discussion that resolves to IE is indeed scraping the ultimate bottom of the barrel

[23:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I suspect this is about making a point about Larry's and Julian's requests

[23:15:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hmm

[23:16:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
so if Hixie feels like his time is being wasted, the solution is to spread the waste of time more widely so that others share the pain

[23:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Or so others are motivated to help stop the pain

[23:17:01.0000] <drclue>
IE is irrelevant. The capabilities of HTML5 will make IE to browsing like MS paint is to desk top publishing. At this juncture in life  lets all laugh loudly and move on

[23:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Right.

[23:20:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
anyway, apologies for my non-sequitor posting of that link and interrupting the previous conversation.. here's a link that I think might be more relevant to that: http://logopoeia.com/wisdom/ 

[23:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think you actually interrupted anything...

[23:21:01.0000] <drclue>
I really hate having to read links, and I hate it more when after doing so my time is wasted

[23:22:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
amen to that

[23:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmithX, stop using your magical powers to force people to read links

[23:24:00.0000] <drclue>
Hy , if folks have VALID OPINIONS on the topic at hand , I'll trade words till I die, but if there was a nuclear button for folks with no F**King opinion just wasting my time I would be dancing on it 

[23:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: your impl of details is surprisingly similar to mine

[23:25:01.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: except you don't check for native support and don't check which key or button was pressed

[23:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
well and i listened for clicks on document

[23:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: OK, point taken

[23:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me turns off his personal Ultra Low Frequency long-range communications transmitter

[23:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It looks like firefox still supports for=window event=onload (but inline, not onload)

[23:27:02.0000] <drclue>
[MikeSmith] Please go somewhere for an extended period of time before I violate some law

[23:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: eww, why would you listen for clicks on document?

[23:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: yeah my implementation was lazy

[23:29:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
drclue, OK, please just don't violate me. I prefer to be more like, say, ravished

[23:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
犯される方がいい

[23:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: you always have a way with words

[23:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
great pick-up line, that

[23:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: I also forgot to add a :active state for the triangle

[23:31:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll have to try that one out

[23:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I didn't know you needed pickup lines

[23:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: I also wanted to make it animate but likewise ran out of steam - not sure it can be done with just CSS transitions

[23:32:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I figured there was already a line of people wanting to be picked up

[23:32:03.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: actually, maybe it can through grotesque hackery - wonder if my idea would flicker

[23:36:00.0000] <drclue>
[MikeSmith] Bring it , I will ravish it, if for no other rason than you will be quite for 2,4,6,8 hours

[23:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: i had a listener on document for other things as well

[23:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: i sent an email to www-style about transitioning between height:0 and height:auto

[23:38:01.0000] <zcorpan>
well height:1em and height:auto should work too

[23:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: I gotta convince Simon to just implement that for me

[23:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: but I did think of a way to fake it

[23:38:04.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: height: 1em is kinda bogus though

[23:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
why?

[23:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the summary could be taller than 1em

[23:39:02.0000] <zcorpan>
true

[23:39:03.0000] <zcorpan>
but not if you know it's just one word

[23:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if it has a different font than the details its height won't be 1em in <details> space

[23:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: datasrc, datafld, and dataformatas are the first global attributes that have been added to the "Non-conforming features" section. if we use the same mechanism of making them valid in legacy.rnc (and emitting the errors in the assertions code) it presents a new problem: the also need to be added to the embed.attrs.other pattern

[23:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there are not currently any obsolete-and-nonconforming attributes in embed.attrs.other

[23:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: an alternative is filing a spec bug about this and force a decision against making all legacy stuff conforming

[23:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm

[23:49:01.0000] <drclue>
F**K this spec bug shit , if there is an issue lets all have it out , the parties that be read this IRC thing probably more than the bug spec thing

[23:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: they're nonconforming already, aren't they?

[23:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: or I can just hold off and wait for the drama to play out

[23:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
these particular features, that is

[23:50:03.0000] <drclue>
I think there might be disagreements , but real bugs  ,lets hear the song

[23:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
script@for and script@event and table@datapagesize are easy enough to add, so maybe just add specific assertions error messages for those for now and leave the datafld, etc. stuff for later

[23:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
drclue, help commands

[23:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, definitely in the non-conforming section

[23:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: that's one option if you can get someone else to play the drama opposition 

[23:53:02.0000] <drclue>
[MS] ya ain't near enough to obey 

[23:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: are you just making sure that all explicitly nonconforming attributes have a custom error message instead of the generic one?

[23:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: if these are at all inconvenient due to the <embed> stuff, I'd just not add any code for these

[23:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: yeah, for consistency with a change made a while back to emit custom error messages for all attributes listed in that section

[23:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK

[23:55:00.0000] <drclue>
HTML5 aint perfect by a long shot , but as a means to move forward , it's ok

[23:55:01.0000] <zcorpan>
is <embed datafld> conforming?

[23:55:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: the spec does not explicitly say that the conformance checkers should emit specific warnings for obsolete-and-non-conforming attributes, but it seems useful for end-users to have them

[23:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess it's not since the obsolete section says it must not be used

[23:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
especially given the un-usefulness of the generic messages that jing emits for them

[23:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: in general, yeah - for the datawhatever attributes, maybe not so much, since they only ever existed in the world of imagination

[23:56:03.0000] <drclue>
HTML5 tries to please too many people , but forward versus standstill it rocks

[23:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: good point

[23:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what does IE do with dataformatas?

[23:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
though the "world of imagination" sounds like a great place to be

[23:57:03.0000] <drclue>
The further IE falls behind , the better

[23:57:04.0000] <hsivonen>
"As of Windows Internet Explorer 7, the DATAFORMATAS attribute is no longer supported for the input type=button object."

[23:57:05.0000] <hsivonen>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533706%28VS.85%29.aspx

[23:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I was wrong about the world of imagination

[23:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I did not realize these were from the world of old IE versions

[23:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
a much less invitingly-named world

[23:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: the schema currently allows <embed datafld> so i think it would give the desired result to add these as assertions and not change the schema

[23:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess that would be doable

[00:00:00.0000] <drclue>
Microsoft has so many contractual reasons to lag behind I could not even write them in a single night. The only  way out is to be so far ahad

[00:00:01.0000] <drclue>
as to blow them off the screen

[00:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if MS is still making long-term promises about IE8 to BigCos

[00:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: but datafld is a global attribute, so not changing the schema would mean that if datafld were used on an element other than embed, two error messages would be emitted (the generic one from jing, plus the assertions one)

[00:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: the assertion could be <embed>-specific

[00:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[00:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: No, I don't I tend to avoid graph theory at all costs.

[00:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me used canvas for the first time last night

[00:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: but then <p datafld> would give the jing message?

[00:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
interesting.. Mac OSX update seems to have removed my JDK install

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: yeah

[00:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me still isn't sure he got his internal representation of the hexagonal grid right

[00:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: then maybe it's not worthwhile to special-case embed; most people who use datafld probably use it on div or so anyway

[00:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but wouldn't it be relatively easy to add these as global attributes in the schema and then have a global assertion?

[00:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: it's easy to add them to the schema, it's just that currently all the obsolete attributes are in a legacy.rnc file that's not in the "valid" schema repository but is copied over by the build

[00:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
in consideration of the case of uses of the schema outside of v.nu

[00:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so the legacy.rnc file is just something that v.nu uses internally

[00:44:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but the embed.attrs.other pattern is not in the legacy file

[00:44:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's part of the valid schema

[00:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and the particular nature of the embed.attrs.other pattern is such that there's no way to just append attribute names to in in the legacy file

[00:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the legacy file would need to basically completely refine it in whole

[00:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and it's a long list of attribute names

[00:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and maintaining it in two different places would be error-prone

[00:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i see

[00:48:02.0000] <zcorpan>
/me suggests doing whatever is simplest :)

[00:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I just noticed that Safari on my system has tabs under the location bar

[00:48:04.0000] <hsivonen>
didn't some beta at least have tabs in the title bar?

[00:48:05.0000] <jgraham>
/me discovers that pypy is also using html5lib as a benchmark (I guess they inherited it from Unladen Swallow)

[00:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: safari 4 beta had them in the title bar but safari 4 final changed it back, i think

[00:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I see. that explains it.

[00:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.xqsharp.com/xqsharp/samples/raytracer/index.htm

[00:49:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: We ought to get serializer test there too

[00:49:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Haven't tried benchmarking that yet, though

[00:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: on OSX, do you use the macports openjdk, or something else?

[00:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I use Apple's JDK6

[00:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I did a "port install openjdk6" and it seems to be installing all kind of X11 dependencies for some reason

[00:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[00:52:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: We hould build some better benchmarks in general, I guess

[00:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so what do you set your JAVA_HOME to?

[00:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: we had titlebar tabs for a while -  it did not end up well-loved

[00:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: /Library/Java/Home

[00:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok, thanks

[01:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: if you're going to research [ in doctype any more, maybe you should look for any garbage there

[01:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: it's possible people use things like <!doctype html public "" !> and expect a certain mode

[01:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I have very little sympathy for authors who aren't using a doctype from http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/#choosing and are trying to be clever with SGMLisms

[01:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't really understand the point of that kind of clever sgmlism

[01:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if you use an SGML internal subset to violate conformance rules, then doesn't that render the conformance result from the validator meaningless?

[01:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: the point is that you want to use custom attributes and you want a validator say they are valid

[01:55:03.0000] <hsivonen>
it's the data-* use case

[01:55:04.0000] <othermaciej>
right but you're basically ordering the validator to lie to you

[01:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: you might still want to catch typos even if you don't want the validator to complain about dojoFoo

[01:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but using the internal subset is an even worse idea than using a home-grown public id

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or system id, rather

[02:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: http://philip.html5.org/data/doctypes.html#%3c%21doctype_html_public_%22-%2f%2fw3c%2f%2fdtd_xhtml_1.0_transitional%2f%2fen%22_system_%22http%3a%2f%2fwww.w3.org%2ftr%2fxhtml1%2fdtd%2fxhtml1-transitional.dtd%22%2f%3e

[02:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
etc

[02:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
Those seem like the most common garbages

[02:11:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: what kind of PC did you order?

[02:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: Shuttle sx58h7, i7 950, Intel SSD drive, 6 GB RAM (I wanted more but the supply chain sucks), passive-cooled nvidia GPU

[02:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wow

[02:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: hoping to run hg, make and gcc faster

[02:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
well that outta do it I guess

[02:14:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: wow in what sense?

[02:14:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems like a lot of spec

[02:14:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I had been thinking you meant a new laptop

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's ridiculously hard to get a small enclosure for i7

[02:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and the supply situation for the barebone, for RAM and for passive-cooled nvidia GPUs are also ridiculously bad

[02:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
s/are/is/

[02:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess if you're doing a lot of serious merging and building, the machine performance can make a significant difference

[02:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, the alternative fix would be making C++ work with incremental builds like Java

[02:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but that's not gonna happen

[02:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it's crazy to have to have faster hardware because of the C preprocessor and the undecidability of C++ syntax

[02:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
everything except maybe the thermal characteristics of i7 950 would fit in a smaller box. It's pretty annoying that smaller boxes aren't available

[02:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: looking at the retail price for it, I see it's pretty reasonable

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess the vendors assume that anyone who wants a fast CPU has to want multiple drive bays and card slots and a dedicated GPU instead of an integrated one

[02:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I suppose needs of average users in their market are bit different than needs of code developers

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's basically Atom for non-gamers and huge hardware eating a lot of watts for gamers

[02:26:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: until atom is multicore, and the cpu plus the rest of the hardware doesn't choke on fullscreen flash, then atom is not it

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: atom is dualcore

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't recall if I tested full-screen flash on my grandfather Atom box, but Google Earth and Compiz worked great

[02:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
using the integrated Intel GPU

[02:28:02.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: that depends on which particular atom chip is the flavor of the day

[02:28:03.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: flash is a pig

[02:28:04.0000] <virtuelv>
and you can quote me on that

[02:28:05.0000] <hsivonen>
s/grandfather/grandfather's/

[02:29:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I mean, Grooveshark, nice as it is, makes my laptopcore2 cpu speed up

[02:29:01.0000] <virtuelv>
s/pco/p's co/

[02:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: clearly, Grooveshark should use HTML5 and Vorbis

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
once I get the new box, I was thinking of not installing Flash and see how far I can go without it

[02:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
though maybe I have to have Flash to get representative performance metrics

[02:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
from Firefox that is

[02:33:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: not all of youtube's content seems to be available in html5 video

[02:33:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(or I haven't been able to make it work, at least)

[02:33:02.0000] <virtuelv>
and there's the entire needing x264-thing

[02:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: thanks

[02:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me doesn't have time to analyze today

[02:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen, zcorpan - well, after a little more poking around and thanks to finding wakaba_'s http://suika.fam.cx/~wakaba/wiki/sw/n/dataformatas page, I notice that the dataformatas, etc., attributes were never global in HTML4 anyway

[02:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the reserved PE was only referenced by span, div, input, select, textarea, button, table, object

[02:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so it seems the spec should list those explicitly instead of stating "...on any element"

[02:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: file a spec bug :)

[02:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I'll just reopen bug 9000

[02:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
btw for people giving talks on html5, i can recommend picking one subject and diving in instead of trying to cover everything in html5

[02:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
my talk on html5 video felt a lot more useful than my previous talks on html5 because i didn't have to grossly cut corners

[02:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe i should convert the talk to an article (in english)

[03:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Or was it just a better talk because you didn't have to speak a strange, weird, language like English?

[03:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
an updated PER draft of XHTML 1.1 was published last week

[03:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2010/PER-xhtml-modularization-20100213/

[03:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there's a diff-marked version at http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2010/PER-xhtml-modularization-20100213/xhtml-modularization-diff.html

[03:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, produced by a WG that doesn't exist.

[03:23:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Odd.

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
WGs with unfinished business hang around as ghosts

[03:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the group remains in existence only until this final set of deliverables get published

[03:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
On grounds that everything must become a REC or NOTE?

[03:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: yeah, basically

[03:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and on grounds that there apparently are some organizations that want a final XHTML 1.1 Rec

[03:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so, anyway, given that it is going to be published, it would nice to make sure there's nothing in it still that's broken

[03:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I would appreciate it if anybody with interest/time could check and let me know if you find any problems

[03:27:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
by beginning of next week

[03:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
they fixed the longstanding usemap datatype problem

[03:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
The http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1172653243&count=1 one?

[03:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: yeah

[03:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
another they fixed was the problem that the XHTML 1.1 DTD restricted the value of class to NMTOKENS, which meant class="" was not valid in XHTML 1.1 (though it is in HTML4 and XHTML1.0

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
good thing the WHATWG doesn't have the kind of Process that makes a datatype fix to one attribute take a decade

[03:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, it was a decade of non-fixing it

[03:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and probably 10 minutes of actually fixing it 

[03:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2010/PER-xhtml-modularization-20100213/abstract_modules.html#s_commonatts

[03:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
"class (NMTOKENS)"

[03:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like the forgot to change that one

[03:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
*they

[03:33:00.0000] <annevk>
why does XHTML 1.1 matter?

[03:33:01.0000] <annevk>
it's obsolete by XHTML5, no?

[03:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`:  thanks for catching it, I'll pass it on

[03:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: it matters because that spec is going to be published, and this is the last opportunity to get it while there's an actual group chartered to make changes to it

[03:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
*to get it fixed

[03:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: apparently the epub thing that Apple and Adobe use depends on XHTML 1.1 specifically

[03:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not 1.0 

[03:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
not 5

[03:35:03.0000] <annevk>
i don't see how that matters, nobody is going to conform to XHTML 1.1

[03:35:04.0000] <Philip`>
(Changing to xs:string seems to do a lot more than merely allowing an empty value, since it removes the restrictions that tokens must be Names)

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: see http://blog.threepress.org/2009/11/28/what-i-would-change-about-epu/

[03:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I don't expect anyone to make an XHTML 1.1 -compliant ebook reader

[03:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
has it been revealed if the reader on iPad is based on WebKit or has a simpler CSSless epub-specific different engine?

[03:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or just WebKit without CSS

[03:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: that's the original datatype the attribute had in HTML4 and XHTML 1.0 anyway, I think

[03:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or equivalent of it

[03:38:01.0000] <annevk>
at some point all the old HTML specs should just be marked as obsolete

[03:38:02.0000] <annevk>
similarly to how RFCs are marked obsolete at some point

[03:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Most HTML5 drafts are obsolete within a few hours of publication, so maybe they should all be marked as obsolete by default

[03:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Is there any way to detect clicks in a certain bit of a canvas

[03:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[03:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Use onclick, then write some scripts to test the position

[03:40:02.0000] <gsnedders>
OK, so that's the only way

[03:40:03.0000] <Philip`>
potentially using isPointInPath to help

[03:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If I have a hex grid, how can I tell which hex it has hit? Any idea of what the easiest way to do that is/

[03:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
Loop through each grid tile, check whether the point is inside its hexagon or not

[03:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That seems awfully slow

[03:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
(which is like six dot products per tile)

[03:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
(or an isPointInPath which isn't much faster)

[03:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It seems like there should be some constant time way of doing it

[03:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: The dot product? How does that work?

[03:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well sure if you literally just have a grid you can calculate which hexagon you are in with some formula

[03:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
But you said "easiest"

[03:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
For constant time, I guess you could calculate x mod hex-width, y mod hex-height, and then do a few line comparisons to work out which relative tile it's in

[03:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
s/easiest/easiest but not gratutiously expensive/

[03:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
and then add that to floor(x / hex-width) etc

[03:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
or something along those lines

[03:46:03.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article747.asp#MOUSE

[03:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If the point is outside the hexagon, then there's a side of the hexagon which you could extend to infinity and the point would be on the outside of that line

[03:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
and you can detect whether a point is outside by doing a dot-product with the perpendicular and checking the sign, or something equivalent

[03:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
so you just do that for each side

[03:47:03.0000] <Philip`>
and if it's not outside any side, it must be inside the shape

[03:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Should work for any convex shape, I believe)

[03:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me will someday learn maths

[03:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: (the concept of being "outside a line" doesn't make much sense)

[03:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
(on its own)

[03:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: "On the opposite side of the line to the center of the shape which we are considering"

[03:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Anyway, probably quickest to wrap the mouse coordinates to the smallest rectangular tiling region (which won't be the size I said, because I was stupid) and just do half a dozen line comparisons in there

[03:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
...like that gamedev.net thing except use maths instead of bitmaps to determine the region

[03:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
(By "half a dozen" I think I mean "five")

[03:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html-editor/2010JanMar/0002.html

[03:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Thanks

[03:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you (or anybody else) find other problems, probably best to post comments to www-html-editor, and either Cc or forward a copy to me

[03:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Presumably it's too late to address any real problems, so only trivial things are useful?

[04:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
no, definitely not too late to address any real problems

[04:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anything is fair game

[04:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
Like "processing requirements are not specified for anything"?

[04:06:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: ↑

[04:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[04:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that might be worth sending a comment to www-html-editor at least

[04:07:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
to have it on the record

[04:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I can make a personal list of comments to pass on

[04:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but yeah, that's not a deficiency that's likely to get resolved

[04:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
I can't imagine there'd be any practical value in suggesting "the spec should be rewritten to be like HTML5"

[04:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there might be some value in seeing what kind of response it would elicit

[04:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm not sure that value would qualify as practical

[04:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Probably not a useful use of anyone's time, then :-)

[04:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
(As a specific example, saying usemap is a URIREF doesn't answer questions like what happens with <img usemap="#%"/><map name="%"/><map id="%"/><map name="%"/>)

[04:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but I think people who care about that don't care about XHTML 1.1, and people who care about XHTML 1.1 don't care about that)

[04:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
(so everyone can be happy)

[04:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: yeah, seriously, that's probably an accurate way of describing the situation

[04:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I don't even care enough to comment that a comment in the DTD still refers to "a usemap IDREF")

[04:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me tries to decide if he needs to care enough to notice Philip`'s non-comment

[04:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
All specs ought to have a built-in bug reporting feature similar to the HTML5 one, so that complaining via a bug report is no harder than complaining via IRC

[04:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wonder how much work it is to port that feature to other documents

[04:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I could add it to all the various dev.w3.org/html5 drafts at least

[04:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
Perhaps the hardest part is convincing people that it could possibly work

[04:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
just adding it first and having it working would do a pretty good job of that

[04:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wow, the marriage of TeX and Javascript

[04:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
one of the lesse-known William Blake works

[04:26:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but also now this:

[04:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://ajaxian.com/archives/tex-line-breaking-algorithm-in-javascript

[04:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ouch. it's even more alarming that text layout is being worked around in canvas than that lack of flexbox is.

[04:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[04:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
lacking one right solution is a great way to generate lots of wrong solutions

[04:30:00.0000] <annevk>
i guess it is inevitable that people will build browsers on top of browsers

[04:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's probably what will be the final trigger that brings us into the Singularity

[04:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me discovers that there is a thrash-metal band called "Detente" and wonders if they actually know or care what they word means and considers what worse names they could have chosen

[04:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe "Gentle Breeze" or "Kumbaya"

[04:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
not that "detente" is dumb word absolutely

[04:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's actually a really good word, with some relevance to all kinds of group/social interactions

[04:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but thrash metal is not high on the list of those

[04:40:01.0000] <annevk>
ARIA could really use some ARIA5 treatment

[04:41:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is reviewing the responses to his comments

[04:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I dream of a future where groups accept external feedback so it isn't necessary to "fix" their work afterwards

[04:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder when they'll get to my comments

[04:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I did send mail about the stray remaining usemap-IDREF comment - http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html-editor/2010JanMar/0003.html

[04:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm happy to collect and pass on any further comments

[04:45:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, not "happy", exactly

[04:45:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
but will do it nonetheless

[04:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and/or to follow up on any outstanding comments

[04:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh wow, cssquirrel linked Hixie's bible

[04:48:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I thought he was smarter than that

[04:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"outstanding" in this case meaning "so far, ignored or otherwise not adequately responded to" rather than as in, "man that was some outstanding kush"

[04:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: that is clearly a trick to fool people into thinking that he has no sense of irony

[04:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and then if somebody points that out to him, he can create an ironic T-shirt mocking somebody's lack of ability to recognize his clever feigning of lack of a sense of irony

[04:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But someone did point it out

[04:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh, there you go

[04:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I anticipate a T-shirt will be forthcoming real soon

[04:52:02.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, they should've already

[04:52:03.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, if they didn't something went wrong

[04:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: mine might have been after whenever their last call was

[04:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: what annevk said

[04:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Did CSSquirrel remove the comments written by someone claiming to be Larry Masinter?

[04:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pfwg-comments/2010JanMar/0038.html

[04:53:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[04:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I do not see a response

[04:54:01.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, he's mostly doing cheap shots

[04:54:02.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, though they're funny sometimes, admittedly

[04:54:03.0000] <Dashiva>
It also seems nobody has called Larry out for lying about the telcon

[04:54:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I thought you guys were talking about XHTML 1.1 comments

[04:54:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
nm

[04:54:06.0000] <Dashiva>
He says there never was a formal objection, but on the telcon he was explicitly asked about a FO twice

[04:54:07.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, apparently they're going into LC again

[04:55:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, so I guess we can email reminders then

[04:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I propose we try to avoid using words like "lying"

[04:55:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Should we use words like "intentionally avoiding telling the truth" instead?

[04:55:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and instead use more words like "gentle breeze", kubaya, and detente

[04:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I thought the first HTML5 CSSquirrel was funny but since then, the comics haven't really been funny

[04:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I have not seen a message by Larry that claimed to be a Formal Objection

[04:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
at least, regarding this topic

[04:56:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Not in the message itself

[04:56:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: the minutes say "<masinter> do I need to repeat objections?"

[04:56:05.0000] <Dashiva>
And then paulc: the co-chairs are aware of the formal objection

[04:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: which to me means no scribe misheard Larry but he wrote the word "objections" himself

[04:57:01.0000] <Dashiva>
He doesn't bother to correct that

[04:57:02.0000] <annevk>
http://www.cssquirrel.com/comic/?comic=06 is okay, though not about HTML5

[04:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
other people did call it a Formal Objection, and he did not correct the record right away

[04:57:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: granted, without the word "formal"

[04:57:05.0000] <Dashiva>
"paulc: plh and larry, can you post the FO on the public-html list and the affects on the plans?"

[04:57:06.0000] <annevk>
anyway, I sort of stopped following it because his blog is just a few one-liners pulled together without even trying to consider both sides

[04:57:07.0000] <Dashiva>
If he didn't think it was a FO, how could he agree to post a FO?

[05:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. reading http://www.cssquirrel.com/comic/?comic=13 , it's not as funny as I thought it was

[05:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Larry did call his comment an objection initially, and he didn't correct others who called it a Formal Objection

[05:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
later he said it was not formal

[05:04:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Who is the other person in the final panel?

[05:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
now I think he doesn't even want to call it an objection

[05:04:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Has he tried to justify posting it on a private list yet?

[05:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe he implied that my suggestion to avoid lengthy scope discussions on public-html led to his choices of where to post

[05:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
honestly, I no longer care what Larry did or why

[05:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: when I read your suggestion, I thought you meant www-archive

[05:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: maybe that's worth saying next time

[05:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am just waiting for the w3c team to actually get us an answer from Tim, since they insist on treating Adobe's non-Formal non-Objection as a matter that must be handled by the Director

[05:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: he did initially post to www-archive

[05:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
he also asked for a ruling from the Chairs and the Team, as I suggested he should if he didn't want to leave it up to the WG

[05:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I figured after that his logical next step, based on my suggestion, would be to prepare a Formal Objection against the WG Decision to publish, should such a decision be forthcoming

[05:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So if you don't agree with something, you can skip all the existing processes and just say "I want a direct ruling here"

[05:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not certain of the sincerity of Larry's claim (a week after the fact) that he was just trying to follow my directions

[05:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I thought there was already a publicized ruling on canvas

[05:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
my understanding is that you can bypass the Formal Objection process and instead make an Appeal of a Chair's Decision, but only if you feel you are not getting due process

[05:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I thought there was already a publicized ruling on canvas too, but Larry apparently was not convinced that it applied to a separate draft of only the canvas API

[05:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
note also that the Director has to approve FPWD so there is also effectively a published ruling on HTML+RDFa

[05:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: purely hypothetically speaking, yes

[05:10:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/policies.html#WGAppeals

[05:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: It seems quite non-hypothetical since it happens right now

[05:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, well, I'm referring to the hypothetical case

[05:11:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
"The Team Contact must inform the Director when a group participant has raised concerns about due process."

[05:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: is that really supposed to apply even when you don't have "concerns about due process"?

[05:11:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
would be what would happen in that case

[05:11:05.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: so an "appeal" doesn't need to be public? only known to the Director and Team Contact?

[05:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Besides, how can you claim you're not getting due process if you haven't even tried following the process?

[05:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: that particular sentence does not mention "appeal"

[05:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I didn't see a message where Larry raised a concern about due process, he just disagreed with a decision, so I would have expected the correct escalation path to be a Formal Objection

[05:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: in any given case, I would think it will always be arguable about what constitutes legitimate "concerns about due process"

[05:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it is unclear to me at this point when one should raise a Formal Objection and when one should raise an Appeal of a Chair's Decision

[05:13:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me finds recent goings on in the HTMLWG distressingly close to the experiences of friends who teach teenagers for a living

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: the section about appeals doesn't mention "appeal" using that word at all (except when mentioning that AC appeals are yet separate)

[05:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: sure - I would just expect the person to at least nominally say "I have concerns about due process because X"

[05:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, the title of that section is not ideal

[05:15:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ↑

[05:15:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: yeah, ideally

[05:15:04.0000] <othermaciej>
as opposed to "I disagree with decision Y for reason Z"

[05:15:05.0000] <othermaciej>
disagreeing with a decision is not in itself a concern about due process

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: in what sense?

[05:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be nice if the Team would clarify when it is appropriate to use a Formal Objection vs. an Appeal of a Chair's Decision, whether the latter category in fact exists, and whether there are any other kinds of appeals that can apply to decisions in a Working Group

[05:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
because I thought I understood it from reading the Process document but clearly I don't

[05:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me taught in a high school for 3 years and can see some relevance in jgraham's allusion

[05:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I suppose the Director can clarify that

[05:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the reason I ask is because the appeal to a Team Contact bypasses the chairs and is guarateed to get to the Director right away instead of by the next transition request, so if an Appeal is allowed any time you disagree, why would anyone choose to raise a Formal Objection instead?

[05:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Bunch of teenagers…

[05:18:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe the document was written without considering people gaming the system

[05:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I assumed the point of the process where you bypass the chairs was for the case where you think the chairs are not acting in good faith and thus failing to give you due process

[05:18:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej:  true that would not be a path that it would be prudent to encourage going forward

[05:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"In order to vote to resolve a substantive issue, an individual MUST be a group participant in Good Standing."

[05:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think circumstances now and then end up such that the Director gets involved, even if the letter of the process doc would not seem to absolutely require it at that point

[05:20:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Doesn't that make htmlwg's exception for IEs invalid?

[05:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: a possibly good outcome of this particular case might be that it gives some greater clarification about what the Director expects should happen the next time a case like this might come up

[05:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: that would be good, yes

[05:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me tries to concentrate on sentiments like "look for the silver lining" and communal songs like kumbaya, in contrast with, say, "mutual assured destruction"

[05:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone know how to get the amount of memory used by a process in Java?

[05:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: top(1) ?

[05:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: And then parse it? That seems hidious

[05:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And so system dependent

[05:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, java VMs are system dependent

[05:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, but there's not even anything that will work on all POSIX systems here

[05:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
they only appear system independent to the applications they run

[05:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
stackoverflow says http://support.hyperic.com/display/SIGAR/Home

[06:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
krijnh: How about "next day" and "previous day" links at the bottom of the logs?

[06:00:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, do you know if Safari made the withCredentials thing affect same-origin requests?

[06:01:00.0000] <annevk>
per spec that's not supposed to work, but maybe we should allow it...

[06:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone have a test case that shows if Flash gets the attributes of <embed> in the "right" order?

[06:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
krijnh: Also, I'm getting only parts of the page most times. The content just stops.

[06:06:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, didn't hixie have tests for that?

[06:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: thanks. I'll look for it on Hixie's site

[06:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me fails to find a test under http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/

[06:10:00.0000] <annevk>
cannot see it either now, but hixie did test attribute order for plugins somehow

[07:02:00.0000] <asmodai>
I love what people come up with:

[07:03:00.0000] <asmodai>
http://www.bramstein.com/projects/typeset/

[07:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I rather wish browser didn't compete on perf so much on desktop and dared to implement more expensive line breaking algorithms

[07:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or at least did it for justified text

[07:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
justified text probably doesn't show up of perf benchmarks too much

[07:09:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: I'm sure we can push some people's buttons to add that ;)

[07:09:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's pretty cool.  We need more effort on good typography.

[07:10:00.0000] <asmodai>
TabAtkins: Agreed.

[07:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(that is, I appreciate competition on perf as long as rendering beauty isn't stifled by perf concern)

[07:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean, how often do perf tests measure justified text anyway?  I would *love* to see this justification algorithm in.  I implement justified text generally across my company's site, but it has less-than-pretty effects in some places.

[07:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Which in the case of justified text, it normally is

[07:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also, the quality of that shape-filling justification is just wonderful.

[07:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me would love to see the (La?)TeX hyphenation algorithm in browsers, too

[07:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think "We make the web more beautiful" could be a successful advertising point to counter perf losses.

[07:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the #1 beauty problem is Windows font rasterization though

[07:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
This is true.

[07:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and the Ubuntu/Fedora FreeType defaults, too

[07:14:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: How's that? I don't know that background.

[07:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: Windows XP doesn't have even ClearType on by default

[07:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: and ClearType is very ugly compared to Quartz or FreeType

[07:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
worse, the Windows rasterizers use legacy TrueType hinting

[07:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
designed for low-res non-AA rasterization

[07:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
which has the side effect that fonts that aren't hinted with Windows in mind can look nice on Mac and Linux but totally, totally horrible on Windows

[07:17:00.0000] <asmodai>
Mmm, wonder if that's still the case on 7

[07:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it was on 7 beta

[07:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I doubt they've changed the rasterizer since then

[07:20:00.0000] <asmodai>
Indeed doubtful.

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: /proc/$PID/status gives easier-to-parse memory stats, on Linux

[07:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Easier than top)

[07:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Doesn't seem to make much sense to have a system-independent memory usage thing, because the concept of "memory usage" is itself system-dependent

[07:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: very short page for you to review if you have a couple minutes

[07:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://pastebin.ca/1802736

[07:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
this is pretty much the same as the earlier page-template patch

[07:24:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it just does the same for the form part of the page

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: assuming the page emitter works, I trust this does the same thing for another file

[07:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[07:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, do you think it would make sense to change the build so that it does actually generate the Java code from the (default/existing) page templates? 

[07:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is, have the SaxCompiler actually generate the validator/src/nu/validator/servlet/PageEmitter.java file as part of the build

[07:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
from the default validator/xml-src/PageEmitter.xml file

[07:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: that would be ok as long as the generated file goes into the current location for convenient access from Eclipse

[07:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, yeah, it would definitely go in the same location

[07:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will write up a patch for it later

[09:11:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, guess what, guys.

[09:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
What?

[09:12:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The website works so well in HTML5 that we're going to move the entire product to HTML5.

[09:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hah, awesome!

[09:12:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yea ... kinda nervous about that one, though I pushed this.

[09:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What HTML5 features did you use here?

[09:19:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
On our website?

[09:20:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Mostly structural to build the website as an outline, but we're also using <video> with a graceful flash fallback.

[09:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And this really gives you serious concrete benefits?  I'm a big fan of HTML5, but it's only marginally useful so far as far as I can tell.

[09:23:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, it's the way the web is going, and nobody else is seriously going for it, so we figure it worked so well for the website

[09:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like, I wouldn't use <video> with Flash fallback except as opt-in, since it doesn't support things like fullscreen (except in FF3.6) . . . I'd make it opt-in and/or use Flash with <video> fallback.

[09:23:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
bam, let's do it.

[09:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've been trying to get Wikipedia to switch, but it's backlogged way too much on code review, so it hasn't deployed my new less-broken HTML5-enabling code yet.  :(

[09:23:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, marginally is the name of the game

[09:23:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
HTML5 elements in use in the core product would be, hgroup, nav, section, article

[09:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, true.

[09:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You don't have an atomic HTML5 vs not

[09:24:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
probably header and footer as well, though I'm still not sure how the W3C or WHATWG wants us to use them.

[09:24:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Just a large set of tiny changes that mesh together

[09:24:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
JonathanNeal, so you have the JS hack for IE?

[09:24:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yes.

[09:24:06.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And we haven't received a single complaint about it.

[09:25:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And traffic is very high on our site from the enterprise end, who would be the ones on the lowest end machines.

[09:25:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
No complaints about not being able to see the videos either, in fact, only a few compliments from developers who noticed the <video> implementation.

[09:25:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
For those who don't know what we did, they didn't even notice.

[09:27:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Oi, just feel like I'm playing with the fetus of fire.

[09:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This reminds me, I have to re-add IE5.0 and 5.5 CSS support to MediaWiki.  Someone gratuitously removed it.

[09:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Do you really have to?

[09:29:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, what were the benefits of adding it back in?

[09:29:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And what were the benefits of taking it out?

[09:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
The only benefit of taking it out is two lines saved in the <head>.

[09:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The benefit of adding it back in is tens of thousands of IE5 users will still be able to read Wikipedia.

[09:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably hundreds of thousands.

[09:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, well, at least if you assume they view at about the same rate as other users.

[09:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm guessing you don't pay heed to the moral argument of not aiding and abetting entrenchment of outdated browsers :)

[09:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, Wikimedia's goal is to make knowledge freely available to everyone.  Not only to people who use up-to-date browsers.

[09:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
*Personally*, well, you can look at the source code of http://aryeh.name/ to see my attitude there.  :P

[09:32:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Tens of thousands of IE5 users?

[09:32:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Are you sure you're not talking about IE6?

[09:33:00.0000] <daedb_>
IE6 still has many millions of users.

[09:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm talking about IE5, on Wikipedia.

[09:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikipedia has hundreds of millions of users.

[09:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE5 is not down to 0.01% market share yet.

[09:34:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Sure, and I honestly didn't know tens of thousands of them (I understand it's a small percentage) were still using IE5.

[09:34:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
You think IE5 is all the way down to 0.01%?

[09:35:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I thought it wasn't even listed anymore.

[09:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The statistic that was given as justification for the removal was 0.3%, which would be hundreds of thousands of users.

[09:36:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yea, I can understand that.

[09:36:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
You are correct, not that you needed me to say that.

[09:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportClients.htm

[09:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
MSIE 5.5 4,982 0.11%

[09:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
MSIE 5.0 932 0.02%

[09:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
MSIE 5.01 902 0.02%

[09:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, you were closer to correct.

[09:37:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Still thousands of hits, but possibly only hundreds of users.

[09:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, wait, that's times a thousand.

[09:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So about 5,000,000 hits from IE5.5.

[09:38:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Did the removal of the two lines kill IE5.5 though?

[09:38:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I thought IE5.5 was its own beast.

[09:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
One line was for IE5, one was for IE5.5.

[09:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how many of those are bots pretending to be ie

[09:39:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If you could cross-reference requests to pages with requests to style sheets...

[09:39:03.0000] <karlcow>
http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/201002/msg00064.html

[09:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
a couple of years ago I was looking at my logs and concluded most ie5 requests weren't from browsers

[09:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, that's an idea, we could look at the stats for how often those particular stylesheets were requested.

[09:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Bots wouldn't request stylesheets either.

[09:40:03.0000] <Dashiva>
GranParadiso was the FF 3.0 alpha, wasn't it?

[09:41:00.0000] <karlcow>
AryehGregor: it's not done every month?

[09:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
karlcow, I dunno, I don't see newer data.

[09:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: Ubuntu backports use the code names for browsers that are built from the same codebase as firefox

[09:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
karlcow: Is that list open to post to?  I can provide reasoning for why, frex, data urls were rejected as a solution.

[09:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Isn't that IceWeasel etc?

[09:43:01.0000] <karlcow>
TabAtkins: I guess the list xml-dev has a moderator

[09:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: firefox-3.5 in jaunty-backport gives you a browser called Namaroka

[09:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: that's debian

[09:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Namaroka is supposed to be 3.6

[09:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oops sorry. I meant Shiretoko

[09:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But I get your point

[09:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me lives on the trunk

[09:45:02.0000] <karlcow>
/me wonders how many people are using Safari with VoiceOver, or jaws with IE. not visible in the stats, I guess

[09:56:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I noticed that the WHATWG example for HTML5 shows <nav><h2>Navigation</h2> ... </nav> without an <h1>

[09:56:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Why is that?

[09:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
The absolute values of the numbers are meaningless

[09:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Only relative values matter)

[09:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
So I guess the example is attempting to demonstrate that it's valid to do that

[09:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also, using lower numbers sometimes can be helpful for no-CSS display in legacy browsers.

[09:58:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So <h1> or <h2> would have been fine, it's completely arbitrary unless relative to another <h*>

[10:00:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I've read somewhere that <hgroup> is a specialised form of <header>, but that would not appear true.

[10:00:01.0000] <Dashiva>
<hgroup> is for grouping headers and subheaders

[10:00:02.0000] <Dashiva>
So they aren't interpreted as separate headings

[10:00:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, it's just a way to group multiple <hn> into a single heading, so it won't mess up the outline.

[10:01:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Right, that's what I thought.

[10:01:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's how we're using them.

[10:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Okay guys, let me share my "strategy" for HTML5 in our product.

[10:10:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I can pastie it, actually.

[10:11:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://pastie.org/833062

[10:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why bother with <html>, <head>, <body>?

[10:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
They're implicit.

[10:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You don't need the /> in the meta, <meta charset="UTF-8"> will work fine.

[10:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, why <header id="header">?  What's the id needed for?

[10:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Likewise <nav id="navigation">, etc.

[10:14:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Part of the point of those elements is so you don't need those id's.

[10:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You also have some div wrappers of unclear purpose -- do you need those for styling?

[10:15:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, yes the div wrappers are there for style guys to muck around with the content.

[10:16:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
the IDs are important because they target a particular singular instance versus a generic element which can exist elsewhere in the site.

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Calling them something like id="main-header" might help disambiguate them, and stop people asking why that header is header and other headers aren't header

[10:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or you could put a class or id on the body element and use that.

[10:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you'd only need one class instead of lots of id's.

[10:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or, better yet, just stick with no id's or classes at all until you actually need them.  That's what I've done so far for my personal site, although admittedly it only has a few pages.

[10:18:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, I don't see how that would be easier AryehGregor, I'd still end up having .someBodyClassName > div > header or something to specifically target those elements, that's what IDs and classnames are for.

[10:18:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've used "body > header" to target my top-level stuff.

[10:18:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Me too.

[10:18:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's what selectors are for.

[10:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Especially if you don't need IE support, then you barely need classes/ids at all.

[10:19:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We'll need IE support.

[10:19:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Also, it's easier for a web designer to target an ID than moving through selectors.

[10:19:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, IE6 is the problem there.  Doesen't support child selectors.

[10:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So an #id helps there.

[10:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah.  Sigh.

[10:20:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, not to mention that it's easier to develop on.

[10:21:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
id is implicit that it is unique to the page, the only instance, therefore #header and #footer mean "The ONE header" and "The ONE footer"

[10:41:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Okay updated @ http://pastie.org/833113

[11:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the spec really ought to include an explicit description of the rationale/background behind the srcdoc attribute

[11:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Even though it doesn't describe rationale/background for any other feature?

[11:44:00.0000] <karlcow>

>This is an implementation of the Knuth and Plass line breaking algorithm using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas element. The goal of this implementation is to optimally set justified text in the new HTML5 canvas element, and ultimately provide a library for various line breaking algorithms in JavaScript.

[11:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, neat, Opera is releasing something as open-source.

[11:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: What something?

[11:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't follow enough blogs and/or news sites

[11:56:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/opera-dragonfly-open-for-business

[11:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me only follows Slashdot, which is enough to get most of the notable tech news

[11:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ooh, Mercurial

[11:58:00.0000] <karlcow>
DragonFly has always been under BSD licence.

[11:58:01.0000] <karlcow>
/me goes read

[11:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me no longer follows any tech news sites at all, because it takes up too much time and anything really important will be repeated on IRC

[11:59:00.0000] <karlcow>
so they put the code in a repository now. I guess that is the diff with before.

[13:04:00.0000] <tumbleweed>
howdy. I can't seem to create ElementTrees with html5lib 0.90: http://pastebin.com/m298aa482

[13:19:00.0000] <bfrantz>
is it outside the scope of html5 to establish how user agents should treat a content body when issued a 404?

[13:20:00.0000] <bfrantz>
seems like more of an http issue but thought i'd check

[13:22:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: How come this doesn't say that the default text alignment for <th> is center? http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/th.html#th

[13:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sounds like HTTP.

[13:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
GPHemsley: MikeSmithX is editor for that document

[13:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: dunno, i didn't write that document

[13:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The funny part is that it's probably grounds for a libel suit in England

[13:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not if it's true

[13:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, you need grounds for a libel suit in England these days?

[13:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's an awesome T-shirt.

[13:54:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: I don't think truth is relevant

[13:54:02.0000] <Dashiva>
As long as feelings are hurt

[13:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_defamation_law#Justification - "A claim of defamation is defeated if the defendant proves that the statement was true."

[13:57:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
right, but the burden of proof is reversed

[13:58:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
/me waits for libel prosecutors to discover Gödel's theorem

[13:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's libelous to say, KevinMarks

[14:19:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
I'd love a libel suit

[14:19:01.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
with a libel waistcoat and libel trousers

[14:24:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
haha

[14:26:00.0000] <abarth_>
othermaciej: according to http://dev.w3.org/html5/status/issue-status.html it looks like the deadline for ISSUE-4 change proposals as past

[14:27:00.0000] <deltab>
bfrantz: not if the missing resource is a stylesheet, script, image, video...

[14:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Just watched Hot Fuzz on your recommendation (a while back).  Good movie!

[14:46:00.0000] <bfrantz>
deltab: i have not explicitly tested for stylesheets, script, etc. i stumbled over an apache  configuration that implements the ErrorDocument directive to send 404s to index.xml which in turn issues a meta redirect to a script.  FF3.5, Safari 4, and Opera 10 follow the redirect where IE8 and Chrome 4 ignore it. I figured I would raise this behavior here so folks are aware of it. It may or may not be a behavior worth standardizing on.

[14:47:00.0000] <bfrantz>
all browers follow the redirect when visiting index.html directly

[14:48:00.0000] <deltab>
meta refresh, you mean?

[14:48:01.0000] <bfrantz>
yea, my bad

[14:53:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
following meta refreshes is often a preference in a browser

[14:54:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
as an author, using a meta refresh is a bit amateur

[14:58:00.0000] <bfrantz>
GarethAdams|Home: I agree, but thats not the reason i'm mentioning this. The meta refresh is just an example of the UA rendering the entity body when encountering a 404. 

[14:59:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
bfrantz: my mistake, I'm in a lot of webdev support channels, I sometimes forget I'm also in this one when flicking through

[15:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: for the websocket nonce thing... i'm trying to come up with something equally hard to predict or fake, but which can be done trivially (e.g. without implementing MD5 or using a library). What do you think of the client sending 16 bytes of noise, and the server return 8 bytes of noise consisting of the first 8 bytes from the client xored with the second 8 bytes?

[15:12:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
MikeSmithX: How come this doesn't say that the default text alignment for <th> is center? http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/th.html#th

[15:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Hmm, did I actually recommend it?

[15:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Pretty sure.

[15:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
I thought I usually just mention things without actually giving an opinion because my opinion might be wrong and that would be embarrassing

[15:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
clearly you are in fact wrong about not giving an opinion

[15:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Shouldn't have given that opinion, I guess.

[15:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: the 2008 doctype data seems a bit dated; i found that the 116 doctypes were all gone by now, and looking further at the others doesn't give much fruit either

[15:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: could you maybe do a new query for: (?i)<!doctype\s*html\s+public\s*("[^"]*"|'[^']*')\s*[^"'>]

[15:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that doesn't convey the origin at all

[15:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: or include anything that specifically indicates WebSocket and not some other protocol

[15:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the client could use a one-time pad to encrypt the request handshake, but you really want the server to decrypt and then repack what it got

[15:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: if you're basing this on abarth's concept

[15:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Do you want just a list of URLs, or also the matching excerpts?

[15:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The latter is harder because my multi-line grep program only outputs URLs)

[15:59:01.0000] <zcorpan>
urls is fine


2010-02-20
[16:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Incidentally, I believe that regexp won't work because " " matches "\s*[^"'>]"

[16:00:01.0000] <zcorpan>
oh forgot \s in there

[16:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think \s*+[^"'>] ought to work

[16:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
using Java's possessive quantifiers

[16:01:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't know what that means, but if it's equivalent then i guess it's good

[16:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
It means it'll match as much of \s as possible, and not back off

[16:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ah

[16:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
(so there will never be any whitespace left for the [...] to match)

[16:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me starts grepping

[16:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: http://philip.html5.org/data/doctype-with-bogus-after-pub-id.txt

[16:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>

Yay!  Just mounted by first NFS share.

[16:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/by/my/

[17:55:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
GPHemsley: that document doesn't say what the default text alignment is for any element

[17:56:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
MikeSmithX: Shouldn't it? I mean, it's part of the default styling...

[17:56:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
well, that's not normative even in the HTML5 spec itself

[17:56:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
And the rest is?

[17:57:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
all my doc does is this regard is attempt to provide some "typical" default display properties

[17:57:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
right

[17:57:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/th.html#th-display

[17:57:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
and that in fact seems to indicate that in Webkit, it's not centered by default

[17:57:04.0000] <MikeSmithX>
as far as I can see

[17:57:05.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh, lovely

[17:59:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
while we're on that page, why does th have two different style declarations?

[17:59:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hmm

[18:00:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
yet, in Safari, it still gets centered

[18:00:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
GPHemsley: about that, I dunno

[18:00:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
that default, BTW, goes all the way back to 3.2, AFAICT

[18:00:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
all that I do is attempt to have it copy in the relevant parts of the default Webkit UA stylesheet

[18:00:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
HTML 3.2, that is

[18:01:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
why WebKit?

[18:01:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
because its default UA stylesheet is a single file

[18:02:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
anyway, in this case, it seems like the mechanism I'm using for parsing the Webkit stylesheet has a bug

[18:02:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
because it seems to be not picking up something that it should

[18:03:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hmm, weird

[18:04:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
when I look at the computed style in Web Inspector, it doesn't seem to show anything about text alignment being center

[18:06:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
OK, it shows that text-align: center is set on it, but inherited from... somewhere

[18:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
is the empty string a valid RFC 3987 "IRI reference"?

[18:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, looking the ABNF at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987#section-2.2 it doesn't even seem to allow "#foo" as a value

[18:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I must be misreading it somehow

[19:12:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me learns that <video> content-sniffs :-(

[20:47:00.0000] <wycats>
Can you put yourself in a cache manifest?

[20:47:01.0000] <wycats>
so if an HTML page modifies its DOM, can it serialize itself and update the manifest?

[21:10:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Is there a blanket term for all form elements (e.g. input, select, etc.) that is distinct from (and cannot be confused with) "<form> elements"? (I think there is, but I can't think of it....)

[21:28:00.0000] <boblet>
aaw, drclue isn’t here?

[21:29:00.0000] <wycats>
GPHemsley: form controls?

[21:30:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
ah, maybe

[21:31:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
thanks

[21:36:00.0000] <boblet_>
don’t understand why Mac OS X can’t transition seamlessly from ethernet to wifi when ethernet is unplugged

[21:36:01.0000] <boblet_>
how hard can it be? :|

[23:02:00.0000] <wycats>
sorry for reiterating, but is it possible to replace a document ITSELF in the cache manifest?

[23:03:00.0000] <wycats>
say I have a foo.html with a cache manifest

[23:03:01.0000] <wycats>
and I want to replace foo.html after manipulating the DOM

[23:03:02.0000] <wycats>
is that possible?

[00:22:00.0000] <foolip>
jwalden: <video> does not content-sniff per spec

[00:22:01.0000] <jwalden>
foolip: not true if the MIME type of the video is application/octet-stream

[00:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Are there actually any pages out there relying on quirks/not-quirks that use the obscure SGML-isms?

[00:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Not counting new pages being written to make point

[00:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
Which obscure SGML-isms?

[00:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
Some use XML-style internal subsets, but those come after the system identifier so they don't force quirks mode in HTML5

[00:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The obscure SGML-isms that Leif is fighting for on public-html

[00:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
I would expect there's approximately zero

[00:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
(since I've seen no occurrences in half a million pages)

[00:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And if that is the case, I don't see how what browsers did before is a valid point. Seeing as a) nobody is affected retroactively and b) nobody should be using this in new pages

[00:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: indeed

o_O

[00:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
methinks that is inaccurate

[00:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I know some companies raise prices before a sale so the slash rate can seem more impressive, but that is... excessive

[00:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: It's relevant only to the extent that some pages do bogus things that happen to look a little bit like obscure SGML-isms and might care about compatibility

[00:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
and they might care about compatibility with e.g. Firefox, whose special-casing of "[" was (I guess) due to an attempt to handle internal subsets, or something like that, unless I'm completely misinterpreting its behaviour

[00:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, how many pages like that exist?

[00:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The media type registration RFC seems completely oblivious of versioned formats...

[00:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: i think i've read mozilla's rationale for its behavior of [] being something like "if there's an internal subset, we know it's not an old-era doc and the author probably knows what he's doing so let's use standards mode"

[00:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: About 0.001%

[01:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: "not an old-era doc" doesn't sound obviously true to me, since people in old eras are probably even more likely to mistakenly think that HTML is SGML

[01:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: i might be misremembering that part

[01:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1312#c62 - "   2. A DOCTYPE declaration without a DTD, i.e., <!DOCTYPE HTML>.  ... Personally I do not see the point of using Standard mode with those as opposed to quirk mode. ... Number 2 is more likely to mean HTML2 than any other version." - Hixie

[01:08:01.0000] <zcorpan>
thank god Hixie didn't get his way there

[01:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
"HTML 5 should be backwards compatible" - at least that hasn't changed

[01:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: whoa. indeed

[01:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
someone should put together embarrassing ancient bugzilla quotes from #whatwg regulars

[01:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It would show a capability to learn

[01:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That would be biased against people working on public bug trackers :P

[01:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It would just show how everyone got corrupted when they started working for browser vendors

[01:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: you may have cause and effect reversed there :-)

[01:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(assuming that you count taking the Web red pill as getting corrupted)

[01:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: how did http://www.tudakozo.hu/ROYAL-CAPS%20Kft..html end up in the list?

[01:47:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: does \s*+ cover newlines?

[01:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me first got corrupted then started working for a browser vendor

[01:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jania.pe.kr/wiki/jwiki/moin.cgi/CmmKeyProcessArea?action=DeleteUploadedFile - i wonder which file Philip` deleted

http://www.depmod.com/albums/some_great_reward/a0470.htm has lots of U+FFFDs rendered with html5 parser

[03:09:00.0000] <foolip>
jwalden: yes true, it doesn't sniff, it is hard-coded to "maybe", i.e. it will alwasys be tried (regardless of content)

[03:11:00.0000] <jwalden>
thing is, if you're given something a/o-s, there's no reason you should assume it's something more specific; if you want it to be handled a certain way, give it that content-type

[03:11:01.0000] <jwalden>
application/octet-stream means arbitrary content

[03:21:00.0000] <foolip>
so you think we should hard-code it to unsupported?

[03:22:00.0000] <foolip>
I think maybe is a more reasonable answer, is it harmful in some way?

[03:22:01.0000] <foolip>
/me is afk for a while

[03:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jwalden: the spec requires 'maybe' for application/octet-stream

[03:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: The tudakozo page said

[03:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

...except with a newline before the "http"

[03:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why his IRC client sometimes eats newlines when pasting

[03:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: \s does include newlines

[03:31:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: you there?

[03:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Blame dotbot for deleting files, not me - I never made any HTTP requests to any of these pages :-)

[03:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: ok

[03:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me really should make a program that can print the page content it's got for a given URL

[03:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
rather than grepping for '.' and then grepping the output to find lines from that URL

[03:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me goes away

[03:46:00.0000] <boblet>
is the spec annotation system login shared with anything else, or a separate thing?

[03:48:00.0000] <boblet>
never mind—thought it was connected with submit review comments form, and it isn’t

[04:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: there must be a subtle bug in how the html5 parser behaves when the decoder returns an error

[04:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's a known bug

[04:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the decoder interface isn't documented in detail

[04:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I must have read the old code badly

[04:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
does anyone here understand what Julain, Tantek, and Manu hope to achieve by generalising the profile attribute for use on all elements, and which isn't already addressed by microdata?

[04:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
I couldn't see anywhere in the the thread, or the draft, that illustrated what use cases and problems its meant to solve

[07:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: what about the decoder?

[07:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: the code that drives the decoder generates the U+FFFDs

[07:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
boblet: If you're logged in to the annotation system, and your login email address is a registered Bugzilla account, then you get CCed on bugs from the submit review comments form, I believe

[07:46:00.0000] <boblet>
Philip`: oh, so it does work how I hoped

[07:46:01.0000] <boblet>

Anyone have a link pointing towards a pro HTML5 article that lists some of the advantages of moving to HTML5.

[11:54:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
?

[12:56:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Whaddaya guys think of my start @ http://pastie.org/834549 ?

[12:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: You sending that out as a message to other people in your company or something?

[13:00:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Probably the co first, then the community.

[13:00:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Get people excited.

[13:01:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm not exactly a star blogger, so I figure it's more for a forum post :D

[13:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sounds pretty good so far, I think.

[13:02:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Cool

[13:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, you say something about CSS3 features and gradients, but I'm not seeing any gradients in your CSS.

[13:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is overly concerned with things he has worked on.

[13:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
css3 gradients?  Absolutely, all of our tabs.

[13:06:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
All of our tabs, Tab :D

[13:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
never mind, I'm dumb.  Was looking at the wrong file.

[13:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just now found the one with all the includes.  ^_^

[13:07:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
What do you mean, you worked on?

[13:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
In that case, still disappointed.  You're only doing webkit and MS gradients.  ^_^

[13:07:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Firefox gradient support comes from the section of CSS3 Images I wrote.

[13:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Your tabs would be -moz-linear-gradient(#ddd,#f0f0f0)

[13:08:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, say it ain't so!  Maybe Firefox gradients didn't exist when I wrote them.

[13:08:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Are they in now?

[13:08:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
yup, in the public 3.6

[13:09:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, I'm adding them right now, which means they'll make it onto the public site Monday.

[13:09:01.0000] <Necrathex>
that's why the -moz- and -webkit- stuff sucks

[13:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm?  No, that's why it's good.  Now that we have a solid draft, once the Images Module hits CR webkit can implement prefix-less support without breaking people who used their experiment prefixed version.

[13:11:00.0000] <Necrathex>
why would it break?

[13:11:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, will this make you happy?  background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(#DDD, #F0F0F0); background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0.0, #DDD), color-stop(1.0, #F0F0F0)); filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Gradient(GradientType=0, StartColorStr='#DDDDDD', EndColorStr='#F0F0F0');

[13:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wrote the CSS gradients spec *in response* to webkit's experiments in the space, because while it was a great idea, the syntax frankly sucked.  And now Moz has implemented experimental support for it, so if I end up still tweaking it a bit, things will be fine when they do the unprefixed version too.

[13:11:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: Yes.

[13:11:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Necrathex: Because -webkit-gradient() uses a completely different syntax from what's currently in CSS3 Images.

[13:11:05.0000] <Necrathex>
ahh

[13:11:06.0000] <Necrathex>
okay, in that case it doesn't suck :)

[13:11:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Check what JonathanNeal just posted to see how it looks.

[13:12:00.0000] <Necrathex>
what does, is that most sites that already use border-radius still don't show up in the new opera version, because it's only defined with prefix

[13:12:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, is writing this stuff your primary job or hobby?

[13:13:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And Firefox just decided to adopt it after you wrote it up?

[13:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Was a hobby until about 2 weeks ago, when Google hired me.  ^_^

[13:13:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, that's awesome, I met a guy who works on Analytics at a party the other day.

[13:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Firefox still waited until it was actually in a draft (after I'd been invited into the CSSWG and made co-editor of Images).

[13:14:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Not a geek party either, just happened to be there.  Really nice guy, said they were hiring like crazy, but Liferay treats me too well and I have to admit, I love it here through the highs and lows.

[13:14:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can thank ROC for implementing it.  He helped point out some ambiguities too.

[13:14:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, congratulations, TabAtkins

[13:14:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I love my current job too, but I just can't pass up the ability to work on specs full time.

[13:14:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thanks.  ^_^

[13:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Necrathex: Is opera doing -o-border-radius, or border-radius?

[13:16:00.0000] <Necrathex>
the latter

[13:16:01.0000] <Necrathex>
just like with opacity, iirc

[13:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then yeah, that's true.  But I believe mox and webkit are planning on dropping their vendor prefixes on border-radius too.

[13:17:01.0000] <Necrathex>
they already did for opacity, didn't they?

[13:17:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Border-radius is in a weird spot, because everyone liked it so much that it became widespread while it was still officially 'experimental'.

[13:17:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[13:17:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
('experimental' meaning 'not in a draft that's reached CR')

[13:18:00.0000] <Necrathex>
it seems opera doesn't use prefix at all for stuff that's in a spec or draft

[13:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
HTML5 is popular and "experimental" according to that definition

[13:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
hsivonen: You know I'm talking about browsers' approach to CSS specifically.  They treat other technologies differently.

[13:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: This shows up in one of your stylesheets, but has a 404: http://cdn.www.liferay.com/osb-theme/images/progress_bar/complete_gradient.png

[13:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(happened to find it when i was first looking for the gradients you mentioned)

[13:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the CSS WG seems to take the W#C document maturity stuff more seriously, but the conflict between speccing time scales and the eagerness to do early implementation applies to both HTML and CSS

[13:21:01.0000] <Necrathex>
does opera support gradients yet?

[13:22:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, huh where is that coming from?

[13:22:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'll look for it.

oh, css.jsp's, I hate those guys.

[13:22:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
They're css injected by the application.

ah, kk

[13:23:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I thought I was being so cool by adding all my boxmodel stuff to one file, but later it proved to be a big waste of time.

[13:23:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
As if I'm going to add properties to all display block elements...

[13:24:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hey, but the good news is, I think our main menu uses an image gradient, and now I can pull that out in exchange for the css3 equiv.

[13:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
hsivonen: Agreed, but CSS has a good fallback story to allow experimental naming conventions, which eases some of the early impl burden (you're at least not afraid of locking people into an early version by accident, for the most part).  HTML doesn't, shrug.

[13:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>

[13:32:05.0000] <Necrathex>
any opera people here btw? :)

[13:32:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Trying very strongly to avoid picking up new projects.

[13:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Necrathex: Several

[13:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's 9 or 10 over there, though, so they may not actually be around.

[13:34:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, you'll be working on drafts at G?

[13:34:01.0000] <Necrathex>
yea, i'm in the same timezone

[13:34:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: If everything goes as planned, yes.  Right now it's looking like I'll join up with Chrome team and be allowed to spend most of my time on spec work.

i was wondering about a pretty serious crasher i found, but i guess this isn't the place..

[13:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Got a lot of stuff in the pipeline that I want to work on.

[13:36:00.0000] <Necrathex>
made a 20 lines html page that crashes every opera version past 9.5 :S

[13:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ooh, share?  I'm curious.

[13:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's a very bizarre thing to crash on.

[13:37:03.0000] <Necrathex>
doesn't happen when i change the values, or put a doctype on it

[13:38:00.0000] <Necrathex>
so something in the quirks-mode i guess

[13:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, that means it's related to the quirks-mode rendering, then.

[13:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[13:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I figure it'll get passed on

[13:39:01.0000] <Necrathex>

Runaway memory allocation?

[13:42:00.0000] <Necrathex>

[13:42:01.0000] <Necrathex>

[13:42:02.0000] <Necrathex>
actually found it in a live website, www.enra.nl

[13:43:00.0000] <Necrathex>

What's great about putting some of these stuff in the portal is how much faster it will push adoption.

[13:43:02.0000] <TabAtkins>

With anyone, any company who uses the Portal.

[13:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>

how is one supposed to destroy an HTML5 audio elment? there is no .close() or .destroy() or anything like that when you create an Audio element via new Audio( url )

[15:34:01.0000] <btipling>
and in Chrome Audio elements are never garbage colleged, they just continue to eat up cpu even after you have no reference to them anymore

[15:34:02.0000] <btipling>
collected*

[15:54:00.0000] <btipling>
hrm

[15:54:01.0000] <btipling>
"only once a media element to which no references exist has reached a point where no further audio remains to be played for that element (e.g. because the element is paused, or because the end of the clip has been reached, or because its playbackRate is 0.0) may the element be garbage collected."

[15:54:02.0000] <btipling>
maybe I'll do all of those and then it will be garbage collected

I'm trying to use font-variant:small-caps; on a @font-face embedded font which does not have a specific small caps style. Sometimes font-variant:small-caps; seems to "fake" small caps, and on some fonts it doesn't. Should/when should I expect it to work? What alternatives do I have?

/me has always wondered how high and low directions are supposed to go in the phrase "higher-level protocol"

[02:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thought an encapsulating container was lower in the stack

[02:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, it seems like the spec should say "lower-level protocol"

[02:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: maybe at least emit a warning for documents lacking a title element?

[02:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or not?

[02:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: as far as I can tell, the spec still requires <title> for documents served over HTTP

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and neither v.nu nor the w3c validator supports the validation of email messages

[02:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so as far as I can tell, no cange to the schema is needed until srcdoc checking is implemented

[02:22:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[02:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>

[02:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

othermaciej: I have a question about the Webkit default user-agent stylesheet: I notice that it doesn't set text-align on the th element, but if I open Web Inspector and show the inherited properties, it indicates that th has text-align: center inherited from.. somewhere

[05:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't understand where it's inheriting it from

[05:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: good point - lemme see if I can find out

[05:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: after looking for a while, I can't figure out how th elements get their centering

[05:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: my guess is that it does it in an odd way to avoid interfering with <th align=whatever>

[05:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: since a UA stylesheet rule would (I think) take priority over a presentational attribute, which is supposed to be treated at "presentational hint" priority

[05:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but, I can't see the code that does it at the moment

[05:55:00.0000] <annevk>
presumably th[align] would be implemented as a UA style sheet rule too

[05:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
this is supposed to be the precendence for presentational hints: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#preshint

[05:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess the only thing special about them is they have specificity 0

[06:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I do not think th[align] in the UA style sheet would correctly implement the requirements for "presentational hints"

[06:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that would have specificity 0,0,1,1

[06:01:00.0000] <annevk>
it's a ua style sheet, they're not part of the CSS cascade

[06:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I see, origin takes priority over specificity

[06:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess the only technical problem with putting them in the UA stylesheet is that they would override the user stylesheet

[06:01:03.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway

[06:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I can't tell where the text-align: center comes from through code inspection

[06:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I could debug it but I don't feel up to it right now

[06:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

table cells can inherit some properties from their table in a weird way but I don't think that's what is causing this

[06:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
oh I found it

[06:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
this is hella weird

[06:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
        // Table headers with a text-align of auto will change the text-align to center.                                             

[06:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
        if (e && e->hasTagName(thTag) && style->textAlign() == TAAUTO)

[06:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
            style->setTextAlign(CENTER);

[06:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
in CSSStyleSelector.cpp

[06:06:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I have no idea why it's done that way

[06:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess we want a table header to center even if you explicitly set text-align: auto?

[06:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"auto" isn't even a standard text-align CSS value

[06:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's our implementation of the secret nameless initial value of text-algin

hey all, what are context menus? Also, is the contextmenu attribute only for inputs?

[07:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
right-click menus, generally.

[07:28:00.0000] <boblet>
TabAtkins: aah, ok

[07:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also, no, @contextmenu is a global attribute.

[07:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's just an attribute that points at a <menu> somewhere in the document, which should be presented as a context menu in a UA-specific manner when the user triggers it in a UA-specific manner. (Which is just a popup menu when you right-click in typical UAs.)

[07:30:01.0000] <boblet>
they’d probably normally contain buttons huh

[07:30:02.0000] <boblet>
huh

[07:31:05.0000] <boblet>
guess I don’t make enough web applications

[07:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, it's something that isn't used enough in typical webapps today.

[07:32:01.0000] <boblet>
ok, thanks for explaining

[07:32:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But yeah, just assume that it's for producing custom right-click menus on specified elements.  It happens to have usability/accessibility benefits beyond that which come for free.

[07:33:00.0000] <boblet>
the UAs will present in relevant way part? or something more?

[07:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, they can present it in whatever way makes sense for them.

[07:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And trigger it based on whatever interaction makes sense for them.

[07:34:02.0000] <boblet>
cool

[07:35:00.0000] <boblet>
/me pines for the web of pages

[07:35:01.0000] <boblet>
I could understand that one

[07:35:02.0000] <boblet>
:)

[07:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Now you've got a web of applications, which happens to contain the web of pages as a strict subset.

[07:44:00.0000] <boblet>
TabAtkins: don’t forget the web of data. sheesh, where do I file a complaint that my knowledge is being made less relevant? ;)

[08:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, I have zero self control when it comes to discounted video games.  I went to Best Buy with a $100 bill and the intention of buying Mass Effect 1, expecting it to be $30 or $40.  It was $20.  So was Mirrors Edge.  And Dragon Age was $40.  I now have to make the difficult decision of which to play first.

[08:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Probably gonna be ME1.)

[08:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
$20?

[08:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
I got Mirror's Edge for about £3 on Steam

[08:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
My computer is weak and sickly.

[08:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I must play these things on the xbox.

[08:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I expect to parlay my new salary into a new desktop, since the last of my birthday just got spent on video games and extending my tattoo.

[08:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I can't see the exact price but it was £4.98 for Mirror's Edge plus The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition

[08:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
That reminds me, I've still got three Monkey Island games I need to play

[08:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though I am physically unable to play Oblivion on the xbox.  Ffs, every fps in the entire world needs to come with the option to invert BOTH x and y.  I can't play unless they're both inverted.

[08:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hold the controller upside down

[08:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then I have to do the thumbstick with my right hand, which is just wrong.

[08:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hold it behind your back so your arms are the other way round

[08:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then my hands are upside down.

[08:43:00.0000] <annevk>
http://twitpic.com/13rmjt has a pic of that Japanese HTML5 book

[08:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's a badass-looking book.

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Alternative solution: View the game in a mirror

[08:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That one would actually work, since I *can* invert the Y-axis.

[08:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, there we go.  Hacking on Chatzilla's CSS is difficult when you can't use Firebug on it.

[08:58:00.0000] <svl>
dom inspector

[08:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Does that work on arbitrary XUL apps, or just on ones running within Firefox?

[08:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
'cause I've got cz running standalone.

[09:00:00.0000] <paul_irish>
doesnt ChromeBug work well for that?

[09:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wouldn't have any idea.

[09:03:00.0000] <svl>
TabAtkins: should work on arbitrary xul apps (afaik, no personal experience)

[09:04:00.0000] <svl>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XULRunner_tips#DOM_Inspector has instructions (seems to be more convoluted than I'd thought/expected, but still doable)

[09:05:00.0000] <paul_irish>
check out chromebug, it's designed explicitly for hacking on XUL

[09:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, excellent.  Chromebug is doing what I need.

[11:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Am I the only one who thinks that the existence of Ctrl+scroll wheel in browsers probably causes many more users to find websites mysteriously the wrong size than it actually helps anyone?

[11:07:01.0000] <Steve^>
you are not

[11:14:00.0000] <annevk>
AryehGregor, it helps me

[11:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, it probably doesn't *hurt* anyone in this channel, because we all know the magic Ctrl+0 trick.

[11:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I constantly see people asking how to reset their browser to the right zoom level.

[11:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I use zoom shortcuts too, but would it really hurt to have them less accessible?  Like Ctrl-Shift-mouse wheel or something?

[11:16:00.0000] <Steve^>
this is why Opera disables single key shortcuts by defaults - they are too easy to hit by accident

[11:16:01.0000] <Steve^>
its easy to be using ctrl for something and hit the scroll wheel by accident

[11:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, it does that for all single-key shortcuts?

[11:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I recall it requires Shift-Esc or something for accesskeys, which always struck me as inconvenient.

[11:19:02.0000] <Steve^>
theres an option that simply re-enables single key shortcuts, like z for back and x for forward

[11:25:00.0000] <daedb>
I remember when Opera had a single-key shortcut for turning images on and off, it was bloody annoying :)

[11:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, so we were talking about double-key shortcuts, not single-key.

[11:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Backspace is an annoying shortcut.

[11:27:00.0000] <Steve^>
I find it more annoying that my firefox doesn't have that shortcut

[11:27:01.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - strongly agreed, backspace is a very annoying shortcut.

[11:27:02.0000] <tantek>
really wish I could disable that

[11:28:00.0000] <tantek>
have lost content too many times due to that shortcut

[11:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've used backspace on a laptop before, when I didn't have a mouse with back/forward buttons.

[11:28:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The back button on my current mouse hasn't worked for a long time, though, and I mostly just click the back button when I want to go back.

[11:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me should look into that.

[11:28:04.0000] <tantek>
e.g. you think you're focused in a text field, and want to delete characters you just typed, but it turns out the "document" has focus, and then backspace/delete goes back, and loses your textarea edits.

[11:29:00.0000] <Steve^>
your browser doesn't remember the field contents?

[11:29:01.0000] <tantek>
/me wishes he could patch is browsers to *not* treat backspace/delete as "go back" in navigation.

[11:30:00.0000] <tantek>
Steve^ depends on if the page was the result of a form submit etc.

[11:30:01.0000] <tantek>
then if you try to go forward, you get asked, do you want to resubmit? etc.

[11:30:02.0000] <tantek>
= dataloss

[11:30:03.0000] <tantek>
or worse, AJAX hacks to edit content that don't recover from back/forward

[11:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, one of my first MediaWiki commits was removing an annoying shortcut.  https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8203

[11:32:00.0000] <Steve^>
apart from the AJAX wizardry, your browser doesn't account for form submit pages?

[11:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, well, if you use an open-source browser, you can!

[11:33:00.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - not without lots of work recompiling and merging with updates.

[11:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably wouldn't have to do much work merging with updates, just recompiling.  It's unlikely those lines would get changed often.  But, yeah, just saying.

[11:33:02.0000] <Steve^>
Maybe I'll just point out that Opera has none of these problems, without you patching the browser?

[11:34:00.0000] <Steve^>
might be simpler in the short-term

[11:34:01.0000] <tantek>
seems to me like shortcuts should be in a separate config file anyway

[11:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, every game out there lets you change all your shortcuts -- why not browsers too?

[11:34:03.0000] <tantek>
I'd be fine even with a "defaults write com.apple.webkit ... " type solution (for webkit, firefox etc.)

[11:34:04.0000] <Philip`>
Opera has a handy keyboard shortcut editing dialog so you can disable backspace there if you want

[11:35:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip` - nice - thanks I'll check that out.

[11:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
(in Preferences/Advanced/Shortcuts)

[11:35:02.0000] <Steve^>
hmm, Philip stealing my ideas!

[11:35:03.0000] <Steve^>
So, <video> replaces flash on the ipad. What's going to replace PDFs?

[11:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Who wants to replace PDFs?

[11:36:01.0000] <Steve^>
i.e, when are we going to able to print properly from the net?

[11:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
PDF is a standard format, why do you need to replace it?

[11:36:03.0000] <Steve^>
doesn't work on my phone

[11:36:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just use a different implementation if you don't like Adobe's.

[11:37:00.0000] <Steve^>
if its a matter of time for it to get to all devices, then that's probably ok

[11:37:01.0000] <Steve^>
I assumed it was more of a royalty deal

[11:37:02.0000] <Steve^>
or implementation problem

[11:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
PDF can be implemented royalty-free.

[11:37:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
And is.

[11:37:05.0000] <Philip`>
There's already lots of reader and writer implementations

[11:37:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Tons of programs support it.

[11:37:07.0000] <Steve^>
does Android have one?

[11:37:08.0000] <daedb>
My phone has a pdf reader installed by default.

[11:38:00.0000] <daedb>
I've never used it though :p

[11:38:01.0000] <tantek>
/me thought HTML+CSS was supposed to replace the need for PDF. ;)

[11:39:00.0000] <Steve^>
tantek, that's what you'd expect, but you can't print from the web - I can't do my CV in HTML

[11:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Steve^, why not?

[11:39:02.0000] <Steve^>
it's ideal in that you can format exactly how you want and yet the browsers let you down

[11:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've done a resume in HTML before.

[11:39:04.0000] <tantek>
/me remembers helping to write some pretty damn good print (including print preview and size/image tweaking) in IE5/Mac ~ 10 years ago.

[11:40:00.0000] <daedb>
I write my CV in HTML and print it to a pdf...

[11:40:01.0000] <tantek>
Steve^ re: CV in HTML: http://microformats.org/wiki/hresume

[11:40:02.0000] <Steve^>
I'm speaking from experience in trying to get something I know will print to 2 pages

[11:42:00.0000] <Steve^>
ok, Opera printing a full-screen CV document: the right margin is about 3 inches wide

[11:42:01.0000] <Steve^>
same as the bottom

[11:43:00.0000] <Steve^>
ooo, chrome does a pretty good job

[11:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I dont' think I've tried printing my resume before, I just send it around as a link.  And it's all marked up with hresume. ^_^

[11:46:00.0000] <Steve^>
I think the printing is more for myself than employers

[11:46:01.0000] <Steve^>
I want to send a PDF around but Open Office is useless

[11:47:00.0000] <Steve^>
looks like Chrome produces a good quality doc though, so I might try this in the future

[12:16:00.0000] <ment>
Steve^: why would you want pdf replacement? there's no way to comfortably read documents with page-wide fixed layout on phone anyway.

[12:16:01.0000] <Steve^>
but I dislike meeting a dead-end when browsing the web

[12:17:00.0000] <ment>
what do you mean?

[12:18:00.0000] <Steve^>
I needed the days that my recycling is picked up from my site, the council gives the information as a pdf

[12:18:01.0000] <Steve^>
I browse their site, find the pdf and have to give up

[12:19:00.0000] <tantek>
sounds like an opportunity for a PDF->plain text (or semantic markup) web service

[12:20:00.0000] <ment>
steve^: that has nothing to do with PDF, they might as well supply the informations in .xls or dBase 3 format

[12:21:00.0000] <tantek>
Steve^ ask the council to support more and better OpenGov: http://tantek.pbworks.com/OpenGov - specifically through step 5

[12:21:01.0000] <Steve^>
pdf is the standard "I want the information laid out like this" format, just as flash is the "I want a video" format

[12:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Google already does PDF -> HTML

[12:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
which often works okay

[12:28:00.0000] <ment>
Steve^: pdf is standard for "i want this document to be printed exactly like this", flash is the "there's no other way to include video in web page" standard

[12:29:00.0000] <Steve^>
Philip`, is there a way to easily access that function?

[12:30:00.0000] <ment>
pdf could be composed of scanned handwritten pages

[12:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Steve^: Put e.g. cache:http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/html5-letter.pdf into the search box

[12:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Argh, I have 110 threads in my spec inbox.  :(

[12:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me just starts skipping all procedural threads

[12:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And accessibility, and CSS.  That cuts out about 90%.

[12:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, "note, though, that I can count pretty high on two hands" -- using binary?

[12:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[12:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That line was a joke, but yes, I regularly count on my fingers in binary.

[12:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's very useful to be about to count to 30 on one hand, or 1000 on two.

[12:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't have enough independent control over each finger to count in binary :-(

[12:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Really?

[12:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, you can always just represent less digits.  Find out which groups of fingers you *can* control independently, and just use them.

[12:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
I can't bend my little finger without the adjacent finger bending

[12:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you can only count to 256.

[12:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, I've never actually found much use for it . . .

[12:59:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
If I need to count higher than ten, I usually go by fives and just remember how many fives I've done.

[12:59:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Requires less brainpower.

[12:59:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I use it to count how long to use my mouthwash, frex.  ^_^

[12:59:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
And after you've done it for a while, it doesn't require any thinking at all.  Muscle memory takes care of changing your fingers.

[12:59:06.0000] <Nikita>
so is the device spec ever going to be reviewed and/or possible to implement?

[13:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nikita: It just (a few weeks ago) got introduced at all.  At some point, yes, more work will be done on it.  It's just an idea for now.

[13:03:00.0000] <Nikita>
ok, who is involved in the committs and specs? Like if I or someone else wanted to committ code like that to the repository is that possible? I'm only now starting to get into the group

[13:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ian is the primary (and currently sole) editor of the spec.  However, if you wanted to start proposing stuff, go ahead and do so.  Just pop it onto the list.

[13:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Right now, afaik, that feature is *extremely* experimental, and would benefit tremendously from some actual browser experimentation in the area.

[13:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's not even really specced, is it?

[13:05:01.0000] <Nikita>
ok, I would love to try to experiment with it, any guidelines? I think since its not a published spec? is there anything I need to do, like is there a resource on how to make pages with the latest code/experimental things?

[13:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not fully/properly, at least.

[13:06:00.0000] <Nikita>
not sure if this article is true http://www.ozcarguide.com/technology/web/2136-google-gears-html5

[13:06:01.0000] <Nikita>
but I do believe gears had an Audio API for recording, don't remember about video

[13:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yeah, nothing's specced except for some very basic concept work on it.  Basically "Hey, it should would be cool if there was a <device> element.".

[13:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/should //

[13:09:00.0000] <Nikita>
well since its just cool (it hasnt been updated since last year according to that side note thing on the left), is there any technology that can be used for live video recording and broadcasting WITHOUT flash/flex/silverlight (i was thinking a java applet might do it), but I reallly wish that spec was available

[13:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nothing exists yet, afaik.

[13:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Java might work, no?

[13:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not sure what it supports.

[14:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yay, finished reading spec mail.

[14:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Took an hour and a half.  :/

[14:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Was it worth it?

[14:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe.

[14:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess so.

[15:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: you didn't mail hte list

[15:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Craps.

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[15:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Danke, sent.

[15:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me learnt last week that the IETF submission process actually has a human in the loop

[15:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
and apparently submitting websocket so much is tiring them out

[15:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-/

[15:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's like the IETF stopped evolving in the 70s or something

[15:21:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie every standards organizations' processes tends to be a time capsule of the culture/technologies in common use at their inception. Hence the need for new standards organizations every few years.

[15:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems that way

[15:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Blargh, why does type="search" not support width in WebKit?

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
width?

[15:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, maybe I'm wrong?

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
what do you mean by width?

[15:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
CSS property, IDL attribute, content attribute, something else?

[15:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The width CSS property.  But my accusation was scurrilous.

[15:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[15:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, I guess scurrilous doesn't mean what I think it means.

[15:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
My accusation was groundless.

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there a spec for how HTTP CONNECT works anywhere?

[15:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, maybe this http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2817.txt

[15:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
I haven't read it to see how well it defines it. just found it

[15:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks

[15:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[15:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
if i connect to hixie.ch port 80 and send:

[15:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
CONNECT hixie.ch:80 HTTP/1.1 [CRLF][CRLF]

[15:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i get back a 400 Bad Request

[15:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
but if i connect to hixie.ch port 80 and send:

[15:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
CONNECT hixie.ch:80 garbage [CRLF][CRLF]

[15:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
i get back a 405 Method not Allowed


2010-02-22
[16:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i really can't see how to make CONNECT work as a handshake

[16:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
(not if we simultaneously try to not violate HTTP)

[16:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
how would a CONNECT handshake violate HTTP?

[16:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is it forbidden to send a CONNECT request to an origin server?

[16:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
no

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is the response

[16:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
it consists of an entire 2xx response before the pip is established

[16:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
pipe

[16:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
so basically we're opening a massive hole right at the head of the connection

[16:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you could do the Adam-style handshake after the connection is established

[16:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i guess we'd have to

[16:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
unless there is some chance that the CONNECT request itself will completely own the server

[16:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh i missed your response to that question i asked the other day, btw, i was meeting with one of the hybi chairs

[16:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I do think the Adam-style handshake is more complicated than necessary for its own security

[16:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or at least, his original version

[16:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i don't see why we need to encrypt any useful data

[16:14:03.0000] <othermaciej>
there's no need for the server to generate its own entropy

[16:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
can't we just include a challenge of the form "here's 16 bytes, return them x'ored with each other"?

[16:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
s/'//

[16:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there's a couple of issues with that

[16:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
1) doesn't increase the likelihood that the server will pay attention to the client's Origin

[16:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
2) no way to differentiate from future protocols using the same approach

[16:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
if the server doesn't pay attention to the origin, he'll include a hard-coded value, which is fine, no?

[16:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
3) required useful data ("this is WebSocket", "here's the Origin") would have to go in a separate response, increasing the number of round trips

[16:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see how we can do anything that reduces the chances of a server just echoing the origin when they should check it

[16:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well let me put it this way

[16:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't follow #3

[16:17:04.0000] <othermaciej>
what do you expect to be in the handshake besides those 16 bytes, if anything?

[16:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Adam's goal was that the whole handshake looks like random bytes if you don't understand it, and thus is highly unlikely to have a specific bad effect on servers

[16:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well given that the start of the handshake is a CONNECT, there's zero chance of that

[16:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i kinda gave up with that goal

[16:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess if we want to do it we still can though

[16:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah I don't know how meaningful it is to do the Adam handshake after a CONNECT

[16:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean, probably somewhat meaningful just less so

[16:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there are a few ways I can think of to simplify server-side implementation of Adam's design without reducing the security:

[16:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
1) Have the client use a one-time pad as its crypto (i.e. XOR with an equally long key)

[16:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
2) have the server respond with a hash of the client's key and the client's plaintext (perhaps reodering the parts)

[16:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it doesn't even have to be a cryptographically secure hash, could even be CRC, you just want a hash value that's too long to get the right value by chance

[16:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
though I suspect MD5 is more widely available in library form than most simpler hashes with a decent output size

[16:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that removes the server's needs to use a fancy algorithm to decrypt, to produce random bits, and to use a fancy algorithm to encrypt again

[16:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
we can get rid of the need for a library altogether just by having the server xor parts of the key together

[16:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. xor bytes 1,2,3,4 with bytes 5,6,7,8

[16:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
also making the key the right length is easy if you just interleave each byte of the key with the byte of data it's been xored with

[16:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. ABC becomes [k1][k1 xor A][k2][k2 xor B][k3][k3 xor C]

[16:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the server's nonce can then just be [k1 xor k2][k3 xor k4]...[k8 xor k16] or something

[16:34:00.0000] <NickYoung>
I hope this isn't supposed to be cryptographically secure..

[16:34:01.0000] <NickYoung>
the security guy in me is seeing the next WEP being created...

[16:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think making the server xor random bytes is probably more of a burden on the server than telling the server to use MD5

[16:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
NickYoung: it's not supposed to be cryptographically secure

[16:35:02.0000] <NickYoung>
Oh good ;)

[16:35:03.0000] <NickYoung>
also, I disagree with your assertion.. XOR is a single cycle operation

[16:36:00.0000] <NickYoung>
even if you have 20 of them, it will be many thousands times faster than MD5

[16:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
NickYoung: by "burden" I mean difficulty of implementation, not CPU cost of doing the computation

[16:36:02.0000] <NickYoung>
seriously, bitwise -or is difficult to implement? =P

[16:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you invent a funky custom algorithm then the server can't use a pre-existing library

[16:37:01.0000] <NickYoung>
from what I read, you're just XORing a few bytes...

[16:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, the tricky part is which bytes

[16:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you have to hand-code a loop to do it and have it step in the right increments

[16:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and the reason Hixie wants to do that is because calling a library function to do MD5 or CRC or whatever might be too hard

[16:39:00.0000] <NickYoung>
what's the point of this anyway, to verify you're speaking the correct protocol..?

[16:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to verify that you are speaking the correct protocol and that the connection is allowed without  opening too much opportunity for cross-protocol attacks

[16:41:00.0000] <NickYoung>
and these 16bits are a nonce?

[16:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think if your key is variable-length then you need to length-prefix or terminator-delimit the client handshake, so the server knows when it got all of it

[16:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: sure, the last four bytes would decode to CRLFCRLF or some such

[16:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it's meant to be 16 bytes, a 16-bit nonce would be pretty weak

[16:42:01.0000] <NickYoung>
ah, misread

[16:42:02.0000] <NickYoung>
wait

[16:42:03.0000] <NickYoung>
16 bytes?

[16:42:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that would force a requirement to do the "decrypt" operation in streaming mode

[16:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
NickYoung: it's really a variable-length number of bytes, since the plaintext client handshake message is not fixed-length

[16:43:01.0000] <NickYoung>
ah.

[16:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yes? the whole protocol is a "streaming-mode" protocol

[16:43:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: as opposed to "read known length or up to delimiter and then process"

[16:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
which is how HTTP headers and WebSocket messages are both handled

[16:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there is no need to process every single byte to even find the message boundaries

[16:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the point is, what you're proposing is not easier to implement than even Adam's original version, given a reasonable set of available libraries

[16:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it is in fact harder

[16:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and people could easily get it wrong in subtle ways, e.g. not expect the client handshake to be split in the middle, or to be split on an odd byte

[16:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't mind have a non-encrypted delimiter if you like

[16:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would say it's far better to use well-known algorithms than some weird ad-hoc thing if your goal is to make it easy on custom server implementations

[16:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think the delimiter is the biggest problem with your proposal

[16:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
we could even just define the key characters for the last four bytes so that you can do the delimiter check in either mode

[16:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"run around XORing random bytes together" is not a trivial operation

[16:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
i can't think of a single language i've ever used where it's been anything _but_ trivial

[16:47:03.0000] <othermaciej>
most people who interview with the Safari team would probably fail if presented that problem as an interview question (not that we hire them, but lots of these people think they know how to code)

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand the problem here. read byte; if (needkey) key = byte else append(byte xor key); needkey = !needkey;

[16:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
it seems truly trivial

[16:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
am i missing something?

[16:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you're missing the loop, the code to detect the terminators, and the code to output the response

[16:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
right, you need those regardless of what we do here

[16:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
also you're not accounting for the fact that the read is asynchronous

[16:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
s/output/compute/

[16:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm assuming the above is the code you stick in the select() loop for the socket

[16:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the hypothetical naiive server-side programmer is using select with raw sockets instead of something like Twisted?

[16:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
this hypothetical person must really hate using libraries

[16:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hypothetical people do, as a rule.

[16:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm baffled as to why you would use a library for something this simple personally

[16:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Adam

[16:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
er

[16:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Adam

[16:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
dammit, why must enter be so close to the quote key

[16:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Adam's original version also has the problem that it's variable-length but neither length-prefixed nor delimited

[16:58:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: did you see the HTML5 & APIs book that is just coming out in Japan?

[16:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in his case the key is fixed-length, so you could just keep decrypting til it works, but that is lame

[16:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: didn't see it, but mike told me about it

[16:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm happy to delimit it

[16:58:04.0000] <boblet>
http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4822284220/

[16:59:00.0000] <boblet>
Mike was encouraging Shiraishi-san to send you a copy, so you might be able to see it in the flesh :)

[16:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I can't tell up front what a good delimiter would be

[17:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: btw your code, despite doing only a small fraction of the work, has an obvious bug

[17:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it doesn't save the key bytes, which per your definition are used to compute the server response

[17:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(I'm also not clear on why the server response depends only on the key and not the plaintext in your proposal)

[17:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i wasn't sure what to do about that sicne you didn't like the proposal of using hte key

[17:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i would use this as the delimiter, so you could detect it in either implementation style (before or after decrypting): 0x00 0x0D 0x00 0x0A 0x00 0x0D 0x00 0x0A

[17:01:02.0000] <boblet>
Futomi-san (of http://html5.jp/ fame) also has a book in the pipeline: http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4798025291/ It’s a hot topic over here

[17:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
(maybe we should just use LF line endings in this, since we don't have to be HTTP-compatible)

[17:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
boblet: people are probably more excited in Japan because they can't follow the mailing list flamewars

[17:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[17:03:02.0000] <boblet>
othermaciej: zing!

[17:04:00.0000] <boblet>
yeah, info about it comes prefiltered so ppl here miss out on that and the FUD too

[17:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I dunno if you come up with a complete proposal I can analyze it (and I'm sure Adam would be willing to as well)

[17:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
too hard to review an emerging design over IRC

[17:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i'm poking at one

[17:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I do think that even though this doesn't have to be cryptographically secure, it would be wiser to use off-the-shelf algorithms, because the first rule of crypto club is "don't invent your own algorithms"

[17:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
the idea of the nonce coming back from the server is to have the server include something in the response that's verifiable (showing the server knows the protocol) and yet not predictable without controlling the client's handshake, right?

[17:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
yes

[17:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
a one time pad isn't a new invention

[17:06:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think a one-time pad for the client request is fine

[17:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh for the response, yeah

[17:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(given a suitable way to mark the boundary)

[17:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ideally I think the response would use an algorithm that doesn't require the server to generate a random number, which is why I thought of hashing instead of encryption

[17:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
totally agreed on that

[17:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one more thing I thought of, you can't use a fixed set of bytes as a delimiter without forcing some kind of escapting

[17:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh, I guess the idea of 0x0 0xD is supposed to be that the plaintext request can't contain byte 0xD, but that's pretty subtle

[17:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I can't think of a good simple way to encode the length without violating the "it looks like random bytes" property

[17:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: btw have you had a chance to look at the Change Proposal that the i18n people came up with for ISSUE-88? would it be helpful if someone extracted out the requests there that still differ from the spec?

[17:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
link?

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
the answer is probably no

[17:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
because in the last week i've only done bugs and websocket feedback

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh this one? http://www.w3.org/International/wiki/Htmlissue88

[17:35:00.0000] <Waldo_>
othermaciej:erm, do you happen to know why the jwalden nick I usually use is banned in #webkit?  was my connection flaky recently or something?

[17:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Waldo_: banned?

[17:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
as in, you can't enter the channel, or you can't speak?

[17:36:02.0000] <Waldo_>
"=== jwalden #webkit Cannot change nickname while banned on channel"

[17:36:03.0000] <Waldo_>
that's as much as I know, when I try /nick jwalden

[17:36:04.0000] <othermaciej>
no idea

[17:36:05.0000] <gavin>
your nick isn't registered?

[17:36:06.0000] <gavin>
or you aren't identified

[17:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there's only one other person who has channel ownership

[17:37:01.0000] <Waldo_>
no, this is when I try to change nick right now

[17:37:02.0000] <gavin>
oh

[17:37:03.0000] <gavin>
Waldo_ isn't identified

[17:37:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I can probably unban you but my IRC mojo is weak

[17:37:05.0000] <gavin>
so you can't change his nick

[17:37:06.0000] <Waldo_>
well, sure

[17:37:07.0000] <gavin>
because webkit is +R

[17:37:08.0000] <Waldo_>
you identify after you change nick

[17:37:09.0000] <gavin>
part webkit, change nick, identify, rejoin

[17:38:00.0000] <jwalden>
hum, that worked

[17:38:01.0000] <jwalden>
sorry for the trouble...

[17:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
the bans in #webkit are:

[17:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
02:43 -!- 1 - #webkit: ban *!*jibot⊙621* [by zelazny.freenode.net, 1910310 secs ago]

[17:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
02:43 -!- 2 - #webkit: ban *!*onar@*.hsd1.ca.comcast.net [by zelazny.freenode.net, 1910310 secs ago]

[17:38:05.0000] <Hixie>
looks like someone using comcast was banned

[17:38:06.0000] <Hixie>
and the server won't let you change nicks while that's going on

[17:38:07.0000] <gavin>
no no, this is just a quiet ban

[17:38:08.0000] <gavin>
+q $~a

[17:38:09.0000] <gavin>
applies to all unregistered nicks

[17:39:00.0000] <gavin>
(/mode +q #webkit)

[17:39:01.0000] <jwalden>
chatzilla could use a better error message here, if the protocol permits one to be used

[17:39:02.0000] <jwalden>
or rather, allows the situation to be identified

[17:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that would stop people from talking but not from entering the channel, right?

[17:39:04.0000] <gavin>
right

[17:39:05.0000] <gavin>
unregistered users can currently join but not speak in #webkit

[17:40:00.0000] <gavin>
 |/mode -q $~a #webkit| if you want to remove that restriction

[17:40:01.0000] <gavin>
er, or maybe |/mode #webkit -q $~a|

[17:53:00.0000] <JonathanNeal_oww>
Hey guys!

[17:54:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I heard some great questions about HTML5 today and I thought I would share them with the group and get your reactions.

[17:55:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Accessibility: What is the benefit to accessibility with HTML5? Do existing and popular screen-readers have an easier or harder time understanding HTML5 tags? How do they parse the content in IE when they run into an unknown tag?

[17:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
HTML5 improves matters for accessibility, though the various and sundry ways it does that are numerous and difficult to summarise

[17:58:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hixie, can any of them be mentions or written?

[17:58:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Are they listed on the web?

[17:58:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Or is it theory.

[17:59:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: one of the big accessibility improvements is moving a11y stuff from hidden locations (like attributes) to visible locations (like content), so they’re available to everyone, and also to give authors a reason to add them

[18:01:00.0000] <boblet>
an example of this is the great table summary vs caption wars

[18:01:01.0000] <boblet>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tabular-data.html#attr-table-summary

[18:01:02.0000] <boblet>
another is the ongoing longdesc battle

[18:03:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
HTML5 Accessibility can be measured in battles.

[18:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: hidden="", the new <input type>s, removing features that were harming accessibility due to widespread misuse, removing all media-specific presentational features in favour of CSS, making many of the features more explicitly media-independent, etc

[18:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i replied to the issue-88 stuff

[18:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
 making many of the features more explicitly media-independent, you mean like the presentational to css stuff?

[18:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: thanks

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: i mean like <hr> being redefined to have nothing to do with horizontal rules specifically

[18:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
or <b> and <i> being redefined to make sense in all media, not just visual media

[18:08:02.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: eg em = emphasis to stress emphasis, kbd = keyboard to keyboard and other eg voice input (ie has explicit aural ref plus less UA-specific)

[18:10:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: re accessibility battles, it’s a topic on which many people have strongly held and conflicting beliefs :|

[18:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the best features for accessibility are the new controls (both form controls and things that don't participate in form submission but resemble standard application widgets)

[18:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because now people won't need to use <div> soup to build those controls

[18:11:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
This is a fun discussion.

[18:15:00.0000] <boblet>
also once UAs (and authors) start using semantic structural elements (nav especially) it’ll make things way more accessible

[18:16:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>

Google and the world of search:

[18:17:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Is there an SEO benefit to HTML5?  Is there one now, or will there be one?  Does Google favor HTML5 markup, over HTML4 markup, or XHTML markup? Does any search engine (such as Bing, Yahoo, etc)?

[18:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
no SEO benefit

[18:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
just make your content useful

[18:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
you'll have much more luck with making your content have high rank in google if you make it something people want, than if you spend the same time trying to do markup tricks

[18:20:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Fair enough, boblet or othermaciej feel free to jump in on that one if you think differently, otherwise I'll move on.

[18:20:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Final section, The Browser Effect:

[18:21:00.0000] <boblet>
although I think it’s fair to say that using good markup will help make the content accessible to people. i suspect there is some search engine benefit to using good markup over tag soup

[18:21:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
How will HTML5 impact browser performance? CSS3 selectors have a quantifiable impact on performance, but do HTML5 tags have any impact on rendering performance? What about in IE; what is the performance impact (in ms and possibly in MB) on having to create the elements via JS on every page load?

[18:22:00.0000] <boblet>
eg Google Lists(?) probably won’t include a list marked up using <p> with <br> in it’s list of related entries suggestions

[18:23:00.0000] <boblet>
I think POSH (plain old semantic HTML) is probably good SEO for free

[18:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know anything about what search engine algorithms do

[18:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you would have to ask them

[18:25:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: i don’t know of any performance impact, and typically something like 90% of the time is spent getting the file (vs processing), so any change on processing will probably be small

[18:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML5 will probably improve performance in the case where you can use a native HTML5 feature instead of rolling your own with DIV+CSS+JS

[18:26:00.0000] <boblet>
re: IE HTML5 shiv, the JS itself is tiny, and the performance overhead of creating new elements before being able to use them should be tiny compared to something like using jQuery. in current browsers I wouldn’t expect HTML5 (over HTML4 etc) to make a noticeable difference

[18:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also using the <video> element may be higher performance than plugin-based video solutions

[18:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it really shouldn't make much difference either way in most cases

[18:28:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: if you’re worried about performance use YSlow and Smushit—your HTML 

[18:29:00.0000] <boblet>
—HTML differences are tiny compared to image minification and reducing requests

[18:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
appcache is an HTML5 feature that can significantly improve load performance (past the first time)

[18:31:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: the “submit review comment” help message should probably mention that you can receive a reply if you use the same email as bugzilla

[18:31:01.0000] <boblet>
also it munges non-ascii characters

[18:33:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
All of what you guys have said is great, but is there any measurable, documented proof?

[18:33:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Or is there a way you would recommend I make one, such as with yslow, etc?

[18:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what are you looking for proof of?

[18:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"how will HTML5 impact browser performace?" is a very open-ended question

[18:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if you formulate a specific hypothesis we can tell you ways to test

[18:35:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
"Do HTML5 tags have any impact on rendering performance?"

[18:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if the question is about using HTML5 at all, without using any new features, you could try the same page with HTML4.01 and HTML5 doctypes to see if there is any difference in load speed (there won't be)

[18:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you want to see if enabling IE to use the new tags compatibly impacts load time in IE, you can test load times in IE of a page with and without

[18:36:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
How would you test those load times in IE?

[18:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if you want to see if appcache improves cached-case load speed, then that would be a more challenging experiment (to set up the app cache manifest properly etc) but still doable

[18:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you could use a stopwatch

[18:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or if you want to ignore network load time, instrument the page with a <script> to save the current time at the very top of the page (right inside <head> I guess) and then check in the "load" listener how much time elapsed

[18:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
benchmarking is hard

[18:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
if you want data and not just educated guesses, it will take some work

[18:38:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: there’s a hardcore performance tool for IE that I saw mentioned on John Resig’s blog

[18:38:01.0000] <boblet>
http://ejohn.org/blog/deep-tracing-of-internet-explorer/

[18:38:02.0000] <boblet>
dynaTrace Ajax

[18:39:00.0000] <boblet>
there’s a similar extension for Google Chrome called Speed Tracer:

[18:39:01.0000] <boblet>
http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/speedtracer/

[18:40:00.0000] <boblet>
please publish any testing you do btw

[18:44:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Freaking Ajax tool requires registration and doesn't immediately send out the registration email.

[18:44:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
If you want to collect info about who is using your product, don't make it so damn hard to get.

[18:45:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm referring to dynaTrace AJAX

[18:55:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm tweeting how much these guys suck for that.

[18:55:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's bull when companys do this.

[18:55:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
*ies

[18:59:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: so you’re thinking to test it?

[19:07:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm trying to.

boblet

[19:08:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: if you have any success (and remember to) please ping me @boblet on twitter. I’d love to hear about it

[19:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
boblet: http://twitter.com/jon_neal

[19:11:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'll let you know on here or tweet it once I've gotten the software and had a successful test (which proves either case)

[19:12:00.0000] <boblet>
that’d be great!

[21:29:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, I made a test.

[21:30:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Afte running several tests, each test running itself 100,000 times...

[21:31:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The average time it takes for JS to add support for styled HTML5 elements in IE6 browsers is from 0.01ms in native IE6 to 0.05ms in emulated IE6, with a 0.000497ms descrepency caused by the test itself.

[22:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see some mentions of an open letter from the FSF to Google about free-licensing On2 video codecs

[22:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wondering where the actual FSF communiqué is

[22:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
.me finds http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/google-free-on2-vp8-for-youtube

[22:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, this looks more like just the case of one dude who has blogging perms at http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/ deciding to post about it

[22:24:01.0000] <gavin>
Google was going to release On2, but are reconsidering the decision now that the FSF thinks it's a good idea

[22:24:02.0000] <gavin>
er, s/On2/VP8/

[22:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[22:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
<snort>

[22:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, that would seem to be a good idea in general for reconsidering any decision that would otherwise be obviously beneficial

[22:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, about #webkit not allowing nick changes, I started to have that problem, fairly recently

[22:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
like, within the last 3 or 4 weeks or so

[22:27:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I also get the same message about being "banned"

[22:27:03.0000] <gavin>
that's when the freenode spamming started

[22:27:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[22:28:00.0000] <gavin>
and channels started all going +R (registered users only)

[22:28:01.0000] <gavin>
then the ircd switchover happened, and some channels are still +q $~a (the new +R)

[22:28:02.0000] <gavin>
they should probably remove it now that the spamming has mostly stopped, but othermaciej doesn't seem keen on the idea

[22:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so if I register my other nicks, maybe that will let me change them when I need to

[22:32:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
"You are already logged in as MikeSmith." "Use GROUP to register MikeSmithX to your account." .. "group :Unknown command"

it's interesting to see how little documentation one needs to convince a locksmith to come over

[00:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, nice to see that Adam wrote a counter-proposal to Larry's

[00:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
now I don't have to

[00:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: you should send a +1 at least

[00:10:01.0000] <boblet>
annevk: well, just ignore everything but the spec, and you’ll be about there ;-)

[00:12:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: so the shiv to addHTML5 support adds 0.04ms to IE6’s page load? that’s … acceptable, hehe

[00:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok. I'll express my support to zero edits

[00:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I note that the TAG as a whole has been unwilling to support the doctype versioning change proposal

[00:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: you know, it strikes me that if we just include some data in the encrypted part, then just repeating that information (unencrypted) is actually proof enough that the server is reading the handshake

[00:46:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, wasn't the concern with that simple echo thingies?

[00:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
well they'd have to decrypt it

[00:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is easy enough, but won't happen unless you really are a websocket server

[00:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you would need to make sure that part of what they echo back is unpredictable

[00:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
right

[00:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
ideally you want at least one thing to be both unpredictable *and* not verbatim

[00:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it wouldn't be verbatim, since it'd be encrypted

[00:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but the data XOR'd with the one-time pad key is all predictable

[00:55:02.0000] <annevk>
what counts as unpredictable? timestamps?

[00:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the key itself is the only unpredictable part

[00:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: random data

[00:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i mean, client sends something like Unique-ID: 312524232362435234521, but in the encrypted part, and the server just has to say that back

[00:56:03.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: random data generated by the browser after JS code transfers control

[00:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: but the server's returned data is unencrypted

[00:56:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you could do that - then the client is generating two different random numbers

[00:56:06.0000] <Hixie>
right

[00:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one to be the encryption key and one to be the nonce

[00:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[00:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
they can be generated from the same single truely random number, it's not like they have to be independent

[00:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
so it's not an entropy drain

[00:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the other property Adam was trying to guarantee is that both request and response look like random bytes without WebSocket processing but I don't know offhand why it's important

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: they do have to be independent, XORing a value with itself won't be very random

[00:58:03.0000] <annevk>

[03:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
JonathanNeal: But seeming you said good morning when you pinged me over the weekend at a time four hours later, I guess that's quite uselss

[04:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if updating his canvas tests would be useful

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk>
yes

[04:07:01.0000] <annevk>
a) gives some insight how far impls are along b) prolly generates more <canvas> feedback / improvements

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I hope there weren't too many features snuck into the spec while I wasn't looking

[04:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me completely missed drawFocusRing

[04:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: yes, and you should submit them for the html5 test suite

[04:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I probably should have said "worthwhile" rather than "useful")

[04:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, I can't say how it would rate for you against other uses of your time

[04:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it would definitely be of great benefit to others

[04:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I would actually like to put your whole test suite into the WebKit regression tests

[04:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: about 'should longdesc be considered "obsolete but conforming" or just conforming to a warning'

[04:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: yes?

[04:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
what does "just conforming to a warning" mean?

[04:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: it means that it would not be listed in the "obsolete but conforming" section or have that label applied to it, but the practical effect would be the same

[04:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
meaning that conformance checkers would still need to warn about it?

[04:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems like it is effectively creating yet another conformance level

[04:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, summary is in a gray zone right now where it's not totally clear which of those buckets it falls into

[04:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Cynthia's change proposal for summary would in fact label it as "obsolete but conforming"

[04:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
my thinking is we should do the same for longdesc

[04:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the effect on validators is pretty much nil, it's just a matter of presentation and spec organization

[04:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
perhaps one possible remedy for this is to not use the word "obsolete" in the name of that section, but categorize them as "Conforming features that have specific caveats"

[04:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or something else that is more in the sense of "caveat" rather than "obsoleted"

[05:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the spec could mandate the specific warning messages that conformance checkers should emit for those cases

[05:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or at least what specific sense the messages should convey

[05:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., in general, the sense would be "There is evidence to suggest this element is widely misused, therefore, make sure to use it with care."

[05:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or if not "widely", at least "sometimes"

[05:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
Every feature of the language is sometimes misused

[05:03:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think removing the word obsolete will do anything, it will just shift the battle to removing the new language

[05:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
and everything should be used with care

[05:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Why does this fully conforming and not obsolete feature need a warning?"

[05:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe some need slightly more care than others, so perhaps we could have a care-o-meter that says longdesc rates 80% on the need-to-care index while summary is 70% and <a href> is only 20%

[05:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Then we wouldn't have to keep drawing and shifting arbitrary lines between features that are good and features that are bad and features that are sort of in the middle so we'll allow them but complain a bit

[05:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And instead we get bikeshedding over what number to use for each feature

[05:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Now only 19.95 care"

[05:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
We could vote and use the mean rating

[05:07:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Median, surely

[05:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: I think he meant "mean" in the sense of "meanest"

[05:08:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or maybe a mix, like removing the top and bottom 10% and doing the mean of the rest

[05:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Good point - we should have a vote on what voting mechanisms to use

[05:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How about we just stick to the current categories

[05:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
Everyone can rate each voting mechanism out of 10, and then we use a weighted sum of all voting mechanisms

[05:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
all smartassery aside, we do really need to get agreement about what the spec should say about these attributes

[05:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
There is wide agreement, and a few dissenting voices

[05:10:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: If we make enough new categories, then people will be confused into supporting choices that are equivalent to ones they've rejected

[05:10:03.0000] <Philip`>
(I assume that's the purpose of tweaking the wording of category labels)

[05:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: no, that's not an accurate assessment of the state of things, actually

[05:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and that's not the basis for making decisions, regardless

[05:11:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
by anybody's measure

[05:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's the basis of quite a few systems

[05:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
true, like mob rule

[05:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And, you know, democracy

[05:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
right, what I said

[05:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: the closest equivalent to "Obsolete but conforming" in HTML4 would have been "Deprecated

[05:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: in non-HTML contexts, things that are "deprecated" tend to generate a warning, though I don't think any HTML4 validator ever did that

[05:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, HTML4 validator(s) have a lot of deficiencies

[05:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that was then, this is now

[05:14:02.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: We support philosopher kings too, but apparently you don't like that either

[05:14:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: in my opinion "deprecated" is a fine, accurate way to describe this case

[05:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think "obsolete but conforming" is also an ok way to describe it

[05:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, it's just more words

[05:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
"You shouldn't be using this any more, but we will grudgingly allow it, for now"

[05:15:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I will conceded it's probably more precise

[05:15:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't really want to open up the can of worms of what that section should be named

[05:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to me that's much less important than the actual real effects

[05:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But none of those wordings actually satisfy the people who want to encourage use of that feature

[05:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: I like philosopher kings pretty well, actually

[05:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think "Obsolete but conforming" is an improvement over "Downplayed error"

[05:16:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I would have just said "mandatory warning" or something

[05:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"downplayed error" is just goofy

[05:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"deprecated" also seems sort of ok, though I think some people don't like that specific word because the way HTML4 handled it seemed to be ineffective in discouraging those features

[05:17:02.0000] <Dashiva>
deprecated is just wrong

[05:17:03.0000] <Dashiva>
It implies removing support in a later revision

[05:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess that is wrong in two subtle ways:

[05:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
1) we'll likely never remove support, just any semblance of conforming status

[05:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
2) we don't necessarily promise to remove even that

[05:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Most of the cases seem entirely uncontroversial, with summary being quite the exception

[05:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But is there anyone who objects to summary being marked as <whatever> who doesn't also want summary to be fully unconditionally conforming?

[05:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
for summary it might cease to be controversial if the Change Proposal currently in development by the a11y tf goes through

[06:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: So, effectively zero time to get IE to support the new elements?  Fractions of a millisecond are basically free.

othermaciej: "Is it actually used that way in content?" - apparently not frequently

[06:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: thanks

[06:32:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: so that's one plausibly correct fragment reference

[06:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: out of how many pages total?

[06:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
About 425K

[06:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/data/dotbot-20090424.txt

[06:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
Which one is plausibly correct?

[06:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and those are the only idrefs?

[06:34:03.0000] <Philip`>
The one that points to an empty element, or the one that points to a non-existent element?

[06:34:04.0000] <othermaciej>
the #top one, out of those you mentioned

[06:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is there relevant content after the <a>?

[06:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
No

[06:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
See the page itself :-)

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It hasn't changed since the crawler saw it)

[06:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
I just looked for the string "# in the longdesc-raw.txt file

[06:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
so it's all the pages that have <img longdesc="#...">

[06:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I see, that anchor is just before the image, so not clear how much it's supposed to help

[06:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would say post your findings on public-html

[06:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am more curious if it works in any reasonable way in browser+AT combos

[06:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if not, then energy is probably better directed into more fully implementing ARIA than into making longdesc="#..." work reasonably

[06:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
Whoops

[06:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
Opera's incremental find doesn't work perfectly if you use it before the page has finished loading

[06:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
so there's a few more longdesc="#..."s

[06:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I count 28 values with # signs

[06:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
11 of which are not just "#"

[06:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
most look like similar $top situations

[07:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it possible to have a 0x0 pixel JPEG?

[07:12:00.0000] <Necrathex>
no, but 0x1 is

[07:12:01.0000] <Necrathex>
^_^

[07:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
most image formats seem to have that as a possibility but I don't know about JPEG

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
PNG doesn't ("Zero is an invalid value")

[07:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Necrathex: Peculiar

[07:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
JPEG is all weird and talks about samples and lines instead of width and height :-(

[07:17:01.0000] <Necrathex>
i'm pretty sure you can make a 0x0 svg image

[07:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You can make SVG without size at all, can't you?

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, can't JPEG do 0x0 if you use this special DNL thing to set it to 0?

[07:19:01.0000] <Necrathex>
why do you need an empty image?

[07:19:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Division by zero!

[07:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
or maybe you can only do the DNL thing after the first line

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
if a "scan" is related to a line in some way

[07:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
This seems too complex to bother understanding :-)

[07:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
(or at least too different to terminology I understand)

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Necrathex: Just wondering what could/should happen if you do toDataURL("image/jpeg") on a 0xN or Nx0 canvas

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
and/or if you use drawImage with a 0x0 image

[07:23:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, worthwhile depends on you, it would be useful to a lot of people I think

[07:27:00.0000] <annevk>
/me likes that HTML5 makes LF out of &13; but has no good arguments

[07:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
<othermaciej> also using the <video> element may be higher performance than plugin-based video solutions <-- Are there benchmarks that show this is consistently true?  I've heard conflicting reports.

[07:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I've heard reports <video> is worse than plugins for fullscreen

[07:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
"may be" != "is"

[07:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's certainly possible that it can be higher performance than a plugin, because in the worst case it can be implemented exactly like a plugin and in the best case it can be more tightly integrated with the browser's rendering code

[07:39:00.0000] <fupp>
according to adobe, <video> doesn't solve the performance problem, but does the exact same thing that makes flash slow, to convert YUV data to the RGB colorspace and combine the image with other elements

[07:39:01.0000] <fupp>
http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2010/01/solving_different_problems.html

[07:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fupp: if you profile Firefox running a pageload test, you'll find that one of the top things taking time is the color domain conversion for JPEGs

[07:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so yeah, YUV to RGB is a big deal

[07:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's not the only deal, though

[07:41:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Couldn't a browser do what a dedicated media player does?

[07:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
depends on whether you're doing fancy things like rotating the video or having transparency

[07:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: in the absence of hard SVG filters, yes

[07:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=538323

[07:43:02.0000] <asmodai>
Mmm, could the html in the HTML 4.01 doctype be lowercase as well, or should it always be uppercase? (Can't remember >_< )

[07:43:03.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: yes

[07:43:04.0000] <gsnedders>
It's case-insensitive

[07:43:05.0000] <gsnedders>
HtMl is fine too

[07:43:06.0000] <workmad3>
htmL

[07:43:07.0000] <asmodai>
Heh, I'll just stick to the lowercase then. ^^

[07:44:00.0000] <asmodai>
/me seriously wants to nail this developer to the wall. Not sure which HTML standard he was following, but it was not HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0

[07:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I'd expect rotation and transparency to work if the video is an OpenGL texture converted from YUV to RGB using an OpenGL pixel shader

[07:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and the 2D compositing is done on the GPU

[07:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
although that's not what movie players on Linux do

[07:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
they tend to use xv instead of OpenGL

[07:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why can't you solve color format conversions by just using a different color format in the videos?

[07:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Because YUV compresses much better than RGB

[07:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmph.

[07:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I see.

[07:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is this the sort of thing that parallelizes nicely, so we can all rest assured that in five years we'll do fine because eight cores are standard?

[07:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I imagine you could hand one frame to one CPU and the next to another.

[07:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or something.

[07:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(maybe not, if there's delta encoding or whatnot . . . oh well, not my field)

[07:57:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
so it seems the first f2f meeting of the hybi wg will be March 24 in Anaheim, California.. would be good if we could get some people to attend

[07:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think it will cost you 200 USD for registration, though

[07:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: what's the goal of the meeting? (I'm not planning on attending. just curious.)

[08:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: not sure what the agenda is.. I've not been following the hybi discussions closely for last couple months

[08:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Each pixel is entirely independent, so you can do colour conversions with loads of parallelism

[08:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is why it's good to do it on the GPU rather than CPU, because then you can process hundreds of pixels in parallel

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
as far as I'm aware

[08:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I trust that people who know more than I do will figure out some way to do it efficiently.  :)

[08:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
In five years we'll all have higher-resolution monitors so there'll be more pixels to decode :-)

[08:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
so simply relying on hardware improvements won't fully solve the problem

[08:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: U and V are not truly independent for each pixel, though

[08:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rats.

[08:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: assuming a sampling where the resolution of U and V is lower than the resolution of Y

[08:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess video is pretty close to unlimited resolution, for the foreseeable future.  You can always get better quality until the pixels become invisible.  That's a long way off . . .

[08:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p movie trailers on a 1080p display from a normal movie watching distance

[08:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(as in: downloading the same trailer and 720p and 1080p from Apple and comparing)

[08:07:00.0000] <annevk>
you need at least 42inch or so

[08:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Oh, true

[08:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
but 4x2 blocks (?) should be independent

[08:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
and there's still zillions of those to process in parallel

[08:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I used a 37" display

[08:11:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I'm not a 100% sure of course, but I heard you start seeing the difference from 42"... So presumably you need 50 or so to really see it

[08:11:01.0000] <annevk>
of course, this doesn't stop them from working on 4000+

[08:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that the live action in the newer star wars movies was shot at mere 1080p

Hurrah.

[09:12:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Goodmorning.

[09:37:00.0000] <boblet>
hey Mike…

[09:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[09:39:01.0000] <boblet>
was just chatting to Yakura-san, and he mentioned that a lot of Japanese sites (esp. mobile) use <hr> as a content division. The new “*paragraph-level* thematic break” doesn’t mesh with that usage

[09:40:00.0000] <boblet>
makes sense on eg yahoo.co.jp’s HP when you turn off CSS atm. No <hr> would make it a wall of unstyled content

[09:40:01.0000] <boblet>
(admittedly as opposed to a slightly chunked wall of unstyled content :)

[09:42:00.0000] <boblet>
are UAs eventually expected to differentiate between sectioning content blocks visually when CSS is disabled?

[09:43:00.0000] <boblet>
and with that rousing question I bid you adieu. sleep well…

[09:43:01.0000] <boblet>
nn

[10:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: some Japanese sites have a pattern of doing a number of strange/bizzare things as far as markup goes  

[10:03:00.0000] <boblet>
don’t we know it. ok, nn fo reals this time

[10:04:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I've started ending my emails with "VIVA LA CINCO!"

[10:04:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
In support of HTML5.

[10:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: http://www.p01.org/releases/128b_mandelbrot/115b.htm is b0rked with html5 parser

[10:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: nvm, wfm in 3.7, just not 3.6

[10:30:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Today is battle of the HTML5 day, woohoo.

[10:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
eh?

[10:33:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We've been running out HTML5 website through a gauntlet of tests.

[10:34:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Screenreaders, performance checkers.

[10:34:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Testing to see how much positive or negative the HTML5 impact has been.

[10:35:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
HTMl5 killed 0 accessibility tests on MAC and PC, including using the EYES and JAWS readers.

[10:36:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
In fact, HTML5 in combination with properly layed-out markup improved accessibility, and use of <nav> tag offered improved accessibility in the JAWS reader.

[10:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ooh, JonathanNeal, could you write up your findings?

[10:37:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
For IE6,7,8 we tested the shiv used to add in support for HTML5 elements in the DOM and CSS.

[10:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Especially regarding the results with actual screenreadeers.

[10:37:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, yea and we've been youtub'ing the results.

[10:37:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Awesome.

[10:38:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
You may wanna wait til we've written up our assessments of the results, right now it's scattered.

[10:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[10:38:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We found the HTML5 shiv for IE had an impact of 0.025ms in IE6.

[10:38:03.0000] <miketaylr>
so awesome

[10:39:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
0.015ms in IE8.  We contrast these results with other tests, like document.getElementById, ElementsByTagName.

[10:39:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We're measuring our existing site search results on Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc to see how the content was picked up.

[10:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
JonathanNeal: that's interesting data

[10:41:00.0000] <Necrathex>
what site are we talking about btw?

[10:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, some tests don't require the site, but otherwise we're looking at our site, liferay.com

[10:42:01.0000] <Necrathex>
ah

[10:43:00.0000] <Necrathex>
you actually have ie6-visitors? :)

[10:43:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Which I built exclusively in HTML5 thanks to the help of TabAtkins and many others in here, taking advantage of the new markup as well as the new <video> feature.

[10:43:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We have plenty of IE6 visitors, you'll see Cisco is a client, and they're pretty much all IE6.

[10:43:03.0000] <Necrathex>
that's really nice :)

[10:43:04.0000] <Necrathex>
:x

[10:44:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Guess how many complaints we've received about HTML5, from anyone, even on the forums, or support tickets; 0.

[10:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
JonathanNeal, I wish I could say that about my attempt to get HTML5 into Wikipedia.  Then again, we don't have all this "testing" stuff you've been talking about.

[11:00:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Wikipedia doesn't have "testing" stuff?

[11:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Depends if you consider ordinary users to be testers

[11:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
JonathanNeal, we don't have any formal testing procedure.  The procedure is largely 1) people commit stuff to trunk, 2) users of trunk (mostly developers) hopefully complain when things break, then eventually: 3) test.wikipedia.org is synced to trunk and sysadmins wait a little while to see if there are reports from voluntary testers, 4) all Wikimedia projects are synced to trunk, 5) sysadmins hang around in #wikimedia-tech for a while fieldi

[11:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
ng critical bug reports that weren't caught at an earlier stage.

[11:30:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, AryehGregor, I will be sure to show my results to you and capture any other questions you have.

[11:30:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I hope we can help each other, in the spirit of opensource.

[11:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
JonathanNeal: I am here again

[11:32:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hey gsnedders, cool, did you have a question for me?  I can't recall, it's a been a wild night and morning.

[11:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
JonathanNeal: You tried to get me :P

[11:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
well, the first evidence of the domintro boxes having a negative effect just surfaced... it looks like microsoft read those instead of the normative text.

[11:32:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
gsnedders, cool, do you also know what I was asking you for? :D

[11:33:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I bet it had SOMETHING to do with html5.

[11:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
JonathanNeal: No

[11:33:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
heheh.

[11:33:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, hello friend!

[11:34:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We're doing lots of accessibility tests with HTML5.

[11:35:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Like, for instance, in Chrome you can not tab to a <video> element, but in Firefox you can, and then use spacebar to play and pause the video.

[11:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, did they disagree with the normative text?

[11:35:02.0000] <jwalden>
JonathanNeal: that's a quality-of-implementation thing, right?

[11:35:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
JonathanNeal, neat.  Gecko seems to have better <video> support overall than WebKit right now.

[11:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: no they just said they were confused and quoted the domintro text

[11:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: see public-canvas-api

[11:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
(there's a bug in the spec)

[11:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i believe the &#13; thing was done in response to your feedback...

[11:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: oops...

[11:43:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I've filed a ticket about the <video> keyboard accessibility issue @ http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36472

[11:44:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Might as well push them all to improve. :D

[11:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does Safari have the same issue?  If so, you should probably file with WebKit instead.

[11:45:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, their implementation of <video> differs so greatly.

[11:45:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I think Safari swallows <video> and turns it into a quicktime control.

[11:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"quicktime control"?

[11:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
we do use QuickTime as the media engine but not stock high-level APIs like NSMovie

[11:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How much of the <video> implementation is shared by Safari and Chrome?

[11:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
The spec has annoyingly many conformance requirements

[11:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
We should remove all the conformance requirements, then.

[11:49:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Would that solve the problem?

[11:49:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
othermaciej, yes, the video seems to share the same controls as a quicktime video, though they do not add height to the video as quicktime controls usually do.

[11:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has now reached 306 testable statements for <canvas>

[11:50:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
But that means they're overlapping the bottom portion of the video, since they do not hide themselves.

[11:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That seems low.

[11:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders what all the 105-year-old Internet users do when they get age forms that only go back to 1910 or so

[11:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
It looks like it's probably more than the combined total of http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Test/HTML401/current/assertions/assertions_toc.html

[11:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That says more about HTML 4 than it does about HTML5, though.

[11:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Maybe they do what all the 15-year-old Internet users do, and lie about their age

[11:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assume so.

[11:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, as for video, it seems to me like the spec is sort of painted into a corner.  Authors have to know how much space the video will take up regardless of whether it has built-in controls, but the size of controls would be implementation-dependent.  So it's basically forced to leave no space for UA-provided controls.

[11:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
UAs handle this pretty elegantly, I guess.

[12:09:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
othermaciej, I looked into this Safari issue deeper, let me post a test.

[12:15:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://sandbox.thewikies.com/html5-video-framing/ <-- note the result in Safari.

[12:17:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
We lose the bottom 16 pixels of the video while the controls are visible, which do not hide.

[12:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone (othermaciej) have any comments on these updates to the change proposal for longdesc=""? http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Change_Proposal_for_not_including_longdesc%3D""

[12:18:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
JonathanNeal: the controls are only visible when the video is paused, or when the cursor moves over the element

[12:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
this shows the diffs: http://wiki.whatwg.org/index.php?title=Change_Proposal_for_not_including_longdesc%3D%22%22&action=historysubmit&diff=4448&oldid=4436

[12:19:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
eric_carlson, noted, so it's only for preview.

[12:19:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's fair, the poster attr doesn't work yet either, so I hope to see it all pushed through eventually.

[12:19:03.0000] <eric_carlson>
JonathanNeal: the poster attribute should work in WebKit

[12:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
JonathanNeal, same in Chrome, looks like.

[12:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, no.

[12:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
They fade out if you mouse away.

[12:20:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But not if it's paused.

[12:21:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
These are notes on framing, hpoe I'm not pissing you guys off -- I note the similarity in Chrome too!

[12:26:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It seems unique to the paused state of <video> in Chrome and Safari.

[12:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Sounds good overall.

[12:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
have i missed any arguments?

[12:31:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Kill that longdesc, Hixie :D

[12:31:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, we recently had the same with <canvas> domintro text

[12:31:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, with us it was about drawImage() exceptions

[12:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: the same bug, or the same problem with implementors reading the domintro text?

[12:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it should say "This box is not normative" in every domintro box

[12:32:02.0000] <annevk>
same problem, have not looked at the bug

[12:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: ooh, that's a good idea.

[12:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like people aren't used to the idea that anything that doesn't say "must" is not normative

[12:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I'll try to look over lunch

[12:37:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
From an accessibility standpoint, Firefox's implementation is the best.  The visible controls are unique to the paused state of <video> in Chrome and Safari, whereas Firefox will hide the controls once a mouse has passed into and out of a <video>.  If a mouse has not passed into a <video> but keyboard interaction does, the controls remain visible - it's a visible feature triggered by a visible interaction.

[12:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: One example of a page with useful @longdesc is cssquirrel.com.

[12:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though the last 4 comics' longdescs 404.

[12:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You know, I can understand that FSF wants open codecs, but saying Google owes them a free codec seems taking a bit far...

[12:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does the FSF ever *not* take things a bit far?

[12:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yes.  When they take them more than a bit far.

[12:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: your updates certainly increase the persuasive force of your argumemt

[12:40:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Dashiva, which codec do they want now?

[12:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I guess Chaals or I or someone advising us needs to find at least one example of a page with a good use of longdesc

[12:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
JonathanNeal: VP8

[12:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: one in one trillion is not good odds. :-P

[12:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I agree - though it is infinitely better than zero in a trillion

[12:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm just saying that I don't know if I can stand behind a rationale of "there are some good uses of longdesc" without having at least one to point to

[12:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: CSSquirrel.  Weems uses @longdesc to link to the transcripts for his comics.

[12:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
he also already uses ARIA, and his latest links are 404

[12:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it's not like (a) he uses it correctly and (b) he needs a transition story

[12:50:00.0000] <annevk>
this reminds me of a site from Philip TAYLOR with an incorrect alternate text and a longdesc pointing to a 404

[12:50:01.0000] <annevk>
was a homepage of something

[12:51:00.0000] <tantek>
longdesc arguments are looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong

[12:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder why he does not use aria-describedby for the transcripts, seems pretty harsh to force a page load to get it

[12:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah longdesc="" isn't even a good solution in that case, compared to just putting the text inline

[12:53:00.0000] <tantek>
or an inline visible link to an external transcript

[12:53:01.0000] <tantek>
when or why would you want curbcuts to ever be invisible?

[12:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[12:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
inline visible test or visible link associated with aria-describedby seems to be the best of all possible worlds afaict

[12:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or if you must, you can hide the description in visual media

[12:54:01.0000] <tantek>
better to err on the side of visibility (somebody else might find use for the information) than err on the side of invisibility (some developer might be annoyed at having to make it visible)

[12:54:02.0000] <tantek>
also - note that in that case user need should win over author/developer need - per the design principles

[12:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
aria-describedby defaults to visibility, which is nice

[12:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i added something to the Risks and Negative Effect sections

[12:56:01.0000] <tantek>
are there any conforming and recommended invisible content features in HTML5 currently?

[12:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does alt count?

[12:57:01.0000] <tantek>
no - because alt is visible when you load a browser with images turned off (a common preference in browsers)

[12:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
do the various <meta name> and <link rel> types without default visible effect count?

[12:57:03.0000] <tantek>
and some browsers show alt while images are loading (e.g. over slow connections)

[12:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'll post this to the list later if nobody has any more suggestions in the meantime

[12:58:01.0000] <tantek>
which just demonstrates another curbcut scenario - what was intended for accessibility helps those with slow networks

[12:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Change_Proposal_for_not_including_longdesc%3D""

[12:58:03.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej - yes, meta name needs to be dropped nearly universally

[12:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
diffs at http://wiki.whatwg.org/index.php?title=Change_Proposal_for_not_including_longdesc%3D%22%22&action=historysubmit&diff=&oldid=4436

[12:59:01.0000] <tantek>
link rel is typically programmatic rather than content oriented - like script

[12:59:02.0000] <Dashiva>
"Not including" is probably going to be misunderstood to "not supporting"

[13:00:00.0000] <tantek>
you might argue that the "title" attribute on link is invisible content, but it is only advisory, and in the context of alternate style sheets - for user agents that support them (e.g. Mozilla back in the day), those titles are visible when choosing an alternative

[13:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva added comment to hte summary for you

[13:02:00.0000] <tantek>
/me fixes the link to the wiki placed in IRC to be more regex-auto-linking proof.

[13:03:00.0000] <tantek>
so, once again, any conforming invisible content in HTML5 other than meta name (which IMHO should be dropped) ?

[13:04:00.0000] <annevk>
<link>?

[13:05:00.0000] <annevk>
<rp>, <input type=hidden>

[13:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
hidden=""

[13:06:01.0000] <tantek>
annevk - see above about <link>

[13:07:00.0000] <tantek>
(in short - it's more programmatic like script than any kind of content)

[13:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
fallback in <object>, <canvas>, <video>, <iframe>, <audio>, etc

[13:07:02.0000] <annevk>
hmm, <link rel=prev> and all are not

[13:07:03.0000] <tantek>
fallbacks are not invisible because they show up when the primary content fails

[13:08:00.0000] <annevk>
only a few in http://annevankesteren.nl/2010/01/optimizing-html are programmatic

[13:08:01.0000] <tantek>
/me would like something akin to <rp> for general use

[13:08:02.0000] <annevk>
but I'm not sure they're very useful either, to be honest

[13:08:03.0000] <annevk>
I included them because at the time using <link> like that made sense

[13:08:04.0000] <annevk>
it was the HTML4-way

[13:09:00.0000] <annevk>
markup gods would give you a compliment and you'd feel good about yourself; nowadays it feels more like bloat :)

[13:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
the markup gods are dead? :-)

[13:12:00.0000] <tantek>
annevk - there's good markup for practical reasons, and there's good markup for dogmatic reasons. some disagree about which category any particular technique falls into.

[13:13:00.0000] <tantek>
e.g. I've found plenty of practical use in making biglot documents, especially recently.

[13:13:01.0000] <tantek>
there's plenty of XML based tools that are useful (e.g. in PHP, DOMDocument etc.)

[13:14:00.0000] <tantek>
so until all these backend languages have built-in support for html5lib - biglot documents are useful (and thus the space slash for empty elements like <img /> etc.)

[13:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh bi-glot, i was reading big-lot

[13:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finishes updating his canvas test assertion list, and ends up with 311 (excluding the focus management section)

[13:16:00.0000] <tantek>
e.g. the software running on my current site to post to Twitter etc. uses an hAtom biglot store.

[13:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't think he's ever seen any tool in which space-slash is needed

[13:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(instead of no-space slash)

[13:18:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, you should create a patch for the source code of html5 so you don't have to do it again everytime

[13:18:01.0000] <annevk>
but I guess hixie would have to maintain it then

[13:18:02.0000] <tantek>
Philip' - I believe the "lore" is that some browsers need the space before the slash in order to treat those elements properly

[13:19:00.0000] <tantek>
/me does not have specific tests for this though - it may just be out of date lore.

[13:22:00.0000] <tantek>
/me prefers to use biglot HTML5+hAtom for storage of small numbers of things rather than pay the DBA-tax (e.g. MySQL).

[13:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I don't have to redo the whole thing, I just have to add/remove/update whatever's changed since the last version of the spec

[13:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
so it's no harder than if the markers were inline in the spec

[13:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
The main problem is the last version of the spec was 1.5 years old, and it's changed a bit since then

[13:23:02.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, re: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Change_Proposal_for_not_including_longdesc - where is the section on how longdesc harms accessibility?

[13:23:03.0000] <annevk>
mostly because of you :p

[13:23:04.0000] <tantek>
I think that needs to be made explicit

[13:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
tantek: By "lore", you mean dogma? :-)

[13:25:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip` usually it's a transition from experience to lore to dogma.

[13:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
No modern browser could require the space because it'd break on web content

[13:25:02.0000] <tantek>
by the time it makes it to dogma, because the lore became detached from experience, it is no longer possible to retest the original hypotheses.

[13:25:03.0000] <tantek>
Philip` - which web content would it break on?

[13:25:04.0000] <Philip`>
and (if I remember correctly) even Netscape 1 worked fine with no space

[13:26:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip` - do you have test cases of all HTML empty elements with no-space slash? Including tests to ensure than any attributes before the no-space slash are handled correctly?

[13:28:00.0000] <Philip`>

I think it could be more strongly worded

evidence demonstrates that longdesc has harmed accessibility

[13:39:02.0000] <tantek>
those same studies

ok why does .domintro:before { display: block; margin: -1em -0.5em 0 auto; width: auto; content: '...'; border: solid thin; background: white; padding: 0 0.25em; }  result in a box that fills the width of the ocntaining block???

[13:39:04.0000] <tantek>
that show all the garbage values

[13:39:05.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: they don't demonstrate harm to users

[13:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: just that the data is bogus

tantek: it is argued that UAs are ignoring longdesc="" values that are bogus

[13:39:08.0000] <Hixie>
or that they could

[13:39:09.0000] <Hixie>
or some such

[13:40:00.0000] <tantek>
how can they tell that the values are bogus?

[13:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
beats me

[13:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i'd rather not explicitly say there is harm caused unless i can prove it

I think the intrinsic width values are vendor-prefixed right now?

[13:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
slowest. moving. wg. ever.

[13:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just use display:table, yeah.  That's the current hacky form of width:min-intrinsic.

[13:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
For real.

[13:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok good, that works

   .domintro:before { display: block; margin: -1em -0.5em 0 auto; width: auto; content: 'This box is non-normative. Implementation requirements are given below this box.'; col\

Oh, it's not

[16:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-a11y/2010Feb/0451.html

[16:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
right

[16:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
i replied asking if we could make it public

[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
i cannot work out a way to make Web Socket safe from cross-protocol attacks from HTML pages without sacrificing the HTTP compatibility

[16:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
unless we can use a new method... maybe that would be acceptable

[16:37:00.0000] <rauchg>
let's just move to SPDY

[16:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=292 (about video) seems interesting

[16:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
(particularly since it's by someone who actually knows about video codecs)

[16:40:00.0000] <miketaylr>
needs moar contrast

[16:46:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie FWIW I agree with making all surveys regarding HTML5, even in TFs, public.

[16:52:00.0000] <hober>
tantek: indeed. the WG is chartered to do its work in public; the same should apply to its TFs.

[17:04:00.0000] <bfrantz>
a few days ago i had mentioned that there is disparity in how FF3.5 (+others) and IE8(+others) treat the entity body when encountering a 404. after some testing it turns out they all (opera, chrome, safari, ie, firefox) respect the entity body provided it is over 512bytes.  again, i'm unsure if html5 is the place to document or standardize on the "correct" behavior but thought I would provide the update for those interested.

[17:27:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: the x264 developers are pretty rabidly in favour of H.264

[17:27:01.0000] <roc>
unsurprisingly

[17:27:02.0000] <roc>
and there are some errors in that article

[17:27:03.0000] <roc>
> even though H.264 is licensed under RAND terms (Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory, they legally cannot be anti-competitive)

[17:27:04.0000] <roc>
I don't think that's true at all

[19:58:00.0000] <rektide>
i'm trying to use SharedWorkers, and have a base case written up that I cant seem to get to do anything.  its at http://rektide.voodoowarez.com/2010/2/ping.html

[20:00:00.0000] <rektide>
it should just post a message to the sahred worker, which should reply back.  i cant see any evidence of communication actually happening.  not sure whether its my code thats wrong, or whether the browsers silently dont implement any SharedWorker functionality.

[20:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
bfrantz: one thing you could do is to raise a bug report in the HTML5/HTMLWG bugzilla along the lines of, "HTML5 spec should mandate consistent UA behavior for handling of entity bodies for 404 responses"

[20:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
bfrantz: others can/will respond there

[20:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that way there's some record of the conversation a resolution

[20:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would guess that one likely outcome is that the editor will say it's out of scope fo the HTML5 spec and should be covered by the HTTP spec

[20:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
bfrantz: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=HTML%20WG

[20:03:01.0000] <bfrantz>
sweet, I was just googling that 

[20:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Julian Reschke from the HTTP WG follows HTML5 bug mail pretty closely, so if you raise a bug report there, he will probably see it

[20:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, I can always give him a heads-up about it too

[20:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: I don't know what browsers you are trying it in but I know that Shared Workers are supported in Chrome at least

[20:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there's a page that shows up-to-date status on Chrome standards support

[20:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to look for it

[20:11:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders if cying may have done any app development yet using shared Workers

[20:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: page is here: http://www.chromium.org/developers/web-platform-status

[20:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it looks like it's less up-to-date that I thought

[20:12:02.0000] <rektide>
MikeSmith: i've been using Chrome, Opera 10.50 and desktop team releases, and firefox trunk.  thusfar, my absolutely primitive example code doesnt seem to do anything whatsoever on any browser.

[20:12:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems to have not been updated since December

[20:12:04.0000] <cying>
MikeSmith: hm, not sure

[20:12:05.0000] <cying>
MikeSmith: i know the general idea

[20:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: I don't remember hearing anything about any support at all for workers in Opera yet

[20:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but maybe I missed something

[20:13:02.0000] <rektide>
trying other browsers was an act of desperation when i couldnt get Chrome to do anything

[20:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I know mozilla has workers support, but I don't know if they support shared Workers

[20:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
cying: rektide has a script that uses shared Workers but it seems not to behave as expected in Chrome

[20:15:00.0000] <rektide>
its http://rektide.voodoowarez.com/2010/2/ping.html

[20:15:01.0000] <rektide>
it really should be an absolute minimum use case... send a ping to a SharedWorker, get a pong back.

[20:15:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
cying: so had just been wondering if you might have written anything using shared workers and might have any troubleshooting insight

[20:15:03.0000] <rektide>
but it doesnt appear to actually be doing anything whatsoever. :/  i cant get any evidence whatsoever the SharedWorker exists / was created

[20:16:00.0000] <cying>
ah nope

[20:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: you checking with the error console and/or other script debugging features in Web Inspector?

[20:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
cying: OK, just thought it was worth asking you at least :)

[20:16:03.0000] <cying>
heh

[20:18:00.0000] <rektide>
MikeSmith: i have.  the debugger seems to be isolated from the SharedWorker scope

[20:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[20:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sounds like another area where web inspector could use some improvements

[20:20:00.0000] <JoePeck>
MikeSmith: mention it in #webkit-inspector I'm sure they would be interested

[20:20:01.0000] <JoePeck>
although, I think this may have been raised before

[20:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey JoePeck 

[20:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I didn't know about #web-inspector

[20:21:00.0000] <rektide>
just threw them a quick message. figure its worth mentioning.

[20:21:01.0000] <JoePeck>
#webkit-inspector

[20:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: maybe also worth trying on #chromium-support

[20:22:00.0000] <rektide>
i'll probably post to chromium-dev group

[20:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as this channel, I guess it's kind of off-hours for Europe and North America right now

[20:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's usually very quiet here this time of day

[20:24:00.0000] <rektide>
ugg there's a chromium html5 google group.  perfect forum!  it just looks crazy inactive.

[21:01:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, in Firefox video there are some keyboard controls, like SPACE, LEFT, and RIGHT, are there any others?

[21:12:00.0000] <doublec>
JonathanNeal, home and end

[21:14:00.0000] <doublec>
JonathanNeal, meta-down, meta-up, meta-left, meta-right

[21:14:01.0000] <doublec>
JonathanNeal, from what I can see perusing the source

[21:14:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
oh, what do those do and how do I trigger "meta" down.

[21:15:00.0000] <doublec>
JonathanNeal, I don't know what the 'meta' key is but meta up/down is mute/unmute. meta left/right is seek 10% increments rather than 15 seconds without the meta.

[21:17:00.0000] <doublec>
JonathanNeal, apparently the windows key or apple/command

[21:17:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Oh okay.

[21:18:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm working on the Flash equiv for a Video For Everybody fallback.

[21:18:01.0000] <doublec>
nice

[21:19:00.0000] <doublec>
I'm not sure how those key actions were decided upon - other browsers will be different i'm sure

[22:18:00.0000] <bfrantz>
anyone know where to find data on the compat hit a user will experience if they config their browser to speak only TLS 1.2 vice TLS 1.1 or 1.0 ?

[22:51:00.0000] <JonathanNeal_oww>
http://sandbox.thewikies.com/html5-video/

[22:52:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I know there's no real documentation yet, but I'm looking for folks who can help me write up some documentation.

[23:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
doublec: do I recall correctly that you blogged a few days back about an CVS attribute-naming conflict?

[23:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me doesn't find mention of it at Bluish Coder..

[23:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc, maybe?

[23:10:02.0000] <roc>
certainly not me

[23:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc, er, I meant SVG attribute-naming conflict

[23:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
freudian slip

[23:15:02.0000] <roc>
that sounds more like me, but it wasn't :-)

[23:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, found it

[23:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
'twas Hallvord

[23:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://my.opera.com/hallvors/blog/2010/02/16/svg-adds-style-filter-now-where-have-we-seen-that-before

[23:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
shepazu: ↑

[23:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
" It has been raised as an issue with the SVG working group, who discussed it and decided to sweep the issue under the carpet with an informative warning in the spec."

[23:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
harsh words

[23:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me comes across "The conformance checker has been configured to assume that the document is an e-mail or document intended for a specific person who is known to be able to view images." in r4795 diff..

[23:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me imagines "Valid HTML for e-mail" and "Valid HTML for documents intended for a specific person who is known to be able to view images" badges

[23:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: nothing requires conformance checkers to support such a configuration

[23:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: true that nothing requires it, but the inclusion of it in the spec could be seen as implying it would be a good idea for conformance checkers to provide such options

[23:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: maybe V.nu would be differently configured if used for Mail.app

[23:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: yeah, something like that would make sense, true

[23:31:02.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: while the web service is configured to assume that all documents being validated are public web pages intended for anyone

[23:31:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[23:55:00.0000] <roc>
MikeSmith: we knew about the problem Hallvord talks about

[23:56:00.0000] <roc>
none of the proposed solutions are very good

[23:56:01.0000] <roc>
so we decided to tackle the problem head-on by exposing style.filter in Firefox and seeing how bad the compatibility problem is

[23:57:00.0000] <roc>
if the problem isn't bad, or we can persuade sites to fix their detection logic, then the Web wins. If the problem is really bad and unfixable, then we'll back off and nothing is really lost. Hallvord should be thanking us :-)

[23:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
interesting

[23:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
have you gotten much feedback or data yet on sites breaking?

[23:58:01.0000] <roc>
not yet

[23:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[23:58:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
this is a fairly recent change?

[23:58:04.0000] <roc>
yes

[23:58:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[23:58:06.0000] <roc>
checked in 12 days ago

[23:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
whoah, very recent indeed

[23:59:01.0000] <roc>
probably only 10-20K users have that change so far

[23:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I'm one of those, since I'm running a recent Minefield

[23:59:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I look forward to hearing the results of the experiment

[00:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me too

[00:03:00.0000] <roc>
if you guys know of any sites that are likely to be broken, you could let us know in bug 374216 :-)

[00:03:01.0000] <roc>
The webkit changeset that introduced undetectable 'filter' ( http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/15557 ) only references one site, housingmaps.com, which appears to work now

[00:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I have a strong recollection of there being more but I could not locate them with bug archaeology

[00:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: housingmaps we were pretty sure would be fixed soon enough, because even then the copy of Google Maps code they were using was out of date and the latest version had the fix

[00:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I recall some other sites that had a three-way test for filter, -moz-opacity and opacity, in that order of preference

[00:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
JW in the minutes is jwatt, right?

[00:10:00.0000] <roc>
yes

[00:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
do VP6 videos in Flash usually use MP3 for audio?

[00:15:00.0000] <asmodai>
Jeez, sometimes I think I'm the only techie that abhors conferences.

[00:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there are some people who enjoy going to conferences

[00:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
asmodai: i hear ya

[00:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me hates them too

[00:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
though not as much as teleconferences

[00:16:04.0000] <asmodai>
My colleagues here were all jumpy about going to a PHPcon

[00:16:05.0000] <othermaciej>
there might even be some people in that category who produce significant technical achievements

[00:16:06.0000] <asmodai>
and I am like: meh

[00:16:07.0000] <roc>
it entirely depends on the conference

[00:16:08.0000] <asmodai>
would rather go to Pycon at the moment

[00:16:09.0000] <othermaciej>
the phone is my least-favorite communications medium

[00:16:10.0000] <asmodai>
And I intensely dislike conferences.

[00:17:00.0000] <asmodai>
Can't even stand to talk shop outside of my work hours.

[00:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
especially in group format

[00:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
hear hear

[00:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
actually I might hate video chat even more, not sure

[00:17:04.0000] <asmodai>
If there's a group with techies and another with women, I'm over there talking about life with the women

[00:17:05.0000] <roc>
I'm encouraged that out of the top 100 Google hits for "if style.filter", only one actually is testing style.filter in JS (although several are testing style.filters, whatever that is), and that one tests for 'opacity' first

[00:17:06.0000] <asmodai>
Hixie: Glad to hear I ain't alone in that :)

[00:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
conferences are nice to attend, but traveling there sucks (esp. over multiple time zones)

[00:20:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: to each his/her own

[00:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what if there's a group of women techies talking about lifehacking?

[00:21:01.0000] <asmodai>
othermaciej: Mmm

[00:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: that would be a pretty noteworthy event

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I hear telepresence systems are awesome compared to traditional video conferencing

[00:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I haven't tried telepresence systems myself, though

[00:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know what exactly constitutes a "telepresence system"

[00:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
my main video chat experience is with iChat

[00:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
even when it's pretty good, it's pretty lame

[00:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I could imagine doing better with a lot more bandwidth

[00:26:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but it kinda creeps me out

[00:26:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: a carefully tuned room where you sit across the table from a quality display that shows the remote people in a similar room elsewhere

[00:26:05.0000] <othermaciej>
ChatRoulette is basically my worst nightmare

[00:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if anyone ever needs to torture a state secret out of me, make me use ChatRoulette until I break

[00:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: where the whole room including the color temperature of the lighting has been built according to Cisco's specs

[00:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
sounds fancy

[00:27:03.0000] <roc>
mmm Cisco

[00:27:04.0000] <roc>
I've got a story about Cisco

[00:27:05.0000] <roc>
Worst. Firefox. Bug. Ever.

[00:28:00.0000] <roc>
"crash in Cairo spline subdivision code while Cisco VPN enabled"

[00:31:00.0000] <annevk>
the SVG WG should have named it cssFilter

[00:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that sounds pretty awful

[00:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Maybe http://philip.html5.org/data/if-style-filter.txt might be relevant?

[00:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: the SVG WG shouldn't have even named the CSS property itself "filter"

[00:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it was lame

[00:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
they were warned

[00:32:03.0000] <annevk>
true

[00:32:04.0000] <othermaciej>
they were not thinking about tight integration with browsers at the time

[00:32:05.0000] <roc>
Philip`: ta

[00:32:06.0000] <Hixie>
roc: wow, what on earth was the story behind _that_?!

[00:32:07.0000] <annevk>
i guess it is somewhat the fault of the browsers for not participating from the start and then trying to implement it anyway

[00:33:00.0000] <annevk>
starting with Opera...

[00:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you're not jaded enough if you are truly surprised by that

[00:34:01.0000] <roc>
turns out that Cisco's VPN kernel driver, under rare, random circumstances when processing network traffic, will corrupt the floating point registers of user processes

[00:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[00:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I must admit I've never had a browser bug turn out to actually be a kernel bug

[00:34:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(other than perf issues)

[00:35:00.0000] <roc>
most of the time, people probably don't notice, since wrong floating point values usually don't cause programs to crash

[00:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
however, we *have* had the production compiler from the OS build train miscompile our code

[00:35:02.0000] <roc>
spline subdivision is one case where they do (the tolerance value got replaced by NaN, and the recursive subdivision never terminated)

[00:36:00.0000] <roc>
I wonder how many Wall St firms use Cisco VPN on machines running financial simulations, though

[00:37:00.0000] <annevk>
that could be fun

[00:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yikes

[00:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(though NaN would probably lead to an obvious error)

[00:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
has Cisco fixed their code yet?

[00:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
can somebody remind me what does the HTML5 parsing algorithm do for a text/html document that has an svg element as its root element?

[00:39:02.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: yes, in the latest version

[00:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: can't happen

[00:39:04.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: it generates <html><head></head><body>before the <svg>

[00:39:05.0000] <Hixie>
what hsivonen said

[00:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: so as Hixie says, you can't have an svg root

[00:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[00:40:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I meant the serialized document

[00:40:03.0000] <hsivonen>
It only looks like a root :-)

[00:40:04.0000] <hsivonen>
there's no spoon there

[00:41:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, you mean what happens when you serialize an HTML document that has <svg> as root?

[00:41:01.0000] <annevk>
nothing special I think

[00:41:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean what happens if you serve an svg document as text/html

[00:46:00.0000] <annevk>
what hsivonen said

[00:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[00:48:00.0000] <annevk>
so I wonder if IE9 is a) shipping around MIX and b) has SVG in HTML support as seems to be hinted on the IE blog

[00:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think they'd be shipping in a month when they haven't even started a beta yet

[00:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
If they do have SVG-in-HTML, I wonder if it is per the HTML5 draft, or using IE's namespaces in HTML

[00:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
(As of a few days ago, they have been "closing down the Internet Explorer 8 Feedback Program in preparation for soliciting feedback for our next version", so maybe the IE9 beta will be around MIX)

[00:54:00.0000] <asmodai>
I wonder how standards compliant in general it will be anyway.

[00:54:01.0000] <asmodai>
IE remains a strange beast

[00:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"All you'll have to do is feed

[00:58:01.0000] <zcorpan>
it into the appropriate compiler (also to be defined in the HTML5 spec)

[00:58:02.0000] <zcorpan>
and out will come a working browser."

[00:58:03.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess writing such a compiler has about the same complexity as writing a working browser

[00:59:00.0000] <roc>
MIX won't have an IE9 beta

[00:59:01.0000] <roc>
they'll announce a bunch of IE9 features though

[01:00:00.0000] <roc>
(IE builds won't even be generally available within Microsoft)

[01:01:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, this is public info?

[01:01:01.0000] <roc>
not really

[01:05:00.0000] <asmodai>
Now it is since this channel is logged.

[01:05:01.0000] <asmodai>
;)

[01:05:02.0000] <roc>
that's not exactly sensitive information

[01:06:00.0000] <asmodai>
/me grins

[01:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
roc might be making things up

[01:09:01.0000] <roc>
indeed

[01:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Besides, he works for a competitor :P

[01:10:01.0000] <roc>
I could be a double agent

[01:10:02.0000] <roc>
or a triple agent

[01:11:00.0000] <roc>
or just an agent

[01:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
or a user agent

[01:11:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Is he conforming?

[01:11:03.0000] <zcorpan>
he's a conforming html4 UA

[01:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
assuming he renders quotes around <q>s

[01:12:01.0000] <Dashiva>
With his fingers, I assume

[01:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[01:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
does he assume a default encoding?

[01:13:02.0000] <zcorpan>
no

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
sounds compliant to me

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the about: URL registration sure takes a long time

[01:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for taking stuff off Hixie's plate

[01:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
was about: registration on my plate?

[01:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I thought it might have been

[01:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've registered two schemes in the past year

[01:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
ws: and wss:

[01:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
it was relatively easy

[01:16:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
asmodai: do you know of another channel around here where I can talk about life with the women?

[01:17:00.0000] <annevk>
there was the whole TAG thing that you should use http://websockets.org/{uri-here} instead or some such...

[01:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
>8 pages have longdesc="#".

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: whoa, whoa. what problem does *that* solve?

[01:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders if any AT would be able to create an infinite loop from that

[01:19:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, beats me

[01:19:02.0000] <asmodai>
MikeSmith: Mmm -- good one, most of the women I talk to are on my IM. XD

[01:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
Is that the same argument they used for XRIs?

[01:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: It seemed to me that TAG just wants everything to be http

[01:20:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, could be, yes

[01:21:00.0000] <danbri>
if not the TAG, then a lot of folk on the TAG list (and URI list)

[01:21:01.0000] <danbri>
there was some discussion lately about having platforms dispatch on substrings of full URI, rather than just the scheme name... wonder if that'll go anywhere

[01:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And then at some later point, they'll have platforms that dispatch on substrings of substrings

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does the TAG have a stated opinion on how things on FTP servers should be addressed from an href?

[01:23:01.0000] <asmodai>
Is that data URI scheme being mandated in the HTML5 spec, by the way? I remember the first time I wanted to use on-the-fly generated images and it was great using that until you find out it was only supported by one or two browsers. :(  (And I still need to find out why the bloody spec sometimes hangs my Firefox.)

[01:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should set up http://redire.ct/ftp://ftp.example.com/pub/...

[01:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
asmodai: data: support is not required by html5 afaik

[01:25:01.0000] <asmodai>
zcorpan: A pity

[01:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
not is http: support :-)

[01:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
nor, rather

[01:25:04.0000] <Dashiva>
But all modern browsers support it for images, I believe

[01:25:05.0000] <zcorpan>
asmodai: except maybe for canvas toDataURL() which requires serializing as data:

[01:25:06.0000] <Philip`>
Only small ones, in IE8

[01:25:07.0000] <asmodai>
Dashiva: Oh really? I hadn't retested that since I last did it. Granted, a few new major ones came out in the mean time.

[01:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: How small is small?

[01:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I don't think the ability to generate data: strings really counts as data: support

[01:26:02.0000] <asmodai>
Small would be ok if it would be big enough for sparklines.

[01:26:03.0000] <Philip`>
since you can do that anyway by writing <script>var uri = "data:,";</script>

[01:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
Reading data URIs is probably the slightly more interesting thing :-)

[01:27:00.0000] <asmodai>
You wound me with your semantics. :P

[01:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Wikipedia says 32KB

[01:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not sure if that's before or after base64 encoding

[01:29:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i think it's the url's length

[01:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc848897(VS.85).aspx

[01:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
"Data URIs cannot be larger than 32,768 characters."

[01:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0765.html

[01:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
asmodai, if you have AdBlock plus installed, add a filter so that it blocks the script http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/status.js . That will resolve the issues with the spec hanging Firefox.

[01:32:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It's unacceptable to tell people how to do proper accessibility

[01:32:03.0000] <danbri>
(in some charset...? I guess 32768 japanese chars might be too big?)

[01:33:00.0000] <asmodai>
Lachy: ahhh!

[01:33:01.0000] <asmodai>
Lachy: Let me try that

[01:33:02.0000] <zcorpan>
danbri: i'd assume s/characters/bytes/

[01:33:03.0000] <Dashiva>
danbri: It's either base64 or percent-encoded, either way there's no Japanese 

[01:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: doesn't have to be percent-encoded

[01:34:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i think

[01:34:02.0000] <asmodai>
Lachy: I was driving myself nuts with it, because it kept locking up Firefox.

[01:34:03.0000] <Dashiva>
"If set to base64, this parameter specifies that the data specified by the sResourceData parameter is encoded as base64; otherwise, the data is assumed to be percent-encoded."

[01:34:04.0000] <asmodai>
Lachy: Is that a bug within Firefox?

[01:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"The resource data must be properly encoded; otherwise, an error occurs and the resource is not loaded. The "#" and "%" characters must be encoded, as well as control characters, non-US ASCII characters, and multibyte characters."

[01:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
Windows never uses bytes - I expect it's more likely to be UTF-16 code units than anything else

[01:35:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: sure, doesn't say how much if anything actually is percent-encoded

[01:36:00.0000] <danbri>
does javascript inside data: URIs ever get interpreted? 

[01:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
danbri: sure

[01:36:02.0000] <asmodai>
Sounds like data: could use some clarification then ;)

[01:36:03.0000] <Dashiva>
zcorpan: non-ascii and multibyte seems pretty clear

[01:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
data:,%C3%A5 and data:,å both work but have different length

[01:40:01.0000] <zcorpan>
um

[01:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the latter was supposed to say "å"

[01:41:01.0000] <asmodai>
did for me?

[01:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, then it's opera doing something bogus with showing urls in irc

[01:42:01.0000] <asmodai>
/me pats irssi

[01:42:02.0000] <danbri>
/me see a with a bobble-hat in both lines

[01:42:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what the "platform" changes to Opera on Mac and Linux are

[01:42:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Cocoa? newer Qt? Gtk?

[01:43:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, yeah, in email as well

[01:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: bug reported?

[01:43:02.0000] <annevk>
no, it's just now that you mention it

[01:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah, it seems Opera 10.50 on Mac is Cocoa

[01:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is a bit surprised Opera made the migration this late

[01:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: could you report it? i'm in the middle of video stuff

[01:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me can't find a blog post explaining what the "platform" changes on Linux are

[01:48:00.0000] <Rik|work>
hsivonen: http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/happy-new-year ?

[01:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik|work: I see. 

[01:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik|work: interesting choice of making an app that works without either Gtk+ or Qt these days

[01:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and the can optionally use either

[01:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the menus in the latest .deb release of Opera were seriously 1995

[01:50:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, yup, done

[01:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Which menus? It looks OK to me

[02:43:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I'm not sure whether XHR origin is always equal to Document origin

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
when would it not be?

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not XHR origin that matters, it's script origin, surely

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk>
if that's true there's no need for an XHR origin

[02:45:01.0000] <annevk>
annoyingly I forgot the original scenario

[02:46:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe the origin always matched and it was just the base URL that was a different concept

[02:47:00.0000] <annevk>
the base URL coming from the Document of which the Window object had the XHR constructor object

[02:47:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm, so maybe I should kill XHR origin in favor of HTML5 script origin

[02:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
origin is new, right?

[02:48:00.0000] <annevk>
new?

[02:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
like, not implemented before you started adding stuff

[02:49:00.0000] <annevk>
the Origin header you mean?

[02:49:01.0000] <annevk>
/me is a bit confused

[02:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
me too

[02:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm talking about whatever you pass the 'fetch' algorithm

[02:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
i think that's only for Origin header purposes

[02:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
so yeah, the header

[02:50:00.0000] <annevk>
right, that's new, but it would make sense if it matched what I defined to be "XMLHttpRequest origin"

[02:50:01.0000] <annevk>
I'm realizing the concept of "XMLHttpRequest origin" might not be needed; i.e. just XMLHttpRequest base URL is needed

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not familiar enough with XHR to say one way or the other

[02:52:00.0000] <annevk>
my point was that if "XMLHttpRequest origin" is justified, the Origin header from HTML5 fetch needs to match what it says

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
not necessarily

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
a lot of the checks for script origin use the "effective origin" which is made using document.domain

[02:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
whereas the Origin: header is always made from the original origin

[02:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
which one does XHR use?

[02:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
can you XHR to the document.domain domain?

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess not, since you need a port and once you set document.domain you have no port

[02:55:00.0000] <annevk>
XHR does not care about document.domain

[02:55:01.0000] <annevk>
ah, but thanks for bringing that up

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
even for the cross-document accesses?

[02:56:01.0000] <annevk>
so you have an iframe foo.example.org and a normal page bar.example.org

[02:56:02.0000] <annevk>
both set document.domain

[02:56:03.0000] <annevk>
to example.org

[02:56:04.0000] <annevk>
bar.example.org has the iframe

[02:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
so now foo can sent Origin: bar using bar's XHR?

[02:56:06.0000] <annevk>
bar.example.org then gets the XHR constructor out of foo.example.org

[02:56:07.0000] <annevk>
the request you make with that XHR is based on origin bar.example.org

[02:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, good

[02:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
then you're using the entry script

[02:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
('s document's origin)

[02:57:03.0000] <annevk>
the script runs on foo.example.org, no?

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
you said bar.example.org then gets the XHR constructor, so i presume the entry script is from bar

[02:58:01.0000] <annevk>
damn it, I missed up

[02:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
but what happens if you pass the object to foo?

[02:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
does the same object then change origin?

[02:58:04.0000] <annevk>
foo.example.org gets a constructor out of bar.example.org and uses it, the origin is bar.example.org

[02:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
as in, is it the caller that decides the Origin: header, or the object?

[02:58:06.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[02:58:07.0000] <Hixie>
that's not the entry script then

[02:58:08.0000] <annevk>
right

[02:58:09.0000] <Hixie>
quite different from how Origin: works in HTML5

[02:59:00.0000] <annevk>
the origin and base URL of XHR are determined by where its constructor comes from

[02:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What if you use the XMLHttpRequest object from a different window?

[02:59:02.0000] <annevk>
yes, same for base URL

[02:59:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, that's what you meant

[03:00:00.0000] <annevk>
therefore I was saying that fetch should be modified somehow so that Origin matches the XHR origin

[03:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
Origin? or Referer?

[03:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
you pass in the value for Origin, so that's not a problem

[03:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
Referer however comes from the script currently

[03:02:00.0000] <annevk>
oh ok

[03:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
to pass an origin you just say "fetch foo from bar" where foo is the URL or resource and bar is the origin

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9017 confused me

[03:04:01.0000] <annevk>
there you said something that indeed is not in the spec

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[03:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://rishida.net/scripts/uniview/conversion.php - wonder if rishida knows about redirects

[03:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i assumed that his tool was broken since, well, it didn't work anymore

[03:08:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, there you say "The 'origin' parameter is only used for deciding if there should be an Origin header"

[03:08:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it is also used for its value as it turns out

[03:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh, right

[03:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
sorry, i was speaking more loosely than i should have

[03:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me sends an email to rishida

[03:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: shouldn't the categories table include formatBlock candidates?

[03:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, forgot about that one for some reason. Can you file a new bug for that?

[03:30:02.0000] <zcorpan>
sure

[03:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: could you move focus to the close button when filing a bug?

[03:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i've filed dups twice now because i've pressed enter as an attempt to close the dialog

[03:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can just leave the box, it'll disappear after 10 seconds

[03:33:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't want to wait for 10 seconds

[03:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
if i move focus, it ruins the select() on the text field for keyboard users

[03:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i can make ESC hide it or something

[03:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
file a bug on that too

[03:33:05.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm about to go to bed)

[03:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
(thanks)

[03:34:01.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe you should make it not cover the whole screen so that it's ignorable for 10 seconds

[03:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah... put that in the bug too, i'll see what i can do

[03:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
mark it P1 critical

[03:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i remember to look at it

[03:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, bed time

[03:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[03:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks for filing the bugs

[03:40:03.0000] <zcorpan>

[03:45:00.0000] <annevk>
Bing is even worse

[03:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, if the spec says what it does now then it's incompatible with deployed usage

[03:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
In a really big way

Ye gods, now I remember why I disliked zenburn as colour scheme. It just tends to blend into each other. Guess I better implement my own scheme.

[04:07:00.0000] <asmodai>
Guess colour schemes are as religious as it comes to shells, browsers, MUAs... :)

/me didn't actually read that article but doing one step down from skimming it suggested that his problem was that linear pixel averages should be replaced by gamma-weighted pixel averages

[04:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which I guess web browsers won't do because it would hurt performance

[05:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
(not that I have any special insight or anything)

"As others have pointed out: why have so many willfull violations to support legacy content if there is *no legacy HTML5 content to support?*"

[05:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Where is *that* from, Dashiva?

[05:54:01.0000] <annevk>
bugs

[05:54:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Augh god.

[05:54:03.0000] <annevk>
just somebody missing the point

[05:54:04.0000] <annevk>
no big deal

[05:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, I'm curious who these others are

[05:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sigh, I know.  It hurts my head, though, that someone can misunderstand a term so profoundly.

[06:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm more curious as to why they think an anonymous bug reporting mechanism is a good way to ask such questions

[06:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
since it makes it pretty inconvenient to see any response

[06:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's not so important if you assume the response will necessarily be to agree fully

[06:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you explicitly note that others have already pointed out your point, and if the spec hasn't changed in response to them, and you don't offer any new arguments, then I don't see how anyone could assume the response would be to agree and to change the spec

[06:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
All the reports going more or less just "add theora" suggest otherwise

[06:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is heading to jack-in-the-box for his free sammich for breakfast.

[06:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'll mail you some, myakura.

[06:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could get straight fries, and then bend them

[06:18:00.0000] <myakura>
:S

[06:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hehe.

[06:30:00.0000] <asmodai>
Think our BK still does twister fries at least :)

[06:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
watching a video demo of how easy is to use Hover Mode is in the Nokia 900, it seems instead to do a pretty good job of illustrating Morgan Adams' argument that any possible mechanism for implementing mouse overs on touchscreen device are going to have serious usability problems

[06:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dude even says at the beginning of the video "many people seems to have problems with it, but it's actually quite simple" and then proceeds to show how completely non-intuitive it is

[07:09:00.0000] <asmodai>
MikeSmith: Too close to the project :)

[07:09:01.0000] <asmodai>
MikeSmith: Or something like that. Some people need to take a step back and look at it freshly

[07:09:02.0000] <annevk>
anyone here know how a Ubuntu OS upgrade suddenly lets me use Wireless-N on a lenovo T60? I'm not even sure I have the hardware for that and yet it works...

[07:09:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
he's probably the guy who wrote the implementation

[07:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
asmodai: ↑

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: How can you tell it's using Wireless-N?

[07:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
(e.g. does it actually connect?)

[07:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and is it really connecting with N, or is the UI just broken?)

[07:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if Ubuntu has /sbin/iwconfig to tell you wireless informations

[07:15:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I have set up my Airport Extreme in such a way that it broadcasts two different networks; one being just for Wireless-N

[07:16:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, before the OS upgrade the Wireless-N variant was not detected and now it is and it works fine

[07:16:01.0000] <asmodai>
MikeSmith: Heh, most likely.

[07:20:00.0000] <asmodai>
GAH, some people should NOT be allowed near a text editor.

[07:20:01.0000] <asmodai>
*kcccht* Step away from that editor, do not hurt that HTML any more

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
HTML doesn't feel pain, it's only markup

[07:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
If those people want to communicate, and use HTML (badly) to do so, why should you stop them?

[07:21:02.0000] <asmodai>
Because I have to maintain it now :(

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[07:23:00.0000] <asmodai>
Some application. With a lovely mix of PHP and inline HTML. And the HTML cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be HTML 3, HTML 4, or XHTML 1

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like it wants to be HTML5

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
since that allows (a subset of) the union of HTML and XHTML syntax :-)

[07:29:00.0000] <asmodai>
Philip`: Yea

[07:30:00.0000] <asmodai>
Philip`: Right now I am rewriting it to HTML 4.01 Strict and keeping in mind HTML 5/XHTML constructs for easy moving over whenever we want.

[07:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay, I just reduced 23 images to only 2 in conforming browsers!

[07:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(read: in latest Firefox, because I'm using -moz-linear-gradient())

[07:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
What do you mean by "conforming"?

[07:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
"Conforming to my personal set of specs that I think should be supported right now".

[07:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
By "specs" you mean "non-standard vendor-prefixed extensions"?

[07:38:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, they're standardized.

[07:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not with the -moz-, I hope :-p

[07:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just not in CR yet, so the vendor prefix is appropriate.

[07:39:02.0000] <jgraham>
Well something can have a spec without being a standard

[07:39:03.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed traditionally the W3C didn't publish "tandards"

[07:39:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bah.  Semantics.

[07:39:05.0000] <jgraham>
huh, what happened to the "S"

[07:39:06.0000] <jgraham>
it was there, I saw it

[07:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The w3c doesn't publish with an S.

[07:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is, "The w3c doesn't publih with an S."

[07:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
afaict the w3c doesn't publih

[07:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Exactly.

[07:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
*doen't

[07:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: So what you mean is "in browsers which use Mozilla's vendor-prefixed implementation of a spec that hasn't even reached CR yet"?

[07:42:03.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, your "s" is broken

[07:42:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Yes, that's what I mean.

[07:42:05.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, at least somewhat

[07:42:06.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: I guess "conforming" is an easy typo for that

[07:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: you think there i omething trange? Everything eem perfectly normal a far a I can ee""

[07:47:00.0000] <annevk>

i'm having a hard time getting a base case of Shared Worker code working

[09:28:00.0000] <rektide>
i wrote a post describing my attempt at http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-html5/browse_thread/thread/8a1a0042c8c32de3#

[09:28:01.0000] <rektide>
and the sample code is running at http://rektide.voodoowarez.com/2010/2/ping.html

[09:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What's the most kosher way to indicate on <body> whether js is enabled?  Right now I'm thinking <body class=nojs><script>document.body.className="js";</script>

[09:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think that will swap the class out immediately, before the rest of the page is processed, so any CSS that qualifies on .js will apply immediately without a flash of wrong styling?

[09:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
<html><noscript><body class=nojs></noscript><p>...

[09:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Warning: bad idea)

[09:44:03.0000] <jgraham>
No, really?

[09:44:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was asking for things that *weren't* bad ideas.  ^_^

[09:45:00.0000] <annevk>
seems like a cool idea to me

[09:45:01.0000] <annevk>
shorter too

[09:45:02.0000] <miketaylr>
TabAtkins: paul_irish has an article on that here, http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/

[09:46:00.0000] <paul_irish>
aye. i think using the html elem for the class is best, removes the neccessity of a script tag at the top of your <body>

[09:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, so he pops it onto <html> instead.  Sure, works for me.

[09:46:02.0000] <paul_irish>
and css is all peachy with it.

[09:46:03.0000] <annevk>
"I prefer to write unique css for the no-javascript user" -- aren't those users obsolete by now? meh

[09:46:04.0000] <Philip`>
It's not valid HTML5, because noscript in head can only contain link/style/meta

[09:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and it's a parse error)

[09:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: No?  Plenty of people run around with javascript off.

[09:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
They suffer, but I'd like to minimize the amount of that suffering that I cause.

[09:47:03.0000] <annevk>
weirdos

[09:47:04.0000] <miketaylr>
:D

[09:47:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I agree, but still.  ^_^

time to get some ingredients for food

[09:48:01.0000] <annevk>
/me is hungry

[09:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
If you are hungry now, you ought to have got them earlier

[09:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Benefit of putting it on <body>, though, is that I actually have a use for the <body> element other than just preventing IE from slurping all the new html5 elements that occur before a recognized html4 element into the head.

[09:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But meh.  It wont' kill me to just put a lonely, useless <body> in there.

[09:49:03.0000] <Philip`>
Ingredients for food are often themselves food

[09:49:04.0000] <Philip`>
It's a handy shortcut if you're in a rush

[09:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wait, nm, I already have an <a> as the first element in the body, so I don't need <body>.  <html> it is, then.

[09:51:01.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, ideally that's how it works

I guess it will be implemented in Quicktime.

[10:22:03.0000] <karlushi>
longtime I have checked the support of SMIL in webkit

[10:22:04.0000] <roc>
karlushi: i's huge, underspecified, and duplicates a lot of HTML+CSS features

[10:23:00.0000] <annevk>
oh yeah, I commented on that spec long ago saying something like that

[10:23:01.0000] <annevk>
like a couple of years back at least

[10:24:00.0000] <roc>
unfortunately there's a lot of momentum behind it because there are several shipped implementations

[10:24:01.0000] <karlushi>
roc, your comment relates to SMIL or TTML? or both ;)

[10:24:02.0000] <roc>
DFXP specifically

[10:24:03.0000] <karlushi>
ok

[10:24:04.0000] <roc>
extra-unfortunately, those implementations all implement different subsets of DFXP

[10:24:05.0000] <annevk>
oh, mine is about TTML (and also SMIL)

[10:24:06.0000] <annevk>
roc, guess everyone got their proprietary features in, hurray

[10:25:00.0000] <roc>
SMIL is huge and underspecified, but at least it doesn't duplicate HTML+CSS features :)

[10:25:01.0000] <karlushi>
my tests of SMILs for creating slideshow in the past have been frustrating. Low interoperability between real, quicktime, and some other products

[10:26:00.0000] <roc>
yeah, that's what you'd expect

[10:28:00.0000] <karlushi>
/me should try to test it again. Last time was in 2006

[10:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
OMG Why is CSS so underspecified? >_<

[10:37:00.0000] <karlushi>

i cant get my extremely simple ping pong SharedWorker code working

[10:51:01.0000] <rektide>
http://rektide.voodoowarez.com/2010/2/ping.html

[10:52:00.0000] <rektide>
ping.html sends "ping" to a pong.js shared worker, the shared worker should send "pong" back.... i'm not getting any errors from Chrome, but its not doing anything either.

[10:52:01.0000] <rektide>
if someone could put eyes on it, this should be a super-dead-simple absolutely minimimal SharedWorker implementation

[10:55:00.0000] <annevk>
does a spec example work?

[11:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rektide: you need to call postMessage on the 'connect' event's port; the 'message' event doesn't have .ports

[11:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rektide: you could store a reference to the port by doing onconnect = function(e) { self.port = e.ports[0];

[11:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rektide: or maybe 'message' has ports

[11:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but it might be null

[11:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
onconnect = function(event) {

[11:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
  var port = event.ports[0]

[11:18:02.0000] <zcorpan>
  port.onmessage = function(event) {

[11:18:03.0000] <zcorpan>
    port.postMessage('pong')

[11:18:04.0000] <zcorpan>
  }

[11:18:05.0000] <zcorpan>
  port.postMessaage("connect")

[11:18:06.0000] <zcorpan>
};

[11:20:00.0000] <dimich>
Interesting that WebKit nightly actually reports the correct errors for rektide's URL

rektide: btw, you also need to call worker.port.start() if you're using addEventListener (as opposed to worker.port.onmessage, which calls start() implicitly)

[11:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rektide: otherwise the messages are on a queue waiting for the port to be enabled

seems like the only intuitive way to implement "mouse over" equivalent on touchscreen devices is to also have a proximity sensor on the device that can detect when you are actually hovering over something with your finger 

[21:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there is a big irony in the fact that the prevalent GUI conventions are modeled on physical desktop conventions that can't currently be implemented practically on devices that provide a greater degree of real physical interaction with the UI (through the touchscreen) rather than through the abstraction of a separate pointing device

[21:29:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
in terms of people, currently

[21:29:04.0000] <wirepair>
i used to be at symc, did some browser security assessments and been hooked on browsers ever since, so decided to hang out here see what cooky stuff you guys are cooking up ;>

[21:29:05.0000] <wirepair>
er symc = symantec

[21:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
excellent

[21:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would guess you might have some good insight into client-side security issues

[21:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
which the community could definitely use more of

[21:30:03.0000] <wirepair>
yeah i've been passively reading ;>

[21:30:04.0000] <wirepair>
mainly seeing in fighting though ;>

[21:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wirepair: you may want to read up on iframe/@srcdoc and get involved in recent discussion of that

[21:32:01.0000] <wirepair>
got a link for that?

[21:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/text-level-semantics.html#attr-iframe-srcdoc

[21:33:01.0000] <wirepair>
thanks

[21:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and see related discussion on that whatwg mailing list

[21:33:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me will try to get a link for that too

[21:33:04.0000] <wirepair>
appreciate it

[21:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't know if you aware already but another thing that's been in the works for some time now is a mechanism for enabling cross-origin (cross-site) XHR (and other forms of cross-origin requests)

[21:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is definitely worth taking a loot at too

[21:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Cross Origin Resource Sharing

[21:34:03.0000] <wirepair>
yeah, i've read a little about it

[21:35:00.0000] <wirepair>
couldn't see anything immediately wrong with the preflights, but i think it may boil down to browser implementation

[21:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wirepair: you've read up on the alternative Uniform Messaging proposal as well?

[21:37:01.0000] <wirepair>
hmm, no i have not i've honestly been busy building my testing framework heh

[21:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wirepair: about recent iframe discussions, http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-December/thread.html#24487 is a good place to start if/when you have time

[21:40:00.0000] <wirepair>
yeah i should be testing this web app ehe, i'll check it after work

[21:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
はい

[21:40:02.0000] <wirepair>
blarg, stupid utf-7 term

[22:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: in your response to Larry about normative reference to IRIbis, the URL you gave is a file URL for your local copy of the issue-status file

[22:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: oops

[22:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
no biggie

[22:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the dev.w3.org version is linked to in plenty of other messages, so I'm sure people can put 2 and 2 together

[22:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I notice that nobody seems to have responded yet to Aryeh and Henri's message questioning the utility of warning about absence of lang

[22:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0160.html and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0171.html

[22:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I should try to see if I can get someone to respond to those points

[22:16:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hey all, how's everyone tonight (or whatever time it is where you exist) ?

[22:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: does the spec currently require that?

[22:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I was thinking maybe the change proposal was advocating for having it be a warning, but maybe in fact it doesn't and that suggestion only came up on the e-mail thread

[22:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to looks now

[22:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
my brain hurts from sending all that email

[22:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and I still need to write an agenda

[22:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I need to write an agenda for the accessibility TF call for this week too

[22:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which is less work

[22:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I believe we will have two actual proposals from the TF to move forward to the wider group of the a11y TF telcon this week

[22:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the canvas adom proposal and the summary proposal

[22:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
*move forward to the wider group for further discussion

[22:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which reminds me also that I wanted to check in with Silvia

[22:28:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: you around and have time to chat a bit about status on the media proposals?

[22:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, I see that Richard's change proposal for issue 88 in fact says nothing about warning on absence of lang

[22:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so nm

[22:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

"range of expectation" is pretty narrow as far as desktop browsers go...

[23:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok, why is it that the various Calls for Whatever I posted today drew so many random follow-up comments?

[23:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
most of the things of this type that the Chairs post get no responses at all

[23:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: does .@ mean something special in twitter-ese (as opposed to just @)

[23:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
"So if someone really wanted to propose allowing the rel attribute on <img> elements, that would be in scope (though in my opinion, it would be a silly idea)." - RDFa already makes that allowed

[23:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
(if I'm not misreading the DTD)

[23:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: It means I wanted to broadcast those tweets to all my followers--not just those who also follow masinter

[23:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I did not know twitter made such a distinction

[23:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me has learned something

[00:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Is it just me or does "The requirement is from TimBL's original axioms." come close to the axiomatic proof?

[00:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok, someone tell me that I shouldn't reply to Roy's latest email

[00:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because, if we're gonna drop ping anyway, there is no point debating it

[00:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't really understand why anyone would like the idea of simply removing the W3C logo from the feature, when it's equally likely to be implemented if it's in a WHATWG spec

[00:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
Isn't the idea meant to be to improve the feature?

[00:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not if you think it's broken by design, I suppose

[00:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you think that, I still don't see why you'd happy to just have it move to a different spec where it'll get implemented just the same and you won't have any chance to provide feedback to make it slightly less broken

[00:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: You make a clear statement that you're against it, and wash your hands of the consequences

[00:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: having it only in the WHATWG spec takes it away from the W3C PP, which might have an impact on the willingness of some vendors to implement

[00:32:00.0000] <annevk>
"I look forward to the more exciting XHTML2 phase of our Working Group" -- hehe

Oh wow

[00:33:01.0000] <asmodai>
Valve is beta testing webkit for their Steam service

[00:33:02.0000] <asmodai>
http://store.steampowered.com/uiupdate/

[00:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: source?

[00:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that the name "HTML5 (including next generation additions still in development)" came after a long discussion about how people would get confused if they were pointed to something that people normally call "HTML5" and the document did not call itself HTML5

[00:36:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, http-state mailing list, othermaciej being sarcastic about the suggestion that we should replace cookies

[00:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: after he called it "phase 2" I could barely resist

[00:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
asmodai: It's interesting since they've used IE for years, and have presumably put a lot of effort into understanding it, and only care about Windows support, and still WebKit offers sufficient technical benefits to switch

[00:38:00.0000] <asmodai>
Philip`: I just updated it, man, does it look slick

[00:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
("we swapped out the Internet Explorer rendering engine with WebKit, which gives us a bunch of size, stability and performance benefits")

[00:38:02.0000] <asmodai>
yeah, it starts up noticeably faster too

[00:38:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Even without any direct benefits, being able to support a single version of webkit seems better than 3-4 different IE engines

[00:39:00.0000] <asmodai>
Jesus, I wonder how long they worked on this

[00:39:01.0000] <asmodai>
If I now click my games it will present me with so much more information

[00:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
Surely you only need to support one IE engine, and put the others in compatibility mode

[00:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: thanks

[00:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Google FAIL: http://www.google.fi/search?q=http-state+archive

[00:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http-state worked :)

[00:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
googling for 'ietf mailing list' and navigating worked, too

[00:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yes I was snarky to Adam: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/http-state/current/msg00589.html

[00:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I hope he forgives me

[00:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i really, really, really wish i could put unique data into the method of the websocket handshake

[00:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
before the resource

[00:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
that would make it _so_ much harder to screw up the server-side implementation of this

[00:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
definitely seems like it would reduce the attack surface

[00:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
something like "WS012 /resource/ HTTP/1.1"

[00:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
where the three digits have to be converted to a number by parsing them as a decimal

[00:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: so what is preventing you from doing that?

[00:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: in all sincerity, I am pretty dubious of the prospects for or even usefulness of an incompatible replacement for cookies, but it's probably not *quite* as silly as an incompatible replacement for HTML

[00:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: seems like it would be a pain for HTTP servers to dispatch on, if they dispatch based on method

[00:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
and then some other number has to be divided by that number, so even if the implementor really screws it up, the number they get will be zero, and the division will crash the server rather than let it be attacked

[00:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: also, I am sure it would make the HTTP gods furious with hot anger

[00:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: the wg members are up in arms enough as it is, and i'm using existing methods

[00:56:04.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, I'm skeptical as well

[00:57:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, though maybe if HTTP authentication is made useful enough... but then I'm not sure if that would be sufficient

[00:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I guess I haven't seen Adam's use cases that would justify a replacement for cookies as the solution

[00:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: being able to tie form-based login to HTTP auth would remove a decent fraction of the true need for cookies, but the way to achieve that is not through a protcol spec

[00:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: but on the other hand, most of the cookies currently in my cookie store are not login cookies

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
i love that if i telnet to port 80 of hixie.ch and then send "GET / HTTP/1.1" (with no Host:) I get a 400, but if I send "GET / WEBSOCKET" I get a 200 OK with an error message

[00:59:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, yeah, but those might be replaced I suppose with localStorage and XHR... though maybe not

[00:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: those aren't protocol specs either...

[00:59:02.0000] <annevk>
true, not sure how much protocol changes would be needed

[01:00:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe a little, to support logout

[01:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
hmm... if I include a Host:, they both work

[01:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder whether we can just send WebSocket instead of HTTP/1.1

[01:00:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, maybe with the second one it assumes HTTP/0.9?

[01:00:04.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I guess I should hold my fire until Adam presents the use cases and or design for Phase 2

[01:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: maybe...

[01:00:06.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: the other thing Phase 2 makes me think of is... underpants gnomes

[01:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
eh?

[01:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
underpants gnomes?

[01:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, south park

[01:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, news flash: sitting in a chair all day in front of a computer can make you fat and unhealthy: http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/stand-up-while-you-read-this/

[01:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it appears that some scientists have been looking into this

[01:07:00.0000] <annevk>
this comes to mind: http://or.ly/

[01:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: That's misrepresenting the article gravely

[01:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"In other words, irrespective of whether you exercise vigorously, sitting for long periods is bad for you."

[01:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
gravely indeed

[01:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
my apologies

[01:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I assume the site shows the orly owl, but I don't know because it's hostile to my Referer settings

[01:08:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me types up a retraction

[01:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: That sentence seems to be misrepresenting the rest of the article

[01:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
dang I sit for long periods

[01:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
me too

[01:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'm switching to lying down

[01:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
/me reconsiders the idea of a standing height workstation

[01:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sideways, Roman-feast style

[01:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
othermaciej: Even better, walkstations

[01:11:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Threadmill + workstation

[01:11:03.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: I'm not sure the Roman feast helps with weight issues

[01:11:04.0000] <Dashiva>
-h I guess

[01:11:05.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: That's what the article suggests

[01:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Presumably it would be treadmill + workstation + need to go fast enough or the computer will die

[01:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the best solution to the weight issues is probably to combine the sitting with a lot of meth smoking

[01:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
what exactly is the "bad"?

[01:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: Can't go that fast, or you get exhausted before the end of the day

[01:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
Right but presumably the benefits are lost somewhat if you just stand there

[01:13:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Even standing still is a great improvement over sitting

[01:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I like how the references section is about as long as the main article

[01:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and death, which all sound quite bad to me

[01:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: her articles are almost always like that

[01:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: good to know

[01:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
A ray of hope in an otherwise desolate journalistic landscape

[01:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
Sitting down can kill puppies too

[01:15:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: she's actually more of genuine scientist that an journalist.. some of her prose is just awful

[01:15:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
but her stuff is always worth reading

[01:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: btw, need I ask, but are you perhaps planning to attend the hybi f2f in Anaheim on March 24?

[01:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
not in person

[01:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[01:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
probably on irc and listening, though if it doesn't seem productive i'll drop off

[01:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, that really makes me think.. there's no fee for calling in to the meeting, right?

[01:18:01.0000] <annevk>
nope

[01:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you were to actually attend in person, I think you'd need to pay 200 USD to do it

[01:19:01.0000] <annevk>
you don't call in actually

[01:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah

[01:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
right

[01:19:04.0000] <annevk>
you get a live audio feed and there's an IM bachchannel

[01:19:05.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: !

[01:19:06.0000] <Hixie>
$200?!

[01:19:07.0000] <foolip>
spec experts: is it valid to use percent-encoding even when it isn't necessary? e.g. to encoding a as %61

[01:19:08.0000] <foolip>
in URIs that is

[01:19:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: that is what I had to pay to attend Hiroshima for 1 day

[01:19:10.0000] <annevk>
foolip, yup

[01:20:00.0000] <foolip>
ok

[01:20:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, and USD 600 for a week or so

[01:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
wow, that's worse than the w3c's tpac $50/day extortion

[01:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
man i hate f2fs

[01:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: dang, that's expensive

[01:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I was thinking about going or sending a minion but I'm not sure I could justify that cost on top of travel and hotel

[01:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for the IRC part in IETF meetings, you are allowed to get in the speaker queue and type questions and the chairs read them out, right?

[01:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: it may be there is some other way to attend without paying that much but if so, I don't know about it and it was not offered to me as an option

[01:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me had to pay €565 for 5 days at a networking conference

[01:23:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, yeah, not necessarily by the chairs though

[01:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, my university had to pay)

[01:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me concluded that it wasn't worth it

[01:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: there's three sessions of interest in the whole f2f, each on a different day, and nothing I would be remotely interested in for the rest of the day

[01:23:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: not enough massages and mint juleps included in the deal?

[01:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wait, I forgot about IR

[01:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
IRI

[01:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
/me wonders if that is a fourth day

[01:24:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: luckily, last time time IRI and hybi meetings were on the same day

[01:24:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't know about this year

[01:24:05.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: None at all

[01:24:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: then you definitely got gipped

[01:24:07.0000] <Philip`>
(The hotel was another €500)

[01:24:08.0000] <othermaciej>
hybi, iribis, httpbis, http-state would be the sessions I might be interested in

[01:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah, http-state

[01:25:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, same here, but I don't think I'll be going

[01:25:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess abarth will be that one at least

[01:25:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
there was no http WG f2f in Hiroshima last time

[01:26:00.0000] <annevk>
Though I'm considered for IRI co-chair apparently there are other candidates as well so it doesn't really seem worth my time to fly over there. On top of that there's something fun going in the Netherlands at the same time :)

[01:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wonder if it's permitted to allow people to voip/Skype others in so they can actually ask and answer questions verbally instead of just by IRC

[01:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: my understanding is taht it is

[01:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
or at least, that option was offered to me for anaheim

[01:27:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
frankly though the idea of _charging_ people to participate in what should be completely open standards development is just insane to me

[01:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
i hated when w3c did it, and i hate it when ietf does it

[01:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
especially given how often ietf does it

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so httpbis is Monday, httpstate is Tuesday, hybi is Wednesday, and iri is Friday

[01:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think part of the IETF reason is that they othwerwise charge no membership fees

[01:29:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I wish the W3C could figure out sponsorship instead of charing fees to individuals

[01:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
(if google hadn't paid for a bunch of people to go to the htmlwg meeting, i probably wouldn't have gone)

[01:29:04.0000] <othermaciej>
for TPAC

[01:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm really not at all convinced f2fs are that good

[01:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
like have some corps pay big bucks to have their logos on a page in the conference program

[01:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: well, me too

[01:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
people keep saying they're useful because of the social aspects

[01:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
but that hasn't helped the htmlwg much as far as i can tell

[01:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
mostly because most people can't go anyway

[01:30:06.0000] <Hixie>
so why bother

[01:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TC-39 meeting is Wednesday and Thursday, the same week as the IETF meeting, so I'm missing at least hybi

[01:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which is too bad because that's the one where I most expect to be able to have a useful impact

[01:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
#whatwg is useful because of the social aspects

[01:32:01.0000] <zcorpan>
but it hasn't helped the htmlwg much as far as i can tell

[01:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
we started an irc channel quite a long time into the whatwg being quite productive

[01:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
iirc

[01:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i don't think irc really helped in that respect

[01:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's fun and helpful, but it's not necessary, imho

[01:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
f2fs aren't even fun and helpful

[01:33:05.0000] <Hixie>
they're miserable and generally a waste of time, imho

[01:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
2010 W3C AC meeting is 22nd and 23rd March in Cambridge, btw. so anybody attending that won't be able to attend the first two days of the IETF meetings

[01:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I feel like I get some value out of f2fs but I have never tried to quantify

[01:34:02.0000] <Dashiva>
<Dracula> What is a f2f?

[01:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
face-to-face

[01:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It was a joke, pay it no heed :)

[01:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i used to think so, then i tried to measure the net impact on the specs i was working on, and i determined that it didn't unblock any blocked issues, and yet basically inserted a 10-day delay (assuming a 3-day meeting with 2 travel days)

[01:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: d'oh

[01:35:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
as I think hsivonen pointed out, the worst part by far of f2f meetings is the travel part

[01:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
especially if you happen to live in a part of the world far away from where most of the f2f meetings take place

[01:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the opportunity cost is my biggest worry

[01:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the main value I feel I have experienced is in conveying information about complex technical issues that seemed impossible to transfer in email, and opportunistically learning interesting facts from people I run into

[01:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't understand larry's latest blog post. What are these superfluous MUSTs he's concerned about?

[01:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: You mean all the anti-competitive ones?

[01:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"HTML5 also suffers from problems in Firefox 2 and Camino 1 because these two browsers use the Gecko rendering engine." - http://www.whatcreative.co.uk/blog/?p=410

[01:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The only one I can think of is that .width and .height aren't allowed to disappear for no reason

[01:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And that just shows how little he cares about usable APIs

[01:52:01.0000] <zcorpan>
where are .width and .height not allowed?

[01:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or were there too many negatives in that sentence

[01:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The values must remain available once they become available

[01:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
What happens to .width/.height in e.g. Opera when you disable images after loading a page?

[01:54:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me assumes they return 0 but hasn't tested

[01:54:02.0000] <Dashiva>
The images remain with the same size, they just don't render

[01:54:03.0000] <Dashiva>
The layout is fully preserved

[01:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum

[01:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe that's styling interfering, though. Let's check otherwise.

[01:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: i get layout changes when i turn off images

[01:56:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: at least when there's alt text

[01:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, there was a fixed image size where I was checking.

[01:57:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Without styles, it resizes to fit the alt tex, and the dimensions match that

[01:58:00.0000] <annevk>
sounds like some kind of bug

[02:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: was there any kind of resolution at all on the "Backward-compatibility of text/html media type" thread on the TAG mailing list a few weeks back?

[02:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think you posted a few messages about that

[02:08:01.0000] <annevk>
I did and I don't think there was

[02:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me finds http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2010Feb/thread.html#msg23

[02:09:01.0000] <annevk>
You sometimes go in a discussion with the TAG but then it takes ages for them to reply

[02:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think they may be waiting on some kind of update from the HTML WG

[02:10:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess in the end we just disagreed

[02:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm trying to find what HTML WG bugzilla bug is associated with that, if any

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i randomly picked this mail from that thread:

[02:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2010Feb/0027.html

[02:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
which asks:

[02:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
1.  Is there an intention to have at least the vast majority of the older 

[02:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
content work and be considered conforming?

[02:12:05.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders if Noah realises that the vast majority of the older content _isn't_ considered conforming even under the old rules

[02:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I first probably should try to figure out exactly what the TAG seems to be asking for around this

[02:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me wonders if Noah realizes that "work" and "be considered conforming" are independent axes?

[02:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[02:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think I understand what the question/request is

[02:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
Not really independent, but not parallel either

[02:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think it's about whether the spec says that documents with an HTML 2, 3.2, 4 or XHTML 1 doctype are considered to be text/html documents or not

[02:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't think that parallel is quite the right word

[02:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in the case of HTML 4.01, there are documents that "work" but are not conforming, and documents which do not work, but are conforming

[02:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/group/track/actions/364 is public right?

[02:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe not an orthonormal basis, but definitely not identical

[02:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: is there any way for me to tell, given that I have Member access?

[02:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I could figure out how to delete my http password

[02:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
aren't all the tracker instances world-readable?

[02:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: using curl or wget or whatever, I guess

[02:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it curls

[02:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, so I see there that action is a "give somebody else an action" action

[02:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and the somebody else in this case is me

[02:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
yes

[02:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
or PLH

[02:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and the action we are expected to do is to write a change proposal

[02:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
x3d profiles, hmm

[02:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
on something you may or may not believe in

[02:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[02:20:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I would much prefer for Change Proposals to be written by actual advocates for the change in question

[02:20:05.0000] <othermaciej>
(no need to be a WG member; DanC is signed up for one already)

[02:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that'd certainly seem to be the best way to get them written, if they are to be written well

[02:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
this is otherwise like some kind of telephone-game thing

[02:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
however that issue is also one we decided we do not need to address before LC

[02:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[02:22:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I sorta remember that now, yeah

[02:22:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, so I guess I can respond to say that

[02:22:04.0000] <othermaciej>
which is why it is in "HTML5 Spec - PR Blockers" instead of "HTML5 spec"

[02:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
which I guess means my open issue count is off by one

[02:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wish I could look at the issues for a specific product

[02:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you can, can't you?

[02:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
how?

[02:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/products/8

[02:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
how that's cool

[02:26:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me reads the recent public-html thread related to this

[02:26:04.0000] <othermaciej>
it even consolidates open and raised

[02:26:05.0000] <othermaciej>
this is now my favorite page on the tracker: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/products/1

[02:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe the title should be "HTML5 (*plus* next-gen additions additions still in development)"

[02:27:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm appending ,access does not work on dynamic URIs

[02:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: right, unfortunately

[02:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: that would make more sense

[02:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: ^

[02:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: can you give me some guidance from your chairs perspective about what update I should give to the TAG about this?

[02:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: cool. I was unaware of ,access

[02:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I dunno

[02:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: have they made a request of you yet?

[02:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: just, "The group is planning resolve the text/html media-type registration issue after LC"

[02:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, I don't think that will fly

[02:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: DanC pinged me about it

[02:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hot potato

[02:31:03.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: we previously decided that ISSUE-53 doesn't need to be addressed before LC and had WG consensus on that change

[02:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: given how long it took to get the title be something everyone in that discussion was happy with, i'd rather not reopen that discussion

[02:31:05.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: that doesn't mean we can't make any related changes, but we are unlikely to reconsider and make it an LC blocker

[02:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[02:32:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i'd be suprised if anyone objected to s/including/plus/ but ok

[02:32:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
+1 to plus

[02:33:00.0000] <annevk>
makes sense to me too fwiw

[02:33:01.0000] <annevk>
(though the term HTML5 would still be used differently, but that seems fine)

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I support s/including/plus/

[03:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
"HTML5+"

[03:09:00.0000] <nessy>
lol

[03:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: for all those people who miss "HTML+"

[03:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
whoah, HTML+ had a figure element! (named FIG, but still...)

[03:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
html3 had a <math> element

[03:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
a lot of the stuff in html5 is inspired by older drafts

[03:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
much like a lot of the stuff in html "6" will be inspired by things we dropped in 5

[03:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
like datagrid

[03:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML+ also had a LIT element for content to be rendered literally, but in a proportional font, giving a verse example

[03:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's a neat idea

[03:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
though of course you could just style PRE

[03:14:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: can you remind me if any of the media subgroup proposals are ready for moving forward within the a11y TF this week?

[03:14:04.0000] <nessy>
I think they are both, actually

[03:14:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[03:14:06.0000] <nessy>
you mean at Friday's meeting?

[03:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will add them to the agenda

[03:15:01.0000] <nessy>
ah, ok - I thought that had already happened last week :)

[03:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
"HTML+ documents offer a means for providing hypertext links to a variety of media including images, sound sequences, MPEG movies, Postscript files and other formats." - we still don't have MPEG support :-(

[03:15:03.0000] <nessy>
discussion will keep going though, but an in-principle agreement that we are on the right way and ready for trial implementations would be good

[03:15:04.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: what's the state of the media subgroup proposals?

[03:16:00.0000] <nessy>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_TextAssociations

[03:16:01.0000] <nessy>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_MultitrackAPI

[03:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: the chairs (well, me and Sam) were wondering today when to put out a formal Call for Proposals for ISSUE-9 video-accessibiity

[03:16:03.0000] <nessy>
oh!

[03:17:00.0000] <nessy>
well, the latter one is related ot issue-9

[03:17:01.0000] <nessy>
I guess I assumed that because the subgroup existed, the video a11y related issues and bugs were sorta "delegated"

[03:18:00.0000] <nessy>
I think after MikeSmith has had them discussed at the a11y TF meeting, it'd be good to introduce them to the larger html wg

[03:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: everything ultimately has to go through the HTML WG process

[03:18:02.0000] <nessy>
sure

[03:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: quick question about the first - how do <track> and <trackgroup> interact with <source>?

[03:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: I think the movement forward on the proposals is pending me putting them to the a11y TF for sign-off that we are ready to formally ask for review from the wider WG

[03:19:01.0000] <nessy>
not at all

[03:19:02.0000] <nessy>
MikeSmith, agree - just what I thought

[03:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
all the examples use <video src="">, and not multiple <source> elements

[03:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
and it is not clear to me how you would use them with <source> elements

[03:19:05.0000] <othermaciej>
could you add examples like that?

[03:19:06.0000] <nessy>
that's just because after the source selection algorithm, a single video source will be dealt with

[03:20:00.0000] <nessy>
I'll add an example, no problems

[03:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
do all <track> elements apply to all sources, regardless of which is picked?

[03:20:02.0000] <nessy>
yes

[03:20:03.0000] <annevk>
that seems problematic

[03:20:04.0000] <nessy>
they are external files that get associated to the selected video source

[03:20:05.0000] <nessy>
how so?

[03:20:06.0000] <annevk>
there's no guarantee <source>es are of equal length

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk>
e.g. based on device features you might get a shorter video

[03:21:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me doesn't think that's especially problematic

[03:21:02.0000] <nessy>
I think that's an author's problem if he provides alternatives that are not really alternatives

[03:21:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I was thinking you might want the option to nest <track> inside <source>, but I am not sure there is a compelling use case

[03:22:00.0000] <annevk>
currently the primary use for <source> is different formats, but I expect that to shift over time

[03:22:01.0000] <nessy>
yeah, we had such a proposal at one stage

[03:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the example I thought of is, you have one video with no captions, one video with burned-in captions, and external captions in other languages

[03:22:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure if that is realistic

[03:22:04.0000] <annevk>
nessy, why would they not be alternatives?

[03:22:05.0000] <nessy>
such an example is realistic

[03:23:00.0000] <nessy>
alternatives is not a good word choice

[03:23:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, yeah, maybe not

[03:23:02.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, nesting inside <source> might no longer be feasible

[03:24:00.0000] <nessy>
but what I mean is: right now the choice is mostly based on formats, and maybe later on devices (through the media queries) - what is provided to the user should, however, not be a different experience

[03:24:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, unless we change deployed content and fix our parsers quickly...

[03:24:02.0000] <nessy>
it would be strange if you went to a site on different browsers and you got different videos

[03:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: we might need to make <source> imply </source> to do that

[03:24:04.0000] <othermaciej>
yuck

[03:24:05.0000] <nessy>
annevk: yes, nesting inside <source> was rejected because of that problem

[03:24:06.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, still fails for the last though I suppose </video> could close the last one...

[03:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: the basic idea of Media_TextAssociations seems pretty good

[03:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: is that what the SRT vs DFXP vs smilText format war has been about?

[03:26:01.0000] <nessy>
it tried to really match with the way in which tracks are encoded in MPEG, too, including the track grouping

[03:27:00.0000] <nessy>
well, the srt - DFXP - smilText discussion is about what external format to support - the markup itself seems rather uncontroversial by now

[03:27:01.0000] <nessy>
also, it seems only the SMIL  guys are for smilText  nobody else has spoken up for it yet

[03:27:02.0000] <annevk>
really, requiring DFXP?

[03:27:03.0000] <annevk>
omg

[03:27:04.0000] <nessy>
several voices have been for DFXP - mostly those that want professional captioning

[03:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: the track access API also seems reasonable - I worry slightly that it's more power than needed for the use case, but we may end up going that way anyway

[03:28:01.0000] <annevk>
DFXP is extremely broken

[03:28:02.0000] <annevk>
and way too complex

[03:28:03.0000] <nessy>
but we seem to be agreeing that DFXP needs to define conformance levels, which will make it easier to implement support for it

[03:28:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it would be plausible to not require any format or require only SRT (which I gather is the bare-bones format)

[03:28:05.0000] <annevk>
SRT has some weird stuff too

[03:28:06.0000] <othermaciej>
is smilText less broken than DFXP?

[03:28:07.0000] <annevk>
it would need to be defined

[03:28:08.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure we'd want either

[03:29:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems to me that SRT addresses well over 80% of the use cases

[03:29:01.0000] <annevk>
for the rest we could provide an API so you can implement stuff yourself

[03:29:02.0000] <nessy>
we will need to have something more than DFXP since captioning requirements by law require more quality than what DFXP can provide, IIUC

[03:29:03.0000] <nessy>
(that's US law)

[03:29:04.0000] <nessy>
SRT addresses subtitles very well

[03:30:00.0000] <nessy>
quality captioning has actually more indepth requirements, such as colours and formatting and positioning

[03:30:01.0000] <nessy>
nothing that couldn't be done with a simple subpart of DFXP and a mapping to HTML+CSS

[03:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so DFXP is really complicated, but still cannot meet US legal requirements for captioning?

[03:31:01.0000] <nessy>
at the lowest level, DFXP could be no more than SRT plus basic formatting markup in the captions plus CSS

[03:31:02.0000] <nessy>
no, no, DFXP meets all US legal requirements

[03:31:03.0000] <nessy>
I referred to SRT not meeting them

[03:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I see, ok

[03:32:01.0000] <nessy>
sorry about the double negation :)

[03:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
"we will need to have something more than DFXP" - did you mean SRT there?

[03:33:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought SRT had formatting extensions

[03:33:01.0000] <nessy>
I think all browser vendors will initially only want to implement srt - and that's fine

[03:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
are the track roles defined in Media_MultitrackAPI all things that can be determined in common container formats?

[03:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Otherwise I'm not quite understanding)

[03:33:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: i think she did

[03:33:05.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I think so

[03:33:06.0000] <nessy>
I think we have to take it in steps

[03:33:07.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: what legal requirements does the U.S. have that .srt doesn't meet?

[03:33:08.0000] <nessy>
Philip' good catch - I said DFXP where I meant SRT

[03:33:09.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: is there any expected use for <track> besides external caption tracks?

[03:33:10.0000] <nessy>
I meant: we will need to have something more than SRT

[03:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(wondering if the name is too general)

[03:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
considering what closed captioning in the U.S. looks like on e.g. CNN, it's hard for me to believe that SRT didn't meet legal requirements

[03:36:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: I don't know the details but apparently you need to be able to place captions at locations where they don't overlap central activity, you need to be able to mark up in colour and provide italics for certain things and stuff

[03:36:01.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: I'm hoping we can use the <track> spec also for lyrics, karaoke and other such text stuff, and ultimately also for other audio and video tracks, though that last one will take a long time before browsers will feel comfortable implementing it

[03:37:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems we need to define something like Web SRT anyway; adding extensions for a few things shouldn't be too hard and definitely much easier than DFXP

[03:38:00.0000] <nessy>
this is an interesting read with what features broadcast captions provide: http://www.theneitherworld.com/mcpoodle/SCC_TOOLS/DOCS/SCC_FORMAT.HTML

[03:38:01.0000] <nessy>
annevk: DFXP is actually in use by a lot of companies already

[03:39:00.0000] <nessy>
it's not that difficult after all - and extending srt wouldn't serve a purpose here other than those who already do it saying: WTF and those who are doing DFXP saying: WTF

[03:39:01.0000] <nessy>
here's a typical DFXP file http://www.apple.com/media/us/mac/imac/2009/tours/apple-imac-design_video-cc-us-20091111_cc.xml

[03:40:00.0000] <nessy>
honestly not that different from SRT

[03:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
sweet jesus

[03:40:02.0000] <nessy>
?

[03:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
namespace alert

[03:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
woop woop

[03:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
namespaced _attributes_ no less

[03:40:06.0000] <othermaciej>
dxfp looks just enough like HTML to confuse me

[03:41:00.0000] <nessy>
hehe :)

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
wait is that a THIRD styling language at the w3c? or is DFCP not W3C

[03:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
DFXP

[03:41:03.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: does the captioning functionality of analog over-the-air TV in the U.S. support italics and color?

[03:41:04.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I guess so

[03:41:05.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: SMIL has the same stuff

[03:41:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I have a hard type typing or saying DFXP correctly - it's got to be the worst acronym ever

[03:41:07.0000] <othermaciej>
especially considering that internally it calls itself "Timed Text"

[03:41:08.0000] <nessy>
the ppl that developed it wanted it to be "working independent of the Web", too

[03:41:09.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: DFXP reinvents large parts of CSS and HTML

[03:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
can we please not reinvent the wheel

[03:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
why do subtitles have to be formatted?

[03:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: always a reason to reinvent parts of the Web stack

[03:42:03.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: it seems so - if you follow the link that I posted above, it has a list of what US captions are capable of

[03:42:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the cat is out of the bag on reinventing the wheel

[03:42:05.0000] <annevk>
omg it doesn't even refer to CSS for things like <color>

[03:42:06.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#style-value-color

[03:42:07.0000] <Hixie>
maybe colour and italics, but sheesh

[03:42:08.0000] <Dashiva>
Aren't there plenty of subtitle formats in existence?

[03:42:09.0000] <annevk>
definitely do not want DFXP in a browser

[03:43:00.0000] <annevk>
evar

[03:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
note the host in the URL nessy posted

[03:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but indeed this looks like it reinvents more wheels than SVG 1.2 Tiny

[03:44:01.0000] <nessy>
once you're over your initial shock, can I convince you to just look at it as a format to parse and map into proper html/css/etc? :)

[03:44:02.0000] <nessy>
http://www.apple.com/imac/ <- is the video, incidentally

[03:44:03.0000] <annevk>
that would mean writing a new spec for something that is very complex

[03:44:04.0000] <annevk>
whereas adding some features to SRT is much simpler

[03:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
why would we ever want to map subtitles to HTML/CSS/etc?

[03:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
surely we want subtitles to be media-independent and simple

[03:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's so weird that they reused html element names with strangely different meanings

[03:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
so they can work with braille displays, speech synth, etc

[03:45:04.0000] <nessy>
that's what DFXP set out to be

[03:45:05.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, apparently there are some requirements for formatting

[03:45:06.0000] <Hixie>
what requirements?

[03:46:00.0000] <nessy>
read the bottom of this http://www.theneitherworld.com/mcpoodle/SCC_TOOLS/DOCS/SCC_FORMAT.HTML "Closed Caption Style Guid"

[03:46:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, placement, and color/italics (which you can prolly do media-independent in some way)

[03:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
According to DFXP, rgba(255, 255, 255, 1) is almost entirely transparent white

[03:46:03.0000] <nessy>
s/bottom/more or less middle/

[03:46:04.0000] <Philip`>
whereas CSS says it's solid white

[03:46:05.0000] <Philip`>
Fun

[03:46:06.0000] <annevk>
really?

[03:46:07.0000] <annevk>
lolz

[03:46:08.0000] <Hixie>
SRT supports placement and color/italics

[03:46:09.0000] <nessy>
no, no placement

[03:46:10.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: not the kind of SRT that would make sense for the Web

[03:46:11.0000] <Hixie>
you don't need an inline box model or whatnot

[03:46:12.0000] <nessy>
italics and bold only for some extensions

[03:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: color and italics are in the RSS title land

[03:47:01.0000] <nessy>
I'd rather we use only pure srt and don't do any interpretation on random text, actually

[03:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
("the alpha component, if expressed, is maximum (255) at 100% opacity and minimum (0) at 0% opacity" is what it says for all colour syntaxes)

[03:47:03.0000] <annevk>
nessy, if we can avoid the mess that is DFXP...

[03:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, oh wow, it uses 0-255 as scale rather than 0-1 for alpha?

[03:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's kinda more logical

[03:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but tragically inconsistent

[03:48:03.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, they are either intentionally incompatible with CSS and all or just stupid

[03:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think you need to be stupid to have that kind of design error

[03:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Seems like an easy bug to introduce if you're not being sufficiently careful

[03:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
just poorly informed

[03:49:03.0000] <nessy>
no comment ;)

[03:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
but the more fundamental problem is redefining CSS-like colours at all, rather than deferring to CSS, which would avoid any possible divergence

[03:50:01.0000] <nessy>
there was a lot of information from the traditional TV side of things, but the world of the Web seemed to have been a bit less relevant

[03:50:02.0000] <annevk>
o_O

[03:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, i'm all in favour of providing ways to define different voices, some of which might even by default be mapped to italics or specific colours, and i'm even ok with providing inline equivalents to <cite>, <em>, <i>, and <b>, but seriously, putting a CSS engine into subtitles is just a bad idea on so many levels

[03:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is what they have really equivalent to a CSS engine?

[03:52:01.0000] <nessy>
why would we need an extra CSS engine? browser would just use their existing one, once the format is mapped to html + css, no?

[03:52:02.0000] <nessy>
it's a lot simpler, actually

[03:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: not all UAs have a CSS engine

[03:52:04.0000] <nessy>
but yes, there will be issues

[03:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that's a mean thing to say about IE

[03:53:01.0000] <nessy>
well, in that case you can only do best effort on captions, too, no?

[03:53:02.0000] <nessy>
ahhh (lol)

[03:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't mean IE

[03:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
i mean like a braille display

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
or my TV

[03:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I was joking

[03:54:02.0000] <nessy>
braille people aren't interested in subtitles or captions, I would think ;)

[03:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
or any number of other environments where embedding an entire CSS engine is overkill on a massive scale

[03:54:04.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: a deaf-blind user might be

[03:54:05.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: They would be interested in the text, but not timed and linked to video/audio tracks

[03:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Why not audio tracks?

[03:55:01.0000] <nessy>
as I said: best effort for the given situation should be acceptable

[03:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: true, assuming a non-timed transcript was available

[03:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Because they're deaf

[03:55:04.0000] <nessy>
we can't standardise on the lowest common denominator

[03:55:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't it possible they're only blind?

[03:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: othermaciej was talking about deaf-blind users

[03:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
who, by definition, are deaf

[03:56:02.0000] <nessy>
we can do the lowest common denominator as a baseline, of course

[03:56:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, didn't see that

[03:56:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: my suggestion was that a deaf-blind user might want to use caption tracks via a braille display

[03:56:05.0000] <othermaciej>
a blind user would likely most want an audio description track

[03:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
(although I suppose they could be hearing-impaired such that they can hear music but can't understand speech)

[03:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
(so it's probably nicer to accommodate such people if possible)

[03:58:00.0000] <nessy>
so, I really do wonder: is there a problem with just parsing the external file (SRT, DFXP, or whatever format we decide on), mapping it to existing HTML/CSS/JavaScript/ whatever constructs, and displaying it in the browser that way?

[03:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but not if it significantly compromises the majority use cases)

[04:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: my guess is that in our case we'd use QuickTime's existing implementations

[04:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: the video playback subsystem should not have to reimplement, or import, an HTML/CSS/JS/DOM/HTTP/etc engine just to render subtitles

[04:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: I expect using the Web engine to present subtitles it would be harder to get the performance good and the synchronization accurate

[04:01:02.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: I think that makes sense when the DFXP track is inside a QuickTime file - such as the 3GPP files that use it, but maybe not so much when it comes straight into the browser as a text file

[04:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
there should be no difference between an embedded file and an external file, imho

[04:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: well I sure don't want two totally separate DFXP implementations

[04:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
they should be exposed using the same API, and rendered using the same subsystem

[04:02:03.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: I don't think you can pass an external text file through the media subsystem for parsing and interpretation

[04:03:00.0000] <nessy>
but ok, that's fair enough

[04:03:01.0000] <nessy>
the API that we are proposing has been designed to be the same across internal and external tracks

[04:04:00.0000] <nessy>
and maybe it is possible to reuse the parsing of a media subsystem

[04:04:01.0000] <nessy>
I'm sure going to have to work at encoding DFXP into Ogg...

[04:05:00.0000] <nessy>
or at least a sensible subpart of it ...

[04:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: why? does someone want to write an Ogg player with DFXP support?

[04:06:00.0000] <nessy>
we cannot ignore the professional market with Ogg IMO

[04:06:01.0000] <nessy>
if we want to be omnipresent, we have to be able to do quality captions

[04:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
quality captions I agree with

[04:07:01.0000] <nessy>
several open source players support basic DFXP already

[04:07:02.0000] <nessy>
out of MPEG and MOV files mainly

[04:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: I wonder what the deal is with the way the page you linked references the external captions

[04:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the <text> element inside <video>

[04:09:00.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: I couldn't get them out of firebug either - must be linked inside the file or something, not sure either

[04:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't see any support for that in WebKit

[04:09:02.0000] <nessy>
Eric showed me that file and since I like collecting examples, I keep using it

[04:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the <video> element has a child element <text type="application/ttaf+xml" src="/media/us/mac/imac/2009/tours/apple-imac-design_video-cc-us-20091111_cc.xml" lang="en"></text>

[04:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which is nonstandard

[04:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I should ask Eric what is up with that

[04:10:03.0000] <nessy>
oh, I didn't see that (silly me)

[04:10:04.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe there is also a caption track in the file

[04:10:05.0000] <nessy>
must be just some javascript then that does the display...

[04:10:06.0000] <hsivonen>
<text> overlaps with SVG. :-(

[04:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems there are also captions in the file

[04:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
cause the controls show up even if I go straight to the video file: http://movies.apple.com/media/us/mac/imac/2009/tours/apple-imac-design_video-cc-us-20091111_r848-9cie.mov

[04:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(Safari uses a generated HTML document with a <video> element when you directly link to a video file)

[04:12:01.0000] <nessy>
ah, I should probably look at it in Safari to get the HTML5 markup!!

[04:12:02.0000] <nessy>
that would make a difference!

[04:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
oh yeah, I got all that with the Web Inspector

[04:12:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think the <text> element does anything

[04:12:05.0000] <nessy>
in Firefox I just got an object element of course :)

[04:14:00.0000] <nessy>
looks like somebody had similar ideas to us with the <text> element :)

[04:20:00.0000] <nessy>
anyway - looking at the DFXP thing as a long-term possibility and SRT as a quick here-and-now solution is probably where we are going

[04:24:00.0000] <nessy>
incidentally, neither has been "standardised" as such - we need to write a spec for SRT and register the mime type and the TimedText guys have to get to CR

[04:24:01.0000] <nessy>
you might also enjoy looking at smilText http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL3/smil-text.html

[04:27:00.0000] <nessy>
we'll introduce the spec into public-html soon - maybe should cross-post to whatwg?

[04:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: cross-posting messes up threads - I recommend not

[04:41:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah, I have had that experience in the past, too

[04:41:01.0000] <nessy>
so, maybe two posts - on each

[05:20:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I'd say no to 1

[05:20:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, much like CSS obsoletes features over time, so should it be possible for HTML

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: do you mean that previously valid CSS1 is no longer valid CSS1?

[05:38:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, yes

[05:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: interesting

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk>
also, allowing HTML4 makes no sense since we already decided it's broken

[05:54:01.0000] <annevk>
all kinds of stuff validates as HTML4 and will never be processed as such

[05:54:02.0000] <annevk>
it makes no sense

[05:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I agree.

[05:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
however, saying that DTD-valid HTML4 no longer is DTD-valid HTML4 is quite revisionist

[05:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but I'm not saying that it's useful to have DTD-valid HTML4

[06:09:00.0000] <annevk>
I see

[06:10:00.0000] <annevk>
In CSS that works because CSS does not have "versions". Just different levels of features. So if something is changed that affects a features it will change in every level...

[06:11:00.0000] <annevk>
I tried to find a list of the things  that changed, but can't see to find it now. At least one of the things is the escape syntax.

[06:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I remember clip changed in 2.1

[07:33:00.0000] <boblet>
hey all, when talking about a11y Hixie mentioned “making features more explicitly media-independent”

[07:34:00.0000] <boblet>
does media-independent refer to eg not just visual browsers?

[07:34:01.0000] <boblet>
can anyone hazard a guess?

[07:38:00.0000] <smaug>
Hixie: ping

[07:44:00.0000] <annevk>
 boblet, yup

[07:44:01.0000] <annevk>
boblet, he gave some examples, e.g. braille readers

[07:44:02.0000] <boblet>
annevk: thanks

[07:44:03.0000] <boblet>
I wasn’t around for the mention of braille readers unfortunately :)

[08:18:00.0000] <leejongwook>
firefox support html5 ?

[08:18:01.0000] <miketaylr>
sure

[08:18:02.0000] <leejongwook>
how about iceweasel ?

[08:18:03.0000] <leejongwook>
@_@

[08:18:04.0000] <miketaylr>
depends on what you mean by html5, and which subset of it

[08:18:05.0000] <leejongwook>
<--- want to learn html5

[08:19:00.0000] <leejongwook>
i know nothing but the name html5

[08:19:01.0000] <leejongwook>
<--- need to setup my environment :)

[08:19:02.0000] <miketaylr>
leejongwook: http://diveintohtml5.org/

[08:19:03.0000] <leejongwook>
so i need firefox :) and... that site :P

[08:19:04.0000] <miketaylr>
as well as the spec ;)

[08:20:00.0000] <leejongwook>
miketaylr, thanks :)

[08:20:01.0000] <miketaylr>
newer firefox, chrome, safari, opera all support html5 to varying degrees

[08:20:02.0000] <leejongwook>
i see :)

[08:22:00.0000] <smaug>
also IE8 supports some html5

[08:22:01.0000] <miketaylr>
oh, good call

[08:24:00.0000] <leejongwook>
:)

[08:27:00.0000] <leejongwook>
FlowPlayer <--- this is interesting 

[08:29:00.0000] <leejongwook>
Everything you know about XHTML is wrong <-- good, 'cause i don't know xhtml :P

[08:48:00.0000] <leejongwook>
i doubt my eyes @_@

[08:49:00.0000] <leejongwook>
so it's not flash player :P and it plays video @_@ without any kind of plugins

[08:50:00.0000] <leejongwook>
can't compare this with html4, only seen it with flash

[08:58:00.0000] <leejongwook>
In other browsers that do not support <video>, it falls back to QuickTime.  <--- i see

[09:00:00.0000] <leejongwook>
It’s important to note that the user is not prompted to install QuickTime if they don’t have it. Fallback is instant and automatic

[09:00:01.0000] <leejongwook>
cool :)

[09:03:00.0000] <leejongwook>
http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody <--- i saw this

[09:03:01.0000] <leejongwook>
nice :)

[09:05:00.0000] <leejongwook>
so i don't need to learn action script and svg to share videos and to draw something on

[09:05:01.0000] <leejongwook>
all in one :P

[09:07:00.0000] <leejongwook>
thanks again :P miketaylr smaug, see you all next time :)

[09:07:01.0000] <miketaylr>
later

[09:07:02.0000] <leejongwook>
:)

[09:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
isn't drawFocusRing() better than image maps?

[09:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does anybody still seriously use image maps?

[09:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
I thought server-side image maps went out of fashion in the 90s, and client-side ones in the early 00s

[09:26:00.0000] <mpt>
Philip`, they'd be a moderately vital part of any accessible replacement for Flash

[10:23:00.0000] <deltab>
Philip`: I'm already using SVGs with href

[10:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers bizarre shadow compositing behaviour in Opera

[11:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The <command> element is buggy in Firefox.  It is documented and validates only as self closing tag, but Firefox will not close the tag without a </COMMAND>.  So, you can pick your poison; you can not use the element all-together, you can markup the element as a self-closing tag and suffer the Firefoxequences, or you can add the closing tag and ignore validation all-together.

[11:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
JonathanNeal, can't you put it in another tag, so when Firefox hits the wrapper's close tag, it will close it?

[11:13:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, <command /> will not close, so the next <command /> will be a child of the previous.

[11:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
JonathanNeal: I expect he means <div><command></div>

[11:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
(or similar)

[11:14:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The next element will be a child of <command, until it is closed by some other means.

[11:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
What does <div><command></div><div><command></div> do, or whatever?  Does that make sense here?

[11:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me isn't clear on how or why one would use <command> in practice, so isn't sure if that makes sense.

[11:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why does it matter how Firefox parses it, given that the functionality is not implemented?

[11:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And right, does it matter how it gets parsed?

[11:15:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Say: <menu type="toolbar">

[11:15:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
<command onclick="insertTag(buttons, 0);"  label="strong" icon="bold.gif"/>

[11:15:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
<command onclick="insertTag(buttons, 1);"  label="em" icon="italic.gif"/>

[11:15:06.0000] <JonathanNeal>
</menu>

[11:16:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Ah crap, XChat didn't catch the line returns, sorry.

[11:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So why can't they just be nested in Firefox?

[11:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, they're invisible anyway, aren't they?  Or are you styling them somehow?

[11:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
<div> or <span> wrappers should fix it, anyway.

[11:16:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, nested as in each command being a child of the previous?

[11:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah.

[11:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's making these visible at all?

[11:17:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, then the styling would get in the way.

[11:17:03.0000] <Philip`>
It seems a bad idea to use those elements at all, because the spec might change (given that there's no implementations yet, as far as I'm aware)

[11:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I would very strongly advise that you avoid using anything with zero implementations.

[11:17:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That is a Catch 22.

[11:17:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, it's not.

[11:17:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Implementations happen before features are used in authoring.

[11:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
By the time there's implementations, the parsers will have been fixed

[11:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Once there's at least one implementation, you can test in that implementation.

[11:18:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It is the developers who have dictated the implementations.

[11:18:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's how this whole mess started.

[11:18:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Huh?

[11:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If authors deploy features without implementations, then implementers may find that the sites break when the feature is actually implemented.

[11:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If your site is big enough, that will hold up their implementation.  If it's not, then your site will break.

[11:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
In any event, you gain nothing by using features that don't exist yet in *any* browser, so what's the point?  Use <input type=image> instead.

[11:20:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, you're referring to Gecko or Webkit implementing <command> ?  Okay, I just wanted to use a recommended element as a child of <menu>

[11:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why do you want to use <menu>?

[11:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Nobody implements that either :-)

[11:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What Philip` said.

[11:25:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Accessibility and giving better meaning to page controls.

[11:25:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
let me provide an example

[11:25:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://sandbox.thewikies.com/liferay-rotating-banner/

[11:25:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The source downlaods are outdated, but you'll see on that page I'm using <menu> and <command>

[11:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why not just use <nav> and <a>?

[11:28:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, is there some markup that would allow it to be a control but also prevent the screen-reader from listing the control, since it is visual only.

[11:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
JonathanNeal: I think you'd actually need to use <li><command></li> to make that correct, otherwise the content is interpreted as merely "flow content describing available commands" and not as actual commands

[11:29:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Using a screen reader or keyboard navigation, you can already move through all of the banners, so it didn't make sense for it to then list the controls, since the keyboard and screen-reader already provide those controls.

[11:29:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The controls are for the visually unimpaired only.

[11:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have no idea, but I'm pretty sure that using a completely unimplemented feature isn't the best way to do it.

[11:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Maybe the validator should raise a warning when someone does that?)

[11:32:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hey TabAtkins :D

[11:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
yo

[12:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me always forgets how many canvas tests he has :-/

[12:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
310? 306?  Something like that.

[12:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
My text editor says I'm still only 60% of the way through the test file, and I've not even started writing any new ones yet

[12:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't mean literally forgetting the number - I can check the index page which says 724

[12:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
I just mean forgetting how much work it is to even read through all the tests

[12:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, kk.

[12:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Would anybody mind if I made APNG support necessary in order to pass some tests?

[12:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, go right ahead.  ^_^

[12:38:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, I had a question for you about accessibility.

[12:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
shoot

[12:38:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm trying to create controls visible only to the visually impaired, is there ARIA for that, or an appropriate element?

[12:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If they can be expressed with normal HTML semantics, but you just don't want them shown to sighted users, use the abspos trick.

[12:39:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I was using <menu> and <command>s but they might be considered unstable, and the validation / browser implementation doesn't match up.

[12:39:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I want them show to sighted users, not unsighted users.

[12:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, that's the exact opposite of what you just said.  ^_^

[12:40:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
You're right, I meant to say "visually paired"

[12:40:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
unsighted users get the entire website experience without these additional controls, example @ http://sandbox.thewikies.com/liferay-rotating-banner/

[12:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, actually I'm not sure then.  Typically you're needing to expose extra controls to the disabled.  Let me see...

[12:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The visually impaired wouldn't do well with the controls, but javascript markup seems like a secondary solution, if I can be educated on an elemental or ARIA solution. 

[12:42:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
"javascript markup seems like a secondary solution" eg including the controls via js.  I don't think that would help with screenreaders either.

[12:43:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I can use a series of empty divs and spans, of course, but I thought there was another way.

[12:44:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I was inspired after I saw http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/#N10405

[12:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, duh.  role=presentation

[12:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That conflicts with the allowed semantics in the aria mapping table in html5, though.

[12:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd bring that up on the list.

[12:47:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Wait, so it's good but bad?

[12:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
You want to use role=presentation.  But it's officially disallowed right now in HTML5 (only <img alt=""> can have it).

[12:48:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Oh, and I want presentational html.

[12:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Alternately...  Just use empty elements and/or images with no alt for the controls.  If the controls don't *contain* any content, they can't be read out.

[13:01:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
In the meantime I may add the role="presentational", for possibile forward compatibility.

[13:01:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I wonder who IBM got the idea that <menu> and <command> would work the way they described.

[13:01:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
*how

[13:04:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
What's a good element to use for controls?

[13:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
JonathanNeal: I expect they got the idea by reading the spec

[13:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
although it wasn't "IBM"

[13:05:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Depends.  <div>, <span>, or <img> likely.

[13:05:03.0000] <Philip`>
and it wasn't even a person who works for IBM

[13:05:04.0000] <Philip`>
and it was 2.5 years ago

[13:05:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Right.

[13:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I have a section with controls at the top, I guess I could stick them in a <nav>

[13:06:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Since they don't belong to the content, but they do belong to the section

[13:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  Just found a rendering bug in FF3.6.

[13:34:00.0000] <jwalden>

hi

[14:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
yo

[14:52:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
a breadcrumb wouldn't imply a <nav> right?

[14:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wouldn't personally mark it up as one, but it's arguable.

[14:55:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It's part of the content but not part of any particular section.

[14:56:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm referencing http://sandbox.thewikies.com/html5-layout/portal_normal.html

[15:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are examples of breadcrumbs in the spec, if they help

[15:10:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Oh yea?  I'll check that out.

[15:10:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Where?

[15:10:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>

your version sounds way more poetic though

"I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit."

[19:28:01.0000] <boblet>

Yea, you go and google that and see where it leads you, boblet.

/me is liking these conforming-with-warning feature less and less

[20:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i should raise an issue suggesting that we make them non-conforming but downplayed errors again

[21:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: what would be your suggestion for how a "downplayed error" gets displayed by a conformance checker?

[21:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: Googling that quote leads me here:

I wonder who I should contact about updating http://www.chromium.org/developers/web-platform-status

[22:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmmm. RDFa API mentioned in the context of TAG review of client-side storage APIs

[22:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: collapse all the downplayed errors into one grayed out error at the bottom that says something like "...and 5 less important errors [show]" or something

[22:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: OK, that'd be one way to do it in the Web UI

[22:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but there's also the validator API

[22:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's lots of ways to do it in an api; the api can just have a boolean flag for each error that says whether it's "minor" or not, for instance

[22:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, then, the general problem is that I can't think of any similar apps that have a "downplayed error" level

[22:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
most have error, warning, informational

[22:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
with no additional level of granularity to distinguish different levels within "error"

[22:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you have to interoperate with such systems, put these into the "Warning" category"

[22:13:01.0000] <Hixie>

"The SQL queries could be identified by URIs"

[22:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not a fan of introducing downplayed errors alongside warnings esp. if the are close enough to be mapped to warnings for interop

[22:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
me either

[22:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't see how else they can be stuffed into an api that doesn't have the required level of detail

[22:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose you could also just put them into the "error" bucket with parentheses around them or something

[22:32:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: if only more of the religious right followed the lead of Pastor Phil, instead of being fixated on smiting

rather than "Run these steps:"

[23:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, i see

total inability to debug any SharedWorker code in Chromium is making me really really sad. :/

[00:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: I think unfortunately Pastor Phil himself missed the irony of the term "bottom" in his "step 1. Start with the bottom" advice

[00:00:02.0000] <rektide>
had to go into the logs to see, hey, Chromium, you stopped re-requesting the page... even though its changing.

[00:00:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: nobody helped you out at all on that yet?

[00:01:00.0000] <rektide>
MikeSmith: zcorpan did show up w/r/t my base case, and he got that working

[00:01:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: nooo! don’t destroy my hope!

[00:01:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: this is case of "dramatic irony"

[00:01:03.0000] <rektide>
Drew Wilson also followed up /w a post on the Chromium-HTML5 group

[00:01:04.0000] <pesla>
MikeSmith: What has the N people to do with it?

http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-html5/browse_thread/thread/8a1a0042c8c32de3#

[00:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
pesla: read the message and try to figure out if there is any part of it -- even any small part -- that adds new information to the discussion, or that is actionable in any way

[00:03:00.0000] <rektide>
but now that the base case is out of hte way, i have MessageChannels flying everywhere and closures galore and i can only debug 1/3 the code... if i want better debugging i have to add new message channels to output the statu\s of the code I cant see

[00:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: you should get that feedback to JoePeck and/or #webkit-inspector at least

[00:03:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
not that it does you any good personally in the short term

[00:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but could help others later, if they add some better debugging features for workers

[00:07:00.0000] <rektide>
drew wilson filed http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=36577

[00:08:00.0000] <rektide>
chromium is, so i'm told, lacking what capabilities do exist in webkit-inspector

[00:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe we can suggest to people that they self-evaluate the content of their messages before sending them, and add [ignorable] if they are not providing any new information or if there's nothing actionable in the message

[00:08:02.0000] <rektide>
i dont believe i have any way to see whats in webkit-inspector, lacking a mac osx or windows machine.

[00:08:03.0000] <annevk>
naïve comes to mind

[00:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: huh?

[00:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
chrome runs on linux

[00:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
arora has web inspector too

[00:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
arora = browser based on Qt port of Webkit

[00:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: right-click and Inspect Element ?

[00:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the v8 test suite makes assumptions about how a race between a timeout and the HTML parser finishes

[00:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Web <3

[00:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess the spec doesn't put those two into the same queue, huh

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'd expect that to be a spec bug then

[00:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
is this a 0-second timeout?

[00:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so the v8 suite assumes that the event loop doesn't spin after an inline script

[00:20:03.0000] <hsivonen>
25 ms

[00:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh, ok, that's different

[00:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
so if the inline script is the last thing, it wants the EOF handled in the same task?

[00:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
as the </script>?

[00:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
no, it wants a div after the script to parse in the same task as the script

[00:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh well that's definitely a bug in the page then, we can't guarantee that kind of thing, it might be network-bound

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: indeed, it's a bug in the test suite

[00:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[00:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but it's still my problem

[00:23:00.0000] <annevk>
you have to be compatible with the page or something?

[00:23:01.0000] <annevk>
if so the spec should prolly say something about it

[00:23:02.0000] <annevk>
though it seems kind of odd

[00:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yeah, because it's part of Mozilla's test suites

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, I expect another perf fix to paper over this

[00:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
just whining about test suites

[00:24:02.0000] <othermaciej_>
hsivonen: you should patch the copy in Mozilla's test suite IMO

[00:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej_: that, too

[00:26:00.0000] <beilabs>
Hey guys, I've been playing around a little with HTML5/cached pages for offline use....is it possible to run a script to cache many different pages, allowing for the user to have full use of the site in an offline context without them have to visit each one individually?

[00:27:00.0000] <annevk>
beilabs, you can list the pages in the manifest

[00:27:01.0000] <annevk>
beowulf, that ought to do it

[00:28:00.0000] <annevk>
that was not meant for beowulf but you get the idea...

[00:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me decides to try to increse the sniffing limit to 1K as in WebKit in order to work around bogus Apache instances out there

[00:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
including the one at lists.whatwg.org

[00:28:03.0000] <annevk>
o_O

[00:28:04.0000] <beilabs>
annevk, so just having 10 pages in the manifest will allow the user to browse all 10 pages even only after visiting one single page....the other 9 will be cached?

[00:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: please let adam know what you decide is the minimum required for compatibility

[00:29:01.0000] <beilabs>
just thinking about a concept app...sorry for my silly questions

[00:29:02.0000] <annevk>
beilabs, as long as the user visits the one that points to the manifest, yes

[00:30:00.0000] <beilabs>
annevk, ahh cool...thanks.

[00:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm trying 1K, because I recall someone (ap?) saying that WebKit went to 1K and that worked

[00:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but yeah, I'll let Adam know if 1K works

[00:30:03.0000] <annevk>
/me forgot how it worked when they all point to he same manifest

[00:31:00.0000] <asmodai>
g'morning.

[01:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, this autobuffer attribute (now preload) is the most weak-sauce attribute in the language

[01:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
it has like no UA criteria at all except the IDL attribute, when you get right down to it

[01:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't suppose there's any way i could convince you to add some sort of support for the equivalent of #file and #line to the validator, is there?

[01:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the "offset the line numbers by this much" thing stopped working when i started validating the post-preprocessor versions of the files

[01:09:00.0000] <doublec>
is autobuffer officially preload now?

[01:10:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems so

[01:10:01.0000] <annevk>
http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=4810&to=4811

[01:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
just checked it in

[01:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
mere seconds ago

[01:12:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: thanks for addressing autobuffer

[01:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notes that "none" is the added feature

[01:14:01.0000] <zcorpan>
adding a "nobuffer" attribute would be more compatible with shipping firefox

[01:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
"metadata" is also an added feature

[01:15:01.0000] <doublec>
is the spec regenerating itself or something? All the multipages are 404

[01:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
before, you had two options -- UA does what it likes, and UA does what it likes but probably will buffer a lot

[01:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
doublec: hm, seems to have broken, hold on

[01:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: and how we have three options -- UA does what it likes, UA does what it likes and UA does what it likes? :)

[01:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
four options

[01:17:02.0000] <zcorpan>
oh yeah sorry

[01:18:00.0000] <annevk>
at some point HTML5 needs to say something about https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524223 I think

[01:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
UA does what it likes (likely to be equivalent to one of the other three unless it invents a fourth state), UA does what it likes but likely downloads nothing, UA does what it likes but probably will buffer only metadata and first frame, and UA does what it likes but will either buffer until canplaythrough fires or until load fires.

[01:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
doublec: multipages at whatwg or at w3c?

[01:19:00.0000] <annevk>
i.e. under what circumstances something will be treated as a CSS style sheet; the rules changed

[01:19:01.0000] <doublec>
MikeSmith, whatwg. It's working now though.

[01:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
k

[01:19:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: do you think it belongs in HTML5 because the CSS WG didn't address the issue?

[01:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: there's pretty much no way to convince me to add any validator features right now, sorry. I'm trying to get the HTML5 parser in Gecko into a state where we can flip the switch and turn it on by default

[01:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Is it not more an issue of whether you use the link element or not?

[01:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looked at that back in October when it was reported, and can't remember the detail entirely

[01:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Esp. in the case when what the link element points to isn't served as text/css

[01:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
doublec: yeah, dunno what happened there. seems fixed now.

[01:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
doublec: sometimes the rather brittle pipeline between all the services i use breaks :-)

[01:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: k

[01:21:04.0000] <doublec>
hehe

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: maybe i should work on MikeSmith instead :-)

[01:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: is there some way to make the text/plain output to output the actual broken line at all?

[01:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that would help a lot

[01:22:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me hopes the multipage problem wasn't his fault

[01:22:04.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, because HTML5 defines the conditions now too I guess

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: no i think it was some side-effect of my bugzilla script dying when it tried to send ISO-8859-1 as UTF-8

[01:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
i really should fix that at some point

[01:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think bugzilla is probably not sending back appropriate headers

[01:27:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess I could file a bug on the issue, but I wonder if that's the appropriate way to track it

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i commented on the bug

[01:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: about the line-reporting thing, might be good to file a bug/enhancement request on bugzilla.validator.nu .. I can try to look myself at what'd take to add it. also, I did a presentation/demo here on validator.nu the other day and there were some people there who were interested in contributed but asked how many interesting/useful features there were left to add

[01:29:01.0000] <annevk>
btw, so bufferedAmount does not include framing overhead, but does include it being encoded as UTF-8?

[01:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yeah

[01:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: will do

[01:30:00.0000] <annevk>
somewhat weird imo

[01:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i imagine that there's a ton of useful work that can be done in making the validator more user-friendly

[01:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, definitely

[01:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: comment on the public-webapps list (smaug mailed the list iirc)

[01:30:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
but this request has an actual person behind it right now, waiting for it get added. which makes a big difference of course

[01:31:00.0000] <nessy>
I'm almost sorry I got so curious about the canvas accessibility discussion - that curiosity is bound to make me only enemies :-)

[01:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: what component?

[01:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i hear ya

[01:31:03.0000] <zcorpan>
"The above rules will block the attack because an HTML, XML etc. header will

[01:31:04.0000] <zcorpan>
always cause a broken first CSS descriptor." -- <!-- is valid css

[01:31:05.0000] <zcorpan>
from https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524223#c4

[01:31:06.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: yeah, I know :S

[01:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: "general" component, I guess

[01:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: I will put together surveys on the two media proposals, and point you at the drafts of those so you can suggest refinements

[01:33:01.0000] <nessy>
MikeSmith: I'm not worried about those two proposals

[01:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: surveys similar to the recent ones on the canvas and summary-details proposals

[01:33:03.0000] <nessy>
MikeSmith: I am more worried about the format question

[01:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which particular format question

[01:34:01.0000] <nessy>
the one which external formats get supported

[01:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[01:34:03.0000] <nessy>
it's actually a question relatively independent of those two specs

[01:35:00.0000] <nessy>
there is only a single line pointing to formats in the TextAssociations wiki page

[01:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, as far as the proposals, I'm not worried if you're not -- but the surveys are a sorta necessary formality

[01:35:02.0000] <nessy>
ah ok

[01:35:03.0000] <nessy>
well, then can we have three surveys?

[01:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
necessary at least as far as the conventions of this particular group (a11y TF)

[01:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: sure

[01:36:02.0000] <nessy>
I'm happy to help formulating them

[01:36:03.0000] <nessy>
thanks

[01:36:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: if you have time to draft up some text for the surveys and e-mail it to me, let's do that

[01:36:05.0000] <nessy>
ok, cool

[01:36:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
you can use the canvas survey and summary-details survey as models

[01:36:07.0000] <nessy>
does it have to be ready before tomorrow's meeting?

[01:36:08.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen, MikeSmith: http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=720

[01:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: models just for just the text.. I will take care of setting up the actual survey

[01:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: thanks

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk>
oh crap

[01:42:01.0000] <annevk>
html5-diff needs an update now for preload

[01:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it intentional that

[01:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
<time>

[01:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
12:34</time>

[01:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
is seemingly non-conforming, because LF is not White_Space?

[01:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
LF is White_Space

[01:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/PropList.txt

[01:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
LF is U+000A which is in the range 0009..000D

[01:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/2010Jan/0010.html seemingly indicated it wasn't

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
i saw someone else say White_Space wasn't LF recently

[01:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
but maybe that's a confusion between WS and White_Space

[01:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
didn't have time to investigate

[01:45:04.0000] <Philip`>
Oops, I didn't realise that was a month old

[01:45:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: speaking of white space, did you actually locate an email from me asking for &#13; to expand to LF?

[01:45:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, the UCD as of Unicode 5.2.0 (i.e., the above link) certainly has LF

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: didn't look

[01:46:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, he did

[01:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt doesn't say WS

[01:47:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, oops, nm

[01:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: may I assume the decision will be reversed regardless?

[01:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe some of the other letters are magic

[01:47:03.0000] <gsnedders>
White_Space: "Separator characters and control characters which should be treated by programming languages as "white space" for the purpose of parsing elements."

[01:47:04.0000] <gsnedders>
'Note: There are other senses of "whitespace" that encompass a different set of characters.'

[01:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: why would we reverse it?

[01:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Why would it?

[01:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Because WS sounds a bit like White_Space

[01:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah.

[01:48:03.0000] <gsnedders>
There is White_Space, which is a binary property

[01:48:04.0000] <gsnedders>
There is also "WS" which is a possible value for Bidi_Class

[01:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Then there is the Zs (Space_Separator) in General_Category

[01:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[01:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: because it's a gratuitous change from what all four engines do now

[01:49:03.0000] <Philip`>
Unicode is hard

[01:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me mumbles it-really-isn't-that-hard

[01:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's harder than not supporting text

[01:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, yes, textual communication is overrated.

[01:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me hasn't even worked out which of the files in http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/ contain original data and which are derived from others

[01:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: is it a web compat problem?

[01:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I don't know yet. It's a mochitest compat problem.

[01:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it was very intentional: http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=941&to=942

[01:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: and it affects the parser quite dramatically

[01:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: dramatically?

[01:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, maybe "dramatically" is overstating the case

[01:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
it affects the tree construction phase in a dozen places

[01:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: only if you want to treat &#13; as whitespace

[01:57:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but even so, not a huge deal

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-June/thread.html#11689 is the thread

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess it was anne requesting it, not you

[02:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm vindicated!

[02:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
indeed you said then what you're saying now :-)

[02:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-June/011703.html

[02:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I have foresight, too. :-)

[02:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
You have to live in exactly the moment, now.

[02:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
reopen the bug or send mail or whatever, so it gets on my queue -- if anyone disagrees, they should speak up

[02:01:03.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[02:01:04.0000] <annevk>
i still think normalizing it makes sense

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
to death with CR

[02:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: then Opera should ship it first to gauge the Web compat effect :-)

[02:06:00.0000] <smaug>
annevk: hey, you're about to send a message about bufferedAmount to webapps

[02:06:01.0000] <annevk>
not really

[02:06:02.0000] <smaug>
I'm not sure my email ever got through

[02:06:03.0000] <smaug>
since I wasn't using my usual email account

[02:06:04.0000] <annevk>
I'm not too interested in its semantics to be honest

[02:06:05.0000] <annevk>
just seemed kind of odd how it worked

[02:06:06.0000] <smaug>
ah

[02:07:00.0000] <smaug>
it is still odd

[02:07:01.0000] <smaug>
unless Hixie just changed it

[02:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just changed it as you asked

[02:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
UTF-8 bytes, no overhead bytes

[02:08:02.0000] <smaug>
ah, thanks

[02:10:00.0000] <rektide>
question; did the "expose EventTarget within JavaScript" thought-train ever get anywhere? http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-April/019387.

[02:10:01.0000] <smaug>
another thing is message event. What values should origin and eventid etc have . I assume null.

[02:11:00.0000] <rektide>
zcorpan: thanks for all the help with my SharedWorker example.  you nailed all the issues i was having.

[02:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think that's defined, but yeah, null, empty string, etc, whatever the "empty" value is for the relevant types

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's defined with the event interface iirc

[02:12:01.0000] <smaug>
Hixie: but null or empty string?

[02:12:02.0000] <smaug>
ah, I'll check there

[02:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
"Except where otherwise specified, when the user agent creates and dispatches a message event in the algorithms described in the following sections, the lastEventId attribute must be the empty string, the origin attribute must be the empty string, the source attribute must be null, and the ports attribute must be null."

[02:12:04.0000] <smaug>
right

[02:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rektide: np

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
rektide: i don't think it ever got sent to the more appropriate list, but i don't follow that other list as carefully, so dunno

[02:14:00.0000] <rektide>
Hixie: thanks, i'll do some archival work & post if its still not mentioned.

[02:15:00.0000] <smaug>
there was some discussion about EventTarget JS objects

[02:15:01.0000] <smaug>
in w3c mailing lists

[02:15:02.0000] <smaug>
webapps or dom

[02:15:03.0000] <smaug>
but IIRC it was still missing good use cases

[02:16:00.0000] <rektide>
well, if you ever want to make an object that can publish events, it'd be handy to have

[02:17:00.0000] <smaug>
"publish events" ?

[02:17:01.0000] <rektide>
i just cant really imagine a spec that would help with the nitty gritty;

[02:17:02.0000] <smaug>
but that is not a use case

[02:17:03.0000] <smaug>
want to make an object to do this or that isn't a use case ;)

[02:18:00.0000] <rektide>
i have a use case, i dont really care to explain it or reduce it to mortal terms.

[02:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rektide: OK if I borrow that sentence from you for later use of my own?

[02:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I like that sentence

[02:22:01.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: nice work on the preload attribute

[02:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
It puits me in the mind of Fermat

[02:22:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[02:22:04.0000] <rektide>
be my guest MikeSmith 

[02:22:05.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: I think you missed something though, but let me run it past you

[02:22:06.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: You're being very philisophical today…

[02:22:07.0000] <jgraham>
You think?

[02:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Certainly far moreso than normal

[02:23:01.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: when autoplay is used, the video should regard preload as set to "auto" - no?

[02:23:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That isn't hard, though

[02:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: so long as it plays, i don't really mind what buffering happens if autoplay="" is set

[02:25:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: yeah, so it is up to the browser, i.e. "auto" ?

[02:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
the preload attribute is just ignored if autoplay is set

[02:25:02.0000] <remysharp>
I'm trying to clarify a point - does HTML5 (and various implementations of specs surrounding it) extend: a) the DOM, b) the BOM (browser object model) or c) both (I thought it was this, but not completely sure now I've gone over and over in my head)?

[02:26:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: I guess it's self-evident that neither metadata nor none would be appropriate, but it may make sense to state the obvious

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Filed the CR thing as http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9144

[02:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: the spec says the attribute is ignored altogether, so it doesn't matter what value it's treated as

[02:27:02.0000] <nessy>
ah I see: so it's up to the browser anyway - ok, I get it

[02:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
remysharp: Depends what you mean by DOM and BOM, I guess

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: well how preload="" is handled is entirely up to the browser anyway, so it's kinda hard to tell the difference :-)

[02:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: it's just a hint

[02:28:03.0000] <Philip`>
remysharp: I don't think HTML5 redefines the basic DOM things like getAttribute and createElement etc - it just defers to DOM 3 Core for that

[02:29:00.0000] <nessy>
fair enough :)

[02:29:01.0000] <remysharp>
Philip`: so things like the applicationCache, would you say that's BOM then?

[02:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
remysharp: but it redefines all the interfaces that HTML pages expose to scripts via objects in the DOM

[02:29:03.0000] <Philip`>
remysharp: I would never use the term "BOM" :-)

[02:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
remysharp: (except for byte order marks)

[02:30:01.0000] <annevk>
remysharp, BOM means byte-order-mark

[02:30:02.0000] <annevk>
remysharp, we refer to everything as DOM usually

[02:30:03.0000] <remysharp>
Philip`: okay cool. That makes sense. I've been staring at the question so long none of the letters made much sense anymore!

[02:30:04.0000] <annevk>
remysharp, including e.g. XMLHttpRequest, applicationCache, etc.

[02:30:05.0000] <remysharp>
cheers for the help chaps.

[02:58:00.0000] <annevk>
I'd like to add some kind of overview table to http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/ but I can't really work out what it should look like

[02:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
overview of what?

[02:59:01.0000] <annevk>
what changed and what stayed the same between HTML4/HTML5

[02:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
get a png of the whole of html4, and the whole of html5, with width 10px or something, and draw confident looking lines from one picture to the other showing how things have moved to different parts of the spec

[03:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
and then wait and see if anyone actually asks about it

[03:00:01.0000] <annevk>
merging DOM2HTML and HTML4 for such a table would be nice though maybe APIs and markup should stay separate

[03:00:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I'll get right on that!

[03:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh i wasn't suggesting the lines should be real, btw

[03:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
hence confident-_looking_

[03:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could draw a graph of HTML version number vs awesomeness

[03:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How would that handle the unversioned future?

[03:19:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, NaN exception

[03:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Just extrapolate the line into extreme awesomeness

[03:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But where on the x axis?

[03:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
On the right

[03:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
because it's more awesome than HTML5, and the line slopes upwards

[03:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it must go there

[03:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'm going skiing, should be back in about 40 hours.

[03:45:01.0000] <virtuelv>
How does it handle HTML6

[03:46:00.0000] <virtuelv>
6.8.3, even, these days

[03:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, you can go skiing in California?

[03:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
we have a mountain

[03:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's not very good skiing

[03:48:03.0000] <annevk>
downhill?

[03:48:04.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: www.skicalifornia.com

[03:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
i mean it's no bruson or verbier or bergen or anything

[03:49:00.0000] <annevk>
didn't know you did skiing

[03:49:01.0000] <annevk>
/me wants to go skiing again too

[03:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm swiss!

[03:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
didn't know i did skiing

[03:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
next you'll say you didn't know i liked cheese!

[03:49:05.0000] <annevk>
fair enough

[03:50:00.0000] <annevk>
or fondue?

[03:50:01.0000] <annevk>
/me doesn't like fondue

[03:50:02.0000] <virtuelv>
or guns

[03:50:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Hey, there are plenty of Norwegians who swear off skiing for life once they reach 18

[03:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
fondue is cheese

[03:51:01.0000] <annevk>
when you say skiing in Norway they always assume cross-country

[03:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, crazy norwegians

[03:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
in french we call than "ski de fond"

[03:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
i call it "walking"

[03:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
specs are generated for publication today, btw, in case the team decides to give the ok

[03:52:01.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: you should try downhill skiing on cross-country skis sometime

[03:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I've done cross-country skiing multiple times this winter. for the first time since military service.

[03:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
if changes are needed, i guess i'll do them this weekend

[03:53:00.0000] <virtuelv>
/me is considering  buying cross-country skis again, for the first time since around my military service

[03:53:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(I spent my naval days in a now-closed mountain in 93-94)

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'm really gone

[03:55:01.0000] <karlcow>
/me loves cross-country skiing but didn't have many opportunities these last few years

[03:56:00.0000] <annevk>
virtuelv, I'm having enough trouble as it is on my normal skis on black

[03:57:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm not falling anymore, but I'm going way faster than other people and not always intentionally so...

[03:57:01.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: is tryvann the only black course you've tried?

[03:57:02.0000] <annevk>
yeah, I hear it's not a very difficult black course, at least according to Lachy

[03:58:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I've actually never skied there, but given the terrain around there, I can't imagine it being more than blue/red

[03:59:00.0000] <annevk>
it's quite a bit steeper than their red/blue tracks

[03:59:01.0000] <annevk>
but maybe those are actually green? and their green is nothing?

[03:59:02.0000] <annevk>
I've only been to one other place in Oslo so I don't have much to compare with

[04:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I can't imagine Tryvann having a black course

[04:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, the problem with the black run at Tryvann is that it's a completely straight, fully groomed run. It's just fun because it's long and designed for high speed.

[04:38:00.0000] <asmodai>
Did HTML ever allow the valign attribute to have "center" as value?

[04:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
asmodai: Off the top of my head, no

[04:45:01.0000] <asmodai>
Guess they meant align then

[04:46:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: *no* slope in Norway is designed for high speed if you have to carry a lift card

[04:46:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(in other word on open days)

[05:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
asmodai: I think there was some issue like you couldn't have the same keyword in two different enumerated attributes

[05:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it was align="center" and valign="middle"

[05:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
(due to weirdness of SGML DTDs)

[05:04:03.0000] <Philip`>
though I could be entirely making that up

[05:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think that's accurate; sgml had a feature where you could omit the attribute name and just have the value

[05:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
like <td center middle>

[05:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
Did that feature have to be explicitly enabled for each attribute in the DTD?

[05:05:03.0000] <zcorpan>
no, it's enabled for all enumerated attributes

[05:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(there's no concept of boolean attributes in sgml; they're just enumerated with one value)

[05:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, indeed

[05:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I really wonder what the SGML people were smoking sometimes.

[05:07:03.0000] <Philip`>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"><title></title><table><tr><td center middle></table>

[05:07:04.0000] <Philip`>
validator.w3.org says that's valid

[05:07:05.0000] <asmodai>
Philip`: They actually did mean align="center". Just replaced it with some CSS to text-align it.

[05:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I like how <table valign=middle> causes the error message "Attribute "VALIGN" is not a valid attribute. Did you mean "valign"?"

[05:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
has someone reported a bug about that?

[05:10:00.0000] <asmodai>
Philip`: heuh?

[05:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Does anyone recall any improvements in IE8 that can be classified as "implementing HTML4 better"?

[05:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't particular know of any lacks in their HTML4 implementation that they fixed in IE8.

[05:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<abbr>? <object>?

[05:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2010Feb/0014.html mentions the bug

[05:11:02.0000] <zcorpan>
<img alt>

[05:11:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
What was wrong with their <img alt>?

[05:11:04.0000] <Philip`>
<q>?

[05:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
they showed a tooltip

[05:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, I suppose they showed it in a tooltip.

[05:12:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[05:12:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That one's not really implementing HTML4 better (closer to the spec), just changing a UI issue to better match expectations, right?

[05:12:04.0000] <zcorpan>
they changed the parser for end tags

[05:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, I really had no idea about that.

[05:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
at least </li>

[05:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
which became incompatible with everyone else

[05:15:00.0000] <virtuelv>
TabAtkins: you're implying the SGML people only smoked some times?

[05:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
virtuelv: Presumably they were sane when they were around their families.

[05:16:01.0000] <virtuelv>
you assume they had families?

[05:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Helps them blend in to society, while they pursue their madcap markup schemes

[05:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
in the future people will imply we were smoking for making the platform overly insane for compat with a mere few billion documents

[05:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
What do you mean "in the future" people ask that all the time in the present

[05:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
And in the past it was the theory that gave us XHTML 2

[05:22:02.0000] <nessy>
MikeSmith: just sent you the three questions to vote on

[05:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: thanks very much

[05:23:01.0000] <nessy>
hope it helps :)

[05:24:00.0000] <nessy>
gotta grab some sleep now - got an early meeting tomorrow

[05:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, nn

[05:24:02.0000] <nessy>
cya nn

[08:38:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Goodmorning!

[08:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Good morning!

[08:40:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, thanks for your help the other day with <menu> and <command> stuff, I was able to finish a new HTML5 outline I'm proposing to put in our product (you can see it @ http://sandbox.thewikies.com/html5-layout/ )

[08:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The bottom links point to alternate css for the page.

[08:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: What's バリデーター?

[08:50:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Why, dominoes.

[09:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Japanese

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.google.com/search?q=%E3%83%90%E3%83%AA%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC highlights the word "validator" on a lot of pages

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
so maybe it's that

[09:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, duh

[09:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I read the last part as 'data'

[09:44:00.0000] <asmodai>
Dashiva: it says baride-ta- -> validator

[09:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: validator

[09:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, what asmodai said

[09:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me figured that out a couple of hours ago thanks to Google Translate

[09:50:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I know enough Japanese to know that google translate is not all that reliable :)

[09:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, it seemed to fit awfully well.

[10:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, I guess バリデータ is the more common way to write it, rather than バリデーター

[10:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I suppose I should have checked that before tweeting it

[10:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh well

[10:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
that common usage sounds wrong to me, though

[10:09:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
バリデーター makes it a long "a" sound at the end

[10:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
with is the usual way of transliterating a final "r", like in "er"

[10:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which there is no real equivalent for in Japanese

[10:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
バリデータ makes the last part sound more like "data", like Dashiva points out

[10:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, a lot of common ways of transliterating stuff in Japanese a plain wrong

[10:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
like マイケル for Michael

[10:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it should be マイクル or even マイコ

[10:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me almost fails to notice the difference between the first two

[10:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: It makes more sense if you assume the people transliterating it only knew the written form and not the pronounciation

[10:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I know

[10:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it's actually changing

[10:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see more and more people on twitter and such who are dispensing with the bookish canonical transliterations of names and words and instead just writing them closer to the way they really sound

[10:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm guessing tech-oriented Japanese have to be able to transliterate independently just to keep up with new terms

Or are there a semi-official "authorities" for that?

[10:21:00.0000] <asmodai>
Not really.

[10:21:01.0000] <asmodai>
There's the G5 collection and some katakana dictionaries, but most of it is quite informal.

[10:21:02.0000] <asmodai>
Nothing like Kojien, Meikyou or such dictionaries tend to really touch it, unless the term is so common.

[11:31:03.0000] <zcorpan>
i thought it actually was the case now (in the spec)

[11:38:00.0000] <annevk>
it is, it's the reverse that's not possible

[11:38:01.0000] <annevk>
(though it's unclear whether that's wanted)

[11:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess it's possible by adding tabindex=-1 to otherwise focusable elements in the subtree

[11:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(with script)

[11:39:02.0000] <zcorpan>

[14:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
@itemtorment, actually.

[14:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Only on a top-level microdata item.

/me suddenly realizes that the channel is +t, but there are no ops . . . do you get a freenode staffer in every time you want to change the topic?

[16:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Change the topic? What's that

[16:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I recall it was -t before, I'm guessing the mode got set during a netsplit or something

[16:41:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
this channel isn't even registered?

[16:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nope.

[17:27:00.0000] <boblet>
I want “Microdata brings torment and dismay” on a t-shirt

[17:29:00.0000] <boblet>
actually “brings torment and dismay” would work even better. I could then change it to HTML5 or whatever is bringing the most torment at the time

[18:34:00.0000] <foolip>
boblet: please let me know when you have the t-shirts for sale, I will buy!

[18:35:00.0000] <boblet>
foolip: we are both naive in the ways of the internet; http://twitter.com/EvilandLazy/status/9656120722

[18:37:00.0000] <boblet>
someone has a real time search set for “t-shirt” and has a nice little business going on Zazzle

[18:37:01.0000] <boblet>
I didn’t have the heart to reply “yeah, but I’d want one that didn’t look like you made it in 5 min” ;-)

[18:39:00.0000] <boblet>
(at least it wasn’t Comic Sans)

[18:51:00.0000] <boblet>
so is @spellcheck only for forms? seems like it’d be for textarea and input, but it’s applicable to “HTML elements”…

[19:01:00.0000] <foolip>
boblet: isn't that just the DOM attribute? is <p spellcheck> really valid?

[19:03:00.0000] <boblet>
in section-index.html#attributes-0 it says elements = HTML elements, whereas eg placeholder has input; textarea

[19:04:00.0000] <foolip>
huh, ok

[19:05:00.0000] <boblet>
might file a bug on it just in case

[19:05:01.0000] <boblet>
or maybe a FORMAL OBJECTION!! (cue ominous da-da-daaaah!)

[19:05:02.0000] <foolip>
no no, it's Formal Objection

[19:06:00.0000] <boblet>
No one ever expects the Span… err Formal Objection!

[19:07:00.0000] <foolip>
no need for mockery though, I assume that's the way some WGs work, even if it seems unnecessarily formal

[19:07:01.0000] <boblet>
instead of the comfy chair, we can have the huge narcoleptic email thread

I wonder if there are other WGs as strange as the HTML WG

[19:12:00.0000] <boblet>
this one has to be the best

[19:37:00.0000] <boblet>
anyone know where in the spec the @id value is precisely defined? it seems from /elements.html#the-id-attribute it now supports non-ascii characters like kanji, and I wanna confirm that

[19:41:00.0000] <miketaylr>
boblet: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#concept-id ?

[19:42:00.0000] <boblet>
miketaylr: that’s actually the same text I referred to ;-) it doesn’t say eg what unicode character range(s) are allowed, or what class of content is allowed

[19:42:01.0000] <miketaylr>
oops!

[19:42:02.0000] <miketaylr>
i don't recall reading that (yet?)

[19:43:00.0000] <boblet>
heh, np

[19:43:01.0000] <boblet>
I’d like to know what “at least one character” actually refers to

[19:43:02.0000] <miketaylr>
emoticons, hopefully

[19:43:03.0000] <boblet>
well, yeah, numbers are ok in ids now, so what else? can we use things like @ or £?

[19:44:00.0000] <boblet>
or is it just straight alphanumeric?

[21:21:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
boblet: anything goes basically in id

[21:22:00.0000] <boblet>
zcorpan__: so any unicode character except space or non-unicode characters (whatever they’re called) huh

[21:22:01.0000] <boblet>
rock

Hixie: the vote on the media a11y stuff will be over the next week, IIUC - then the emails will go to the WGs

[00:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
boblet: I'm not sure if it's explicitly defined anywhere, but I'm fairly sure "character" in HTML5 just means any arbitrary Unicode codepoint

[00:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, it does define "The term Unicode character is used to mean a Unicode scalar value (i.e. any Unicode code point that is not a surrogate code point)"

[00:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
though I'm not sure if "character" is meant to be precisely that definition

[00:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>

So is that yet another case of non-safe CURIE and URI overlap?

[02:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they should be called Dangerous CURIEs

[02:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Imagine how much trouble the world would be saved if they had been sensible enough to scrap non-safe CURIEs from the outset

[02:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
A rather small amount, given how many people care?

Supposing a browser let you change or override @lang, what would actually happen?

[03:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Maybe it'd help screen-readers that use lang to guide pronunciation

[03:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
or the browser's spellchecker

[03:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Spellchecker is useful, but changing @lang is little different from changing the spellchecker's dictionary directly

[03:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: it could affect font selection

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>

There ought to be a TLA registry to avoid naming conflicts

[06:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There needs to be a registry regtsiry too, to prevent people from creating overlapping registries

[06:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wants a registry of all registries that don't include themselves as a member

[06:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's easy - just make a registry X such that if someone asks it whether X is registered in it, their request gets bogged down in bureaucratic processes for years and they never get a definitive answer back

[06:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
That way the registry will never have to give an incorrect answer

To improve the signal-to-noise ratio?

[09:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How does that work?  Smart people respond quicker than stupid people?

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
People who respond quicker are more likely to be feed subscribers, and therefore excellent people, rather than random stranges who noticed the post on Reddit

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also, people who respond quicker are more likely to be responding to the post, and not responding to other comments and straying far from the original topic

[09:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me has his doubts.

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>

[09:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I just got the TeXBook a day or two after his post on the CSS2.1 appendices being in alphabetical order.

[09:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems that some others already pointed out that the TeXBook has appendices in alphabetical order.

[09:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I also wanted to remark, since the comparison had come up, how much more elegant TeX is than CSS.  Granted, partly this is because it's Turing-complete, but I suspect it's also because it follows one person's vision rather than accreting over time.

[09:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've been wondering if anyone's tried implementing a TeX-like line-breaking/hyphenation algorithm in HTML, actually.  I'm sure someone has.  I wonder how it worked out.

[09:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML is really unsuitable for high-quality typography, sadly.

[09:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: That exact topic has come up recently.  Yes, there is definite interest in implementing Tex-like line-breaking and hyphenation, and specifying such precisely in a CSS module.

[09:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would be neat.

[09:19:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And yes, someone has done so already *in Javascript and canvas*.

[09:19:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Awesome.  Link?

[09:19:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I"ll have to find it.  one sec.

[09:20:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hey all.

[09:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: http://ajaxian.com/archives/tex-line-breaking-algorithm-in-javascript

[09:20:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, http://sandbox.thewikies.com/html5-video/

[09:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Seems like no hyphenation, though.  Sad.  The TeX hyphenation algorithm looks efficient enough for web use.

[09:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, right, that's just line-breaking.  Yeah, hyphenation shouldn't be too bad either, from what I understand.

[09:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assume it does French spacing, since you can't do "~" or "\ " or such.

[09:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Er, well, I guess you can.

[09:22:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
&nbsp; is ~.

[09:22:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: Strange implementation of your html5 shim.  Did that come from performance tests or something?

[09:24:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, you mean with the while loop?  It's just the fastest, smallest way to do it.

[09:24:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
In a while loop, you get the best performance by sticking the math before the variable, like --i

[09:24:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's not the smallest way to do it.  May be fastest, shrug.

[09:25:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I bet it's one of the smallest ways to do it, minus all the generous spaces and variable names I gave it.

[09:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
"abbr,article,etc".split(',');for(var i=0;i<e.length;i++){document.createElement(e[i])} is what I use.

[09:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sorry, clipped that wrong.  Assume a "var e=" beginning that line.

[09:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And I'm certain you can do it smaller by using Array functions.

[09:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does JS have map()?  :)

[09:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yes.

[09:28:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, by one space... var e='abbr article etc'.split(' ');i=e.length+1;while(--i){document.createElement(elems[i])}

[09:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does this work?  "abbr,article,etc".split(',').map(document.createElement)

[09:28:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
But the while loop is much better for performance.

[09:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
The performance here is negligible anyway.

[09:28:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

[09:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doubts .map() will work in IE, though

[09:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: Actually, you can probably shave off more if you correctly reference e in the createElement call.  ^_^

[09:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Kind of defeats the point.

[09:30:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, yes.

[09:30:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
var e="abbr,article,etc".split(',');for(var i=0;i<e.length;i++){document.createElement(e[i])} VS

[09:30:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
var e='abbr article etc'.split(' ');i=e.length+1;while(--i){document.createElement(e[i])}

[09:30:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Really, it was the storing of the createElement result that confused me.

[09:31:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, that was unnecessary, in a previous implementation I was nulling out that value after the loop (for memory purposes, but I think it's negliable.

[09:31:01.0000] <paul_irish>
JonathanNeal: /*@cc_on'DetailsCanvasMeterHeader {....}'.replace(/.[a-z]+/g,function(n){document.createElement(n)})@*/

Anyone want to try and play http://igofigure.com/movie/dhsab_p1/ in IE8?  I'm getting a seemingly-random subset of people not able to play videos off of my site in IE8.

[09:32:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
paul_irish uses this in modernizr, and would know a lot about it.

[09:32:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins ^^

[09:33:00.0000] <paul_irish>
TabAtkins: here's the most recent round of hacks on it: http://gist.github.com/296128

[09:33:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Back they placed the shiv in modernizr, I just use it as a reference whenever I need to use it, and that's where the var comes from.  paul_irish why do you null it out?

[09:34:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
paul_irish, what is the performance impact between these?

[09:35:00.0000] <paul_irish>
a reverse while loop vs a str.replace iterator? hmmm.. i dont think anyone has tested.  but its all <20ms  and you know.. happens once per page load

[09:36:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'll run it through my tester.

[09:36:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
it = them

[10:24:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, I never heard if you got what you needed about <video>

[10:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, not yet.  For some reason all flash-based players I've tried are failing when trying to play videos off of either of the servers I control in IE8, for certain people.

[10:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
This isn't helped by the fact that the IE8 on my work comp is refusing to recognize that I even have a valid version of flash, while the IE8 on my laptop plays everything perfectly fine.

[10:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me fights with zip encodings

[10:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought zips don't have encodings

[10:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
They just don't tell you which one it is

[10:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The extraction assumes windows-1252 (or similar) and the content is actually shift_jis. But the result is madness.

[10:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Most of the bytes in the raw filename are in the 0x80 - 0x9F range, but the result filename has characters in 0xC0 through 0xF9

[10:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: Could you try visiting http://www.igofigure.com/flowplayer/example ?

[10:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
In ie8?

[10:50:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Sure thing.

[10:50:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And tell me if it breaks or not?  By 'break', I mean play a second or less of video, then hang the IE process.

[10:51:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Looks good to me, loved the Sing a long blog

[10:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyone else want to try it out in IE8?

[10:51:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Now I'm wondering if it's something to do with our VPN.  I dunno if any customers have reported problems yet.

0x83 0x80 x83 becomes 0xE2 0xC7 0xE2... how on earth

[11:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"When the user presses the key combination corresponding to the assigned access key for an element, if the element defines a command, and the command's Hidden State facet is false (visible), and the command's Disabled State facet is also false (enabled), then the user agent must trigger the Action of the command."

[11:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What does this imply if you have duplicate accesskeys?  They all get triggered?

[11:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That doesn't seem to be what anyone implements (for good reason).

[11:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: That's probably meant to be covered by the optional behaviors in steps 3.3 and 4

[11:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, seems nobody has bothered implementing textBaseline properly yet

[11:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Opera and Chromium use top/bottom of the bounding box, not top/bottom of the em square

[11:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Firefox gets that right)

[11:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
None bother handling hanging and ideographic baselines

[11:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, interop would be nice here.  Firefox 3.5 or so changed behavior so that if there are multiple elements with an accesskey, hitting the accesskey toggles between them instead of activating the first.

[11:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It broke some stuff.  Rather inconvenient from an authoring perspective.

[11:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(it's still not fixed in vBulletin)

[11:48:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Woo, finally cracked it

[11:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It wasn't reading the shift_jis as windows-1252 or anything like it, it was using IBM437

[11:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(Why?)

[11:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Looks like that's the one that lets you draw cools borders and gradients in plain text files

[11:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
I used it all the time for graphics in my QuickBASIC programs

[11:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, now I can fix my Japanese files at long last

"// spec says to not throw error for invalid arg, but do it anyway"

/me tries to figure out the hg equivalent of git show for revisions

[12:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hg log seems to work.

[12:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you want to see the revision as a diff, then I think it's hg diff -c 1234

[12:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me has no idea what git show is

[12:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
git show displays a git object.  For revisions, it typically gives you the commit message, date, diff, etc.

[12:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=436904#c4

[12:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, hg log -pr 1234 sounds like it, then

[12:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's what I wound up with.

"Can we please add to the Web Sockets API methods getResponseHeader() and  getAllResponseHeaders() as the per the XMLHttpRequest API."

[12:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
On one hand, I can see how this might be useful, but on the other hand you can just as easily send that metadata as the first message from the server

[12:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought Web Sockets wasn't HTTP

[12:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it doesn't have headers

[12:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes. But there are plenty of people over at IETF who want to turn web sockets into HTTP 2; also, there would be HTTP headers if a connection via HTTP upgrade failed

[13:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why don't they make HTTP 2 if they want HTTP 2?

I think that's what the hybi group is for

JonathanNeal: low is higher than high, and avg is higher than both?

[13:54:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I must have written things wrong then.

[13:55:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I guess I can throw out these tests.

[13:55:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
My last tests were about the same though.

[17:17:00.0000] <afa>
Chrome has rolled in a preliminary WebForms validity API that has broken my site

[17:17:01.0000] <afa>
i'm going to report it as a bug, but i want to make sure i'm correct before i do

[17:17:02.0000] <afa>
if a radio or checkbox group has an element checked, the whole control should be valid, shouldn't it

[17:18:00.0000] <afa>
where "whole control" means every input with the same name

[17:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
afa: you're using the "required" attribute?

[17:21:00.0000] <afa>
yeah

[17:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm checking what the spec says

[17:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if it's not an implementation bug then it's clearly a spec bug

[17:22:00.0000] <afa>
thanks

[17:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
afa: for checkboxes, the spec says it is based on just the element's checkedness

[17:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#checkbox-state

[17:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
So I guess a "required" checkbox has to be checked, regardless of the group

[17:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
afa: for radiobuttons, it is supposed to be per group

[17:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#radio-button-state

[17:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
afa: according to that spec, if any radiobutton in the group has checkedness of true, validation should pass

[17:28:00.0000] <afa>
sorry for wandering off

[17:28:01.0000] <afa>
that link crashes opera (and my IRC session)

[17:28:02.0000] <afa>
so anything you said after that, i didnt get

[17:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
afa: eek, sorry

[17:30:00.0000] <afa>
it's been a while since i worked on this app, so i want to make sure my memory is correct

[17:31:00.0000] <afa>
if you POST a checkbox, then multiple identical keys get sent for each checked checkbox with the same name, correct?

[17:31:01.0000] <afa>
so if c1s1q1 had values 0 and 1 checked,

[17:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
afa: short version, for checkbox, "required" requires each checkbox to be chacked, regardless of "name", for radio buttons, it's per group

[17:31:03.0000] <afa>
c1s1q1=0&c1s1q1=1 would be POSTed?

[17:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think that's right but I don't really know

[17:32:01.0000] <afa>
i know when i first brought this up, you said this may be a spec bug

[17:33:00.0000] <afa>
and i know that the unintuitive parts of HTML are often there for a reason (perhaps legacy cruft, perhaps others)

[17:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if it was true for radio buttons, yeah

[17:33:02.0000] <afa>
so i want to discuss this before i comment on the RFC

[17:33:03.0000] <othermaciej>
@required isn't legacy

[17:33:04.0000] <afa>
i know, but i know in other cases, there have been reasons for the unintuitive parts

[17:33:05.0000] <afa>
so i want to make sure this isnt the case :)

[17:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think for radio buttons it works as you expect, for checkboxes, what the spec says sounds reasonable to me

[17:35:00.0000] <afa>
the radio bug is a problem in chrome

[17:35:01.0000] <afa>
the checkbox is a conflict between my JS implementation and the docs

[17:35:02.0000] <afa>
i may comment on that part of the spec just to get feedback

[17:36:00.0000] <afa>
on its face, it's not wholly unreasonable

[17:36:01.0000] <afa>
but it seems to me that a group validation is more flexible and consistent

[17:36:02.0000] <afa>
so any multiple choice widget, whether mutually exclusive or not, has the same API

[17:36:03.0000] <afa>
if you want to require a box to be checked, put it in its own group

[18:21:00.0000] <afa>
i submitted a comment on the checkbox validity API:

[18:21:01.0000] <afa>

It is amazing to see Microsoft's reaction to the serious threat that HTML5 has to the OS centric market place after the acquisition of On2. The tactic of using a hobbled Internet explorer to hold back Internet centric applications is finally about to fail and they know it. That's what this is all about. The Microsoft dinosaur is thrashing around in it's tar pit. Microsoft has a lot of fellow reptiles in this tar pit , so I hope we get HTM

It would be a false assumption to consider lack of comment agreement , so I ask it the other way, 

[20:00:02.0000] <drclue>
does anyone here feel that recent actions by Microsoft, Xerox,Adobe and other firms via litigation , government manipulation

[20:00:03.0000] <drclue>
and other methods might be born of fears that an Internet Applications Platform might threaten their business models?

[20:00:04.0000] <miketaylr>

[20:02:00.0000] <drclue>

[20:30:00.0000] <drclue>
Come on folks , either agree that HTML5 is a threat to the powers that be and that the current responses of Adobe, Microsoft , Xerox and indirectly Rupert Murdoch and other powers are a serious threat , or call me out as the fool. Or at least say something. This is a real issue IMHO and should be seen as a call to action. If you consider it to be a yawn fest , say so.

[20:30:01.0000] <drclue>
HTML5 is a major seed change in the way businesses address applications development. Those changes have a major effect on

[20:30:02.0000] <drclue>
the bottom lines of trillions of dollars in business. Everyone just too focused on a weekend of party hardy?  People think that Google my favorite champion is bullet proof? What is it?

[20:32:00.0000] <drclue>
AOL and Compuserve were considered by many pendents at the time to be bullet proof. 

[20:36:00.0000] <drclue>
IMHO Microsoft is a POS , but in this case it is not simply Uncle Bill , nor even computer or Internet centric businesses that have skin in the game. This means that folks you have never even heard of that have significant market power  are taking aim.

[20:40:00.0000] <drclue>
I have on multiple occasions suggested that Google implement a search engine that harvests sec.gov and similar global representations of corporate family trees to allow folks to see who owns who and to understand in an easy way the behaviors of various corporate and news entities. A single link to a child's mobile of relationships would prove my point

[20:42:00.0000] <drclue>
Having to dig about to know that Rupert Murdoch owns MySpace.com and has significant interests in Hulu.com

[20:42:01.0000] <drclue>
should not be a thing I need to prove by elaborate means 

[20:43:00.0000] <drclue>
To show the interactions between Rupert Murdoch and Microsoft , Direct TV , NBC and such is not something I should need to prove

[20:44:00.0000] <drclue>
Simply citing a google link would make this easy

[20:46:00.0000] <drclue>

HTML5 and the CODEC VP8 need to resolve themselves in weeks not months

HTML5 is indeed the future of  the Internet, but don't be so arrogant as to believe that life fixes itself

opera 10.5b2 is better behaved with the dynamic web fonts on http://diveintohtml5.org/ but still not perfect

[21:39:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
the initial page load is fine, but navigating to different pages slowly makes the fonts smaller and smaller

[21:39:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
very strange bug

[21:39:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
easily reproducible, i hope

[21:40:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
email me if you need further details

[22:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
... What the fuck was drclue *smoking*?

[22:12:00.0000] <drclue>
I have been told via official venues that HTML5 is a religious / activist venue basically around the globe. and that in further questioning   that  the platform is covered by various terrorist directives 

[22:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: you woke it up!

[22:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
we have official venues?

[22:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
OH GOD I DID IT I'M SO SORRY MACIEJ

[22:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
btw anything important in my e-mail? i haven't had time to look yet and i'm probably not going to until tomorrow, so if there is, let me know :-)

[22:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I blame the CSS in my IRC.  I make joins/quits almost invisible so I can normally ignore them.

[22:14:01.0000] <drclue>
Not just some middle east thing , but any venue violating dividends with no data to support some other perception 

[22:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
On the other hand, now I get to enjoy a nice word salad, I guess.

[22:16:00.0000] <drclue>
Fuck all this , if nobody can challenge or even agree I I'm out of here as I have far more worthy folks to give the word

[22:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Have fun, drclue.

[22:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, in other news, *finally* got my damned diploma in the mail today.

[22:17:00.0000] <drclue>
Geeze [TabAtkins[ actually says even something, and at last gets some warm thoughts from me 

[22:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: we sent the TransReqs for our FPWDs

[22:18:01.0000] <drclue>
Not sure what to think vs mail and stale

[22:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: will send pubreq once those are approved

[22:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: k

[22:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: grats re diploma

[22:20:01.0000] <drclue>
If hixie wants to say something , gold , anyone wants to claim Hixie fuck ya

[22:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: also Tim officially said HTML5 is in scope for HTML5

[22:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(dunno if you were around for that one)

[22:21:01.0000] <drclue>
Hixie is not particularly god , but of less mind to be a pain than those making noise

[22:22:00.0000] <drclue>
Look , Microsoft is dying unless they can trash us , so what ya got to say?

[22:40:00.0000] <drclue>
So really  , I need to on my own shoulders Internet freedom from a word 

[00:01:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
I feel like quoting TabAtkins, but I'd probably just wake up the dragon again

[00:01:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
(Not that it matters, since I'm going to sleep now, myself.)

[00:45:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, maybe we should just push for another port again?

[00:45:01.0000] <annevk>
with web sockets

[03:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
JonathanNeal: Your while loops look wrong

[03:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
while (--i) only loops i-1 times

[03:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
You should write normal for loops rather than trying to be clever with micro-optimisations that will make no practical difference :-)

[03:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me would like to complain about the snow

[03:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Why?

[03:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Snow is vastly superior to ice and sludge

[03:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
Because yesterday it was raining and washing the snow away. Today it is snowing again

[03:46:02.0000] <Dashiva>
You should complain about the rain then :)

[03:46:03.0000] <Dashiva>
It's too early for spring yet

[03:46:04.0000] <jgraham>
So there will be more ice and sludge in the future compared to it raning again and wasking more snow away

[03:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
You should complain about the ground - if there wasn't any then the snow couldn't build up

[04:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
I expect such a complaint would be dismissed as groundless

[04:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
(sorry)

[05:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone mentioned http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/02/ogg-theora-vs-h264-head-to-head-comparisons.ars here recently

[05:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
A relevant comment from http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=292#comment-2768 : "We talked about that on IRC, both with x264 and Theora people: all considered it one of the worst articles they had ever seen."

[05:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
So probably best not to pay too much attention to it

[05:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm

[05:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Chrome thinks my test page full of "ABCD" is written in Danish and offers to translate it

[06:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
>it should explicitly say alt="" MUST NOT be blank unless it MAY be left blank

[06:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't that implied? Or am I misunderstanding how the terms work

[06:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Implied requirements are dangerous

[06:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems generally better to be explicit

[06:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't like "x MAY y if z" because he's never quite sure if the intention was "x MUST NOT y if not z", or "x MUST NOT (not y) if z", or something else

[06:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
although in the case of <area> it already says it must be text that's somehow equivalent to the image area, so I don't see why it'd need to be stated again

[06:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
For additional fun, write requirements on the form "x MAY not y"

[06:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
And "x MUST only y if z"

[06:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
and "x MUST y only if z"

[06:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe all normative criteria should be written using some kind of formal logic notation

[06:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
RFC2119 is fine as long as you use the words in simple sentences ("if z, then y MUST x", "if not z, then y MUST NOT x", etc)

[06:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I think HTML5 generally does that quite consistently now

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oddly, Opera kerns text with strokeText on Linux but not with fillText

[06:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
and with neither on Windows

[07:06:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, Ubuntu says my harddrive is getting sucky

[07:07:00.0000] <annevk>
and video playback/downloading does seem to fail way more often

[07:07:01.0000] <annevk>
grmbl

[07:07:02.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if it's easy to replace a hard drive

[07:07:03.0000] <gsnedders>
In your ThinkPad?

[07:10:00.0000] <annevk>
yes

[07:11:00.0000] <annevk>
this sucks a bit, I was planning on seeing some of the new Damages episodes today

[07:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: ThinkPads all make it fairly easy to change HD, AFAIK

[07:13:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, guess I have to burn some Ubuntu installer disk as well

[07:13:01.0000] <annevk>
meh

[07:15:00.0000] <annevk>
would be nice if I could just put a SSD in

[07:25:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, those are not cheap

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there a reliable way to make sure a @font-face is loaded before trying to draw with it?

[07:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Firefox and Opera seem to block onload as long as the font is used in a (non-display:none) element within the page itself, so that's okay

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Chromium doesn't, so it randomly works only half the time

[07:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
and if I do something like draw with the font, then wait a bit to make sure it's really loaded and draw again, Chromium crashes

[07:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
so that's not so good

[07:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
and I'm not sure how else to do it

[07:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, seems to work better if I actually use characters from the font in the page

[07:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Detect the character width?

[08:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That would only help detect whether the font has been loaded, and wouldn't cause it to become loaded

[08:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: position: absolute; visibility: hidden; top: 0; left: 0; I guess would cause it to load

[08:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Without interfering with anything

[08:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
That seems to work

[08:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I was doing opacity:0 which also seems to work)

[08:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
with a 0.5s delay before drawing to make sure it's really loaded

[08:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
because WebKit doesn't delay onload, it seems

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Opera doesn't even get textAlign correct :-(

[10:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Current canvas text-drawing test scores:

[10:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Opera is trailing with 52%

[10:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Chromium is a bit better at 56%

[10:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
Firefox is racing into the lead with a staggering 61%

[10:21:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Awesome performance by Firefox

[10:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me gets bored and decides he has enough tests for now

[10:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Reminds me of a survey done here in Norway recently, which asked which dialect was the sexiest, and proclaimed that the northern areas were the winner.

[10:22:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Now, the northern area dialect had got a whooping 12% of the votes

[10:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And the least popular one had 7%

[10:28:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, are you uploading the new version of the test suite?

[10:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I will do once I've fixed some other broken tests

[12:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/tests/canvas/suite/tests/results.html

[12:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't be bothered to run them all on Windows too

[12:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's possible some tests are buggy - if anyone notices any, please let me know

[12:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Also there's some things I haven't tested at all yet, like <video>)

[12:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: ^

[12:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also, actual tests at http://philip.html5.org/tests/canvas/suite/tests/)

[12:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Maybe the results page should link back there...)

[13:03:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hello all!

[13:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
JonathanNeal: Hello, and http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100227#l-282

[13:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Philip`, I don't quite follow.

[13:06:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, oh, so Opera has the highest score rather than the lowest

[13:07:00.0000] <annevk>
seems like a lot of trivial bugs we ought to fix

[13:07:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Oh I see it.

[13:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Highest if you count all of the tests, and weight them all equally

[13:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and if I don't have serious bugs in my test runner)

[13:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Most are trivial and boring, though there's some like http://philip.html5.org/tests/canvas/suite/tests/index.2d.text.draw.baseline.html where it might be nice if top/bottom/middle worked properly

[13:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Maybe this is the kind of stuff Larry was talking about as overspecifying

[13:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Non-existence of createImageData is maybe the biggest thing

[13:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Maybe, but they're almost all things that could come up in practice

[13:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd probably call it "sensible, unambiguous, testable level of specification" rather than "overspecification"

[13:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I agree personally, but minor bugs that don't get fixed even over time may suggest otherwise

[13:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: It may suggest that expecting implementations to have 100% conformance is unrealistic and not a good use of anybody's time (and so the Rec criteria are broken and harmful), but problems are much more likely to get fixed if they're clearly specified and tested than if they're not

[13:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I don't think it suggests that it's not good to specify all the behaviour


2010-02-28
[20:48:00.0000] <boblet>
can anyone speak to the increased rigor Microdata has over Microformats? /cc @foolip

[20:49:00.0000] <boblet>
I can describe examples, but don’t know if I can adequately summarise it

[20:53:00.0000] <boblet>
things like using itemscope & itemprop vs class, defining href/datetime to be content and not text inside element, more explicit separation from content than uF (itemprop vs abbr and class-title patterns)…

[21:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: the main "increased rigour" is the same as the difference between html and xml -- you can parse microdata, like you can parse xml, without knowing the vocabulary in use.

[22:33:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: ahah. good I checked

[22:33:01.0000] <boblet>
and welcome back—how was the ski-ing?

[22:34:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, HTML5 is moving ahead pretty fast in adoption.

[22:34:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
What will happen when everyone starts adopting it when it's supposedly years from being ready.

[22:36:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: why use future tense? I’ve already done 3 or 4 HTML5 sites

[22:36:01.0000] <boblet>
no universe implosion (… at least, so far)

[22:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: not bad, not bad

[22:37:01.0000] <boblet>
;-)

[22:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
JonathanNeal: many parts are ready now, what do you mean?

[22:37:03.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: plenty to do yet

[22:41:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Opp, was having connection issues with IRC.

[22:41:01.0000] <boblet>
heh

[22:41:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
boblet, yea we're releasing our next version of the portal as HTML5.

[22:41:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And our website is HTML5.

[22:42:00.0000] <boblet>
well, there you go.

[22:43:00.0000] <boblet>
nothing happened, right?

[22:43:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, I was wondering what impact this has on the draft.

[22:43:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Since before I heard it wouldn't be ready for so long, I mean, is it still in a stage where elements can be added and removed?

[22:45:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: figcaption is the newest element I remember, and that was a month or two ago

[22:45:01.0000] <boblet>
definitely change is still possible, and we may have to change stuff

[22:46:00.0000] <boblet>
that’s the early adopter price I guess

[22:46:01.0000] <boblet>
at the same time your experiences can directly help improve the spec, so that’s a pretty good reward

[22:47:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yea, I wish I was able to contribute more.

[22:47:01.0000] <boblet>
heh. every bit counts

[22:47:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
But talking with you here, getting your input and implementing HTML5 in our stuff I suppose means something, a lil somethin.

[22:48:00.0000] <boblet>
real world implementation feedback means a lot I think

[22:48:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The guy or girl who puts together HTML5 Doctor does a pretty good job too, generally in my experience.

[22:49:00.0000] <boblet>
there’s six authors … at the moment ;-)

[22:49:01.0000] <boblet>
they’ve also had at least one guest  author

[22:49:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The most confusing new elements for me to learn about was section and article.

[22:49:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I was so confused about when the context was right for either one, and I wasn't comfortable putting section outside (around) an article.

[22:50:00.0000] <boblet>
JonathanNeal: http://oli.jp/2009/html5-structure1/

[22:50:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, there wasn't THAT when I started last summer, there was this room.

[22:51:00.0000] <boblet>
I wrote that June last year ;-)

[22:51:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yes, I saw.

[22:51:02.0000] <boblet>
but IRC is better than an article, so you found the best place

[22:52:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I've been continually taking in input for our master portal layout in the product (I've been keeping a demo @ http://sandbox.thewikies.com/html5-layout/ )

[22:54:00.0000] <boblet>
maybe you should write some articles too

[23:05:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
With those optional theme changes at the bottom, it's kind of like our csszen type layout.

[23:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Everybody does it

[23:06:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
but it's fun to do with html5

[00:15:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, if I have an article and there's an image associated with the article

[00:15:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
with figure / figcaption be appropriate?

[01:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
10.50 RC out now

[01:33:00.0000] <annevk>
you're faster than Google Reader

[01:33:01.0000] <annevk>
suspicious o_O

[01:35:00.0000] <annevk>
meanwhile I ordered a new hard drive

[01:35:01.0000] <annevk>
it does not seem too hard to install it

[01:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, I am in the office, so it's not so surprising I'm quick ;P

[01:35:03.0000] <annevk>
now I need to buy a writable-CD

[01:36:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, dah

[01:36:01.0000] <annevk>
fortunately the current hard drive is not so broken that everything stops working

[01:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
When I had HDD throw up loads of SMART warnings, I tried to dd everything off it

[01:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It failed. It starting making clunking sounds and dd gave I/O error.

[01:38:00.0000] <asmodai>
Be careful though

[01:38:01.0000] <asmodai>
Seagate apparently does some weird things with SMART that normal SMART tools cannot fully read properly

[01:38:02.0000] <annevk>
the only potential issue is that the new hard drive is not compatible I suppose

[01:38:03.0000] <asmodai>
Causing all kinds of false positives (or negatives)

[01:38:04.0000] <gsnedders>
So just because it seems like it currently works doesn't mean it'll keep working

[01:39:00.0000] <annevk>
right, I just noticed the corrupt sector count has increased since yesterday

[01:39:01.0000] <asmodai>
Which brand?

[01:39:02.0000] <annevk>
hitachi

[01:39:03.0000] <annevk>
I bought a new one with faster RPM and more space

[01:39:04.0000] <asmodai>
Ah. Not sure of those, but do they have a tool as well that you can download? Like SeaTools for Seagate disks?

[01:40:00.0000] <annevk>
why would I need a tool?

[01:40:01.0000] <asmodai>
That's always a good test to see how badly it is dying, if it is.

[01:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: do you keep using the broken hard drive?

[01:40:03.0000] <asmodai>
annevk: See point about SMART being misleading above. ;)

[01:40:04.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, it's all I have at the moment

[01:40:05.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: dangerous activity

[01:41:00.0000] <annevk>
the palimpsest disc utility tells me to replace it

[01:41:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I see

[01:41:02.0000] <annevk>
guess I better make a backup nowish then

[01:43:00.0000] <asmodai>
Aye, you should. :)

[01:44:00.0000] <asmodai>
At least now while you still seem to be able to read data from it.

[01:45:00.0000] <annevk>
you guys scare me

[01:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Welcome to the world of failing HDs

[01:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I recommend not shutting down the computer and not using it for anything but sending the files over network to another computer

[01:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or over USB to an external hard drive

[01:54:00.0000] <annevk>
i hope the new drive arrives soon

[01:54:01.0000] <annevk>
drives were in short supply everywhere, will prolly take a few days...

[01:54:02.0000] <annevk>
i'll back up stuff, make an iso tomorrow and I guess after that we'll see when it dies

[01:55:00.0000] <annevk>
hopefully not before all that...

[02:11:00.0000] <annevk>
i prolly have warranty on this hard drive too I guess

[02:11:01.0000] <annevk>
oh well, it's only EUR 80 or so

[02:12:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, if I have an article and there's an image associated with the article would figure and figcaption be appropriate?

[02:23:00.0000] <annevk>
JonathanNeal, sure

[02:26:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And <summary> is like the heading of <details>, like - <h1> is to <article> as <summary> is to <details>

[03:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders in which language "e.g." implies an exhaustive listing

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk>
not dead yet

[04:02:01.0000] <annevk>
and almost fully backed up

[04:16:00.0000] <annevk>
computer did crash once

[04:16:01.0000] <annevk>
presumably related to a disk failure

[04:16:02.0000] <annevk>
so much fun

[04:18:00.0000] <annevk>
instead of booting from a CD, can you boot from an iso file on an external HD assuming your internal HD is empty?

[04:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Presumably that depends on your bios

[04:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
I would guess no

[04:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
But only based on pessimism

[04:19:03.0000] <annevk>
ok, i'll buy some cds

[04:19:04.0000] <annevk>
and hopefully my hd survives long enough

[04:20:00.0000] <annevk>
i'm not going to do nothing until i get that cd and new hd though, that'd way boring

[04:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=305843&view=findpost&p=585740612 suggests a way to copy the contents of an ISO onto a hard disk and boot it

[04:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
though presumably you'd want to set up the boot partition on the external disk too

[04:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
and getting it to boot from that disk instead of from the first one seems likely to be BIOS-dependant

[04:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/ant/ent/

[04:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(If you have a USB memory stick then it ought to be possible to boot from that, instead of a CD)

[04:34:00.0000] <annevk>
oh i do

[04:34:01.0000] <annevk>
that sounds interesting

[04:34:02.0000] <annevk>
/me starts reading https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick

[04:39:00.0000] <annevk>
oh lol, you can even run the entire OS from a CD

[04:39:01.0000] <annevk>
euh, USB

[07:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hard to understand how Larry can complain about a lack of "transprency in standards" with a straight face

[07:37:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Context: http://masinter.blogspot.com/2010/02/masinter-and-web-standards-oh-my.html

[07:39:00.0000] <annevk>
can't find "trans" on that page

[07:39:01.0000] <annevk>
oh euh

[07:39:02.0000] <annevk>
nm

[07:39:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Ignore my typo

[07:39:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Apparently I can't spell anymore

[10:58:00.0000] <Bolkonskij>
hi

[11:02:00.0000] <annevk>
bah, creating an bootable usb stick is failing and also very slow

[11:03:00.0000] <Bolkonskij>
failing?

[11:05:00.0000] <annevk>
apparently some checksum is not matching after it wasted about 10 minutes copying some files

[11:05:01.0000] <annevk>
also formatting the usb drive fails about half of the time

[11:05:02.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if it's the usb drive

[11:32:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems I finally succeeded

[11:33:00.0000] <annevk>
that only took 45min

[11:33:01.0000] <annevk>
o_O

[11:33:02.0000] <annevk>
now I need my new HD and it should be all good

[12:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is there some official source from Google that says what codecs Chrome supports by default?

[12:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or, rather, at all?

[12:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chromium too.  I think that's "whatever ffmpeg supports, if you compile it right", but I don't have a reliable source.

[12:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is editing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_(HTML5)>, needless to say

[12:28:00.0000] <annevk>
afaik it's h.264/theora for chrome and just theora for default chromium

[12:28:01.0000] <annevk>
not sure where this is documented

[12:28:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, but what about other stuff like WAV PCM and AAC?  Also, I need an actual source.

[12:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some dude already reverted some of my changes, so I need to actually substantiate them.

[12:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: I bet if you ask on #chromium someone can help you

[13:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, I did, but didn't get a reliable source.  I went with a link to source code, but not sure if the other guy will think that's acceptable . . . it doesn't really meet Wikipedia guidelines.

[13:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, the rest of the article is largely unsourced, so big deal.

[13:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
what could be more reliable than the source code?

[13:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
are you looking for an official policy statement from Google?

[13:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Source code is reliable, but it can't reasonably be interpreted without programming knowledge *and* quite a bit of tinkering.

[13:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: I think Chrome also supports MPEG AAC audio, from looking at that source code

[13:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could write a blog post summarising the source, and then link to that

[13:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wouldn't mind if it were a blog post by a Chrome developer, or even a blog comment, just something that has a clear statement and is at least vaguely authoritative.

[13:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: (as does Safari)

[13:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: there was a post about their plans on the WHATWG list, but it might not have enough detail

[13:18:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, I'm certainly not reliable as a source here, I don't have any actual knowledge.

[13:18:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, do you remember when that was or what it was called or whatever?  Or have a link?

[13:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
this article says Chrome will support H.264 video, AAC audio, and Ogg Theora and Vorbis: http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10250958-2.html

[13:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Thanks.

[13:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
quoting a Google speaker

[13:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it does not cite MP3, but from the source that does appear to be supported as well

[13:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chromium is actually more important to me, because he put "Yes" for H.264/MP3 for WebKit, and I changed it to "Depends" because Chromium doesn't support those by default.

[13:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(although in practice it usually will if it's a distro Linux package using system libraries, and non-Linux users are unlikely to use Chromium)

[13:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: besides Chromium there are also the Gtk and Qt ports of WebKit which also depend on how the relevant media framework is configured

[13:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the Gtk port supports whatever GStreamer supports

[13:22:00.0000] <roc>
AryehGregor: do Linux distros generally package H.264? Fedora 11, at least, did not

[13:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do you have a quotable source for that?  I could give a link to the IRC logs, but that would probably be considered unreliable.  :)

[13:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: I don't know if I have a source other than source code, but I can try googling

[13:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.linux.org/news/2007/12/17/0001.html

[13:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
roc, the Ubuntu Chromium package lets you install it either with or without non-free codecs.  I suspect that typically the non-free codecs would be installed, since they're needed to play lots of content users would be likely to have.

[13:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess this would be the better reference: http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2007/12/html5-video-support-in-gtkwebkit.ars

[13:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, thanks.  I'll see what the guy says.

[13:25:00.0000] <roc>
AryehGregor: I don't know how that works, since AFAIK Canonical doesn't have a license to distribute H.264

[13:26:00.0000] <roc>
codec

[13:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
roc, I think it's some dodgy thing where it's not installed by default, and you have to click through some dialog saying you have the right to use the codec -- e.g., live in a country where it's not patented.  (I'm sure it's not patented in, say, Iran.)

[13:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know how they get away with it.

[13:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe they do have some kind of license for some of the key codecs.  IIRC, Dell licenses them for its Ubuntu computers.

[13:28:00.0000] <roc>
now I get to rant about how MPEG-LA selective enforcement conspires with well-meaning free software advocates promoting "legal workarounds" to hopelessly confuse the situation and reduce the chance we'll get a truly free solution

[13:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chromium is only in PPAs in current versions, and this page makes it seem like the chromium-codecs-ffmpeg* packages aren't yet available in Lucid: http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/chromium-browser

[13:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So as far as Chromium specifically goes, Canonical might not officially know about what codecs are available.

[13:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I do know that I can play patented formats in Totem and so on, and I don't think I ever did anything except maybe click through some dialog very early on.

[13:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Fabien Tassin is the Chromium PPA maintainer, you could ask him.  He's on freenode right now with the nick fta.
