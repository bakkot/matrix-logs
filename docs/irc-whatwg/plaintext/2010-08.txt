/me would like it noted for posterity that I am connecting to this channel from the Apple //e that my parents bought in 1983

[01:38:00.0000] <boogyman>
Can someone link me to the pages that highlights the differences between releases?

[01:39:00.0000] <annevk>
if you are talking about HTML5 there is http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker

[01:39:01.0000] <annevk>
and also http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/#changelog

[01:40:00.0000] <boogyman>
I thought the purpose of this channel is for HTML5 discussion?

[01:41:00.0000] <annevk>
did you read the topic? ;)

[01:41:01.0000] <boogyman>
it mentions the organization and a log url, that's it

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk>
it also says "Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks!" at the end

[03:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: happy birthday!

[03:55:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: on the websockets protocol; I like the look of just a single format for messages; although, the idea of "oh yeah, it's just always binary data" needs to be changed

[03:55:01.0000] <micheil>
annevk: now that gsnedders' has mentioned it, Happy Birthday!

[04:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
When people say Happy Birthday, it always puts "Unhappy Birthday" by The Smiths in my head

[04:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: But happy birthday irrespective of that

[05:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: https://code.google.com/p/html5lib/source/detail?r=5872b5724934b9dd4193758e1d11bbaa79239236

[05:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Does that get a non-ugly prize?

[05:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(not quite what you described yesterday)

[05:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Doesn't self.dataStream.read(chunkSize) just return the empty string if there is no more data?

[05:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
So you don't need to chech if data:

[05:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Am I totally misunderstanding or shouldn't you be adding _bufferedCharacter onto the beginning of data, not onto the end?

[05:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: No, it returns None, I think

[05:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yes I should

[05:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
Also, where does _bufferedCharacter get reset?

[05:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: where is it missing getting reset?

[05:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Sounds like it needs tests cases :-)

[05:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Well I don't see the code that makes _bufferedCharacter be None or the empty string or whatever when there is no character to buffer

[05:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
if there was in the last chunk

[05:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: it is initially None, and it gets reset to None after it is used

[05:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
line 354

[05:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh

[05:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
OK

[05:12:02.0000] <jgraham>
Can you show me where dataStream.read returns None?

[05:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, actually, is it not dependent on the file object?

[05:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
Right, but a file always returns "" from .read when there is no more data, doesn't it?

[05:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that appears to be true

[05:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
So that is what I would expect

[05:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
in file-like objects

[05:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
(also I am not quite convinced that detting bufferedCharacter to be "" when it is not needed and always doing bufferedCharacter + data should not be faster)

[05:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
(but I may be overestimating the optimisations in the python interpreter)

[05:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: premature optimization much?

[05:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Well I like it because I think it makes the logic simpler

[05:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Bah

[05:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Seems like you should test that optimisation

[05:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
It doesn't seem a good idea if parsing a 5MB file results in an extra 20MB of memory-copies when you're prepending an empty string to each chunk

[05:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
That is indeed the worry

[05:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, looks like it probably does do that optimisation, though it's not obvious exactly when it optimises strings

[05:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, I get similar numbers for the two cases in a trivial testcase

[05:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which might be highly misleading

[05:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me was looking at the id()s of the strings

[05:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
That works too

[13:05:00.0000] <duryodhan>
hi ... what language's HTML5 parser in HTML5lib is the recommended one ?

[13:06:00.0000] <duryodhan>
(talking about http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/ )

[13:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
duryodhan: Only the Python version is being relatively actively maintained

[13:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
The others are obsolete and probably broken

[13:07:02.0000] <duryodhan>
thanks!

[16:20:00.0000] <annevk>
thanks for the b-day wishes!

[16:20:01.0000] <annevk>
/me should get some sleep

[16:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Bleh, othermaciej isn't here.

[16:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
He mentioned something about how Apple backports fixes for significant standards issues in Safari, so I wanted to ask him if this could be backported.  https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40747

[16:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me needs to not forget about that.


2010-08-02
[17:00:00.0000] <Alystair>
any standards folks around? I'm just wondering if the following bug falls under a spec issue because it affects all most render engines: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=582037

[17:00:01.0000] <Alystair>
I've reported it to just about everyone, Mozilla seems to be the first one to step up to the plate

[17:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Alystair: Sounds more like it's just browser bugs

[17:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
given that bz called it a correctness fix

[18:19:00.0000] <variable>
could someone please explain to me what the difference between an IDL attribute and content attributes are ?

[18:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
variable: content attribute is the one on an element, e.g. <div title="this is a content attribute">

[18:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
variable: IDL attribute is the one on a DOM object, e.g. myDivElement.title = 'this is an IDL attribute';

[18:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
variable: setting an IDL attribute that reflects a content attribute will set the content attribute, and vice versa

[18:27:01.0000] <Alystair>
Philip`: well... sorta :X

[18:27:02.0000] <variable>
Ah, I see. Can they *ever* differ? I often see in the spec that "the content attribute must remain consitent with the IDL attribute"

[18:27:03.0000] <Alystair>
I might have made the report sound like it was a spec error, but I don't know if that was validated or not

[18:28:00.0000] <variable>
is there a reason that this must be stated? Or is it just clarity

[18:28:01.0000] <variable>
*just for clarity ?

[18:28:02.0000] <Alystair>
I mean it would make-sense(tm) but I never actually looked to the spec to see if something like that is mentioned

[18:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
variable: yeah, e.g. <input checked> is the same as HTMLInputElement.defaultChecked, and is different from HTMLInputElement.checked

[18:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
variable: also, some have no correspondance whatsoever, e.g. HTMLDocument.body is an IDL attribute but there's no element, let alone a content attribute, to go with it

[18:29:00.0000] <Alystair>
Hixie: you wouldn't happen to be Ian would you?

[18:29:01.0000] <Alystair>
YOU ARE!

[18:29:02.0000] <Alystair>
Wow what luck

[18:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
um hi

[18:30:00.0000] <Alystair>
is Acid3 still modifiable or any new tests need to go into the next Acid suite?

[18:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
acid3 is only modifiable in case of serious error

[18:31:01.0000] <variable>
Are there plans for an acid4 ?

[18:31:02.0000] <Alystair>
I have a test inclusion request for the next version then, what's is there a procedure?

[18:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
acid4 isn't something that is likely to happen any time soon

[18:32:01.0000] <Alystair>
fair enough then :)

[18:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
so if there's a bug that you think needs fixing, i recommend just filing a big rather than hoping for an acid test :-)

[18:32:03.0000] <Alystair>
yeah I've filled a bug with everyone but only Mozilla so far has taken action :/

[18:32:04.0000] <variable>
Hixie, are there concrete plans for it? or is it just some vaporware idea atm?

[18:32:05.0000] <Alystair>
which will be a problem because they will be the "odd man out" 

[18:33:00.0000] <Alystair>
even if their browser does a more correct rendering

[18:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
Alystair: feel free to use the whatwg blog as a soapbox :-)

[18:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
variable: define "concrete plans"

[18:34:00.0000] <variable>
Hixie, "this will get done on Towel Day, May 25, 2012. Or "This will get done with all the browsers release their next major version"

[18:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh the plan is to wait until all five major browsers have announced they pass acid3, more or less; same as with acid2->acid3

[18:46:00.0000] <Alystair>
Hixie: it's hard to tell how webstandards.org and whatwg relate

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
they are in no way related

[18:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
(why did you think they might be related?)

[18:48:01.0000] <Rik`>
Hixie: what about mobile browsers and Acid3 ?

[18:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
Rik`: what about them?

[18:50:00.0000] <Alystair>
Hixie: just my odd mind, because you're involved in both :)

[18:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is the "parse an address algorithm defined by the IRI specification" exposed anywhere to JavaScript?

[18:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
ah :-)

[18:50:03.0000] <Alystair>
or rather, saw your name on the acid test site

[18:51:00.0000] <Rik`>
Hixie: you don't want to wait for specific mobile browsers to pass Acid3 too ?

[18:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
Alystair: well, i guess there is a minor relation, which is that acidtests.org and whatwg.org are hosted on the same server :-)

[18:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
but that's just because i host them both myself

[18:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
(lots of stuff is on that server)

[18:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
(e.g. bully.org, hixie.ch, voidwars.com, etc)

[18:52:03.0000] <Alystair>
/me thinks he might end up getting involved in some way

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
Rik`: any in particular you had in mind?

[18:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: the url decomposition attributes expose it

[18:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay.

[18:53:03.0000] <Rik`>
Hixie: no, just a thought that mobile browsers are turning into "major" browsers

[18:53:04.0000] <Alystair>
mobile browsers?

[18:53:05.0000] <Alystair>
Opera Mini/Mobile

[18:54:00.0000] <Alystair>
Apple's stuff..

[18:54:01.0000] <Alystair>
what does blackberry even use?

[18:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
Rik`: indeed, but all the major mobile browsers correspond to major desktop browsers, so it's not a huge difference

[18:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
from my point of view there's no "mobile vs desktop", there's just the web

[18:56:00.0000] <Rik`>
to me too, but one mobile browser can have more marketshare than one of the "major" desktop browsers

[18:56:01.0000] <Alystair>
only limited by pixel width/height :P

[18:56:02.0000] <Alystair>
PPI

[18:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
Rik`: which one?

[19:03:00.0000] <Rik`>
Hixie: well, marketshare varies a lot depending on the area but Safari iOS or Opera Mini (if it counts) could be bigger than Opera desktop

[19:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
as I understand it Opera Mini intentionally breaks the specs, so it doesn't really count

[19:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
safari on iOS is something I look at, though

[19:05:00.0000] <Alystair>
yeah Opera Mini has a proxy system in place

[19:05:01.0000] <Rik`>
time to sleep, bye

[19:06:00.0000] <Alystair>
Has there been any talk about copy/paste buffers with html5?

[19:06:01.0000] <Alystair>
/me should go check mailinglist archive if there is one

[19:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
Alystair: not sure what you mean by copy/paste buffers

[19:17:00.0000] <Alystair>
well as applications move "to the cloud" you end up in the odd situation where an application cannot access or utilize the OS copy/paste buffer in a safe manner

[19:17:01.0000] <Alystair>
at the moment writing to the buffer is only possible via a cludge in flash or hacking configs in some browsers

[19:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, yeah, there's some feedback on copy-and-paste... let's see

[19:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
only stuff about copy and paste events, looks like

[19:54:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: happy birthday btw :)

[04:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
I really have no clue why people are spending time on the polyglot thread. Isn't it a giant tar pit?

[04:20:00.0000] <annevk5>
fn + backspace

[04:20:01.0000] <annevk5>
well actually, just backspace suffices

[04:21:00.0000] <Smylers>
jgraham: http://xkcd.com/386/ is my best guess.

[04:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's a danger of the approach of allowing anyone in the WG to publish drafts

[04:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Other members are likely to get dragged into discussing it even if they don't care about the subject

[04:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
and if they ignore it now then either they'll have to object to publication later when the editors are happy with the draft, or the WG will publish something technically poor

[06:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-cg/2010JulSep/0010.html is interesting

[06:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the 3rd paragraph in particular

[06:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: perhaps it would be best to discourage any further contributions of patches to make the "polyglot"-checking feature complete

[07:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems like it might not be a very good feature with canonical validator.nu

[07:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think those who want to provide it should maybe instead be encourage to host their own instance and advertise that as a value-add or whatever

[07:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's never really been clear to me what the use case is for that feature anyway

[07:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because I would assume that anybody who cares to make sure their documents follow XML well-formedness rules would most likely already be using an XML toolchain to author their documents

[07:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
unless there's something I'm not aware of that they want and that any XML parser would not already be able to report to them

[07:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
AIUI, what people what from polyglot checking is nothing like the strict level of checking that would be required for full DOM consistency. But rather, most seem to checking of a few XML-like talismans that give the appearance of cleaner and more consistent markup

[07:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
for instance, I'm pretty sure most don't particularly care about the optional tbody issue, unless they actually want scripts or stylesheets to interact with it

[07:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
and most would be happy to omit boilerplate markup like xmlns

[07:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
the important issues seem to be pretty much trailing slashes in void elements, explicit end tags, double-quoted attributes, always escaping & and < characters

[07:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: wouldn't that be the "pedagogical" profile instead of "polyglot"?

[07:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[07:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's why I don't really think the polyglot spec is particularly useful

[07:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
and why I think the approach I have taken in my authoring guide in recent updates (not yet checked in) is better

[07:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I think you mean s/spec/draft/ :-)

[07:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[07:56:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: are you updating the guide again?

[07:56:04.0000] <Lachy>
yes, I started doing that last week

[07:56:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: cool

[07:56:06.0000] <Lachy>
I'd also done some other major changes a while ago that weren't checked in.

[07:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
significant changes are: splitting into HTML5 Reference (for syntax and element reference) and HTML5 Guide (for more tutorial like content, describing common use cases, etc.)

[07:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on a completely different topic: does anyone happen to have pointers to innerHTML benchmarks?

[07:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
and also updating the syntax section to more clearly describe, and compare and contrast the syntax for both HTML and XHTML,

[07:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm interested in benchmarks that represent benchmarks and benchmarks that represent marketing

[07:58:03.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Lachy- Just commenting here: I like your "splitting" idea.

[07:58:04.0000] <KaOSoFt>
-_-

[07:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
I also intend to publish this on html5reference.org soon too with a more liberal licence, so I can bypass most of the w3c politics on that issue

[08:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's another reason I stopped checking it in there, cause I want it licenced liberally there first, and then dual licence it like the spec.

[08:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
on another note, I also got my copy of Windows 7 today and tried out the IE9 preview for the first time.

[08:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I'd love to see the proponents of the polyglot draft to state their use cases for it

[08:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
seems impressive

[08:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: from Amazon?

[08:03:02.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[08:03:03.0000] <hsivonen>
.co.uk?

[08:03:04.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[08:03:05.0000] <hsivonen>
seems slow compared to how fast they delivered Windows 7 to me

[08:03:06.0000] <Lachy>
after a month of waiting, they shipped me a replacement copy last friday by UPS and it arrived this morning. The first copy got lost in the mail

[08:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if I recall correctly that it's been a while since you ordered

[08:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ah

[08:04:02.0000] <Lachy>
they told me I had to wait till the 29th in case of delays before they would ship a replacement. I ordered it on the 2nd

[08:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
my one complaint about windows 7 is that running it in a virtual machine on my 2.5 year old MacBook Pro can be a little slow

[08:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Works fine in a VM on my i7

[08:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(without the glass UI)

[08:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it appears that VirtualBox OSE doesn't emulate a DirectX-compliant GPU

[08:07:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, i7 is a lot newer and faster than my Core 2 Duo 2.4

[08:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
*2.4GHz

[08:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
also my graphics card is technically below the minimum requirements that VMWare says will support the Aero transparencies

[08:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
though it does work

[11:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Interesting reading this Spolsky article from 2004: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html

[11:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Particularly the bit near the bottom about webapps, and the list of things you couldn't do well in a web application.

[11:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think (3) was doable back then with onunload, but we've since solved 1,2,4, and 6.  5, I dunno.

[11:20:00.0000] <espadrine>
5 (having a keyboard-driven web app) is technically doable at least. Not sure how useful that'd be.

[11:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, it's just annoying from what I know.

[11:22:00.0000] <espadrine>
There's a chrome extension that does just that, "vimperator". It hides every user interaction with the browser behind a key. For, instance, J scrolls down, K scrolls up, ...

[11:22:01.0000] <espadrine>
lots of keys to remember

[11:49:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
TabAtkins: O'Reilly wants to use your blurb on the back cover of my book, and they would like to know what your job title is

[11:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Urgh, that's a hard one.  Officially I'm "Software Engineer", but that's just because I haven't customized my title yet.

[11:51:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
no time like the present!

[11:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

haha

[11:53:06.0000] <Workshiva>
It needs to go through approval

[11:53:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suspect that "CEO" is on some list.  ^_^

[11:54:00.0000] <Workshiva>
You could spell it out

"Web Standards Hacker"?

[11:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Unless anyone has objections, go with "Web Standards Hacker" for now.

Those seem fairly reasonably ordered.

[12:04:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
the ordering also tracks fairly closely to how much i give a shit about each particular topic

[12:06:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
man, IRC on an Apple //e is awesomeit

[12:06:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
it's like a text adventure

[12:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suspect it's roughly similar to IRC on irssi.

[12:07:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
go north

[12:07:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
There is a spec here.

[12:07:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
examine spec

[12:07:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
The spec is large; it contains multitudes.

[12:07:05.0000] <mpilgrim>
look behind the spec

[12:07:06.0000] <mpilgrim>
You spot a cabal.

[12:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
^^;

[12:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What does a cabal look like?

[12:12:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
examine cabal

[12:13:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
The cabal shifts and twists in the wind, appearing to each person exactly as they imagine it to be.

[12:15:00.0000] <mpilgrim>

[12:15:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
There is a cabal here.

[12:15:02.0000] <mpilgrim>

[12:15:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
The cabal is everywhere.

[12:26:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Your words have angered the cabal. It catches you and eats you.

[12:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
mpilgrim: You just reminded me of something beyond trivial and several years out of date. You adapted some script I wrote in "Greasemonkey Hacks" but my name never made the credits section :)

[12:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
At least I think that happened

[12:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
I could have imagined the whole thing

[12:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
Delusions of grandeur and all that

[12:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
You might think it wasn't much in the way of grandeur

[12:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
But it all depends where you started

[12:31:02.0000] <jgraham>

Yeah

oh my. beautiful.

!!!!

[12:45:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup, looks like a standard terminal client.  ^_^

[12:46:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
it's not through a terminal client program. 

[12:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Right.

[12:46:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
I have a real Ethernet card in the Apple //e, and a real IRC program (part of Contiki 1.3)

[12:47:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
I can also use it as a terminal, connected through a Super Serial card to the serial port on my Linux box

[12:47:01.0000] <annevk5>

[12:47:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
but this is not that

[12:48:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
jgraham: I apologize if I left you out of the acknowledgements for "Greasemonkey Hacks" (catching up with the backscroll)

[12:49:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
The acknowledgements and contributor list were several pages long. My O'Reilly editor had never seen anything like it.

[12:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
you should show him the html spec's

[12:49:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
lol

[12:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
515 names currently

[12:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
At least two are the same person, though

[12:50:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
Hixie! By any chance, would you like to say something nice about my HTML5 book and get your name on the back cover?

[12:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
you didn't like the suggestion I gave you earlier? :-)

[12:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
(in general i'm trying to avoid getting on any html5 books, since there's so many of them)

[12:51:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
Wrong audience

[12:51:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
:)

[12:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
(and they all want me to write a foreword or whatnot)

[12:51:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
fair enough

[12:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yeah, i asked him about that, i'll remove one when i get to his mail in my pile

[12:52:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Well, at least writing forewords wouldn't cause flamewars on the hybi list

[12:52:01.0000] <jlebar>
While we're bothering you, Hixie: What do you think about making the second parameter in pushState() modify document.title?  Maybe that's better than the state we're in, where everyone (including, now, FF) ignores it.

[12:52:02.0000] <jgraham>
mpilgrim: It is really not something that has ever kept me up at night :)

[12:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders how much of the book one is expected to have read to write a comment for the back or indeed a foreword

[12:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: haven't thought about it, but i'm trying to go through the feedback pile and i know that is one of the options in the feedback

[12:55:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me guesses the answer is probably "none"

[12:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: i recommend experimenting with it, see if it gives authors what they want

[12:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: and then replying to the thread with your experiences from that experiment

[12:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: if you do it and another browser picks it up and it turns out to be a good idea, it'll make my life easy when i get to the feedback :-)

[12:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
It is always mildly concerning when such comments are about the author rather than the book itself

[12:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
Or written by someone also mentioned in the acknowledgements

[12:56:03.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, That sounds reasonable.  I'll see if we want to try it out in the FF beta.

[12:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I guess you just need to read enough so that you don't say anything so blatantly untrue that somebody who does read the book will think you're an idiot and remember your name

[12:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: if you can find a way to make the argument not be vestigial before the spec is even done, you'll certainly get my thanks ;-)

[12:58:00.0000] <jlebar>
I'll try.  :)

[12:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: That is the same as "none", as long as you are careful about what you say

[13:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
For the record, I've read "some" of the book.

[13:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me used the video chapter to remember what @type to give for video sources.

[13:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: So is your quote a secret? Should we have a competition to see who guesses the most words correctly?

[13:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, I just posted it over in internal Buzz.

[13:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
 "HTML5 is the future of the web, but Pilgrim shows you how to make it the present as well. Read this book right now if you want to know to use the most interesting features of HTML5 today, from videos to drawing to scripting, all the way down to the new elements that make your source code more beautiful."

[13:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's interesting how buzz sems to be popular inside Google but not really outside of it

[13:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
It is to Google what Lyskom is to Opera Sweden

[13:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It works nicely as a Twitter+, once you have a decent critical mass.

[13:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hell, it's a decent Facebook News Feed+.

[13:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: LysKOM is popular within Opera Sweden?

[13:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Well it is popular in the sense of "widely used"

[13:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
Even if there are a healthy contingent of people who think it is a sin against nature

[13:52:00.0000] <Workshiva>
jgraham: To be fair, the rest of Opera loathes it :P

[14:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Workshiva: Most of Sweden does too… :P

[14:02:00.0000] <Workshiva>
I don't think most of Sweden has had the displeasure of learning it exists

[14:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
How do you think we use it without knowing it exists?

[14:03:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Oh, you meant Opera Sweden

[14:03:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Not the country

[14:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
(to be fair to Kom, which I never am, I would prefer some of the stuff happens there rather than in email. Best to keep all the mostly-ignorable stuff together)

[14:07:00.0000] <Workshiva>
You should just replace it with google wave

[14:07:01.0000] <Workshiva>
They seem to occupy a similar niche :)

[14:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Workshiva: Google employs UA sniffing to block Opera.

[14:07:03.0000] <Workshiva>
Even better, reduces the amount of time people waste on it :P

[14:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
It is quite like Google wave in that there are no good clients 

[14:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
But

[14:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
And this is important

[14:15:03.0000] <jgraham>
Wave doesn't store all the data as one giant sexp

[14:15:04.0000] <jgraham>
(I presume)

[14:15:05.0000] <jgraham>
Unlike LysKOM

[14:15:06.0000] <jgraham>
(allegedly)

[14:18:00.0000] <paul_irish>
did i catch that the html wg voted on moving to an unversioned html specification? or am i wrong on that?

[14:20:00.0000] <hober>
paul_irish: there was a survey about versioning

[14:20:01.0000] <paul_irish>
this one? http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/issues-4-84-objection-poll/results#xkeepnew

[14:20:02.0000] <hober>
the results: http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/issues-4-84-objection-poll/results

[14:20:03.0000] <hober>
yeah

[14:20:04.0000] <jgraham>
But no pronouncement from the chairs yet

[14:20:05.0000] <jgraham>
afaik

[14:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
The system allows the chairs to basically decide what they like although they have to back it up with reasons and stuff

[14:21:01.0000] <paul_irish>
Roger that. Thanks

[14:28:00.0000] <franksalim>
btw, jgraham, before writing a foreword, I think you are required by law to read the entire book twice. Any technical errors or stylistic blemishes in the book then reflect on you, personally, forever.

[14:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Harsh

[14:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
Are you sure that's not just in North Korea?

[14:30:02.0000] <franksalim>
I didn't make the rules

[14:30:03.0000] <shepazu>
hsivonen: any suggestions on a RelaxNG hacker who would be interested in helping the SVG WG put together a good (not converted-DTD) RNG schema for SVG?

[14:47:00.0000] <Workshiva>
jgraham: I could tell you a lot about how things are stored, but I want to keep my job

[14:51:00.0000] <espadrine>
jgraham: I agree against version info in the doctype, but does that mean we should no longer talk about html5? Say, it would blend in the flow of continuous innovation around the draft for years and years to come, and never actually be final? Will <device> be html5 or 6?

[14:51:01.0000] <Workshiva>
<decide> will be html

[14:52:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Hixie doesn't use version numbers anymore

[14:52:01.0000] <Workshiva>
... also, I can't spell device

[14:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The survey only covered versioning in the doctype.

[14:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not versioning generally.

[14:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The HTMLWG is only chartered to release one version of HTML, and W3C process doesn't allow continuous spec development.  You have to freeze specs eventually.

[14:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess you could charter a WG to let it only publish Editor's Drafts or some crazy hack like that, but the HTMLWG isn't, it's producing REC-track work.

[14:57:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Even if you don't embrace global versionless development, the way w3c keeps splitting everything into smaller and smaller specs you get per-feature maturity tracking anyway

[14:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
espadrine, the WHATWG version of the spec mostly just calls it "HTML".  It only keeps the "5" for now for buzzword purposes.

[14:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
We should just have one spec per paragraph, that would solve it.

[14:58:00.0000] <Workshiva>
You don't need separate specs

[14:58:01.0000] <Workshiva>
You just need per-paragraph tracking :)

[14:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders why jgraham's objection is line-broken

[14:58:03.0000] <Workshiva>
Core canvas is for all intents and purses CR already

[14:58:04.0000] <Workshiva>
... purposes

[14:59:00.0000] <Workshiva>
I should go home and sleep

[14:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
A lot of HTML5 may as well be CR.

[15:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I still like the almost-concluding sentence of my objection: "In summary, the proposal seeks to address a nonexistent problem, and fails to do even that."

[15:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is a pretty good sentence.

[15:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, if the chairs pay even the slightest heed to the survey results, that proposal is completely dead.

[15:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We had at least two people who objected so thoroughly to the proposal that they went over the 5 KBish limit in writing their responses, and the only ones objecting to the no-change proposal were 1) an academic who likes versioned doctypes because they help him date historical HTML pages, and 2) a two-sentence statement that doesn't state support of the other change proposal.

[15:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
To be fair, it was dead before the survey.  It was a dumb idea in the first place.

[15:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me thinks that when it comes to serious issues, the change proposal procedure is a waste of time but not likely to produce particularly bad results.

[15:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yes.

[15:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It exemplifies the problem with letting one person waste everyone's time with a giant pile-on of opposition when no one agreed with him in the first place.

[15:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[15:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: emacs

[15:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You just write stuff there generally in case web forms eat it?

[15:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or do you have some cool plugin that transforms textareas to emacs?

[15:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wish I had that for vim.  :(

[15:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
Workshiva: But since you wouldn't say "s-expressions" it's not interesting

[15:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: No I wrote it there because it is a superior text editor to my browser and it was a reasonable amount of text

[15:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
I would love to be able to use it seamlessly for textareas

[15:25:02.0000] <jgraham>
or at least I would like textareas to suck less

[15:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The closest I've seen is a Firefox extension that lets you right-click on textareas to open them in an external editor.

[15:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Awkward, but it's more convenient than cut-and-paste.

[15:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It basically creates a temporary file, invokes the editor on the file, then updates the textarea whenever the file is written, and deletes the file when you submit the form.

[15:26:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Something like that.

[15:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
I thought about writing that some years ago

[15:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
I didn't of course

[15:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The only major thing that annoys me about vim is that there's no way I know of to easily move up and down between logical lines, which is really a necessity when you're dealing with something that's not full of line breaks.

[15:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean.

[15:27:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Visual lines, not logical lines.

[15:27:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
You know, the way up and down work in regular text editors.

[15:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me should go ask in #vim, although he thinks he's done that before

[15:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
Emacs' handling of visual lines is pretty abysmal

[15:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
As far as I can tell there is no way to get it to break on whitespace

[15:28:03.0000] <jgraham>
(visually)

[15:28:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't mind that part so much.

[15:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
For code it is fine

[15:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But when j and k jump me like a page at a time, it's really annoying.

[15:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
For prose, not so much

[15:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
With some HTML pages, etc. it's seriously obnoxious.

[15:29:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, if you do version control on your prose, you want to line-break it anyway.

[15:29:05.0000] <jgraham>
(so you have to use auto-fill-mode and hope that people don't mind the line breaks)

[15:32:00.0000] <espadrine>
In vi, you can type "80 l", and you get down to the next visual line

[15:32:01.0000] <espadrine>
but there should be a builtin macro for that

[15:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, here we go: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#up-down-motions

[15:32:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
gk, gj.

[15:32:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yay.

[15:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me didn't realize how many motions there are in vim, yikes

[15:33:01.0000] <espadrine>
nice!

[15:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's kind of crazy to have things like "+" when it's really just the same as "j^" or whatever, but if you get used to this kind of thing, it becomes a real time-saver . . .

[15:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think it's time for me to memorize a bunch more vim commands.  I've gotten used to all the ones I know long ago.

[15:36:00.0000] <espadrine>
It seems like the _ vi move makes ^ redundant

[15:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's a lot of redundancy here if you look.

[15:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wow, now there are four different Chrome channels?

[15:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: That textarea->texteditor plugin for Firefox was *awesome*.  I used the crap out of it.  It was great for long comments, and extra-great for code, since I can actually use tab in my texteditor.

[15:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe I'll try it again if I switch back to Firefox when they release 4.0.  I'll have to see if I want to.

[15:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
when Chrome was released it was no contest for me, Firefox was massively less responsive than Chrome on Linux, but that's way better with 4.0.

[15:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
hmm. jailbreakme.com (new iPhone jailbreaking website) is nice, though somewhat scary in how it works.

[15:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
AFAICT, it's using some sort of PDF exploit to actually perform the jailbreak.

[15:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand the content of the PDF file beyond that to know what exactly

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
all jailbreaks are exploits

[15:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
but it does make me wonder what other hacks a malicious website could perform using a similar technique

[15:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
yes, I know that.

[15:47:03.0000] <Lachy>
But the fact that they can do it from just having the user load a web page

[15:47:04.0000] <Lachy>
that's the scary bit

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes, remote code execution exploits are scary :-)

[15:51:00.0000] <wirepair>
to be pedantic that is a client side exploit, not remote ;)

[15:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's remote to the attacker

[15:52:01.0000] <espadrine>
wirepair: oh, we feel much better know ;)

[15:52:02.0000] <wirepair>
espadrine ehe

[15:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
but yeah, i guess it's not a remote code execution since you can't force it to occur remotely

[15:52:04.0000] <wirepair>
/me nods

[15:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's remote code execution because you can trigger it without access to the machine.  You just have to get them to visit a URL, which is fairly trivial.

[15:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
As opposed to requiring that they install a program or something.

[15:54:01.0000] <wirepair>
well the reasoning for seperate terms is to differentiate between someone exploiting a service, versus client software

[15:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does a web page really count as client software?

[15:55:01.0000] <wirepair>
no but a pdf does

[15:55:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's supposed to be sandboxed.

[15:55:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[15:55:04.0000] <KaOSoFt>
PDF does.

[15:55:05.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Er, that.

[15:55:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess.

[15:55:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's sort of intermediate.

[15:55:08.0000] <wirepair>
in the end, it really doesn't matter, one requires client interaction, the other does not

[15:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I don't know why a webpage would not count but a PDF would)

[15:56:01.0000] <wirepair>
i'd consider a webpage as well actually

[15:56:02.0000] <wirepair>
the browser being the client software

[15:57:00.0000] <wirepair>
<wirepair> no but a pdf does (sorry meant adobe acrobat/whatever is reading the doc)

[16:00:00.0000] <Alystair>
http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&uri=http://www.hp.com <- there's really some irony to this 

[16:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why?

[16:03:00.0000] <Alystair>
who donated the hardware to w3c :P

[16:03:01.0000] <Alystair>
HP donates to w3c yet doesn't uphold the standard themselves?

[16:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, come on.

[16:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are web pages on mozilla.org that don't validate.

[16:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
there are pages on whatwg.org that don't validate

[16:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. the forums and maybe parts of the blog

[16:04:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably on w3.org too.

[16:04:05.0000] <Hixie>
not to mention the wiki

[16:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me has been idly planning to make a "blacklist all HTML5-forbidden tags in user input" mode for MW, but it would break copy-paste from Wikipedia, so probably wouldn't be too popular

[16:05:01.0000] <Alystair>
:(

[16:23:00.0000] <JF47>
Hi, is anyone here?

[16:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
JF47: No.

[16:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
JF47: (In other words, if you have a question, ask it, rather than asking if anyone's here and then asking your question.)

[16:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Just checking each new context against the last successfully requested context assumes that compatibility is transitive, right?  (It should be.)

[16:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, see a bit later the definition of the wiki page

[16:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
it says the compat has to be transitive and symmetric

[16:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk, those are reasonable and sane requirements.

[16:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
i thought so :-)

[16:34:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
(It prevents silly things like requesting a 3d and then a 2d to implicitly create a texture in the 3d context that the 2d context draws to.)

[16:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(That should be explicit instead.)

[16:35:01.0000] <JF47>
Does anyone know about how to use File Thingie the free PHP File Manager?

[16:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd recommend asking in a php-focused channel.

[16:37:00.0000] <JF47>
#php-focused

[16:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wasn't suggesting a specific channel name.

[16:37:02.0000] <JF47>
Ok

[16:37:03.0000] <JF47>
Oh

[16:38:00.0000] <JF47>
So why did you say recommend asking in a php-focused channel

[16:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because that's what I recommend?  I'm not saying to go visit some channel named #php-focused.  I have no idea if there is any channel named that in this server, and even if there is, I have no idea what its quality is.

[16:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was just suggesting finding a channel that is more focused on php matters.  This room is for HTML5 talk and related stuff.

[16:39:01.0000] <JF47>
Oh

[16:39:02.0000] <JF47>
Do you know anything about  File Thingie the free PHP File Manager?

[16:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, and I doubt anyone else in the room is either.  Thus my suggestion.

[16:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, we don't.

[16:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Try #php or some other channel.

othermaciej: comet does have built-in compression

[19:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: ok, I guess you can use transfer-encoding: gzip

[19:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: but is it commonly used for Comet-like use cases?

[19:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
it is for google

[19:09:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(I honestly don't know)

[19:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
dunno about elsewhere

[19:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
interesting

[19:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
supporting use cases of google services is probably important to the success of WebSockets (if only because they are a decent model of what other large-scale deployments will care about)

[19:27:00.0000] <franksalim>
i'm sure there is a version of WebSocket that both suits Google's needs and also has more than a passing resemblance to sockets and "tcp for the web"

[22:34:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders, do you maybe know how I could serialize the DOMNodeList which is returned by the php html5lib?

[23:17:00.0000] <erlehmann>
also, why doesn't it return a DOMDocumentFragment?

[00:10:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
urgh... I hate it when Hixie goes on a reply rampage >_<

[00:35:00.0000] <annevk5>
so I'm both second and eight place on Karl's list

[01:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
shepazu: Have you asked MikeSmith? I can't volunteer right now.

[01:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: what was shepazu asking about?

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: help with a RELAX NG schema for SVG

[01:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[01:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll talk with him about it

[02:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hg is so slow on a traditional disk. I should revitalize my MacBook by replacing the hard drive with an SSD.

[02:02:00.0000] <Rik`>
hsivonen: just did that yesterday, it is soooooo worth it

[02:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: On Mozilla-sized repositories?

[02:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: yeah.

[02:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
(It seems very snappy for me on small ones, especially compared to SVN)

[02:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
(but that's a much less hard problem)

[02:03:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: my comparison is with my Linux box than has an SSD

[02:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(my Linux box also has more RAM and a faster CPU)

[02:04:01.0000] <Rik`>
I think I won't ever use a hard drive

[03:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
couple of mac questions; how do I get commandline cvs/svn/hg to run and what is a good basic text editor?

[03:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: You install hg/svn/cvs and run them from the command line...

[03:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
At least hg is trivial since you can easy_install mercurial

[03:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
(maybe even pip install if you are feeling very modern)

[03:12:02.0000] <jgraham>
And emacs is always a good text editor :)

[03:12:03.0000] <jgraham>
(specifically aquamacs in this case)

[03:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but I think that isn't the answer you were looking for)

[03:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: no

[03:13:02.0000] <erlehmann>
well, i just used DomDocument in the end and cut off the superfluous html, head and body tags.

[03:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
i wonder how to install them

[03:15:00.0000] <annevk5>
got an editor

[03:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: Serializing as HTML is possible. There's a patch for PHP awaiting review.

[03:15:02.0000] <erlehmann>
annevk5, nano is a good simple text editor. also, there is always macports … don't you have access to a real operating system with a package manager? ;)

[03:15:03.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: Either look for disk images

[03:15:04.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50973

[03:15:05.0000] <Peter`>
Lots of people will come after you now for not suggesting vim, erlehmann ;)

[03:15:06.0000] <jgraham>
Or install macports or fink or something

[03:15:07.0000] <Peter`>
http://xkcd.com/378/

[03:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
nano is not a good simple text editor

[03:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
Nano is what you use when the choice is vim or nano or ed

[03:17:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders, pastebin.ca seems down from here. that patch will stay in limbo for eternally.

[03:18:00.0000] <erlehmann>
but thanks.

[03:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: Yeah, I just noticed that. And noticed they had patch support in their bug tracker now…

[03:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: I guess I'll dig it up locally later and post it again

[03:18:03.0000] <erlehmann>
well, in the end, saveXML is enough for me.

[03:19:00.0000] <erlehmann>
ugly realiable code is still ugly, but then it gets the job done.

[03:19:01.0000] <nw_>
TextWrangler is a good, basic text editor if you want to get all fancy and use a GUI, I think.

[03:21:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Peter` you should know that i am part of the „randall munroe gets unfunnier with time“ camp.

[03:21:01.0000] <Workshiva>
The important thing to note about that comic is that the nano guy is the only one doing work

[03:21:02.0000] <Workshiva>
The others stand around talking

[03:22:00.0000] <erlehmann>
what shiva said. :P

[03:22:01.0000] <erlehmann>
Also, i did not know about Rocky Mountain oysters till RIGHT NOW. CANNOT UNSEE.

[03:22:02.0000] <annevk5>
aah

[03:22:03.0000] <annevk5>
macports looks nice

[03:23:00.0000] <Workshiva>
"nano is an editor, not a religion"

[03:23:01.0000] <annevk5>
erlehmann, I think I'm giving up on Ubuntu for a while until hardware manufacturers catch up with Apple

[03:23:02.0000] <annevk5>
erlehmann, I'm not too married to any particular OS

[03:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
well, Windows I wouldn't really wanna go back to

[03:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could run Ubuntu on Apple hardware

[03:24:02.0000] <annevk5>
sure

[03:24:03.0000] <erlehmann>
annevk5, the lack of package management really put me of OSX (and windows, too). but many of my hacker friends with macbooks use linux.

[03:24:04.0000] <Workshiva>
Or you could buy the same parts apple buys

[03:24:05.0000] <erlehmann>
sorry, it is „put me off of“

[03:24:06.0000] <annevk5>
but I doubt it would be as efficient

[03:24:07.0000] <Workshiva>
Build your own

[03:25:00.0000] <erlehmann>
well, depends on your task. for programming, i have found package management immensely useful.

[03:25:01.0000] <Workshiva>
What kind of programming?

[03:25:02.0000] <annevk5>
I mean in terms of battery usage and all :)

[03:25:03.0000] <erlehmann>
that kind where you need to quickly pull libxyz

[03:26:00.0000] <erlehmann>
ah, okay. got that.

[03:26:01.0000] <annevk5>
I usually just write text and programming I do on a server

[03:26:02.0000] <Workshiva>
That doesn't sound like programming, it sounds like dependency management

[03:26:03.0000] <erlehmann>
Workshiva, libxyz-dev? ;)

[03:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
It's not programming if you use third-party libraries?

[03:27:00.0000] <erlehmann>
"real programmers write their floating-point routines all by themselves"

[03:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
I generally agree FWIW; unless you stay firmly in the Mac ecosystem, the packaging story on OSX sucks

[03:28:00.0000] <Workshiva>
erlehmann: No, not in that sense. But rather that you pull dependencies once per dependency, and the total number tends to stay rather low over time

[03:28:01.0000] <erlehmann>
jgraham, it confuses me to hell. after all, its not as if apple would not have the resources to set up repositories.

[03:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
erlehmann: They could call it an "App Store"

[03:28:03.0000] <erlehmann>
hehe

[03:28:04.0000] <jgraham>
and let people charge money for their apps

[03:29:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Call it the Book Depository

[03:29:01.0000] <erlehmann>
get libcaca, for the low price of 200g of nazi gold

[03:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Workshiva: You pull dependencies n times each, if you want to keep up with bug fixes and security updates and new features

[03:29:03.0000] <erlehmann>
what that guy says

[03:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
and not-trivial programs use dozens of libraries, so it adds up to quite a lot

[03:30:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Philip`: Yeah, but you have n people on the team pulling them

[03:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/not/non/

[03:30:03.0000] <erlehmann>
don't apple app packages contain every library they need, as with windows?

[03:30:04.0000] <Workshiva>
So the amortized cost is fairly constant

[03:30:05.0000] <Philip`>
Workshiva: I'm assuming a case with 1 person

[03:30:06.0000] <Philip`>
but the libraries get updated n times

[03:32:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Well, 1 person could just ignore the updates

[03:32:01.0000] <Workshiva>
And say 'patches welcome'

[03:32:02.0000] <erlehmann>
Task: Compare software installation overhead for a team of N developers using a) Windows XP SP2 b) Debian GNU/Hurd c) OS X 10.4 . Use big O notation. :P

[03:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: MacPorts for hg/svg/etc. TextWrangler for editor. (It installs a command-line tool called 'edit' for invoking it from he command line.)

[03:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
Debian GNU/Hurd is O(0) because no one actually uses that

[03:33:02.0000] <erlehmann>
Whenever people talk about software having to work on Windows XP, I remind them that it's older than my little sister.

[03:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
That's quite a meaningless analogu

[03:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
*analogy

[03:34:02.0000] <jgraham>
Your little sister could, literally, have been born yesterday

[03:34:03.0000] <Workshiva>
erlehmann: My program isn't meant for kids

[03:35:00.0000] <Workshiva>
So clearly supporting XP is even more important now

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what happens to things like the famous Boeing intranet once XP reaches EOL

[03:36:01.0000] <erlehmann>
haha

[03:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(since XP Mode will reach EOL together with the unvirtualized XP)

[03:36:03.0000] <erlehmann>
I recently got told that the european parliament still uses IE6.

[03:37:00.0000] <Workshiva>
hsivonen: They could just pull it off the internet and give everyone two computers

[03:37:01.0000] <erlehmann>
maybe they manage to patch the wine program loader so it works under windows as well till then?

[03:38:00.0000] <erlehmann>
that would be one hell of a hack.

[03:38:01.0000] <Workshiva>
It's not like XP will stop working, it will just stop being supported

[03:39:00.0000] <erlehmann>
yeah and most people are wary to eat stuff that is past its expiration date.

[03:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
The UK government still uses IE6

[03:39:02.0000] <Workshiva>
They aren't wary of sitting in chairs past their warranty date, though

[03:39:03.0000] <Workshiva>
Your analogies are weird, erlehmann 

[03:39:04.0000] <jgraham>
But Microsoft will still support it whislt there are still big deployments

[03:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Who knows, IE6 might eventually kill them :)

[03:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how much money the Boeing account brings to MS and how much costs it adds

[03:40:02.0000] <erlehmann>
Workshiva, you are not the first person to tell me that.

[03:42:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Even funnier are the ones who point out that I am „IRL just the same as in IRC“. As if that is somehow unexpected.

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, great, I settled on textwrangler independently already :)

[03:47:01.0000] <annevk5>
i'll now struggle with macports

[04:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is glad that he doesn't share a name with anyone particularly famous

[04:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
Because every time I see something on the list from "James May" I read it as "Captian Slow"

[04:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
Which is annoying enough for me, let alone him

[04:21:01.0000] <Peter`>
I'm the only one with my name, so far :P

[04:23:00.0000] <espadrine>
Idea: pick a name from the Bible. Chances are, your child is going to be the first one to bear this name since Jesus' times.

[04:23:01.0000] <espadrine>
My name's that way

[04:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well sure there are lots of ways to generate a unique name

[04:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Take a well0known name and rot-13 it, for example

[04:25:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Challenge: Find a pair of common names that are rot13 twins

[04:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
My (first) name's in the Bible and I don't think that helped it be unique :-(

[04:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders how many people there are called Judas nowadays…

[04:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or Lucifier

[04:31:00.0000] <adactio>
gsnedders: I met a Judas once. It was at a loud party and when he introduced himself, I laughed and said "For a second there, I thought you said your name was Judas." He was not amused. I was embarrassed.

[04:32:00.0000] <Peter`>
I know a Judas too, can't be cool to have a name like that

[04:32:01.0000] <annevk5>
lol

[04:32:02.0000] <Peter`>
Makes you wonder why parents make such a decision.. ignorance or self-knowledge?

[04:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: in Finland this year there has been at least one baby named Juudas. Also at least one between 1940 and 1959. other than that, none. No Lucifer or Lusifer. Not popular names, it seems. However, since the beginning of data, there has been no one in Finland named Jeesus (the Finnish form). (there have been people named, Jesus, though. As part of Spanish names, I would assume.)

[04:44:00.0000] <nw_>
You can't name your baby "Jeesus" in Finland, AFAIK.

[04:44:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, you broke http://www.whatwg.org/specs/html5/current-work/ as a link

[04:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nw_: I'd expect that to be the case.

[04:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
nw_, hsivonen: Why?

[04:46:00.0000] <nw_>
Well, the naming policies in Finland are pretty strict, as far as I know. Not an expert on the subject, but I've understood that you can't change your surname to, let's say, "Tiikerimetsä" (translates as "Tiger Forest") because there are no tigers in Finland. For example.

[04:47:00.0000] <gavin>
wow

[04:47:01.0000] <gavin>
that sounds crazy

[04:47:02.0000] <nw_>
In any case, you can't give your baby just any ol' name in Finland, it has to be approved by someone.

[04:47:03.0000] <nw_>
Yeah, grain of salt and all that, though.

[04:47:04.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: I'd expect Jeesus to be deemed culturally inappropriate as a Finnish name. But if you claim Spanish heritage, you can probably explain Jesus as appropriate

[04:47:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess I'll have to change my name to Geffe Snedderström in se then…

[04:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
Having some approval to protect children from their parents seems reasonable. Banning Tiikerimetsä "because there are no tigers in Finland" seems crazy

[04:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nw_: is there some stated rationale for this policy? do people in Finland support it? is it one of those "that's the way it's always been kind of things"?

[04:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
there's a policy like that in Japan too

[04:49:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
a guy tried to name his kid "Akuma" a few years back

[04:49:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
which means "demon"

[04:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I haven't seen rallies to change the statute

[04:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[04:50:02.0000] <nw_>
MikeSmith, well, like I said, I don't know too much about the subject, but as hsivonen said, no one seems to complain.

[04:50:03.0000] <nw_>
Well, almost no one, I suppose.

[04:50:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[04:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me noticed that Swedish royalty have longer names than what is legal in Finland

[04:51:01.0000] <nw_>
I don't see it as an altogether bad thing, though, what with all the Pilot Inspektors and whatnot in the US.

[04:51:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[04:51:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[04:51:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if Sweden has the same length limit as Finland for common folk and the extra length is a specifically royal thing

[04:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
fixed-length names?

[04:52:01.0000] <annevk5>
makes me think of hybi

[04:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: there's a statutory limit on the number of tokens

[04:52:03.0000] <jgraham>
You are crazy

[04:52:04.0000] <nw_>
That I didn't know.

[04:52:05.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: It bothers me that I've never seen the specs for the tokens

[04:52:06.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, in 16-bit code units?

[04:52:07.0000] <annevk5>
ah

[04:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
you can have up to 3 given names in Finland

[04:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(Swedish royalty have 4 each)

[04:53:02.0000] <nw_>
jgraham, but yeah, I agree that the whole Tiikerimetsä thing is a bit silly (if true). Especially since Eero Tiikerimetsä would be such a badass name.

[04:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the statute doesn't say what character reportoire is permitted, which bothers me

[04:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but Cyrillic letters apparently aren't part of the permitted reportoire and have to be transliterated

[04:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but that's not in the statute

[05:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
wow, been a long time since I heard an installer DVD spinning

[05:02:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me didn't wanna register so is installing Xcode from DVD

[05:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
You didn't give up and use Ubuntu instead then :)

[05:02:02.0000] <annevk5>
not yet

[05:02:03.0000] <annevk5>
macports is next

[05:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
then cvs et al en then I can review your tests and do work other than email

[05:03:01.0000] <annevk5>
as a backup i have my other laptop here on standby

[05:06:00.0000] <karlcow>
[02:40]  <annevk5> so I'm both second and eight place on Karl's list

[05:06:01.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: yes the code compile on email addresses as an identifier. :((( Maybe I should do a second parsing on the list with names OR create manually a list of P(emails, name)

[05:07:00.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: the code is here http://www.la-grange.net/2010/08/02/mail-analysis.py 

[05:08:00.0000] <karlcow>
if someone wants to play, modify, twist, etc. feel gpl. :)

[05:08:01.0000] <annevk5>
two places means I must have been way more active before I joined Opera

[05:08:02.0000] <annevk5>
comparatively, anyway

[05:09:00.0000] <karlcow>
I was thinking also about a data visualization through time for top posters. 

[05:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh yes

[05:11:01.0000] <annevk5>
port install ftw

[05:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. doing data-driven pref optimizations is annoying when you get to the area where you find some cases became slightly better and some slightly worse

[05:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: s/pref/perf/ ?

[05:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: What are you optimising?

[05:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yes, perf

[05:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
tokenizer state transitions

[05:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is that a significant part of the parse time?

[05:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me found with html5lib that simply reading the input string seemed to be the most expensive thing and any computation was basically free, but presumes it's very different in non-scripting languages

[05:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: well, it's more like this optimization seemed like an obvious thing to do, but the rewards are less obvious than I expected :-(

[05:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: in general, the parse time is a small part of what the browser does, so no matter what you tweak inside the parser core, you can't make a huge overall impact

[05:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it makes sense to just optimise for non-general cases where it's a larger part, if there's any such cases

[05:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Nobody cares how long it takes to parse Wikipedia but maybe some people care how long it takes to parse the HTML spec, or is still a small part there?)

[05:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Reflowing during script execution is what kills browsers there

[05:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
has anyone already repurposed the HTML5 spec as a parser perf test case?

[05:45:02.0000] <annevk5>
installing subversion takes loooong

[05:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(i.e. making the whole thing display: none; and making it time itself?)

[05:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: That seems trivial to do

[05:47:01.0000] <annevk5>
lol

[05:47:02.0000] <annevk5>
WOFF same-origin restrictions are mentioned in the introduction

[05:47:03.0000] <jgraham>
Although having scripts is a bit annoying

[05:48:00.0000] <annevk5>
including a reference to CORS and HTML5 et al

[05:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: sure. I was thinking I'd be lazy if someone has done it already.

[05:48:02.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-WOFF-20100727/#Introduction

[05:48:03.0000] <annevk5>
well hopefully everyone ignores the obvious non-normativeness of that

[05:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: actually, I was kinda wishing micro optimizing the parser would benefit innerHTML

[05:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the problem is, I don't know what benchmark I should optimize for in order to optimize "innerHTML<

[05:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/</"/

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there any way to find real-world sites that spend significant amounts of time on innerHTML?

[05:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hrm. the spec is so large gedit behaves slowly

[05:53:02.0000] <smaug>
huh, there are PutForwards in the draft. Need to get rid of those

[05:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like some kind of instrumented browser would be very helpful, to tell people what kind of behaviour ought to be tested in benchmarks

[05:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: indeed

[05:54:02.0000] <jgraham>
smaug: Huh?

[05:54:03.0000] <Philip`>
Does anyone do that yet, or are benchmarks all just made up?

[05:55:00.0000] <annevk5>
smaug, what draft?

[05:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
What's the problem with PutForwards?

[05:55:02.0000] <smaug>
tml5 draft

[05:55:03.0000] <smaug>
PutForwards is evil. A sign of bad API

[05:55:04.0000] <smaug>
html5

[05:55:05.0000] <annevk5>
why is it bad?

[05:55:06.0000] <smaug>
consistency

[05:55:07.0000] <smaug>
it breaks consistency

[05:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: The V8 benchmark did that with the regexp tests iirc

[05:56:01.0000] <smaug>
set and get start doing very different things

[05:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
smaug: It is mostly part of the legacy platform at this point though

[05:56:03.0000] <annevk5>
not really

[05:56:04.0000] <jgraham>
Have we introduced it in more places?

[05:56:05.0000] <smaug>
I can understand it for .location

[05:56:06.0000] <annevk5>
yes

[05:56:07.0000] <smaug>
for .location it is for legacy

[05:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
but I think it is rather elegant

[05:57:01.0000] <Workshiva>
I think it is terrible

[05:57:02.0000] <Workshiva>
#javascript has a lot of visitors asking why they can't do window.location.indexOf

[05:58:00.0000] <smaug>
yeah, we shouldn't introduce similar problems as what .location has

[05:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the spec has lots of images these days

[06:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(removing the srcs for those so that they don't bother parser timing)

[06:15:00.0000] <annevk5>
unless anything unforeseen happens XMLHttpRequest will go to CR today

[06:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: cool. finally.

[06:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah just checked

[06:19:00.0000] <annevk5>
>4 years since first W3C draft

[06:22:00.0000] <Rik`>
I thought it was much less

[06:33:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm

[06:33:01.0000] <annevk5>
/me wonders about XMLHttpRequest.priority

[06:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
macports doesn't do tab-autocompletion

[06:50:01.0000] <annevk5>
wtf

[06:50:02.0000] <annevk5>
mercurial requires freetype

[06:50:03.0000] <annevk5>
euh

[07:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I've been neglecting to add the NE keyword to bugs recently

[07:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or for quite a while now, actually

[07:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and nobody else has been doing it either

[07:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
we need to start doing it again

[07:19:04.0000] <Workshiva>
Are there ne NE bugs left?

[07:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there are some still open

[07:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but we have a lot of existing open bugs that aren't marked with it that should be

[07:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
unless somebody has a better idea for how we can distinguish editorial bugs

[07:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
we basically just want to be able to ignore the editorial bugs

[07:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
because really only the editors need to care about those

[07:21:02.0000] <Workshiva>
What percentage of bugs are filed via the inline tool now?

[07:25:00.0000] <annevk5>
yay

[07:25:01.0000] <annevk5>
edit ...

[07:25:02.0000] <annevk5>
hg clone ...

[07:25:03.0000] <annevk5>
cvs ...

[07:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
prolly requires some further setup stuff but the basics are there

[07:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Workshiva: dunno… maybe 50%

[07:39:00.0000] <Workshiva>
So I guess that means asking the bug reporter to mark NE or not is not viable

[07:55:00.0000] <Rik`>
annevk5: http://test.w3.org/webapps/tests/XMLHttpRequest/info.htm is quite empty, how can it go in CR ?

[07:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
exit criteria

[07:57:01.0000] <annevk5>
not entrance

[08:05:00.0000] <Rik`>
I find it weird to set an exit criteria date when we don't have a date for the availability of the test suite

[08:05:01.0000] <annevk5>
it's just the minimum amount of time

[08:37:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, you around?

[08:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
each time I set up a new laptop CVS is a pain

[08:47:01.0000] <annevk5>
someone please move dev.w3.org out of CVS hell so I no longer have to deal

[09:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: here now

[09:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I could probably set up some rewrites to point selected dev.w3.org stuff to dvcs.w3.org

[09:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
the problem now is that first cvs complaints my ssh file is not protected

[09:06:01.0000] <annevk5>
and when I do protect it I get prompted for a password when I run the cvs lines

[09:06:02.0000] <annevk5>
and none of the passwords I can think of are correct

[09:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Did you protect the file from yourself too?

[09:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
now it just says "permission denied (publickey)"

[09:11:01.0000] <annevk5>
even if I set chmod to 777

[09:11:02.0000] <annevk5>
argh

[09:11:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it needs to be 600, right?

[09:13:00.0000] <annevk5>
i guess, but it's no longer working

[09:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"permission denied (publickey)" means that the server denied access based on your public key, not that the client can't access your public key, I think.

[09:15:01.0000] <annevk5>
ok, but that makes no sense

[09:15:02.0000] <annevk5>
it works fine elsewhere

[09:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you do "ssh -v -v -v cvs.w3.org" and send me the output, maybe I can figure out something

[09:16:01.0000] <annevk5>
oh lol

[09:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
or I can ask systems team

[09:16:03.0000] <annevk5>
it was sudo that was the problem

[09:16:04.0000] <Philip`>
Using the same public key as elsewhere?

[09:16:05.0000] <annevk5>
so I guess this was my fault

[09:17:00.0000] <annevk5>
Philip`, yeah, I just copied stuff from Ubuntu

[09:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me thought that was generally considered not ideal from a security perspective

[09:17:02.0000] <annevk5>
well, I'm only using this mess for dev.w3.org

[09:17:03.0000] <annevk5>
when someone takes over editing we'll find out soon enough :)

[09:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Fair enough :-)

[09:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
where can I store environment variables in Mac OS X?

[09:40:01.0000] <annevk5>
having CVS_RSH=ssh set by default somewhere would be nice :)

[09:40:02.0000] <pablof>
annevk5: .bashrc probably

[09:40:03.0000] <pablof>
or .bashprofile

[09:41:00.0000] <Rik`>
annevk5: ~/.profile

[09:44:00.0000] <annevk5>
thanks

[10:02:00.0000] <hober>
annevk: setting env vars in ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist will ensure that non-shell processes launched from the Dock also see them

[10:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: What did you do to make the annotated spec for the canvas tests?

[10:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I guess I can read the source

[10:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I don't quite remember

[10:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think it involved regexps

[10:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: You around?  I dunno if you can touch the listserv stuff, but I got an odd email today that I think points to a problem on the listserv.

[10:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: I don't have access to the mailing-list backend

[10:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
what was odd about the message?

[10:36:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Someone just emailed me saying they'd received literally hundreds of copies of one of my emails to the CSSWG list over the last few weeks.

[10:36:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (Also, lots of manual annotation-markup)

[10:47:00.0000] <dandaman>
can anyone explain what em does/means? as opposed to px

[10:47:01.0000] <dandaman>
im having trouble understanding the explanations online

[10:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
An em is the current font size.

[10:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Hmm

[10:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, for an element with font-size:16px, 1em = 16px.

[10:48:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: So not easy to generalise to the whole spec?

[10:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: What do you mean by easy, and by generalise?

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
The basic annotation approach should work on any HTML document, I think

[10:49:01.0000] <dandaman>
TabAtkins: so how do you set a font-size and an em size?

[10:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Otherwise, em is just an absolute length unit and works the exact same way as px/in/etc.

[10:49:03.0000] <dandaman>
im guessing em just means scaling

[10:49:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: Through CSS.

[10:49:05.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: The desired end result I have is a way to have a list of tests and a list of positions in the spec (somehow) and associate the two

[10:49:06.0000] <dandaman>
well you use font-size:15px

[10:49:07.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: So that one can see "oh that test tests this statement"

[10:49:08.0000] <dandaman>
then what is the tag for em

[10:49:09.0000] <dandaman>
?

[10:50:00.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Huh?

[10:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
"em" is a unit, just like px.  You just use it like "margin-top: 1.5em;"

[10:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: For "positions in the spec", is my approach of copying the relevant assertion text from the spec into a separate text file and adding some annotations adequate, or would you want something more/less fragile or requiring more/less effort?

[10:50:03.0000] <KaOSoFt>
em tag is for emphasis. 

[10:50:04.0000] <dandaman>
oh

[10:50:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, did you mean <em>?

[10:51:00.0000] <dandaman>
no, you understood me correctly

[10:51:01.0000] <KaOSoFt>
em unit is for scaling.

[10:51:02.0000] <dandaman>
how does the scaling work KaOSoFt?

[10:51:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dude, I just told you - 1em is always equivalent to the font-size of the element you're specifying the property on.

[10:51:04.0000] <KaOSoFt>
What TabAtkins said: "<TabAtkins> So, for an element with font-size:16px, 1em = 16px."

[10:51:05.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (I think it's worked well enough for the canvas section - it doesn't take that much effort to maintain the annotation file, and it means it can automatically generate warnings when the spec text changes and lets me know that some tests are possibly invalid now)

[10:51:06.0000] <dandaman>
i know, but where do i set the em value?

[10:51:07.0000] <KaOSoFt>
So 2em would be 32px.

[10:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You don't set the "em" value.  *It's equivalent to the font-size.*

[10:52:01.0000] <dandaman>
ohhh, 1 em is ALWAYS 16px?

[10:52:02.0000] <KaOSoFt>
...

[10:52:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, it's equal to 16px if the font-size for that element is 16px.

[10:52:04.0000] <KaOSoFt>
If you set it like that before.

[10:52:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
If the font-size for that element is 30px, then 1em = 30px.

[10:52:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
If it's font-size:8px, then 1em=8px for that element.

[10:52:07.0000] <dandaman>
ok lets say i have my inline style like this

[10:52:08.0000] <dandaman>
<div style="font-size:12px">

[10:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Oh that sounds promising

[10:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The size of the em unit is relative to the element it is being used on.

[10:53:02.0000] <dandaman>
so everything INSIDE of that div tag using the em unit will be in terms of 12px?

[10:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html/file/tip/tests/submission/PhilipTaylor/tools/canvas/spec.yaml if you didn't see that file yet)

[10:53:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
If nothing else changes the font-size inside there.  Also, any properties on the <div> itself that use the em unit will get 1em=12px

[10:54:00.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Whatever is font-size related, yes.

[10:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe if one is clever and writes a js frontend for making the annotation file, one can click on a bit of the spec, grab the right text and add a list of tetss or something

[10:54:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I saw it existed

[10:54:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
KaOSoFt: No need for it to be font-size related.  You can use ems for anything.

[10:54:04.0000] <jgraham>
(like the status annotations, but a bit more complex)

[10:54:05.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: ("<^>" means "put the test marker here", "<...>" means match any string of characters, "*must*" means that's the relevant keyword, etc)

[10:54:06.0000] <dandaman>
ok, thanks

[10:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (plus there's some ugly hacks with 'previously' for sentences that aren't uniquely identified by their text)

[10:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<div style="font-size: 12px; border: 1em solid blue;"><p style="font-size:8px; border: 1em solid red;">foo!</p></div> 

[10:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
^^^ The div's border will be 12px wide, the p's border will be 8px wide.

[10:55:03.0000] <KaOSoFt>
TabAtkins- Oh, wait, yeah, no idea how come I was thinking in other elements (images, for instance) have anything to do with font.

[10:55:04.0000] <KaOSoFt>
._.

[10:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It makes more sense to me that the test case identifies what part of the spec it's testing, rather than the spec identifying the tests, because it seems less likely to get out of sync if the test is updated

[10:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: In either case I think we need an intermediate file

[10:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
Because the tests in general can't identify which part of the spec they are testing

[10:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
(we can't really add that metadata to all tests)

[10:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
Yeah, if we want it to be more specific than linking to a fragment ID

[10:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
With the canvas section it's fairly easy to tie each "must" to a set of tests, so sentence-level annotation is reasonable

[10:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
Don't know how well that'll generalise to the rest of the spec

[11:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
For some parts it is reasonable

[11:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
For the parser not so much

[11:00:02.0000] <jgraham>
Some tetss have a one to many relationship with sections

[11:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Solved problem in the CSS test format - the tests carry links to the spec sections they're testing.

[11:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: "the tests in general can't identify which part of the spec they are testing"

[11:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that statement doesn't make any sense to me.

[11:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
And greater than fragment-id level precision is desirable anyway

[11:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, we suffice with section-level precision. (Nearest heading.)

[11:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Well there are tests like the parser tests which a) are not in a format that is conducive to adding that data and b) test many parts of the algorithm

[11:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I don't think one-to-many is necessarily a problem - the way I usually try to write tests is by looking at a sentence (or word etc), then writing enough tests so that an implementation which does everything perfectly except for that word/sentence/etc will fail

[11:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
and it doesn't matter if the test case also depends on many other spec requirements

[11:03:03.0000] <jgraham>
and then there are tests that require quite specific DOM setup

[11:04:00.0000] <dandaman>
not sure if im asking in the right place, but is there a way to make text scale with screen size(besides with javascript)

[11:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
With the parser you could write tests for line N of the spec by finding cases where a parser that implements everything except line N will fail

[11:05:01.0000] <dandaman>
i would hate to have to go through every element in javascript and multiply by a factor of the screen size :\

[11:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: Ideally what you want is to use the vh/vw units, which scale with the size of the screen.  Nobody implements them yet, though.

[11:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
But it doesn't work if buggy behaviour is caused by a complex interaction of steps and you can't point to a specific place in the spec where it's clearly wrong

[11:06:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It seems unlikely that anyone will start again with the parser tests

[11:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
and also, what you said

[11:06:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think that some browsers implement the rem unit, which is just like em but is always based on the font-size of the root element.  Then you can just change the font-size of the <html> element via js.

[11:06:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't sure how often that situation occurs

[11:06:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Otherwise, you're stuck changing them all.

[11:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually I suppose it occurs a lot when testing negative handling

[11:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: Are you wanting to make *everything* relative to the screen size, or just certain elements?

[11:08:00.0000] <dandaman>
vh and vw units you say hmmm

[11:08:01.0000] <dandaman>
TabAtkins: everything

[11:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
like making sure the <foobar> tag isn't parsed specially, where foobar is some non-standard tag that some browsers might handle crazily

[11:08:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: What's the use-case?

[11:08:04.0000] <Philip`>
since then you can't point to a specific place in the spec about it

[11:08:05.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: All we need to do is write a one-to-one implementation of the spec, run the test suite through it, then delete or buggify line N of the implementation and see which tests fail

[11:08:06.0000] <Ms2ger>
You can point at the "any other tag" requirements?

[11:08:07.0000] <Philip`>
and then we know which lines each test is testing

[11:08:08.0000] <Philip`>
and if no tests fail then write more tests

[11:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Easy :-)

[11:09:01.0000] <dandaman>
TabAtkins: just when the page is loaded

[11:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: I mean, why are you wanting to scale everything by the page size?

[11:09:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is making sure you're doing something reasonable before he offers his next suggestion.

[11:10:00.0000] <dandaman>
TabAtkins: its for a mobile website, and different phones=different screen widths

[11:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just to ask, are you aware of ppk's work on dealing with mobile phones and their horrible lies about their sizes?

[11:10:02.0000] <dandaman>
no i am not :(

[11:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Go read some of the recent stuff in the quirksmode blog.

[11:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
I've heard of Java testing tools which mutate the bytecode (e.g. randomly flip a conditional) and if that doesn't cause any test cases to fail then your test cases are insufficient

[11:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
(or your code is redundant)

[11:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wonder if something like that could work on the validator.nu parser...

[11:14:00.0000] <dandaman>
TabAtkins: do you remember the article name?

[11:18:00.0000] <espadrine>
dandaman: http://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports.html

[11:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
espadrine: Ah, you just beat me.  I'd been chasing down through his twitter feed.

[11:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also viewports2.html

[11:20:00.0000] <espadrine>
;)

[11:20:01.0000] <dandaman>
ty

[11:21:00.0000] <dandaman>
so what it looks like is i just need to set my style widths to percentages

[11:21:01.0000] <dandaman>
and i'll be good

[11:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that should generally work.  You'll have to be a little careful, but it should be okay.

[11:24:00.0000] <dandaman>
did not work :\

[11:24:01.0000] <dandaman>
looks good on browser, not so much on emulator

[11:30:00.0000] <dandaman>
doh, was using device-width

[12:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why does this give "submit" instead of "" on Firefox, Chrome, and Opera?  That seems wrong per spec.  data:text/html,<!doctype html><script>alert(document.createElement('button').type);</script>

[12:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is it a spec bug or browser bug?

[12:38:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
AryehGregor, looks like a spec bug, button.type should be limited to only known values, like input.type

[12:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Firefox 3.6 doesn't treat it that way, but Firefox 4 does.

[12:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll file a spec bug.

[12:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(so do the other browsers I tested)

[12:40:03.0000] <kbrosnan>
firefox 4 is using the html5 parser

[12:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's surely irrelevant to this.

[12:42:00.0000] <kbrosnan>
fairly easy to check if that is the cause of the change in behavior in firefox 4, about:config filter on html5 double click to flip the pref

[12:42:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
volkmar probably changed it to match the spec

[12:42:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
AryehGregor, I just filed one

[12:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Where?

[12:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I did too.  :/

[12:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10290

[12:44:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
-289

[12:44:01.0000] <volkmar>
AryehGregor: i changed that to match the specs

[12:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
volkmar, which spec?

[12:44:03.0000] <volkmar>
Ms2ger: btw, i think bug 9635 is more "fixed" than worksforme

[12:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML5 seems to say that Firefox was more correct before . . .

[12:45:01.0000] <volkmar>
AryehGregor: hmm, s/to match the specs//, i don't really remember, i did that months ago

[12:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It matches other browsers better.

[12:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Matches the spec worse, but the spec doesn't match reality here and is probably what should be changed.

[12:46:00.0000] <volkmar>
AryehGregor: why not having button.type limited to only known values?

[12:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't understand the question.  Having button.type limited to known values matches browser behavior, but not the spec.

[12:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Thus, the spec should be changed.  Right?

[12:48:00.0000] <volkmar>
AryehGregor: I hope, I don't see why button.type shouldn't be limited to only known values

[12:48:01.0000] <volkmar>
it would behave like input.type which seems better

[12:48:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
Exactly

[12:48:03.0000] <annevk5>
I think we should change all enumerable attributes to be limited like that

[12:49:00.0000] <volkmar>
I completely agree

[12:49:01.0000] <annevk5>
it makes sense to ignore on setting to unknown value

[12:49:02.0000] <annevk5>
it is what <canvas> does as well

[12:49:03.0000] <annevk5>
and gives the ability to do feature testing

[12:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
I guess we should just implement it so the spec can remove the whole concept of "limited to known values" and make it part of the enumerable attributes definition

[12:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would require changing a lot of attributes' behavior.  Would it break anything?

[12:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
WebKit seems to treat audio.preload, video.preload, form.enctype as limited to known values too.

[12:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(which other browsers don't, and nor does the spec)

[12:51:01.0000] <volkmar>
actually, some time ago i proposed (in a mail) to move the default behavior to be limited to only known values

[12:51:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
volkmar, yeah, http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/decision-policy-v2.html seems to prefer WFM, though

[12:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what the spec bug is

[12:51:04.0000] <volkmar>
and if, needed, case by case, don't limit the attribute

[12:51:05.0000] <jgraham>
Am I missing something?

[12:51:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
What spec bug?

[12:51:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10290

[12:51:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't say "limited only to known values".

[12:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: The testcase you made seems fine afaict

[12:52:01.0000] <volkmar>
Ms2ger: ok

[12:52:02.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: button.type has a missing value default

[12:52:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, behavior doesn't match the spec.  Look at the details of the rules for reflecting.

[12:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If it's an enumerated attribute but it doesn't say it's limited to known values, IDL set and get is supposed to work like a normal string.

[12:53:01.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, this is purely about IDL attribute behavior

[12:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So if it's not present, it returns "", etc.

[12:53:03.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, IDL attribute behavior of enumerated attributes

[12:53:04.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, if it just reflects the content attribute you cannot do feature testing; if it reflects only known values you can

[12:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, I suspect no content relies on this, though I'm not a 100% sure of course

[12:54:01.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, the most problematic are probably knew enumerated attributes on existing elements

[12:54:02.0000] <annevk5>
s/knew/new/

[12:55:00.0000] <annevk5>
I just went through the spec; there are not too many either

[12:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
The sentence about reflecting enumerated attributes that are limited to known values is impossible to read

[12:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
It is like 5 lines long

[13:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but yeah it is a spec bug)

[13:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you increased your resolution, it wouldn't be five lines long.

[13:12:00.0000] <Matjas>
What is up with this? Web Inspector gives the following error: "<noscript> is not allowed inside <p>" Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/rQSRl.png

[13:13:00.0000] <Matjas>
But the HTML validates and everything… Is this is a Webkit bug or am I doing something wrong?

[13:13:01.0000] <annevk5>
sounds like a WebKit bug

[13:15:00.0000] <Matjas>
annevk5: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/scripts.html#h-18.3.1 says "<!ELEMENT NOSCRIPT - - (%block;)+ "

[13:15:01.0000] <Matjas>
(That's from HTML4 though)

[13:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
HTML4 does not seem relevant

[13:16:01.0000] <annevk5>
and that does not tell anything about what <p> allows

[13:16:02.0000] <annevk5>
though I guess if <noscript> just allows %block; <p> does not allow <noscript>

[13:16:03.0000] <annevk5>
but still a bug in WebKit

[13:31:00.0000] <annevk5>
done deal: http://www.w3.org/News/2010.html#entry-8871 might even blog about this tomorrow

[13:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hurrah.

[13:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
"W3C Invites Implementations of XMLHttpRequest" - do they think it's still 1999?

[13:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Quite possibly.

[13:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
Seems a strange phrase to use in this context

[13:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
lol

[13:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
"W3C confirms that it is out of touch"

[13:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Am I the only person who listens to death metal when I want to numb myself?

[13:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Don't most people just take anesthetics?

[13:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, emotionally numb, not physically.

[13:38:02.0000] <jgraham>
Ah, so you're not planning to have major surgery just under the influece of death metal?

[13:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Nah

[13:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
Was inception really that bad?

[13:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Nah

[13:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Inception was pretty good

[13:40:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Like, good enough that I didn't realize it was 20:30 until I looked at my watch and then was amazed at how late it was

[13:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
So it's very unclear why you are listening to death metal

[13:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Because seeing Inception is all I did today?

[13:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well I suppose work might have been that bad

[13:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Having to work with you always is

[13:43:02.0000] <jgraham>
Fair point

[13:43:03.0000] <jgraham>
What we have here is a cycle of badness

[13:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
Because I hate death metal

[13:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
So if you listen to more of it, it is likely to make working with me worse

[13:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
So you will need to listen to even more death metal

[13:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
The only way out is to stop listening to death metal

[13:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
Or stop working with me

[13:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Or both

[13:58:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, http://www.whatwg.org/specs/html5/current-work/ ought to redirect

[13:59:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, would also be great to have http://www.whatwg.org/complete as equivalent to http://www.whatwg.org/html

[14:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"On setting, the given value must be converted to the shortest possible string representing the number as a valid integer and then that string must be used as the new content attribute value."

[14:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What if you set it to a non-number?

[14:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like "foo"?

[14:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Another spec bug, or am I missing something?

[14:01:04.0000] <annevk5>
you are missing the Web IDL layer I think

[14:01:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Again.  :/

[14:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
aah, mark is giving away free copies

[14:17:00.0000] <annevk5>
I already ordered one

[14:17:01.0000] <annevk5>
long ago :)

[14:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: where does http://www.whatwg.org/specs/html5/current-work/ come from?

[14:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
it was a subset of the web-apps draft that was a closer match of the W3C copy of HTML5

[14:22:01.0000] <annevk5>
before all kinds of things were dropped from W3C HTML5 that we thought should remain included

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i misread the url, didn't see the /specs/ there

[14:24:01.0000] <annevk5>
should just redirect to web-apps/ I think

[14:25:00.0000] <annevk5>
at least that is what I changed it to in XMLHttpRequest

[14:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
fixed

[14:25:02.0000] <annevk5>
cool

[14:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
i thought you were talking about http://whatwg.org/html5/current-work

[14:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
so i was confused :-)

[14:25:05.0000] <hober>
Speaking of XHR, I'm so excited browser vendors will implement it now that the W3C has invited them to. </sarcasm>

[14:25:06.0000] <annevk5>
and http://www.whatwg.org/complete redirecting to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/ ?

[14:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
hober, would be nice if they implemented it per spec :)

[14:26:01.0000] <annevk5>
(no sarcasm)

[14:26:02.0000] <hober>
annevk5: fair enough :)

[14:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: added http://whatwg.org/c and http://whatwg.org/C for you

[14:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
(c is complete.html, C is complete/)

[14:27:01.0000] <annevk5>
heh

[14:27:02.0000] <annevk5>
neat

[14:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
any others while i'm at it? :-)

[14:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
hober, I suspect the comm team just issues a normal press release and is not aware of the special circumstances; you can probably email them and get it rectified

[14:28:01.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, can't think of any

[14:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[14:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, now i'm just saying "Indeed" to tab's e-mails on purpose

[14:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
(instead of "Right" or "What he said" or "Yes")

[14:33:02.0000] <annevk5>
as long as you keep him out of the acknowledgment section we should be ok ;p

[14:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-D

[14:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
poor tab

[14:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is sure he's missing something

[14:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is sure gsnedders is missing a lot

[14:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me listens as the death metal gets cranked up

[14:42:00.0000] <annevk5>
you guys still at the office?

[14:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Nah

[14:42:02.0000] <annevk5>
come on

[14:42:03.0000] <annevk5>
oh

[14:42:04.0000] <jgraham>
It was entirely imagined

[14:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well I mean I was listening

[14:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
He probably ranked up the death metal

[14:43:02.0000] <jgraham>
I didn't hear it

[14:43:03.0000] <jgraham>
*cranked

[14:43:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I've only once been this late working, and that was right before shipping

[14:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Also, I'm listening to goth rock, and did not turn it up

[14:52:00.0000] <sebmarkbage>
curious... What's the status on the copy/paste API? Sure, it's a difficult mess but it doesn't seem it has received much love.

can someone on windows do me a favour?

[18:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/582

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you change your highlight colour, does IE update the rendering?

[18:28:01.0000] <wirepair>
ie version matter?

[18:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
probably not, but the later the better

[18:28:03.0000] <wirepair>
it 'modified the page to prevent cross site scripting' ;>

[18:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
(not sure how you change the highlight colour on windows)

[18:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
good times

[18:28:06.0000] <Hixie>
go to http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/

[18:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
and click "download"

[18:29:01.0000] <wirepair>
yes

[18:29:02.0000] <wirepair>
it updates automatically

[18:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[18:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[18:29:05.0000] <wirepair>
np

[18:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
no need to reload or anything right?

[18:30:01.0000] <peol>
wouldn't be very automatic then, would it? :)

[18:30:02.0000] <wirepair>
nope

[18:30:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: I knew it!

[18:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
well chrome changes "automatically" when you next cause it to do a restyle (it also changes it to blue, regardless of what you picked, which is a crazy bug)

[18:30:05.0000] <wirepair>
changes as you type

[18:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: wait, i mean change the highlight colour in the OS settings

[18:31:01.0000] <wirepair>
Ohhh

[18:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: not change the display when you type in the form :-)

[18:31:03.0000] <wirepair>
sorry, 

[18:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: :-P

[18:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: i think it's in display appearance settings or something

[18:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: not sure exactly how to change the highlight colour

[18:32:02.0000] <wirepair>
yeah... me either

[18:32:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was going to poke you and laugh because I saw 2 or 3 emails today where you replied "Indeed.", but then I became certain that you were doing it on purpose.

[18:32:04.0000] <wirepair>
sec

[18:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: :-P

[18:34:00.0000] <wirepair>
yup, it changes

[18:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
interesting

[18:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
so you don't have to even focus the browser?

[18:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
just hitting "apply" or whatever makes the colour change?

[18:35:02.0000] <wirepair>
desktop -> apperence -> advanced -> selected items to change

[18:35:03.0000] <wirepair>
yeah

[18:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[18:35:05.0000] <Hixie>
thanks man

[18:35:06.0000] <wirepair>
after you hit apply, it resets the entire desktop

[18:35:07.0000] <wirepair>
np

[18:35:08.0000] <wirepair>
and the rendered view included obviously

[18:35:09.0000] <Hixie>
k

[18:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
do you know what version of IE and Windows that was by any chance?

[18:36:01.0000] <wirepair>
ie8 

[18:36:02.0000] <wirepair>
8.0.6001.18702 

[18:36:03.0000] <wirepair>
to be exact

[18:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
on XP?

[18:37:00.0000] <wirepair>
yes

[18:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[18:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks again

[18:37:03.0000] <wirepair>
sp3, fully patched

[18:37:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you want some W7 experience, I can try it.

[18:37:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ooh, resource packages!  Yay!

[18:38:00.0000] <wirepair>
now.. to figure out how to automate epiphany ;<

[18:38:01.0000] <wirepair>
the main window has no identifier that i can match on, always takes the <title>whatever</title> value for the window text

[18:38:02.0000] <wirepair>
ps. automating ui's in *nix is *painful*

[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently tantek didn't like the ordering by first name and decided to reorder the speaker list on the wiki by last name :-|

[19:01:00.0000] <dbaron>
Mmmm.  I like Hixie's writing about colors.  He uses "colour" when talking about the concept and "color" when talking about technical terms in the spec. :-)

[19:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie's not in favor of internationalizing the CSS property names then, I suppose. ^_^

[19:09:00.0000] <aho>
i still want #rrggbbaa and #rgba :>

[19:09:01.0000] <aho>
by the way

[19:09:02.0000] <aho>
<:

[19:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
in css?

[19:09:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know, I just need to write Colors 4 so Hyatt will let me commit it.

[19:09:05.0000] <aho>
yes

[19:09:06.0000] <aho>
0-255, 0-255, 0-255, 0-1 is just silly

[19:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
My survey of pages showed that the compat impact of turning it on for HTML colors should be very minimal as well.

[19:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Just so you know, Hixie, so you can change the color parsing algorithm appropriately when I land the patch.)

[19:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
i do not intend to change that algorithm ever again

[19:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's no reason for anyone to use legacy colours

[19:12:00.0000] <aho>

[19:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's somewhat annoying to patch webkit to use a different codepath for attributes and CSS properties.

[20:23:00.0000] <boblet>
can anyone tell me what’s up with @profile? specifically why it was dropped from HTML5 and what’s up with the separate @profile spec?

[23:56:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, so how do you reckon we add multiplexing later? if it is added frames get prefixed by a byte that is an identifier?

[23:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
for example

[23:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
ideally we'd have a multiplexed connection connect to some predefined resource name or something

[23:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
but that might bo harder to do later

[23:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
and not so backwards-compatible

[23:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
so maybe we just try to connect without multiplexing, and if the server says it supports it, we do the channel open separately

[23:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
and just assume that everything on that origin supports it

[00:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
so the server declares multiplexing support in its handshake and the client will start transmitting special frames and remember that server supports multiplexing for the duration of any ongoing connections to that server?

[00:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
(well, not any, *that* ongoing connection, and any new queued will use the same one)

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems unlikely to me that we'll find it's actually necessary though

[00:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
it does seem like a better approach to keep simple servers simple at least

[00:12:01.0000] <annevk5>
without having to put all kinds of provisions into framing from the start

[00:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love the juxtaposition of some of the proposals on the hybi list with the simultaneous argument that we shouldn't use variable-width framing because it's "too complicated"

[00:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah...

[00:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, added NE to 2 bugs!

[00:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: thanks

[00:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
I'll do it for some more; I'm still in bed and feel rather lazy

[00:42:00.0000] <annevk5>
okay, getting bored with this

[00:50:00.0000] <volkmar>
what NE means?

[00:50:01.0000] <annevk5>
it means non-editorial or controversial (if it's editorial but controversial)

[00:51:00.0000] <annevk5>
it also ensures that public-html gets updates as the bug progresses

[00:51:01.0000] <annevk5>
so everyone is in the loop rather than just those subscribed to the bug

[00:51:02.0000] <volkmar>
ok :)

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. even Windows Live developers sniff for Firefoxness instead of sniffing for Geckoness

[02:44:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, I think it might help if a separate thread is started on how multiplexing can be added later

[02:44:01.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, I could email what I sketched out earlier

[02:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
go for it

[02:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
i have to go sleep soon

[02:44:04.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, I believe some people have concerns with changing the framing, but I'm not sure what they are

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk5>
kk

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
me either

[03:00:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh look

[03:00:01.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/ has been republished too now

[03:00:02.0000] <annevk5>
via myakura

[03:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
poked the hybi list

[03:12:01.0000] <annevk5>
i am surprised there is still no reply

[03:15:00.0000] <annevk5>
othermaciej, in "Re: [whatwg] HTML resource packages" your last sentence got truncated (though I suppose it is clear what you wanted to say)

[03:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk5: d'oh

[03:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I hate when I do that

[03:17:02.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Isn't that like once every other message? :)

[03:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, lol

[03:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
and retweeted

[03:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I do it a lot when I reply to emails in haste

[03:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: because I write chunks of my reply out of order, and I don't re-read when I am rushing

[03:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I do it less than I used to because I am more careful in wording my emails most of the time

[03:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Maybe I should make a graph so there is some data to back up that claim :)

[03:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me finds that if he writes emails in haste they are just ill-thought-out nonsense so tries to avoid that

[03:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
(so you are ahead of me there)

[03:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I can sometimes jot off a sensible thought quickly

[03:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I prefer to take the time to think it through and review my words

[03:29:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if I write quickly, I tend to be too verbose

[03:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: the DOM of Hotmail is no laughing matter :-(

[03:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are there any large complex dynamic web apps with nice clean readable well-structured markup and scripts?

[03:50:00.0000] <workmad3>
probably... but it would surprise me if they serve it to the public like so

[03:51:00.0000] <workmad3>
large dynamic apps seem to have moved towards removing extraneous white-space from output to minimise every last bit of output

[04:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
workmad3: Hotmail is minifying each script and style, but it's definitely not minimizing the number of <script> and <style> elements

[04:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or the number of <div>s

[04:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it has a number of style elements each of which is a child of a div inside head!

[08:20:00.0000] <Rik`>
wow, the night :target {} rule on the HTML5 spec is… weird

[08:20:01.0000] <Rik`>
s/night/new

[08:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, :target has existed for ages, hasn't it?

[08:26:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: I mean the style used on the spec

[08:26:01.0000] <Rik`>
combining a big box-shadow and text-shadow in yellow

[10:40:00.0000] <franksalim>
would working examples of amqp, stomp, xmpp, rfb, etc. over WebSocket (75/76) be sufficient to demonstrate that protocol features like framing, chunking, and multiplexing can be done in the application layer (JavaScript)?

[10:42:00.0000] <annevk5>
you could try on the list

[10:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think possibility is a useful thing to demonstrate

[10:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could demonstrate using WebSockets as a transport mechanism for IP packets and then do everything else in the application layer

[10:43:01.0000] <franksalim>
has been done, then

[10:43:02.0000] <franksalim>
this is all working code

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
If the demonstration demonstrates the complexity of doing those things or the performance impact then that'd probably be a useful thing to demonstrate, though

[10:44:01.0000] <franksalim>
annevk5, i will try on the list

[10:44:02.0000] <franksalim>
Philip`, the biggest wins are in flexibility and interoperability

[10:45:00.0000] <franksalim>
without a negative impact on performance. complexity moves from browser native code to JavaScript libraries

[10:46:00.0000] <franksalim>
I strongly suspect the HyBi discussion is being colored by a lack of faith and experience in JavaScript

[10:46:01.0000] <franksalim>
which is tragic considering what WebSocket is intended for

[10:48:00.0000] <franksalim>
 /unsolicited opinion

[10:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
lol

[10:52:01.0000] <annevk5>
just read an email where gregw claims he tries to keep it simple

[10:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone who's trying to design a simple nuclear power station will make something very different to someone who's trying to design a simple bicycle storage building

[11:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me would like to see some simple examples of IDB usage, because it smells overengineered.

[12:03:00.0000] <dandaman>
<body onload="alert('errho');setWidth();$('bodyId').style.display='';" id="bodyId" onscroll="scrolltop()" style=" margin:0 auto;"> gives me an alert

[12:03:01.0000] <dandaman>
but when i put that alert in the first line of my setwidth() function, nothing comes up

[12:03:02.0000] <dandaman>
the case matches the function too

[12:03:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Damn your precise yet intricate prose.  After considerable pain, I find that everything you wrote about margin-collapsing is exactly correct, but requires reverse-engineering for a normal mortal to decode.

[12:03:04.0000] <dandaman>
what the hell :(

[12:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: Are you using jQuery or Prototype?

[12:05:00.0000] <dandaman>
mootools

[12:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, I was just wondering about the $('bodyId') call, because it would cause an error in jQuery.

[12:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Do you see any errors in your error console?

[12:06:02.0000] <dandaman>
hmm lemme check out firebug

[12:06:03.0000] <dandaman>
Access to restricted URI denied.

[12:06:04.0000] <dandaman>
thats what my css tab says

[12:06:05.0000] <dandaman>
dunno what the hell that means

[12:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Look in the javascript tab.

[12:07:01.0000] <dandaman>
public_smo_scripts.js gives me the same access restricted thing

[12:08:00.0000] <dandaman>
i can get rid of that

[12:08:01.0000] <dandaman>
forgot i left that when i was playing around with a tutorial

[12:08:02.0000] <dandaman>
no more access restricted

[12:08:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm looking for any errors that suggest that setWidth() isn't being called.

[12:08:04.0000] <dandaman>
but it still isnt working

[12:08:05.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: margin collapsing is the result of dbaron and i thinking CSS1 and CSS2 were infallible words and thus us working out the only set of rules that could completely solve them. Then we wrote them explicitly and that was CSS2.1.

[12:09:00.0000] <dandaman>
yea, i mean the setWidth() was working before i added a bunch of $('variable').style.display='none' to onclicks

[12:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: then we learnt that we could change specs and we were like "ohhhh. we should have just made margin collapsing simpler. oops."

[12:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Right.  And at this point it can't be changed anymore, as far as I can tell.

[12:09:03.0000] <dandaman>
but i made sure those were all legit changes

[12:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: yeah :-(

[12:09:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: So now I'm trying to see how I can rephrase things and add informative notes so that it's actually parseable by a human.

[12:10:00.0000] <dandaman>
oh wow

[12:10:01.0000] <dandaman>
left out a ' in a bunch of these

[12:10:02.0000] <dandaman>
there we go

[12:10:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: If you didn't see any errors about those, then you're not looking at the right error console.

[12:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: i wouldn't rephrase it, every last comma is meaningful and has dastardly implications

[12:10:05.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: but informative notes would be fantastic! with diagrams!

[12:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There will be so many diagrams!

[12:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: In FF try Tools->Error Console.

[12:14:00.0000] <dandaman>
i cant use ff because it doesnt support css3 :\

[12:14:01.0000] <dandaman>
or rather i dont because google chrome doesnt need plugins

[12:14:02.0000] <dandaman>
do you know where the error console is on chrome?

[12:14:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: ... (a) That's quite wrong, and (b) you said you were using Firebug.

[12:15:00.0000] <dandaman>
chrome's got firebug too

[12:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, it's got a Web Inspector.

[12:15:02.0000] <dandaman>
does the new firefox come with css3 support?

[12:15:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or rather, "Developer Tools".

[12:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In there, just go to the Console tab.

[12:16:01.0000] <dandaman>
kk, but there is a firebug add-on for chrome in case you were curious, im using it right now :)

[12:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Huh.  Weird.

[12:16:03.0000] <dandaman>
found the console, thanks

[12:16:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyway, yes, Firefox supports plenty of CSS3 stuff.

[12:17:00.0000] <dandaman>
guess im using an old  version then

[12:17:01.0000] <dandaman>
i like chrome better anyway

[12:17:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
What version are you using, and what do you consider "CSS3"?

[12:17:03.0000] <dandaman>
so much faster

[12:18:00.0000] <dandaman>
well the main thing firefox wont do for me is sliding transitions

[12:18:01.0000] <dandaman>
-transition:all 1.0s ease-in-out;

[12:18:02.0000] <dandaman>
upon further inspection it looks like firefox has a webkit for those transistions though

[12:19:00.0000] <dandaman>
i have 3.6.7 though

[12:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Correct, 3.6 doesn't yet implement transitions.

[12:19:02.0000] <dandaman>
doesnt look like it implements gradients either :\

[12:19:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Firefox implements gradients just fine.

[12:19:04.0000] <dandaman>
wait

[12:19:05.0000] <dandaman>
this is weird

[12:19:06.0000] <dandaman>
the bg gradient is fine

[12:19:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
They even implement it according to the spec.

[12:19:08.0000] <dandaman>
but my button gradient isnt working haha

[12:20:00.0000] <dandaman>
oh, i didnt put the -mozilla gradient

[12:20:01.0000] <dandaman>
only webkit

[12:20:02.0000] <dandaman>
they really need to standardize this shit

[12:20:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
"firefox has a webkit for those transitions" <--- What does that mean?

[12:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
hmm... counter proposals to ISSUE-110

[12:20:05.0000] <dandaman>
as in you need to put down, -moz-transition:all 1.0s ease-in-out;

[12:20:06.0000] <dandaman>
not just -iwebkit...

[12:20:07.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what counter proposals people would be willing to vote for

[12:20:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, why would you think that -webkit would work for Firefox?

[12:22:00.0000] <Peter->
-webkit worked for IE Mobile, -khtml works for webkit (and vice versa)

[12:22:01.0000] <Peter->
prefixes are a mess

[12:22:02.0000] <miketaylr>
FF4.0b2 has pretty decent support for transitions and transforms

[12:23:00.0000] <dandaman>
i didnt, i just forgot that those were the only css3 things i had in a lot of cases

[12:23:01.0000] <dandaman>
i made my stylesheet like 3 weeks ago

[12:23:02.0000] <dandaman>
kinda forgot about it

[12:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
-webkit only worked only worked in IEMobile for a short while, then they quickly backed off because it was a horrible idea.

[12:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wasn't aware that -khtml worked for webkit, but webkit did come from that, so shrug.

[12:26:02.0000] <dandaman>
webkit seems to work for chrome though

[12:26:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, because both Chrome and Safari use the Webkit rendering engine.

[12:29:00.0000] <dandaman>
how come mozilla doesn't just jump on and use webkit instead of complicating matters and having their own engine?

[12:29:01.0000] <miketaylr>
:/

[12:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because more engines = mo' betta'

[12:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Competition is good in the rendering engine world.)

[12:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, it would require a huge amount of work to switch completely, and their programmers would all have to get familiar with WebKit when they're already familiar with Gecko.

[12:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
WebKit and Gecko do borrow from one another liberally where it makes sense, but it doesn't make sense for either to just use the other engine wholesale.

[12:33:00.0000] <dandaman>
hmmm, good to know

[12:34:00.0000] <dandaman>
i forget that the discomfort of non-standardization promotes progress

[12:48:00.0000] <dandaman>
anyone know of a channel for mobile web development?

[12:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: I do like how protective Google is of their performance crown at JS, speaking of competition.

[12:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me heard that there were people running around after Carakan shipped trying to beat it

[12:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, that's totally unlike other browser vendors, right?

[12:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, doesn't like every single browser release these days claim to have the fastest JS engine in existence?

[12:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: I only got the impression of real panic in Google-land when Carakan shipped

[12:57:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
How did you get that impression?

[12:57:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[12:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can't see them panicking *too* much.  I mean, it took them less than 24 hours after release to eclipse Opera's market share, if I remember correctly.

[13:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Having a link on Google.com is kinda benefical, I guess :)

[13:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
We need to have as many benchmarks as there are browser engines

[13:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
then everyone can be the fastest browser in the world on their own JS benchmark

[13:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It's nice to be able to claim we're fastest on someone else's though :)

[13:01:03.0000] <Philip`>
and then they can stop worrying about it and start optimising things that real users will care about

[13:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, why do you think they'd ever do that?

[13:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If it's not measurable . . .

[13:02:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The measurability increases the competition.

[13:02:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because everyone can compete on every last millisecond, instead of just saying "meh, we're fast enough".

[13:03:00.0000] <Peter->
IE9 Platform Preview 4 just got released

[13:03:01.0000] <Peter->
rather unexpected

[13:03:02.0000] <Peter->
http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/

[13:03:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Peter-: Any changelog?

[13:03:04.0000] <Peter->
not yet, they're still updating pages

[13:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
95/100 on Acide

[13:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*Acid3

[13:05:00.0000] <Peter->
they've madea a demo called Hamster Dance Revolution

[13:05:01.0000] <Peter->
that sounds cool already

[13:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess my guess of them actually aiming for 100/100 is still on track

[13:05:03.0000] <Peter->
they stated not to implement SMIL

[13:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
They've stated it's not a current aim.

[13:05:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Not that it won't be later on in the release cycle.

[13:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Or at lesat that was the case when I last looked)

[13:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(My theory is they're still deliberately not promising anything, not that they aren't planning things)

[13:08:00.0000] <Peter->
"Microsoft doesn't want to support SMIL because the HTML+Time declarative animation it already has never gets used" according to zdnet

[13:08:01.0000] <Peter->
but we'll know in a few minutes I suppose

[13:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Peter-, is that to shut up the guy on Slashdot who has as his sig "HTML5 will displace Flash when it can do [link to that annoying badger/snake video]"?

[13:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I saw something about not shipping final until next year

[13:08:04.0000] <Peter->
I do not think so, it was posted early June

[13:08:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Peter-: That's only part of SMIL, though, no?

[13:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
s/part/a small part/

[13:09:01.0000] <Peter->
to be honest, I'm not sure

[13:09:02.0000] <Peter->
http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/info/ReleaseNotes/Default.html

[13:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't remember to much detail about HMTL+TIME

[13:10:00.0000] <Peter->
refresh a few times, some nodes on their server cluster already got updated

[13:10:01.0000] <Peter->
DOMException objects seems to be the largest improvement

[13:10:02.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like mostly DOM-implementation changes

[13:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
and no significant new features

[13:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What real-world features do they still need to add, practically speaking?  Somewhat better SVG support, anything else?

[13:11:02.0000] <Peter->
They're talking about updates to the DOM hierarchy, "Changes align IE9 standards mode with W3C standards", meaning an HTML5 parser?

[13:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
"var g = document.getElementById; g(‘test’); // Now throws an exception"

[13:11:04.0000] <gsnedders>
What spec defines that?

[13:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, I bet the ECMAScript spec defines that you should treat it as a syntax error when someone tries to use curly quotes.

[13:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
[[Call]] gone from HTMLCollection

[13:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: No, that's an impl allowable extension ;P

[13:12:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Peter-, if they did an HTML5 parser, they'd bill it higher, I'm thinking, because it's a really big backend change.

[13:14:00.0000] <Peter->
Probably, yes

[13:14:01.0000] <Peter->
they did pass Safari in sunspider

[13:15:00.0000] <Peter->
only by 2ms though

[13:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Still slower than Opera 10.60 though :P

[13:21:00.0000] <Peter->
Four of the five ACID3 tests they fail are SMIL, one is SVG fonts

[13:29:00.0000] <paul_irish>
AryehGregor: they're still missing css transitions, transforms, box shadow, gradients, geolocation.... and then web workers, indexeddb, app cache, flexbox, file api, webgl..

[13:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Half that stuff isn't even close to being properly standardized yet.

[13:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE isn't going to implement experimental stuff with a two-year release cycle.

[13:30:01.0000] <paul_irish>
regardless of that, half that stuff is very much real-world nowadays.

[13:31:00.0000] <Peter->
paul_irish: they implemented CSS values for rotations/timing, which is rather useless if you don't plan to do anything with them

[13:34:00.0000] <paul_irish>
Peter-: rotations/timing ?

[13:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Presumably he means the deg, s, etc. units.

[13:34:02.0000] <Peter->
deg/grad/rad/turn/ms/s

[13:35:00.0000] <Peter->
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/ff468705.aspx#_CSS3_Values_Units

[13:38:00.0000] <paul_irish>
ah. good eye.

[13:39:00.0000] <Peter->
Changelog of that document says it PP4 added support for WebIDL as well

[13:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Support for WebM software is not included in this release"

[13:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wonder if that means "support like we said before, where you have to manually install the codec" or proper support.

[13:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If it's proper support, it will be time to break out the champagne.

[13:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
One would imagine that Google and Microsoft have been doing all sorts of secret negotiations about this . . .

[14:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, quite a bit of the XMLHttpRequest tests I created are now wrong per the specification...

[14:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is <html manifest="..."> not usable in XHTML?

[14:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Seems it's only triggered by the HTML parser)

[14:22:02.0000] <annevk5>
it is

[14:22:03.0000] <annevk5>
see the XML loading thingie

[14:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.whatwg.org/C#read-xml

[14:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
you don't need the www.

[14:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[14:23:03.0000] <annevk5>
jaja :)

[14:23:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
What's a dependable way to tell when a <video> has frame data to be grabbed?

[14:23:05.0000] <annevk5>
bbiab

[14:23:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Waiting for "play" doesn't work.)

[14:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, I was just looking the in "XHTML Syntax" section

[14:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/the in/in the/

[14:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: iirc there's an event for it

[14:24:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
"canshowcurrentframe"?

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
sounds right

[14:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk, chrome just doesn't fire that event, it seems.  Drat.

[14:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
file a bug

[14:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[14:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Should set up http://c.whatwg.org/#whatever so that autocompleting location bars will probably just need the "c.w"

[14:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
done

[14:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://c.whatwg.org/ redirects to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html and http://c.whatwg.org/m redirects to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/

[14:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
error id: "bad_httpd_conf"

[14:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah give it a few minutes

[14:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Now it redirects to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.htmlm

[14:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is closer

[14:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm, i guess it would huh

[14:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
try now?

[14:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
That works better

[14:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
had them in the wrong order

[14:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, now how do I teach Opera to autocomplete to the /m address instead of the / one...

[14:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
why can't i register xn--7ca.whatwg.org

[14:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
silly dreamhost restrictions

[14:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Do you not have a HAPPY FACE or whatever on hixie.ch?

[14:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[14:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://xn--74h.damowmow.com/

[14:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Is that not on dreamhost?

[14:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Doesn't show up a happy face in Chrome.  :(

[14:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's on dreamhost

[14:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i just got a captcha where one of the characters was U+221E

[14:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
how are people supposed to type that in!

[14:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
lolwut?

[14:42:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
You sure it wasn't an 8?

[14:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
alt + 5 on the default US/GB Macintosh keymap? :P

[14:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ctrl+Shift+u221E

[14:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
huh, i never knew about alt+5

[14:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me actually knows that one by heart, more or less

[14:44:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: :D

[14:44:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: It's useful!

[14:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Surely that sort of thing conflicts like crazy with application hotkeys?

[14:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: http://junkyard.damowmow.com/434

[14:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
i can't say i type infinities very often

[14:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, was that input actually accepted?

[14:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd think it's an 8.

[14:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although, wait.

[14:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes, it was accepted

[14:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
but it's recaptcha

[14:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
so it probably wasn't checking that side

[14:46:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, huh.  Indeed it is infinity.

[14:46:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Recaptcha actually presents two things and only looks at one, yeah.

[14:46:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was about to say.

[14:46:08.0000] <Hixie>
hopefully some ocr will know about inifinity now!

[14:46:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
So maybe for the side it doesn't look at, it doesn't check well enough that it's really ASCII text.

[14:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Only if the other people who get shown that symbol know how to type it

[14:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
otherwise it has no reason to trust your input

[14:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll just go over to the recaptcha team and let them know to make their system trust me... :-P

[14:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[14:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i was trying to make http://xn--7ca.whatwg.org/ a shortcut for the multipage one for you, but i can't yet. i filed a support request for you.

[14:48:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh, I forgot that Google bought reCAPTCHA too.

[14:48:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like every other cool thing.

[14:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
I can't type ç in Opera :-(

[14:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
IE9PP4 is claiming 374 new JS tests…

[14:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Works in other applications with ctrl+= c)

[14:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I didn't know we'd bought recaptcha!

[14:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/ctrl/altgr/

[14:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
¢.whatwg.org would be better for me :-)

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: k :-)

[14:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, that doesn't work

[14:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
"The URL http://¢.whatwg.org contains characters that are not valid in the location they are found."

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
well dreamhost won't let me register that one either anyway

[14:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's the point of the NE keyword?

[14:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
To spam everyone with bugmail in case they care?

[14:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[14:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
Isn't this whole non-ascii thing just likely to upset anti-homograph code

[14:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
Otherwise all the technical discussion gets stuck in Bugzilla and nobody even knows about it

[14:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, aren't registrars required to vet IDNs for homographs before allowing registrations?

[14:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Why should anyone care about homographs here?

[14:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
given that you could use http://www.paypal.com.whatwg.org and don't need to bother with the homography

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[14:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Who decided to make domain names in URLs backward?!  :(

[14:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
tim

[14:59:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Possibly. I am assuming that whatever defences browsers have (if any) are rather dumb

[14:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
iirc

[14:59:05.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, see http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100804#l-277 for NE

[14:59:06.0000] <jgraham>
Which seems likely :)

[14:59:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess domain names started out backward, and file paths started out forwards, and TBL wanted to stitch them together without reversing either one.

[15:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, though he's on record as regretting that decision.

[15:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yay, more polls.

[15:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me puts off voting for a few days

[15:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
this one doesn't seem so important

[15:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's just "should the w3c spec be complete or not"

[15:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
and we've already decided it shouldn't be :-)

[15:03:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh.

[15:03:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
True.

[15:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it's useful for the w3c spec to contain features that vendors plan to implement

[15:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if only for IPR disarmament reasons

[15:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so far I can't tell if any non-WebKit-based browsers have an interest in srcdoc

[15:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that it would be useful

[15:07:02.0000] <annevk5>
i'm interested

[15:07:03.0000] <annevk5>
and our security folks are somewhat

[15:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
but given limited capacity to effect change, focusing only on normative issues is a higher priority for me

[15:08:01.0000] <annevk5>
it doesn't have much priority for us at the moment though

[15:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
and it seems i can leave it up to the chairs to make sure that the w3c html spec is relevant

[15:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you're free to have your own priorities; I'm mentioning reasons that others might find it useful to reply to the survey

[15:10:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh

[15:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
however, it is also possible and entirely ok that people may find it a waste of time to reply

[15:10:02.0000] <annevk5>
well, it seems most is already said by the change proposal and the first response :)

[15:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if Opera is potentially interested in implementing, that is a valuable data point, whether in email or the survey

[15:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
ok

[15:14:01.0000] <annevk5>
replied

[15:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
i put it as an argument against dropping

[15:41:00.0000] <espadrine>
I get a parse error with html5lib, and don't understand it...

[15:41:02.0000] <espadrine>
It's on a <form>

[15:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
try validating with henri's validator, see what it says

[15:44:00.0000] <espadrine>
http://validator.w3.org/check sees nothing; where is henri's validator?

[15:45:00.0000] <boblet>
http://validator.nu/

[15:46:00.0000] <espadrine>
Neither does validator.nu

[15:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
validator.whatwg.org lists the current known html5 validators (that is, henri's validator)

[15:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
might be a bug in html5lib

[15:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
do you have a minimised test case showing the problem?

[15:48:00.0000] <espadrine>
It's a 5-line form, should I paste it here?

[15:49:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: what’s up with @profile, and the separate @profile spec?

[15:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
boblet: @profile doesn't solve real problems and isn't used by anything worthwhile on the real web, so it's dropped.

[15:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The separate @profile spec is by someone who disagrees.

[15:50:02.0000] <boblet>
TabAtkins: aah thanks (well two ppl who disagree)

[15:52:00.0000] <boblet>
so it should theoretically be possible for the microformat use of @profile to be replaced by link huh

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
espadrine: sure

[15:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: it's not clear that microformats really use profile="" in practice

[15:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Microformats dont' seem to do anything useful with @profile in the first place, so it seems they can be replaced by nothing at all.

[15:54:00.0000] <espadrine>

[15:54:10.0000] <Hixie>
espadrine: might just be an html5lib bug

[15:54:11.0000] <boblet>
TabAtkins: I think there’s a theoretical “you should use @profile to disambiguate” idea, which may become the same as @itemtype

[15:54:12.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Except for gratuituous use of entities.)

[15:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
espadrine: jgraham might know

[15:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
boblet: Yeah, but theoretical disambiguation rarely seems to pan out to anything useful.

[15:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: disambiguate what from what? it's not like "hcard" is going to be used for another microformat

[15:56:00.0000] <karlcow>
question about srcdoc attribute: The document seems to be in a nested browsing context (according to the spec). If I write a text which will be put in srcdoc and I create anchors to the current page. All my anchors will be broken?

[15:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
karlcow: Yeah, it's equivalent to writing a separate page and linking to it with <iframe src>.

[15:57:00.0000] <karlcow>
hmmm then it might not be very practical :/

[15:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
?_?

[15:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could use seamless, right?

[15:57:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although that seems highly pointless.

[15:57:04.0000] <Hixie>
why pointless?

[15:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
srcdoc="" will usually be used with seamless="" sandbox="allow-same-origin"

[15:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
which makes the links work

[15:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, really?

[15:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[15:59:02.0000] <boblet>
I guess the lack of native browser support is due to them being based on @class rather than the lack of an @itemtype equivalent then huh

[15:59:03.0000] <karlcow>
TabAtkins: I imagine the scenario on a blog, or forum, or documentation page with a form for commenting. Then you want to make a link to one of the previous comment or a specific section of the page. You put the anchor name. Save. And then the link is broken

[15:59:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
karlcow: You should be using @seamless and @sandbox="allow-same-origin" for the blog comments case, like Hixie says, so they look like they're part of the same page anyway.

[16:00:00.0000] <karlcow>
TabAtkins: ah ok. thanks.

[16:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh, these IE blog posts are ripping the other browsers to shreds with their totally legitimate benchmarks.

[16:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
boblet: No, the lack of native browser support is generally due to no one caring enough.

[16:00:03.0000] <boblet>
TabAtkins: ouchies :)

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually i guess you'd do <iframe seamless sandbox="allow-top-navigation allow-same-origin" srcdoc="..."> to have the links work if you wanted the sandbox

[16:02:00.0000] <boblet>
TabAtkins: that seems strange to me given e.g. Apple Mail’s data detectors for calendar events in natural language

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe the sandboxed navigation browsing context flag should somehow be mitigated by the seamless attribute

[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
or not, i guess it's better to leave that up to authors

[16:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE9 now even does better on SunSpider than Firefox 4.0b2 and Safari 5.

[16:06:00.0000] <karlcow>
is srcdoc='<p class="foo">bar</p>' possible or srcdoc="<p class='foo'>bar</p>"

[16:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, they're both fine.

[16:07:00.0000] <karlcow>
oki

[16:07:01.0000] <espadrine>
by the way, is there any escape mechanism at all? I didn't realize we'd need that any time soon, but...

[16:07:02.0000] <karlcow>
the note in the spec might be a bit confusing then:

[16:07:03.0000] <karlcow>
>In the HTML syntax, authors need only remember to use U+0022 QUOTATION MARK characters (") to wrap the attribute contents and then to escape all U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (") and U+0026 AMPERSAND (&) characters, and to specify the sandbox attribute, to ensure safe embedding of content.

[16:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
how is that confusing?

[16:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you just do what it says you're safe :-)

[16:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
espadrine: What do you mean?

[16:09:00.0000] <espadrine>
TabAtkins: I have to read the spec better...

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
interesting that the guy on hybi says you don't have to pay $500 to participate in IETF meetings

[16:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess next time i attend i'll just decline to pay and see how that goes

[16:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
(not that i've ever attended one so far)

[16:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for me, the bigger barrier is flying to europe for a 3-hour meeting

[16:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
no kidding

[16:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That feels like a plus to me. ^_^

[16:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I like traveling to Europe for vacation, but not for a very short time for nominally work

[16:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
traveling for work is so painful

[16:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
hate hate hate

[16:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
and the TSA is doing its damnest to make flying for vacation hellish too

[16:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
While I remember when flying was easier, I don't find current flying that bad.  I wear sandals, so the stupid shoe thing isn't a problem.

[16:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
for a single 3-hour session, it would probably consume 4 work days for what I'll optimistically call 3 hours of productivity

[16:45:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The only issue I run into is getting my bag searched *every single time* because I carry around a chainmail dice bag.

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
take laptop out. put sandals on belt. put coat on belt. put keys in bag. put credit card in bag. lose half-drunk bottle of juice. spend six minutes putting everything back together.

[16:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
good.

[16:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
i

[16:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
heavens.

[16:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
hate the tsa.

[16:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
all for what? it's just making a soft target and having zero impact on security on planes.

[16:48:06.0000] <Hixie>

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh and nowdays it's also "stand in this machine that puffs air at you" and "stand in this machine that takes a nude picture of you"

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
and we haven't even gotten to the airlines yet, which are trying their hardest to make air travel the least pleasant way to travel ever

What purpose does the _additional allowed character_ serve, while parsing attributes?

[16:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Presumably there's web content that depends on it being an allowed character.

[16:57:00.0000] <espadrine>

what's the use of having DOMContentLoaded bubble? http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=5239&to=5240

[17:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's what browsers do right now.

[17:26:00.0000] <paul_irish>
but it has nowhere to bubble to.. ?

[17:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Document to Window.

[17:28:00.0000] <paul_irish>
indeed. I had been under the misunderstanding that no event bubbled from doc to window

[17:28:01.0000] <paul_irish>
and was wrongggg.

is using window.location.hash more widely supported than document.location.hash?

[23:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or are they pretty much the same and it doesn't matter which I use?

[23:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and was either of them actually specified somewhere prior to HTML5? 

[23:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[23:15:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Window object spec

[23:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
they're the same (literally the same object)

[23:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
HTML5 was the first to specify them as far as I know

[23:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
(the Window object briefly had some stuff take from HTML)

[23:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

soms

[01:20:01.0000] <Cesarino>
hoe zet je in html5 video als background?

[01:20:02.0000] <annevk5>
gewoon dingen eroverheen zetten?

[01:21:00.0000] <Cesarino>
ja

[01:21:01.0000] <Cesarino>
dingen er overheen zetten

[01:21:02.0000] <annevk5>
wel is van CSS gehoord?

[01:21:03.0000] <annevk5>
;)

[01:21:04.0000] <Cesarino>
ja

[01:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
wat is het probleem dan?

[01:22:01.0000] <Cesarino>
ah, heb nog niet geprobeerd, dus gewoon, video als background zetten?

[01:22:02.0000] <Cesarino>
video tag niet gebruiken?

[01:22:03.0000] <annevk5>
ah nee

[01:22:04.0000] <annevk5>
je hebt wel <video> nodig

[01:22:05.0000] <annevk5>
maar je kan er gewoon dingen overheen positioneren op meerdere manieren

[01:23:00.0000] <Cesarino>
ah

[01:23:01.0000] <Cesarino>
en container overheen positioneren?

[01:23:02.0000] <annevk5>
bijvoorbeeld

[01:24:00.0000] <Cesarino>
zal eerst eens testen :-/

[02:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah

[02:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
It suffered a bit from second system syndrome

[02:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
and a lot from having the suckiest UI imaginable

[02:52:00.0000] <Workshiva>
And from not supporting Opera, obviously

[03:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
not quite sure yet, but hybi discussion might be about distributed extensibility!

[03:26:01.0000] <annevk5>
quelle surprise

[03:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
I don't even understand how that would work

[03:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
Unless they are talking about a) non-browser clients

[03:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
or b) extensions made by browsers

[03:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
a) is totally uninteresting

[03:30:00.0000] <annevk5>
to us yes

[03:30:01.0000] <annevk5>
not to them supposedly

[03:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
If you _only_ care about non-browser clients, why do you care about websockets

[03:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
It makes no sense

[03:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Should have named it WebBrowserSockets to avoid ambiguity

[03:31:02.0000] <jgraham>
It makes sense to care about browser + non-browser clients

[03:31:03.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, that has been hixie's argument too

[03:31:04.0000] <Philip`>
WebBrowserJavaScriptSockets, even

[03:31:05.0000] <jgraham>
But I don't see why you make a service that actually didn't work in browsers

[03:32:00.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, apparently if browsers start doing something network infrastructure will let it through too; they hope to make use of that or something

[03:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
(well I guess it would maybe work)

[03:32:02.0000] <annevk5>
at least, I suppose that is the reason otherwise they could just make their own protocol

[03:32:03.0000] <micheil>
websockets currently work as both client and server in node.js :d

[03:35:00.0000] <micheil>
although, admittedly I think how the websocket client is being used within node is kinda wrong though

[08:47:00.0000] <annevk5>

[10:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or do you mean within script?

[10:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That it doesn't

[10:29:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(I've already implemented all of those states once in the Python version, I don't want to do that again…)

[10:29:04.0000] <erlehmann>
within <style>. i use the '>' CSS selector

[10:29:05.0000] <erlehmann>
which breaks if it gets converted to '&gt;'

[10:30:00.0000] <erlehmann>
or is that a browser issue?

[10:30:01.0000] <erlehmann>
any idea how i could handle that?

[10:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
You mean <style>foo &gt; bar {}</style>

[10:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or…?

[10:33:00.0000] <erlehmann>
yes, indeed.

[10:33:01.0000] <erlehmann>
and i thought i could work around that by commenting it out. was i wrong?

[10:34:00.0000] <erlehmann>
(well, obviously, i was. but how wrong exactly?)

[10:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cstyle%3Efoo%20%26gt;%20bar%20{}%3C/style%3E is identical everywhere

[10:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me wishes that rel=noreferrer worked on more things than just <a>.

[10:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me has figured out how to avoid sending a referrer with an <img> by using an iframe pointing to a data: url containing an iframe pointing to the image.

[10:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But that's dumb.

[10:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That's insane

[10:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know!

[10:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't even quite understand why it works - surely the inner iframe would send a unique origin as its referrer?

[10:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I haven't actually tested it to see what value gets sent.

[10:40:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Well, I highly suspect that no value is sent, since it works for the purpose of avoiding referrer-based hotlinking avoidance.)

[10:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Once again, one of Leif's messages starts out dumb but understandable, and then makes a right-turn into incomprehensible.

[10:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Namespacing the <script> element oasf;lgna;dlfj

[10:42:02.0000] <erlehmann>
lolwut

[10:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The issue 41 thread.

[10:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does the proposal that he was talking about say anything about namespacing the script element?

[10:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, it doesn't.

[10:46:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That would be the "right-turn into incomprehensible" part.

[11:13:00.0000] <jarib>
not sure if this is the right place to ask, but i have a question about webidl

[11:13:01.0000] <jarib>
a while back i wrote a ruby webidl parser based on http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#idl-grammar

[11:13:02.0000] <jarib>
since then, it seems like the array type T[] has been introduced without it being reflected in the grammar

[11:14:00.0000] <jarib>
at least i can't spot it

[11:16:00.0000] <jarib>
this seems to be the commit http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2006/webapi/WebIDL/Overview.xml.diff?r1=1.197&r2=1.198&f=h

[11:17:00.0000] <jarib>
if someone can confirm that i'm not just blind, that'd be helpful :)

[11:18:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders, forget everything i said. since even XML processors apparently work fine with unencoded &gt;, I opted for a simple string replacement to make everything fit. :)

[11:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Arghsdlfkj margin-collapse is so complicated.  >_<

[11:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I thought I'd successfully interned all the rules and distilled them into some simple intuitions.  But then dbaron had to go and throw me a new testcase that's all kinds of crazy.

[11:49:00.0000] <dbaron>
TabAtkins, I'm starting to think the way the spec describes things makes them more confusing than needed (and also makes it easy to write ambiguous wording in the spec itself, since saying "margins A and B do not collapse" is ambiguous if there's a possibility of any other margins between them)

[11:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
dbaron: I'm rereading your response to the issue 158 thread, where you were concerned that my simplification of the second bullet point was a normative change.

[11:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can't tell where in the spec any mention is directly made of margins of the children of a self-adjoining element not being included.

[11:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I'm nearly done with my writeup of a resolution to 158 and 178, consisting almost entirely of non-normative notes and informative diagrams.)

[11:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I just want to establish exactly what change, if any, I'm making with the simplification to the second bullet point.)

[11:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Were you referring to the fact that the current second bullet point only makes mention of the block's top margin, not any child margins that may be collapsing with the top margin?

[11:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: <div><span></span></div> if the span has 'clear:both' and there's a float before it? (i may be wrong about that)

[11:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You mean like <float></float><div><span clear></span></div>?

[11:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
something like that

[11:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh shit. Civ V comes out two weeks after I start uni.

[11:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
the span can end up with clearance even though the div would otherwise be self-adjoining?

[11:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know if that's what you mean, this is just a drive-by comment

[11:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Hahaha!

[11:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Hrm.  Implementations appear to not care about that.  The child produces clearance, but then the parent and subsequent siblings of the parent don't pay attention to it.

[11:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
In other words: goddammit.

[11:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i really would just advise you to not bother changing any of this text and just rely on the existing test suites

[11:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, at the very least I need to change the term "these margins" to something that actually makes sense.

[11:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(In the sentence "The amount necessary to make the sum of the following equal to the distance to which these margins collapsed when the hypothetical position was calculated:".)

[11:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
you are not seriously going to make me open the spec and try to page back in all my margin collapsing knowledge. :-P

[12:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
where is that sentence

[12:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I seriously am.  It's your fault in the first place for using a pronoun to refer to some vague set of margins discussed in a pargraph preceding the list itself.

[12:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see it in 8.3.1

[12:00:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
9.5.2, second bullet point.

[12:00:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean, second numbered step.

[12:00:05.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Oh well, I probably won't have any computer capable of playing it at uni anyway. I guess I'm saved. :P

[12:00:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: From what I hear, it runs on computers able to run Civ 4 just fine.

[12:00:07.0000] <Hixie>
it's refering to "the top margin of the element has been collapsed with previous adjacent margins (including the top margin of the parent block).

[12:00:08.0000] <Hixie>
"

[12:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
nothing vague about it

[12:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, I'll clarify that reference.

[12:01:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Now, "previous adjacent margins" there actually means just "adjoining margins, per the rules in 8.5.2", right?

[12:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because margins of children of a self-adjoining clearing element are included in clearance computation.

[12:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
it means the ones before the current one

[12:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
as opposed to any margins after the current one

[12:02:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, but "before" and "after" are both ambiguous when you're dealing with separate levels.  And if "before" doesn't include children, it appears to be wrong per implementations.

[12:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/before/previous/

[12:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
implementations don't get this stuff right

[12:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
ignore the implementations

[12:03:03.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Don't tell me that.

[12:03:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dude, Hixie, as far as I can tell implementations *agree*.  That's wondrous in the first place.

[12:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you're planning on changing the normative meaning of this to match implementations, you're on your own, i'm outta here. I've gone through that pain before!

[12:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not worth it!

[12:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me runs away

[12:04:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haha.

[12:04:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Sorry.  We'll go down in flames together.

[12:04:05.0000] <gsnedders>
In Flames? Good idea.

[12:05:00.0000] <jarib>
any suggestions for what would be the best place to ask my webidl question?

[12:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me puts on Lunar Strain

[12:09:00.0000] <dbaron>
TabAtkins, FWIW, I think the spec *might* be easier to explain if it were described in a form like http://etherpad.mozilla.com:9000/MarginCollapsingSpecRewrite ... though I'm not sure if that big a change in how it's described is worth it

[12:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we're going to rewrite it that much, we should just bite the bullet and convert the text to RFC2119-style at the same time

[12:11:00.0000] <dbaron>
yeah

[12:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
that way at least when we get around to rewriting all of CSS in that style, we'll already have the margin collapsing done!

[12:11:02.0000] <dbaron>
If we were, I would... but I was just prototyping

[12:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
personally i'm still firmly in the "leave it alone" camp

[12:11:04.0000] <dbaron>
That said, almost all of the text I wrote is in the form of definitions, so it really just needs a single MUST at the end ;-)

[12:11:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Agreed.  I'll just make the smallest changes possible for now, and put MUSTifying this section (along with the rest of CSS) on my "medium future project" pile.

[12:11:06.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: yeah

[12:12:00.0000] <dbaron>
One problem with the current spec is that defining things directly in terms of a definition that we have to keep transitive means that we can mess up the transitivity of "collapses with"

[12:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
jarib: There are no good places for WebIDL questions, but here is no worse than any other

[12:12:02.0000] <dbaron>
(which there's at least one broken occurrence of in the current spec, and Tab was close to introducing a second)

[12:13:00.0000] <dbaron>
There are two obvious ways to mess it up: (1) define A collapses with B, B collapses with C, and A does not collapse with C or (2) define A does not collapse with C without saying which of A and C, if any, the margins between them collapse with

[12:20:00.0000] <jarib>
jgraham: heh, ok

[12:21:00.0000] <jarib>
not sure how common it is that things like that get out of sync

[12:22:00.0000] <jarib>
perhaps i'll just write the author directly

[12:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie , dbaron: I can't remember what case triggers the second step.  I know it's relevant when the position of the float is dependent on some margins collapsing, but the clearance uncollapses them and makes the float move upwards.

[13:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Have any mobile browser teams considered auto-collapsing <nav>/<header>/<footer>/etc.?

[13:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems natural to save space, and might encourage more correct author usage.

[13:29:00.0000] <Peter->
<header> usually contains the title of an <article>, that'd result in half-visible pages

[13:29:01.0000] <Peter->
they're not only used on the document-level

[13:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I thought of that, they'd have to specially slurp out <h*> and display that even if the container is collapsed.

[13:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Still sounds like an interesting idea in theory.

[13:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Since boilerplate is a pain to scroll past on a small screen.

[13:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although nowadays, the high-end cell phones have resolutions not much less than full-size monitors, so . . .

[13:30:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least if "the high-end cell phones" is interpreted to mean "the iPhone 4".

[13:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I get annoyed by the .3F every time I see this URL: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F

[13:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wrote a feature to make id's include anything except whitespace, but it broke some browsers, so I didn't enable it by default.  :(

[13:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me tests again

[13:38:00.0000] <erschlafmann>
I am using HTML5 with RDFa. Where is your god now? http://gsoc2010.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/?p=63

[13:38:01.0000] <erschlafmann>
Also, who would be the right person to advise me on that? I suppose it isn't Hixie.

[13:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
You should be generating RDFa5.

[13:40:00.0000] <erschlafmann>
And use Wordpress5?

[13:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
rdfa5 actually exists, though!

[13:40:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://www.xanthir.com/etc/rdfa5.html

[13:42:00.0000] <erschlafmann>
Wasn't that some kind of practical joke?

[13:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Only half!

[13:42:02.0000] <erschlafmann>
Hue hue hue.

[13:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's "ha ha but serious".

[13:43:01.0000] <erschlafmann>
I guess my intermingling of standards will be fine. After all, the markup can be parsed by existing CC tools.

[13:45:00.0000] <erschlafmann>
But, alas, their licenses are still at version 3! They can't keep up.

[13:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Blast it.  I can't get IE support for redirects to my exotic section anchors.

[13:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's the Unicode that's the problem.  Hmm.

[13:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So, any ideas on getting IE to accept redirects to a URL with an anchor that contains Unicode?

[13:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Direct links work.

[13:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it seems to misinterpret the character set of the Redirect header.

[13:55:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which is fair enough, I guess.

[13:55:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
urlencode()ing the fragment causes IE6 to fail completely.

[13:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(even for ASCII punctuation, which it's otherwise okay with)

[13:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe I could stick to ugly anchors for redirects.

[13:58:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Maybe you could drop support for IE6 :P

[13:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wish.

[13:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me hasn't tested all other browsers yet anyway

[13:58:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
My notes say Opera 10.10 fails but Opera 10.50 works.  On the other hand, my notes also say that IE6 works.

[13:58:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
So . . .

[13:59:00.0000] <Workshiva>
It's not that unrealistic, more and more places are dropping IE6

[13:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me bets some of the code has changed in the interim

[14:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Sigh

[14:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
I have clearly not explained myself very well on hybi

[14:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh well, I don't have time to participate more now

[14:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
Probably just as well

[14:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
i'm getting sleepy

[14:13:00.0000] <annevk5>
i have fixed a bunch more XHR tests and noted some of the stuff that was missing

[14:13:01.0000] <annevk5>
one issue with doing everything on this fancy local server is that nobody can see what is happening :/

[14:15:00.0000] <annevk5>
quite surprising how many clarifications made to the specification have not made it into implementations, even though they were requesting it :/

[14:15:01.0000] <annevk5>
guess this will mean some more changes later on

[14:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me will abolish the .3F forever: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/70526

[14:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me just needs to wait till trunk is a bit more stable to upgrade the WHATWG wiki.

[14:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
can someone else explain to roberto about how we look at how people are using technologies to see how to extend technologies?

[14:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
my various attempts don't seem to have conveyed the message properly.

[14:29:00.0000] <annevk5>
maybe tomorrow

[14:29:01.0000] <Workshiva>
AryehGregor: How ironic, my IRC client didn't parse your URL properly

[14:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Workshiva, which URL?

[14:29:03.0000] <Workshiva>
The special:code one

[14:29:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why, the colon?

[14:29:05.0000] <Workshiva>
Yeah

[14:29:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Colons are totally legitimate in the path part.

[14:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
RFC says so.

[14:30:01.0000] <Workshiva>
RFC also says that + is legit in email

[14:30:02.0000] <annevk5>
this hybi stuff is about 50% of my email I think

[14:30:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Fix your IRC client - mine works fine on that link.

[14:30:04.0000] <annevk5>
prolly because nobody cares about HTML5 anymore ;p

[14:30:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyone who refuses to implement the RFC on e-mail for sanity's sake is completely justified, though.

[14:31:00.0000] <Workshiva>
You don't have to implement the specifics, just don't reject non-crazy valid addresses

[14:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
MediaWiki just checks for the presence of "@".

[14:31:02.0000] <Workshiva>
I bet it can all be traced back to some twit who didn't want to allow + because it confused his regexp

[14:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, just some twit saying "meh, what characters have I seen in e-mails before?  Let me just whitelist those."

[14:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What about quoted-string and comments!?

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
What is that internet meme called wherein text is obfuscated using diacritics?

[15:44:00.0000] <boogyman>
Project Muse?

[15:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MUSE is definitely not what i meant

[15:47:00.0000] <hdhoang>
Zalgo?

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
zalgo!!!

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
thank you!

[16:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
where is the change controller for a URI scheme listed?

[16:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.html doesn't seem to list it

[16:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is super-curious what spec Hixie is working on where Zalgo is relevant.

[16:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: who said it was relevant?

[16:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, you claim it'll get enshrined in a spec, at least.

[16:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's a whole different matter

[16:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That's what you say now…


2010-08-06
[17:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know of an online tool to normalise strings?

[17:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
like, nfc normalize?

[17:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, but charlint is available for perl

[17:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
anything available for JS?

[17:29:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not finding anything.

[17:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
henri's validator just says "Text run is not in Unicode Normalization Form C" and doesn't tell me what it should be, which seems less than optimally helpful

[17:31:00.0000] <ttepasse>
Isn't an Unicode-Normalisation part of IDNA? There a JS-Tools for that.

[17:40:00.0000] <boogz>
has the "lh" tag been removed from HTML5?

[17:40:01.0000] <boogz>
anybody know?

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
lh was never in html5

[17:41:01.0000] <boogz>
aw crap

[17:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
Seems it was only ever in HTML 3.0

"User agents can use this in place of the full list when a mechanism is provided to fold and unfold nested lists." - sounds a bit like <details>

[17:45:00.0000] <ttepasse>
Hixie, I remembered I had a small js-script in which there is a String.prototype.toNFC() ... but there was a problem with higher plane chars.

[17:46:00.0000] <ttepasse>
If you're interested, you'll have to reprogramm the script which tranforms the Unicode DB into a JS-Object:

[17:46:01.0000] <ttepasse>
http://gist.github.com/42793

[17:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool, thanks

[17:47:00.0000] <ttepasse>
If I remember correctly the problem is, that JS only allows four hexadecimal chars for Unicode escape codes.

[17:51:00.0000] <micheil>
I really need to remember to setup that whatwg svn mirror of mine on a cron job.

[19:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: In the sentence above the Zalgo example, signed or unsigned integer?

[19:05:00.0000] <cheeser>
you guys are killing me with the websockets updates.  ;)

[19:09:00.0000] <cheeser>
so all websocket frames are now length delimited?

[19:09:01.0000] <cheeser>
and i reading that correctly?

[19:09:02.0000] <cheeser>
s/and/am/

[19:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: fixed

[19:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
cheeser: yeah

[19:10:02.0000] <cheeser>
well, that's nicer actually.

[19:11:00.0000] <cheeser>
that 7-bit encoded length was ... weird.

[19:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Do bugfixes get you in the acknowledgements?

[19:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: you've been in the acknowledgements for a couple of days now

[19:11:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Woo!

[19:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[19:11:05.0000] <cheeser>
so there's no specific frame format for a close frame, yes?  just series of 0 bytes in the frame yes?

[19:12:00.0000] <cheeser>
0xFF { 8 x 0x00 } 0x00 ?

[19:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That *is* the specific frame format.

[19:12:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, 9 x 0x00, I think.

[19:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
cheeser: 0x00 { 8 x 0x00 }

[19:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
cheeser: it's just an empty frame with frame type 0x00

[19:12:05.0000] <cheeser>
right.  so basically there's only one frame type now.  and the closing frame is defined simply by that content, yes?

[19:12:06.0000] <Hixie>
cheeser: (note that text frames are now frame type 0xff)

[19:12:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, there are two frame types.

[19:12:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
0xFF for test, and 0x00 for "closing frame".

[19:12:09.0000] <Hixie>
text

[19:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/test/text/

[19:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
right

[19:13:02.0000] <cheeser>
ok.  let me get caught up on the new doc.  the diffs are harder to read than just rereading the doc again.

[19:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, the diffs are a pain sometimes, especially with major changes like this

[19:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
and on a related note, bummer, i actually went _up_ in total pending e-mails today despite emptying my websockets folder!

[19:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
booo

[19:14:01.0000] <cheeser>
yeah.  but overall it looks like it might be simplifying some of that for me.

[19:14:02.0000] <cheeser>
i'll probably spend tomorrow updating :)

[19:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[19:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i hope we don't have to change it again before v1

[19:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm getting a little nervous about annoying all the early adopters

[19:15:02.0000] <cheeser>
me, too.  ;)

[19:15:03.0000] <cheeser>
i have to present on this in a month.  

[19:16:00.0000] <cheeser>
hrm.  i'll probalby outpace the browser support.

[20:17:00.0000] <boblet>
anyone know of an outliner tool that also shows what content is associated with each title? want to check I understand 4.4.11.4 creating an outline algorithm…

[23:00:00.0000] <annevk5>
so no variable length after all

[23:00:01.0000] <annevk5>
meh

[23:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, I might have missed it but it does not seem to say what happens if there is more data than 64-bit can express

[23:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, at least for sending

[23:23:00.0000] <boblet>
does http://validator.w3.org/ also check HTML5+ARIA? or is that just the beta version + validator.nu?

[23:45:00.0000] <boblet>
for the record validator.w3.org doesn’t flag ARIA values as errors, so I guess so

[00:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: let me know when a browser supports 16 exabyte strings and i'll fix it

[00:19:00.0000] <annevk5>
64-bit is 16 exabyte?

[00:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
what did you think it was?

[00:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
I didn't think much about it to be honest

[00:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
if most websocket messages are going to be short this is quite the waste

[00:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
not really

[00:23:02.0000] <annevk5>
and if most is going to be video/audio different framing will likely be used...

[00:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
IPv4 + TCP is 54 bytes for the headers

[00:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
and additional 9 is nothing

[00:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
an

[00:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
and IPv6 + TCP is 60 bytes

[00:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
so for a 32 byte message, the 7 bytes extra is 7 / (32 + 9 + 54) = 7% overhead

[00:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
(with variable width it'd be ~1%)

[00:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
in practice it makes very little difference unless you think there'll be lots of frames per packet

[00:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
in which case it's easy to work around, make bigger messages :-)

[00:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
but if you can convince the wg, i'll back you up and be happy to change it

[00:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
i just made it fixed length because i couldn't get anyone to agree

[00:27:00.0000] <annevk5>
i don't feel strongly

[00:27:01.0000] <annevk5>
just have a slight preference for no limits

[00:27:02.0000] <annevk5>
at least no theoretical limits

[00:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
but 16 exabyte... well :)

[00:29:00.0000] <annevk5>
"As of May 2009, the size of the World's total Digital content has been roughly estimated to be 500 billion gigabytes, or 500 exabytes."

[00:29:01.0000] <annevk5>
though also

[00:29:02.0000] <annevk5>
"According to an IDC paper sponsored by EMC Corporation, 161 exabytes of data were created in 2006, "3 million times the amount of information contained in all the books ever written," with the number expected to hit 988 exabytes in 2010."

[00:32:00.0000] <annevk5>
seems like it's time to go to the office; no charger :/

[00:37:00.0000] <abarth>
16 exabytes ought to be enough for anybody -- ian hickson, 2010

[00:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't say it'd be enough for anybody

[00:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
quite the contrary

[00:38:00.0000] <abarth>
:)

[00:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
however, i do expect that by the time it's a problem (2040?) that we'll have added fragmentation (about 6 months from now?)

[00:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok so seriously, wtf

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
the wg hums for a fixed width length, i argue for a variable width length and everyone tells me i should just shut up and do what the experts hum

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
so i change it, and now everyone's like "Well really I would prefer variable-width."

[01:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, fwiw, they did not declare consensus on fixed-length fields

[01:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg02964.html says there was "consensus in the room"

[01:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
for what that's worth

[01:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
sorry

[01:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
but anyway, nobody was arguing for variable length but me, and nobody else seemed to care, and some arguments were made in favour of fixed length that seems somewhat compelling so long as the length was big enough

[01:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
so...

[01:21:03.0000] <annevk5>
i hummed against iirc

[01:21:04.0000] <annevk5>
maybe that's in the minutes

[01:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
i wonder how much it's worth trying to correct what has been minuted here

[01:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
easiest solution to avoid getting misminuted: don't attend the meetings

[01:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
meeting some of the people is useful though

[01:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
i used to think so too, but i'm not convinced of that anymore either

[01:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
the technical discussions, mwah, but then the mailing list fulfills that role mostly

[01:24:01.0000] <annevk5>
I'm still young and naive; I guess I'll find out in a couple of years ;p

[01:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
imho the only thing that face to face meetings could be good for is increasing the sense of being a team

[01:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
but if that's the goal, current meetings are an abject failure

[01:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
we should instead have team-building days

[01:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
where we play board games or whatever

[01:27:00.0000] <annevk5>
I've been thinking the same thing to be honest

[01:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
Something like that would be great

[01:28:01.0000] <annevk5>
(I was thinking more of physical games, but anything goes really :))

[01:48:00.0000] <annevk5>
hybi list blargh

[02:27:00.0000] <annevk5>
so genius that TextWrangler notices when stuff happens on the file system

[02:27:01.0000] <annevk5>
on the fly

[02:27:02.0000] <annevk5>
gedit should learn that

[03:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
lol indeed

[03:12:01.0000] <annevk5>
everyone now talks about some kind of variable length with a maximum

[03:12:02.0000] <annevk5>
dave seems right that we're not nearing consensus anytime soon...

[03:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds more like you're continually nearing consensus

[03:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
until you get too close and then it jumps away

[04:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/privatebrowsing.html - "We found that private browsing was more popular at adult web sites than at gift shopping sites and news sites [...] This observation suggests that some browser vendors may be mischaracterizing the primary use of the feature when they describe it as a tool for buying surprise gifts" - gosh! Who'd have thought it?

[04:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
god

[04:52:01.0000] <annevk5>
content-type is a mess

[07:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I seem to be having some problems with Gmail in Webkit nightlies

[07:20:00.0000] <Peter`>
could be the html5 parser, did you try it earlier?

[07:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[07:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
this is without the HTML5 treebuilder

[07:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it was working fine until maybe 3 days ago or so

[07:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I'll try again with the latest nightly

[07:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: That's hilarious. I had to read the paper to check that you weren't making that up

[07:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although it is not clear that their methodology really supports their results

[07:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/results/conclusions/

[07:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me updates to r64816

[07:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
And they lose lots of points for not saying what the error bars on their graph represent

[07:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Peter`: whoah! MathML enabled now too?

[07:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
excellent

[07:31:02.0000] <Peter`>
It doesn't work inline yet, but by default it gets compiled in

[07:32:00.0000] <Peter`>
in nightlies it works as separate files :)

[07:34:00.0000] <Peter`>
http://trac.webkit.org/export/64845/trunk/LayoutTests/mathml/presentation/fractions-vertical-alignment.xhtml

[07:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Peter`: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/html5-hacks-demo.html appears to mostly work

[07:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
though the entities seem to not work

[07:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and excessive spacing around the radical sign

[07:42:00.0000] <Peter`>
I see both the MathML as the SVG, that's cool :)

[07:42:01.0000] <Peter`>
It's probably doctype related, thank you

[07:42:02.0000] <annevk5>
entities haven't landed yet

[07:42:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[07:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what the hell kind of nonsense is &InvisibleTimes; anyway?

[07:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like semantics

[07:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
or maybe it's a space

[07:44:02.0000] <Peter`>
MikeSmith: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2062/index.htm

[07:44:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[07:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
still not clear to me me what the purpose of it is, other than spacing

[07:45:01.0000] <cheeser>
isn't that what &nbsp; is for anyway?

[07:45:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, that's what I was about to say

[07:45:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess it's a semantic no-breaking space

[07:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or a semantic non-breaking non-space

[07:46:01.0000] <Peter`>
Citing the spec: The InvisibleTimes MathML character entity is used here to indicate to a renderer that there are special spacing rules between the 4 and the x, and that the 4 and the x should not be broken onto separate lines.

[07:46:02.0000] <Peter`>
Use of the entity is deprecated now

[07:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Peter`: what should be used instead?

[07:47:01.0000] <Peter`>
<mchar name="InvisibleTimes" />

[07:47:02.0000] <Peter`>
see the paragraph at http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-MathML2-20000328/chapter2.html#N1720

[07:50:00.0000] <Peter`>
Inline MathML should increase its usage a lot 

[07:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I didn't know about mchar

[07:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
srsly?

[07:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
<char name="InvisibleTimes"/>

[07:51:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I know very little about MathML

[07:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/char/mchar/

[07:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
I thought typing &InvisibleTimes; was bad enough

[07:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah well

[07:52:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
named entities that require DTDs were a misguided idea from the beginning

[07:52:04.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: (the srsly was not directed at your ignorance; I shared it)

[07:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[07:53:01.0000] <Peter`>
So did I by the way, I read it on that page

[07:53:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, editors just need a better way to display non-printing characters

[07:53:03.0000] <cheeser>
interesting

[07:53:04.0000] <annevk5>
most do

[07:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
but perhaps not Unicode invisible characters as they are rather uncommon

[07:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe MathML needs to be less finickity about making you put in all the invisible characters

[07:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
non-printing chars are the only good use case I can think of for named character references or named-character-reference equivalents like that mchar thing

[07:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
<mn>4</mn><mi>x</mi> is long enough

[07:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
without having to write

[07:55:02.0000] <jgraham>
<mn>4</mn><mo><mchar name="InviibleTimes"/></mo><mi>x</mi>

[07:55:03.0000] <Workshiva>
<mchar name="InvisibleTimes"/>

[07:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
In LaTeX you write

[07:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
4x

[07:56:02.0000] <Workshiva>
<span hidden>x</span>

[07:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
LaTeX seems to confuse people in cases where they shouldn't have an invisible times between symbols, though

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
They'll write $stuff = 1$ instead of $\mathit{stuff} = 1$ and it'll render like "stu f f = 1" which is extremely irritating for readers who are needlessly pedantic

[08:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
true

[08:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: You're on holiday. Go away.

[08:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
though I suppose that's less of an issue in many mathematical fields since they'll write $ζ = 1$ instead and it's your own fault if you can't remember how to pronounce ζ or mix it up with ξ

[08:03:00.0000] <Peter`>
MikeSmith: Not sure if you're interested in geo/mobile stuff, but DeviceMotionEvent ("previously" Accelerometer) just landed in WebKit :) http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/64845

[08:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
coo

[08:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool

[08:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[08:04:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
dino

[08:04:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I know what he's been working on now

[08:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the event is actually still called DeviceOrientation in http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html

[08:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I guess that name is a known problem

[08:07:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think Safari already has an event with that name

[08:07:03.0000] <annevk5>
what is the actual event name?

[08:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
these sound like event objects

[08:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
DeviceOrientationEvent

[08:08:02.0000] <annevk5>
that's the event object

[08:08:03.0000] <annevk5>
well, hopefully

[08:08:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html#device_orientation_event

[08:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html#accelerometer_event

[08:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[08:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
actually, I just see from Peter` tweet that DeviceMotionEvent seems to be same as AccelerometerEvent

[08:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I have no where to go

[08:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
and Katie is getting her hair cut

[08:16:00.0000] <Peter`>
MikeSmith: apparently the spec is yet to be updated

[08:19:00.0000] <Peter`>
Weekend! :) Talk to you later

[08:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: The park!

[08:34:00.0000] <farious>
!help

[08:35:00.0000] <farious>
Hello

[08:36:00.0000] <erlehmann>
anyone looking at the [embed] in here in IE will notice that IE cannot into HTML5 http://gsoc2010.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/?p=63

[08:36:01.0000] <erlehmann>
it outputs tags like <:figure> and </:figure>

[08:36:02.0000] <erlehmann>
any idea how a could fix that?

[08:39:00.0000] <erlehmann>
needs more remy sharp

[08:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: Do you really want to be putting things like <html><head/> inside the body of your page?

[08:41:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`, NO. thank you.

[08:44:00.0000] <Workshiva>
erlehmann: Isn't that the same problem the shiv is supposed to fix?

[08:44:01.0000] <erlehmann>
Workshiva, that's a different problem.

[08:45:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Workshiva, apparently the shiv creates an unnamed namespace for elements. as you might see using IE7, VIDEO gets serialized correctly.

[08:45:01.0000] <erlehmann>
but if i don't use remy sharps IE shiv, I cannot style the elements

[09:10:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`, thank you. I had assumed some things about HTML5lib::parseFragment() without checking them.

[09:12:00.0000] <cheeser>
can anyone explain to me the "why" of the security header fields in the websocket handshake?

[09:12:01.0000] <cheeser>
it almost makes sense but i feel like i'm missing something.

[10:08:00.0000] <cheeser>
Hixie: can you explain to me, if you have the time, what need the sec keys fill in the websocket handshake?  the spec doc almost makes sense to me but I feel like i'm missing something.

[10:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
cheeser: (I guess Hixie is asleep right now)

[10:21:00.0000] <cheeser>
could be ;)

[10:21:01.0000] <cheeser>
it's not urgent anyway

[12:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
cheeser: mostly they help convince the browser that the server is really a websocket server and not (e.g.) an HTTP server being tricked

[12:28:00.0000] <cheeser>
ok.  but it's necessarily meant to prevent man in the middle attacks, yes?

[12:28:01.0000] <cheeser>
just to make sure the other side really means to handle the websocket request, right?

[12:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
cheeser: the only prevention of man-in-the-middle attacks is TLS

[12:39:00.0000] <cheeser>
right.

[12:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wants TLS+SRP :(

[12:39:02.0000] <cheeser>
that's why it wasn't making much sense to me.  :)

[12:40:00.0000] <cheeser>
thanks, Hixie

[13:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"value" isn't enumerated, how can it be limited to only known values?

[13:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
oops will fix

[13:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is there any particular reason why other enumerated attributes aren't limited to known values, like preload on video/audio?  annevk suggested that all enumerated attributes should be limited to only known values.

[13:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Seems like it would be more consistent, and he didn't think it would break much.

[13:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm happy to change them on a case-by-case basis (especially the new ones will require very little to convince me)

[13:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
send mail or file bugs

[13:56:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll send mail.

[13:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
but name the ones you want changed, don't ask for a default change :-)

[13:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
(if i were to change the default i'd also change all the existing enumerated attributes so it'd have no effect on the spec :-) )

[14:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could just say that an IDL attribute that reflects an enumerated DOM attribute always has the limit-to-known-values behavior, so you can drop the boilerplate "limited to only known values".

[14:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: yeah but then i'd have to have a "not limited to known values", and currently there are more like that than that are limited

[14:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not if you just change all enumerated attributes to be limited to known values.  annevk seemed to think that was a good idea.

[14:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah what i'm saying is that i am not willing to do that without considering each one on a case by case basis, because it's likely that there are compat issues there.

[14:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Presumably unless the implementers are willing to go with it.

[14:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
food time

[14:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, should I report the "value limited to only known values" thing as a bug?

[14:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, is there a listing of all the spec views somewhere?  I want to read the websrt subset.

[14:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/websrt.html

[14:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
danke, Philip`.

[15:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: nah, i fixed it in the source already, it'll be fixed soon

[15:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, k.

Yeah, looks retarded in irssi, since it doesn't do composition.

[15:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's just broken.

[15:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[15:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I just realized that's the technique that this uses.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454

[15:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[15:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, that probably originated the meme.

[15:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe?

[15:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, apparently not.

Dates to 2004, from SomethingAwful.

Everything ever originates from SA or one of the chan.

/me tried Googling some Zalgo text and got a 414, URL too large

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
so someone is arguing that rel=prefetch should be allowed on <a href="">

[15:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
this seems reasonable, since you don't always know what needs prefetching until you get down the page

[15:47:00.0000] <Peter`>
I remember at least two threads about it on whatwg

[15:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. google search might want to say the first hit should be prefetched, but doesn't know the first hit at the time of writing the <head> </head> bit

[15:47:02.0000] <Peter`>
that was one of the rationales given indeed

[15:47:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Yet that opens up getting really large amounts of resources

[15:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
so here's the question:

[15:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
clearly rel=prefetch on <a href="">...</a> doesn't actually change what kind of link relationship it is

[15:47:06.0000] <Hixie>
so do we define that some rel="" types don't define relationships?

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
if so, do we require that <link rel=prefetch> cases also list another keyword?

[15:48:01.0000] <Peter`>
alternative would be @prefetch, like there's @ping too, although it would be inconsistent with <link>

[15:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
You mean "How do we abuse the rel mechanism to do things other than express relationship semantics"?

[15:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
well it has to be rel=prefetch because that's what people do

[15:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: yes

[15:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is it illegal to do <a rel="" href=foo>bar</a>?  (That is, include @rel with an empty list.)

[15:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would we require that <link rel=prefetch> also list another keyword?

[15:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: We realise that our notions are at odds with the real word and so quietly kill them in a corner?

[15:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me checks

[15:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
rel="" (empty) is valid

[15:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then, no, rel=prefetch should be fine by itself.

[15:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i'm trying to kill them, i'm just trying to work out what to put in its place

[15:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: i mean on <link>

[15:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess <link rel=""> (empty) is also valid

[15:50:04.0000] <boblet>
I also like @prefetch, but @prefetch and rel="prefetch" would be bad

[15:50:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't see anything particularly wrong with a <link> that doesn't express a valid relationship.

[15:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
though maybe it shouldn't be

[15:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I just consider <link> to be the url-carrying version of <meta>.

[15:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems highly pointless.

[15:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
just so we're clear, i'm not suggesting we do anything but rel=prefetch, i'm just trying to work out what we should redefine rel="" to be so that that makes sense

[15:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I think what I'm trying to say is that in-practice rel is used to trigger behaviour in UAs

[15:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: well, it means the same as <link rel="bogus" href="...">, assuming bogus isn't recognised

[15:51:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just say it defines various properties of URLs, mostly relations.

[15:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: But saying it badly, like normal? :P

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: not always

[15:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which means nothing, though?

[15:52:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Counter examples?

[15:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: rel=index

[15:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: it just defines a hyperlink

[15:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: the spec currently separates "external resource links" from "hyperlinks"

[15:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: "rel provides additional information about the link it is associated with.  Often, this expresses a particular relationship between the page and the linked resource, but it also sometimes expresses that the UA should treat the link specially."

[15:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Presumably triggers behaviour in some UAs e.g. search engines, browsers with specific support for that

[15:53:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
"presumably"

[15:53:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Meaning, "I don't see why it shouldn't, so I'll assume it does."

[15:53:05.0000] <jgraham>
Well if it doesn't why are people using it?

[15:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why are people doing <script language="javascript">?

[15:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
They must be getting something out of it

[15:54:02.0000] <boblet>
that’s the way they learned to do it

[15:54:03.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe just a misguided sense of their own cleverness

[15:54:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, they're just cargo-culting or assuming someone uses it somehow.

[15:54:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
When maybe no one does.

[15:54:06.0000] <boblet>
yep

[15:54:07.0000] <jgraham>
Well that doesn't sound like behaviour we should encourage

[15:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Obviously not.

[15:55:01.0000] <boblet>
and the spec doesn’t

[15:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: well insofar as any description of semantics causes behaviour, sure

[15:55:03.0000] <boblet>
well, in that case (and <style>) anyhow

[15:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i thought you meant specifically defined behaviour (like rel=stylesheet) as opposed to UA-chosen behaviour based on semantics (like rel=index)

[15:55:05.0000] <jgraham>
Great so define rel as having a funcional effect and then maybe people who have no idea what the functional effect will be will think twice

[15:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Ah

[15:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The unifier for @rel is that it expresses metadata about the linked resource.

[15:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(And maybe the host resource.)

[15:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what sort of crappy webmail client tells you that your session is "invalid or expired" half way through you writing a message

[15:58:02.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: How is "prefetch" metadata about anything?

[15:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
It is purely a hint to enable special UA processing

[15:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[15:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's my problem

[16:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: It's saying "this resource needs to be prefetched".  That's metadata.

[16:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
You could in some sense say it is metadata about the link itself

[16:00:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Horde? :P

[16:00:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: roundcube

[16:00:04.0000] <jgraham>
but not metadata about the resource

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: it's not metadata about the link or the resource, it's a pragma for the user agent regarding (if anything) the _current_ resource

[16:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway if you want a single unifying principle rather than just saying that it can do various different things, rel provides additional information to the UA to enable special processing of the link

[16:03:00.0000] <boblet>
metadata about the author’s desire for how the UA should treat the link

[16:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm, yeah, saying it's metadata about the link itself would work.

[16:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And be applicable to ordinary relations as well.

[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not really even that imho

[16:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Taking it from "this is an unnamed and meaningless link between two resources" to "this link shows the author of the current page".

[16:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
what would you replace "shows the author" with for rel=prefetch?

[16:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
"this is an unnamed and meaningless link" => "this link denotes a resource that should be grabbed now"?

[16:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me retires to his windows machine, where he will set things up so that he can easily refresh all four browsers at once.

[16:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Fucking. Margin. Collapsing.

[16:08:02.0000] <cardona507>
windows machine... shudder

[16:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why only four browsers?

[16:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: that doesn't sound like metadata, it sounds like a pragma :-)

[16:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
becasue chrome is an adequate webkit representative in things like this.

[16:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
True.

[16:09:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: potato, potragma.

[16:10:00.0000] <cardona507>
only 4 browser? what about Sleipnir? :)

[16:10:01.0000] <cardona507>
*browsers

[16:11:00.0000] <boblet>
fwiw most authors would not worry about prefetch being described as a relationship imo

[16:11:01.0000] <boblet>
not that that helps much

[16:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh this is a completely theoretical issue

[16:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
i just want to make sure the spec is internally consistent

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i have "external resource links" (rel=stylesheet), "hyperlink links" (rel=index), what should I call the third kind of link that is rel=prefetch?

[16:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
pragma links

[16:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
trying to avoid the word pragma, since we used it with <meta>

[16:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Why avoid it?  It describes it accurately.  It's just a pragma with a url argument, rather than a string.

[16:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
using the same term for two things in the same spec causes all kinds of hassle

[16:16:02.0000] <boblet>
links to suggest (desired) UA behaviour

[16:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
like searches finding both terms, people getting them confused, search-and-replace messing it up, etc

[16:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
how about "directive links", since pragma is another word for directive

[16:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
...

[16:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was literally typing that just now.

[16:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[16:17:03.0000] <boblet>
much better than my attempt ;(

[16:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, this is somewhat weird.

[16:19:00.0000] <Workshiva>
gsnedders: It would be more like pulling a me, since I'm always not the first person to type the intelligent comment

[16:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What is this expected to alert? data:text/html,<!doctype html><script>var el = document.createElement("form"); el.setAttribute("action", ""); alert(el.action);</script>

[16:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because I've tested in four browsers and they all get it wrong.

[16:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(as far as I'm reading the spec)

[16:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Per spec? I think ""

[16:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that seems right

[16:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Shouldn't it be the resulting absolute URL?

[16:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/urls.html#reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes

[16:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, wait, yeah

[16:23:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Duh

[16:23:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
"If a reflecting IDL attribute is a DOMString attribute whose content attribute is defined to contain a URL, then on getting, the IDL attribute must resolve the value of the content attribute relative to the element and return the resulting absolute URL if that was successful, or the empty string otherwise"

[16:23:06.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm misremembering what @action is

[16:23:07.0000] <gsnedders>
(Like, confusing it with @method)

[16:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chrome dev, Safari 5, Firefox 4, and Opera 10.60 all alert "".

[16:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Confusingly, the same bug exists for some random set of URL attributes in all of them.

[16:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
In Chrome dev it's audio/src, base/href, blockquote/cite, embed/src, form/action, iframe/src, ins/cite, source/src, video/src, video/poster.

[16:24:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But a/href works as expected.  And img/src, etc.

[16:24:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Opera has a different set where it's wrong.

[16:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Safari 5 has a still different set.

[16:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Firefox 4 only has that one, all others behave correctly.

[16:25:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I'm very confused.

[16:25:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(The test I'm using for this is: http://aryeh.name/tmp/html5tests.html)

[16:25:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Not totally sure if all the failures are legit, I'm working through them and filing bugs when I feel like it)

[16:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Feel free to report a bug on Opera and just attach that

[16:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: (Well, you can link to it, but link-rot makes it preferable to have it attached…)

[16:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dammit, there just doesn't appear to be any way to get an empty element to show its position in Opera.

[16:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It refuses to show an outline, won't show a box-shadow with a positive spread, and implements the old version of border-image which can't paint outside the box geometry.

[16:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And the inspector wont' give me lines for its position either.

[16:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, I filed some bugs against Opera before and never got any response, so now I don't bother.  You can use it if you want.  I hope to polish it up and post it to the whatwg and/or submit it as a test to the W3C before the end of the summer, though.

[16:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Please do report it, though

[16:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can report it for me if you want.  I'm tired of reporting bugs and then never seeing anything come from them.

[16:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even IE doesn't do that.

[16:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, http://diveintohtml5.com/ is showing a Chinese-localized version when I try it

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
me too

[16:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe the .com site has nothing to do with Mark

[16:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems likely

[16:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay, I have focus-follows-mouse behavior in w7 now!

[16:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yay!

opera didn't immediately install on my linux box, and i don't have the patience to debug it when it works on windows where i have to do my cross-browser testing anyway, so shrug.

[16:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: You're wrong.

[16:39:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Note: *not* auto-raise.

[16:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Focus-follows-mouse is unquestionably awesome.

[16:39:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.

[16:39:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
But anyway, I have to go now.

[16:39:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
(by the way, I moved my test to a permanent home at http://aryeh.name/tests/reflection.html, you can treat that as a permalink)

[16:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/WebCore/benchmarks/parser/html-parser.html appears to be benchmark for HTML5 parsing. Dunno if you saw that when you were asking before…

[16:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
should <link rel=prefetch media=audio> not preferch if the media is screen?

[16:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
and if so, should the same apply to <a rel=prefetch media=audio>?

[16:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
if so, this is gonna require far more changes

[16:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<link>, sure, <a>, no.

[16:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I don't think there's any precedent for @media doing special things on <a>.)

[16:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rather than do <a rel=prefetch>, why not just <link rel=prefetch> in content?  Parsers'll have to handle that anyway for Microdata.

[16:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
You'll have to duplicate links, but shrug.

[17:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
why not use <a rel=prefetch>?

[17:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So you don't have to answer questions like "What does <a rel=prefetch media=audio> do?".

[17:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's getting the priority of constituencies backwards

[17:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Only insofar as you believe you can come up with an answer that'll make sense for users.

[17:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see why <link> would change the answer's sense-making ability

[17:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
We already know what effect @media has on <link rel=stylesheet>, so it carries over automatically.

[17:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm pretty sure no UA implements that but sure

[17:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
(for rel=prefetch i mean)

[17:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure.

[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
kinda tempted to dump the whole prefetch feature

[17:27:00.0000] <mcarter>
hello

[17:29:00.0000] <mcarter>
quick question about the websocket spec: given code new WebSocket("ws://example.com?") should the user agent include the trailing "?" in the request url?

[17:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: hey, I guess you're the one who wrote the original version of https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Introduction_to_using_XPath_in_JavaScript

[17:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if so, thanks

[17:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's pretty good

[17:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
mcarter: yes

[17:47:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, the spec says "If /url/ has a <query> component, then append a single U+003F QUESTION MARK character (?) to /resource name/, followed by the value of the <query> component.", but "ws://example.com?" has no query component

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
mcarter: i believe it actually does but that basically depends on the definition of the parser which is rather up in the air currently

[17:54:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, hmm, well, the more important question I have then is if the UA should reject the ws connection if the sec-websocket-location header doesn't contain the trailing '?'

[17:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[18:14:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, I've had some issues with existing cgi-derived technology + websocket (like python's wsgi for instance) which doesn't actually give you the full URL, rather it gives you things like QUERY_STRING which is an empty string in either case (trailing '?' or not)

[18:14:01.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, obviously these things can be rewritten; they should just give expose the full request url. Its too bad they were designed like that..

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
in websockets the path and query are all just part of the resource name

[18:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
so that should be less of an issue

[19:38:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, I'm mostly just interested (when its easy) in making websocket servers work, even when they depend on existing HTTP stacks (like eventlet/websocket which uses python wsgi http://bitbucket.org/which_linden/eventlet/src/tip/eventlet/websocket.py )

[20:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
mcarter: simplest solution is to never have a websocket resource with a trailing ?, then the problem never occurs

[20:14:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, oh sure, but that just exposes the constraint to the end-user

[20:15:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, I'm not particularly worried. 

[20:15:01.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, Its just one of those bugs I can imagine popping up once every blue moon, causing someone spending days, confused, trying to fix it

[20:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[20:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
just check for it and raise a warning when you spot it, to make it easy to fix

[20:24:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, sound advice

[20:39:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, well, thats kind of the problem... dunno how to check for it on the server side.

[20:39:01.0000] <mcarter>
short of rewriting the http stack I mean

[22:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
svn.whatwg.org is slow

[23:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
I wonder where I should dump my work on XHR

[23:52:01.0000] <annevk5>
I guess I'll make some more tests first

[00:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
ooh, <meta http-equiv=link> would also mean HTMLMetaElement supporting LinkStyle

[00:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
clearly we should just drop the feature and avoid needless complexity

[00:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
I think I found another bug in XMLHttpRequest

[00:24:01.0000] <annevk5>
http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest/#document-response-entity-body bullet point 2 should say "or" rather than "and", no?

[00:24:02.0000] <annevk5>
it's either null, text/xml, application/xml or ends in +xml

[00:25:00.0000] <aho>
yes

[00:25:01.0000] <aho>
should be or

[00:25:02.0000] <annevk5>
meh

[00:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
i guess after a while nobody reads the document anymore

[01:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me tries his luck

[01:08:01.0000] <annevk5>
will emailing the WHATWG list go faster than filing bugs?

[01:08:02.0000] <annevk5>
we'll find out shortly

[01:15:00.0000] <annevk5>
okay, not shortly

[01:38:00.0000] <nessy>
is there a list admin of whatwg around?

[01:39:00.0000] <nessy>
no worries - I will re-edit the email and re-send

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk5>
that's prolly the easiest

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
making tests for the conditional get requirement was somewhat harder than anticipated

[10:26:00.0000] <erlehmann>
oh, i just found this http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/

[10:26:01.0000] <erlehmann>
who writes it? is there any history behind it or just random trolling?

[10:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: That's the great mystery about it, who writes it. Just random trolling, though.

[10:28:00.0000] <erlehmann>
it's not exactly my kind of humour, though i frequent an imageboard that shall not be named

[10:29:00.0000] <erlehmann>
but there is a class of dumb jokes, where you need specific knowledge to GET it.

[10:30:00.0000] <erlehmann>
it reminds me of the picture of ahmadineschad pointing at the camera with the caption NO U²³⁸

[10:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's a lot less funny than it used to be

[10:30:02.0000] <Workshiva>
It was somewhat clever in the beginning, then it devolved into random insults and profanity

[10:31:00.0000] <Workshiva>
And near the end it almost seemed to include some not-anti-whatwg sentiment, oddly enough

[10:36:00.0000] <erlehmann>
that technique of finding the worst possible photographs of people makes me chuckle

[11:05:00.0000] <erlehmann>
haha, remember that imageboard, whose admin told me that <video> was not ready yet? people are now using GIF to upload porn: http://krautchan.net/board/b/thread/1955067

[11:05:01.0000] <erlehmann>
facepalm

[11:06:00.0000] <erlehmann>
and each "video" uploaded this way is like 3 or 4 mb. for seconds … oh, the humanity.

[11:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: Not even APNG?

[11:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
Surely it'd be better with full 24-bit colour

"Tickets also can have a target milestone, which would be either 4-week or 6-month."

[11:40:01.0000] <Workshiva>
I know I'm a week late, but is hybi really planning another 6 months on websocket?

[12:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Workshiva: The idea (kind of) is that things that are hard to change are fixed in a few weeks in the hope that they are included in {browser}.next releases

[12:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
In six months more complex things can be added

[12:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
As long as they don't affect back-compat

[12:09:02.0000] <jgraham>
Not everyone agrees on all the details though

[12:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
Also it means you don't have to say "no" to people's pet features, you just have to say "six months"

[12:33:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Seems to be a lot "some people were talking at the f2f and decided x, but we aren't going to tell anyone why"

[13:26:00.0000] <Philip`>

Text within a <footer> must also be wrapped in a <p>?

[17:20:00.0000] <aho>
Steve^, nop. but it might be handy to have some extra hook for styling purposes

Aha, Text is flow content

"when in doubt, validate" ;)

[18:13:00.0000] <Steve^>
For example on this section:   http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#e-mail-state   it does not appear to list the actual value for the email state, "email"

[18:14:00.0000] <Steve^>
It is listed in the table above, but it'd be nice to not have to cross-reference

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
"actual value"?

[19:07:00.0000] <Steve^>
The value to go into the type attribute

[02:38:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: in what ways is the websocket protocol spec moving forward from the (what seemed like) a break down in communication between WHATWG and IETF

[02:38:01.0000] <micheil>
?

[02:46:00.0000] <annevk5>
micheil, it's a tad more complicated than that

[02:47:00.0000] <micheil>
okay, explain then

[02:47:01.0000] <annevk5>
heh, could have expected that

[02:47:02.0000] <micheil>
because I'm totally lost at the moment as to what's going on.

[02:47:03.0000] <annevk5>
we're still communicating

[02:48:00.0000] <micheil>
okay, it sounded like there was a break down of communication.

[02:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
I'm not quite sure where it is heading though, but everyone is still there and nobody has been ousted

[02:49:01.0000] <micheil>
okay

[02:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
it's mostly that people have somewhat varied views on how extensibility is to be addressed

[02:50:01.0000] <micheil>
well, are we still going ahead with the draft76 style packet format, or moving towards the VI one?

[02:50:02.0000] <micheil>
erm, Framing Take IV

[02:51:00.0000] <annevk5>
ranging from WG in control to wide-open (and also way more complicated)

[02:51:01.0000] <micheil>
hmm..

[02:51:02.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie changed the framing

[02:51:03.0000] <micheil>
well, from an implementors perspective, using the Framing Take IV is a hell of a lot simpler.

[02:51:04.0000] <micheil>
did he?

[02:51:05.0000] <annevk5>
it now uses 64-bit

[02:52:00.0000] <micheil>
okay, you've lost me there; let me read up on the spec.

[02:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/network.html#protocol-overview

[02:53:01.0000] <annevk5>
frames are now

[02:53:02.0000] <annevk5>
frame-type frame-length data

[02:53:03.0000] <micheil>
one moment, safari's busy crashing trying to load the compelte one :P

[02:53:04.0000] <annevk5>
with frame-length being a length encoded as 8 octets

[02:53:05.0000] <annevk5>
(the above is multipage)

[02:54:00.0000] <micheil>
okay, cool

[02:55:00.0000] <micheil>
so what, is it still using \x00 and \xFF as the start/end delimeters?

[02:56:00.0000] <micheil>
or are we using just a message is frame-length long

[02:56:01.0000] <annevk5>
a message with a type that is frame-length long

[02:57:00.0000] <micheil>
okay, example?

[02:57:01.0000] <annevk5>
they're in the spec?

[02:58:00.0000] <annevk5>
one octet for type (only text and closing supported currently); eight octets for lengths as unsigned 64-bit int; data blob

[02:59:00.0000] <micheil>
so, example packet may be: <0xFF><11><hello world>

[02:59:01.0000] <micheil>
<11> being a big endian  64 bit int

[03:00:00.0000] <micheil>
<hello world> being UTF8 encoded binary data?

[03:00:01.0000] <annevk5>
yes

[03:01:00.0000] <micheil>
okay

[03:01:01.0000] <micheil>
and, if the content was say, binary, it might be something like <0xFE><11><binary data>

[03:02:00.0000] <micheil>
where <binary data> would be 11 bytes of binary data

[03:03:00.0000] <micheil>
(if binary data were to be supported)

[03:03:01.0000] <micheil>
would it make more sense to have one frame-type reserved for metadata, where an example might be:

[03:04:00.0000] <micheil>
<0xF0><13><Encoding=UTF8>

[03:04:01.0000] <micheil>
which would tell the server that the client expects data to be encoded with UTF8 encoding

[03:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
that requires API changes

[03:05:01.0000] <annevk5>
on top of which we do not want to support more than one encoding for text

[03:05:02.0000] <micheil>
(this would be sent onconnect by the client, but could also be sent by calling ws.setEncoding(enc) )

[03:05:03.0000] <micheil>
where enc maybe a DOMString of either: "binary" or "utf8"

[03:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
seems simpler to just have a different frame type

[03:06:01.0000] <micheil>
okay

[03:06:02.0000] <micheil>
that sounds fair enough then

[03:06:03.0000] <micheil>
but then, how do I change between binary and utf8 data?

[03:06:04.0000] <micheil>
(without requiring massive changes)

[03:07:00.0000] <micheil>
I'm thinking that when the server receives that Encoding=UTF8, it will then encode all out-going messages as UTF8 data

[03:07:01.0000] <micheil>
if it receives Encoding=Binary, it will then encode all out-going messages as raw binary data

[03:09:00.0000] <micheil>
because otherwise the server cannot send binary data

[03:09:01.0000] <micheil>
unless you make everything always binary data, and only have the clients decode to utf8 or something

[03:09:02.0000] <micheil>
but that's not a good direction to go

[03:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
once binary support is there the server can do whatever it wants

[03:12:01.0000] <annevk5>
and the javascript library will just handle binary and strings

[03:12:02.0000] <annevk5>
and in the transition period you can tell the server with a simple text message that your client supports binary

[03:12:03.0000] <micheil>
yeah, but if the data coming in on the "message" DOMEvent is UTF8 encoded, then you'd have to do odd stuff

[03:12:04.0000] <annevk5>
from the application layer

[03:13:00.0000] <annevk5>
a different frame type would be exposed differently in the API

[03:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
(maybe not for all future frame types; but binary and strings get their own primitive; but since JS doesn't have one for binary; we're waiting)

[03:14:01.0000] <micheil>
okay, I think it'd make sense to emit just one event "message"

[03:16:00.0000] <micheil>
and then to change the encoding of those message events, you call a client side API of setEncoding("...")

[03:16:01.0000] <annevk5>
no

[03:17:00.0000] <micheil>
okay

[03:17:01.0000] <annevk5>
just like with XMLHttpRequest send() will just be overloaded

[03:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
and the data attribute of the message event will be a ByteArray (or whatever it ends up being) rather than a DOMString

[03:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
(it's of type any after all)

[03:20:00.0000] <micheil>
okay, so inside ws.send's function, it'd be something like: if(typeof data === "string") { send as string } else if(typeof data === "bytearray") { encode to binary }

[03:21:00.0000] <micheil>
would that also mean that the onmessage api would need to do that same, or would it get given the content type?

[03:21:01.0000] <micheil>
eg, server sends a binary message, then a utf8 message, then another binary message

[03:22:00.0000] <micheil>
would the events still be: message, message, message, message

[03:22:01.0000] <micheil>
and would you still get (data) as the arguments to the function call?

[03:22:02.0000] <annevk5>
it would be just message

[03:22:03.0000] <micheil>
or would you get: (data, binary)

[03:22:04.0000] <annevk5>
but data would be of varied type

[03:23:00.0000] <micheil>
okay

[03:24:00.0000] <micheil>
so I'd need to manually check for typeof data

[03:24:01.0000] <annevk5>
you'll always need to do some kind of check; but yes

[03:25:00.0000] <micheil>
okay

[03:25:01.0000] <micheil>
and there's no more usage of that end delimiter format, right?

[03:25:02.0000] <annevk5>
having said all this, nobody has patched their browser implementation just yet

[03:25:03.0000] <micheil>
there's just one packet format, no high or low byte messages or what ever they were?

[03:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
micheil, right (that's not coming back)

[03:26:01.0000] <micheil>
(I'm just wanting to get up to speed)

[03:26:02.0000] <micheil>
I kinda got lost wading through the 200 odd emails in 1 or so days last week

[03:26:03.0000] <annevk5>
well, the binary/text stuff has remained the same; it's just the packaging that's different now

[03:27:00.0000] <annevk5>
from an API point of view nothing really changed

[03:27:01.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, it's kind of crazy

[03:27:02.0000] <micheil>
yeah

[03:27:03.0000] <micheil>
as long as both text and binary share the same actually packaging around them when sent on the wire, I'm cool with that.

[06:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wikipedia is distracting.

[06:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
and writing a complete test suite is hard

[06:12:01.0000] <annevk5>
even "just" for XMLHttpRequest

[09:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me discovers apt-get install pastebinit

[09:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me discovers he is incapable of writing for any period of time now

gsnedders: I'd blame Twitter

[09:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also, IRC)

[09:35:01.0000] <micheil>
the main part is getting into the right mental frame to be able to write.

[09:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
micheil: A length delimited or sential delimited frame?

[09:41:00.0000] <micheil>
>_>

[09:41:01.0000] <micheil>
preferably a length delimited frame

[09:53:00.0000] <Workshiva>
I would prefer sentinel delimited, with the sentinel being "I have nothing more that needs writing"

[09:53:01.0000] <annevk5>
would be nice if dev.w3.org had a favicon

[09:54:00.0000] <micheil>
Workshiva: hmm, that could work

[11:10:00.0000] <hdhoang>
/me encounters a page for which html5 parser is more useful than chromium's \o/ ( http://www.ishmael.org/Education/Writings/ )

[11:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"Note: There will be at least one such element, by definition." — I don't get how there will be.

[11:51:00.0000] <Ms2ger`>
<p class="note">There will be at least one such element, by definition.<!-- (If there wasn't, then this algorithm wouldn't have been invoked by Web IDL.) --></p>

[11:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah

[11:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tries to work out why

[11:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, the "corresponding name property", I think…

[12:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You had a bug on SpiderMonkey about Math.sin varying between x86 and x86-64, no?

[12:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=531915 ?

[12:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yeah, thanks

[12:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Also, if you want more things to test in your canvas test suite, you could take a look at http://codingforums.com/showthread.php?t=198624

No one much seems to have commented on the srcdoc issue.

[13:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/issue-100-objection-poll/

[13:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me has his doubts about whether srcdoc is actually very useful, to be honest

[15:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
seriously tempted to ask if i can use http://alexkessinger.net/story/html5-brief-one-paragraph as the abstract for the spec

[15:35:00.0000] <Steve^>
I notice that the intention is for the UA to replace the content of <time> with a locale-specific form. I think it'd be helpful to have a set format describing how the UA would do this, or else it is difficult to use the value in the right context

[15:36:00.0000] <Steve^>
For example it may be important to the content to stress that a date was on a saturday. So I could do  Saturday <time datetime="2010-08-07">8th August</time>.   But for all I know the UA could convert this to   Saturday Sat 8th Aug 2010

[15:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is a little skeptical of the idea of locale-specific rendering here.

[15:41:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Steve^: Where does it say that?

[15:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, it seems not to?  Good.

[15:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sounds like a bad idea.

[15:42:02.0000] <Steve^>
In the time element text

[15:42:03.0000] <Steve^>
Here is another way that could be marked up. In this example, legacy user agents would say "today", while newer user agents would render the time in a locale-specific manner based on the value of the attribute.

[15:42:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, wait.

[15:42:05.0000] <Steve^>
^ quote

[15:42:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's non-normative.

[15:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What it actually says in normative text is "If the datetime attribute is present, the user agent should convey the attribute's value to the user when rendering the element."

[15:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is unsure whether that's useful.

[15:43:02.0000] <Steve^>
What does non-normative mean?

[15:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Means "not really part of the standard, just meant to help you understand the actual requirements, ignore it if it contradicts normative text".

[15:44:01.0000] <Steve^>
Oh

[15:44:02.0000] <Steve^>
The text I refer to isn't even inside the non-normative "box"

[15:44:03.0000] <Workshiva>
But there seems to be something in the bindings section

[15:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's in <div class="example">, thus non-normative.

[15:45:01.0000] <Workshiva>
When the time binding applies to a time element, the element is expected to render as if it contained text conveying the date (if known), time (if known), and time-zone offset (if known) represented by the element, in the fashion most convenient for the user.

[15:45:02.0000] <Steve^>
I didn't read the code...

[15:46:00.0000] <Steve^>
I'm a little confused now to your opinion on the matter

[15:46:01.0000] <Steve^>
Is the spec right or wrong?

[15:46:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Steve^: It looks like you're right

[15:46:03.0000] <Steve^>
I'm right that it's silly?

[15:47:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Maybe

[15:47:01.0000] <Steve^>
As an aside, this non-normative stuff sounds misleading and shouldn't be in the spec if it's not valid

[15:48:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Well, "a locale-specific way" gives the UA a license to do pretty much anything it wants

[15:49:00.0000] <Steve^>
which is impossible for content authors to predict

[15:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
File a bug.

[15:49:02.0000] <Workshiva>
I think it's one of those problems that won't actually occur

[15:49:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why not?

[15:49:04.0000] <Steve^>
It seems that there are two seperate use cases here: One for text that should be easily cross-referenced to a calendar and the second for showing dates in a locale-specific manner

[15:49:05.0000] <Workshiva>
That UAs will magically all decide on formats that don't include the day of week

[15:50:00.0000] <Steve^>
Sure

[15:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But why do we actually want it to be locale-specific?

[15:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would just be weird.

[15:50:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like a Chinese person seeing dates in Chinese on an otherwise English page?

[15:50:04.0000] <Steve^>
I think these two use cases conflict... with the former I probably want the value of "today" or "Saturday" to persist, with the true date hidden until asked for

[15:51:00.0000] <Workshiva>
AryehGregor: More like "Let the user configure the browser to show a sensible date format instead of that American rubbish"

[15:51:01.0000] <Steve^>
AryehGregor, 10/02/2010 vs 02/10/2010  for 10th Feb

[15:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And if you're trying to guess whether 6/7/2010 refers to June 7 or July 6, you now have to not only take into account whether the site you're on is mainly American or British, but also try to guess whether it used <time>, and if so, what your browser thinks the right order is for you?

[15:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Seems like a recipe for confusion.

[15:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
In the markup, but it could still be ambiguous in the display.

[15:52:01.0000] <Workshiva>
If the user wants it to be

[15:52:02.0000] <Steve^>
hmm

[15:52:03.0000] <Steve^>
I think the likely case is that the display will always be informal

[15:53:00.0000] <Steve^>
But I somewhat agree

[15:53:01.0000] <Steve^>
The first use case is the important one

[15:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which?

[15:53:03.0000] <Steve^>
Calendar integration

[15:53:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes.

[15:53:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also <time pubdate> is nice for search engines.

[15:53:06.0000] <Steve^>
yes

[15:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't think <time> should be displaying stuff differently from what its contents indicate.

[15:54:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Authors can script that if they like, it doesn't need to be on the browser level.

[15:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Alternatively, users could configure their browser to do it via an extension or something.

[15:54:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It shouldn't be mandated by the spec.

[15:54:04.0000] <Steve^>
It would result as <time pubdate datetime="2010-05-25" />  25th May

[15:54:05.0000] <Steve^>
Seperate, to avoid the browser messing with your styles

[15:55:00.0000] <Steve^>
Thus, you can dynamically show "Today", "Yesterday", "25th May"

[15:55:01.0000] <Steve^>
The browser can't decide that for you, but twitter styles feeds would insist on it

[15:57:00.0000] <Steve^>
AryehGregor, I should file a bug in bugzilla?

[15:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, you can use the form at the bottom of the WHATWG version of the spec.

[15:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Post the URL of the bug so I can voice support.

[15:57:03.0000] <Workshiva>
If you want to track the bug, it's better to file manually

[15:57:04.0000] <Workshiva>
That way you get properly registered as reporter

[15:57:05.0000] <Steve^>
What is the different between the two versions?

[15:58:00.0000] <Workshiva>
The spec form is anonymous

[15:58:01.0000] <Steve^>
Ok, http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi ?

[15:58:02.0000] <Steve^>
(Is that the right one for the right spec?)

[15:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah.

cardona507: hey

[17:28:00.0000] <cardona507>
howdy MikeSmith- how r u?

[17:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
doing good

[22:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
someone keeps hammering whatwg.org with a bot that (a) has a bogus User-Agent field and (b) is idiotically implemented

[23:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: what is the bot requesting?

[23:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me hopes it's not some script of his gone awry

[23:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, is that the same bot that was hammering html5.org at some point?

[23:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: the spec, but they're fetching every fragment identifier one after the other as a separate doc

[23:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://wearehugh.com/public/2010/08/html5-video-accessibility/ heh

[23:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway i solved the problem by just having a script monitor my server and if it sees anyone doing that, it bans their IP

[00:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, "registrying"

[00:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks fixed

[00:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
it seems you didn't add the reference WEBLINK

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
it was already there

[00:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
(my build process won't let me forget a reference, it aborts before doing the regen if there are any broken ones)

[00:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm -- http://gregbaker.ca/blog/2010/08/07/p-n-np/

[00:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt the guy was happy with that

[00:17:00.0000] <annevk5>
it would have been more fun if it was the other way around, yes :)

[00:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
no i mean happy that people put it in the public web

[00:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think at this point people would have been dumbfounded if someone found P=NP

[00:45:00.0000] <roc>
P=NP would immediately trigger the singularity

[01:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, it seems Chrome now intentionally disallows XHR with relative URLs in scripts running locally 

[01:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37586

[01:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37586#c4

[01:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
"In order to be more secure (and indeed now the most secure of any browser as you note ;-) Chromium now restricts a local HTML file from reading other local files."

[01:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so you can't test XHR apps locally in Chrome if you're using open() with a relative URL

[01:24:00.0000] <everton>
what's up? ^^

[01:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47416

[01:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47416#c1

[01:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"I know we've had a few vocal complaints, but the volume feels low relative to our millions of users userbase. … do we have a way of quantifying whether people are annoyed enough about a given thing to warrant a change? … I've only seen comments on the bugs and nothing like blogs or news stories or end user complaints in the Chrome user forums." 

[01:31:00.0000] <annevk5>
set up a local Apache server and it works fine :)

[01:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
super

[01:31:02.0000] <annevk5>
testing over file URLs is dangerous anyway because the API works quite different

[01:31:03.0000] <everton>
unforgetable

[01:32:00.0000] <annevk5>
e.g. send() throws rather than returns a 404 for stuff that cannot be found

[01:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: hmm, OK, didn't know that

[01:32:02.0000] <annevk5>
well, your file system is not HTTP :)

[01:32:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, sure

[01:32:04.0000] <annevk5>
imo we should only support ftp/http/https for XHR and extend it if someone provides a use case

[01:33:00.0000] <annevk5>
rather than the somewhat theoretical open ended model that is defined now

[01:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems like that would be fine if all browsers changed to have that same behavior

[01:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
as it stands now, Chrome is the only one that has this restriction

[01:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and the error message it emits for this case is suboptimal

[01:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, dude has a really great strategy there for evaluating how much a particular browser-behavior change is going to screw things up for Web developers: Just make the change, then wait for news stories and blog posts from people pointing out their apps don't work any more when they test them locally

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
is there some kind of "is same Document" method?

[02:22:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Compare the documents?

[02:22:01.0000] <annevk5>
thought it might be fun to have the browser serialize send() stuff the server echoing it back and then the browser parsing again and seeing if stuff is identical

[02:22:02.0000] <annevk5>
aah

[02:22:03.0000] <annevk5>
isSameNode()

[02:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh no

[02:23:01.0000] <Workshiva>
I assume you're looking for structural similarity, not object identity

[02:23:02.0000] <annevk5>
isEqualNode()

[03:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
did Firefox change the way it encodes URLs for XMLHttpRequest recently?

[03:03:01.0000] <annevk5>
it used to force UTF-8

[03:03:02.0000] <annevk5>
now it seems consistent with HTML form submission

[03:03:03.0000] <annevk5>
which is wrong per XMLHttpRequest

[03:03:04.0000] <annevk5>
bah

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
hopefully that can still be fixed as it would be nice to keep the URL encoding madness as restricted as possible

[03:17:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, can you look into that XMLHttpRequest email?

[03:17:01.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, it's blocking a test and I'm feeling impatient ;p

[03:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, is about:blank same-origin?

[03:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
/me checks

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
ah

[03:21:01.0000] <annevk5>
the for URLs section indicates about:blank is non same-origin

[04:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
whatwg.org down?

[04:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds no evidence to the contrary

[04:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
gsnedders, wfm

[04:27:00.0000] <annevk5>
gsnedders, maybe you're blocked by Hixie's script?

[04:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Now wfm

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
these mime advocates...

[04:28:01.0000] <annevk5>
for testing responseText you first need to check the charset parameter; if the type is text/html or XML you need to check per those specs; then check the BOM and finally fallback to UTF-8...

[04:28:02.0000] <annevk5>
just UTF-8 would be so much better

[07:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: you around?

[07:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wanted to ask if it'd be possible to add an option to anolis to cause it to add id attributes to any <a> elements in the source that don't already have an id

[07:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me takes a look at the code

[07:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: I've really not touched Anolis in ages.

[07:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[07:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Apparently wearing makeup will help me get into pubs where you have to be 20 to get in…

[07:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
like war-paint type of makeup?

[07:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I think the word "pink" was mentioned.

[07:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
It was?

[07:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway, I'm not sure the drag queen look is a winner

[07:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Nor am I.

[07:48:03.0000] <cheeser>
does it get you free drinks inside?

[07:48:04.0000] <cheeser>
'cause then it might be...  ;)

[07:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
cheeser: Not relevant if you don't get in.

[07:49:01.0000] <cheeser>
true.

[07:49:02.0000] <cheeser>
though i find such places not worth visiting anyway

[07:50:00.0000] <cheeser>
i just want to drink not make a statement about my social worth.  

[10:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
whatwg.org slow?

[10:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
More like not working at all (the spec specifically).

[10:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chrome automatically suggests the equivalent section of the W3C spec.

[10:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sneaky Google.

[10:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It got the WD, though, not the ED.

[10:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Everything Hixie related is dead I think

[10:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
oh noes :(

[10:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
SSH works.

[10:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
all seems to work for me...

[10:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
just a bit slow

[10:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
someone at opera is hammering the server

[10:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
something to do with the selectors test suite

[11:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me blames gsnedders

[11:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
(no evidence it is him)

[11:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
(apart from a general theory about what is going on)

[11:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, even then it's not my problem…

[11:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But all the people whose problem it would ordinarily be have gone home

[11:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs

[11:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Provided the theory is right)

[11:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: You should put everything on your server into a convenient bundle so we can download it once :)

[11:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd appreciate outside perspectives on my argument with Justin Lebar on the whatwg list.

[11:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which thread is that, Aryeh?

[11:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, the one on resource packages.

[11:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, kk.  I agree with you completely.

[11:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, then say so on the list.  :)

[11:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me feels like the whole resource packages thing could just lead to a world of pain

[11:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, it does seem complicated and error-prone.

[11:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it's about as simple as you can get without requiring server changes . . .

[11:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
and adding complexity like letting the browser choose what to do depending on the cache state or whatever would make it much much worse

[11:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: More or less pain than a world without resource packages?

[11:13:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But there are plausible cases where not letting the browser mix cached copies of things would make resource packages a huge performance *loss*.

[11:13:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Like a more painful world in which some things are slightly faster

[11:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: doesn't matter who agrees with whom on the whatwg list

[11:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: i only consider the arguments

[11:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
e-mails like "i agree" don't even make it to my pile

[11:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, we're talking about a spec edited by Justin Lebar, not you.

[11:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[11:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
then what's it doing on the whatwg list? there aren't any other editors there at the moment :-P

[11:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
(only kidding)

[11:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: If the cases where it can be slower can be predicted by the author in advance it doesn't seem so bad. If the cases don't happen so often it doesn't seem so bad. If the cases are frequent and serious we should probably throw out the whole idea rather than try to add more3 complexity

[11:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, you'll already see inconsistency if the packaged copy doesn't match the real one, so I don't think it's much more complexity to say the caches can be shared.

[11:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd imagine it's less implementation complexity to share the caches.

[11:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
someone e-mailed me asking about the whatwg status annotation password thing (the one that gets sent to you when you log in in the spec)

[11:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't understand the question they were asking so i asked them to clarify

[11:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
what they're askingme is why the firefox beta is not rendering any pages

[11:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
...

[11:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
. . .

[11:29:00.0000] <kbrosnan>
Hixie: point them at http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Ask+a+question

[11:29:01.0000] <kbrosnan>
if you have the time

[11:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
the hybi list went from not wanting a variable-width length to wanting a variable-width length on the basis that saving 7 bytes is critical

[11:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
kbrosnan: too late, but thanks

[11:30:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
...

[11:30:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
ffs

[11:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are a heck of a lot of obsolete elements and attributes.

[11:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
and that list doesn't include obsolete values :-)

[12:31:00.0000] <henrikbjorn>
Hey :p would this https://gist.github.com/076fbf047a23cbfd6c2e be valid as a page footer or is there a better or more correct way ?

[12:42:00.0000] <nimbupani>
henrikbjorn: I think an article would be more appropriate than a section there. 

[12:42:01.0000] <henrikbjorn>
its going to container something like "there is now 2323 people online@

[12:42:02.0000] <henrikbjorn>
"

[12:42:03.0000] <henrikbjorn>
now you say it i think your right

[12:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So it turns out that when you get form.action as an IDL attribute when the DOM attribute is "", there's a reason you get "" instead of the URL being resolved.  Probably a bad reason, though.

[13:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me files a bug

[13:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
In JavaScript, how could I test whether a given exception is a DOMException rather than some other type of exception?  Or is there no way to do that?

[13:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Given Web DOM Core impl: e instanceof DOMException

[13:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't think it's guaranteed under DOM Level 3 Core

[13:54:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It'll do for now.  Thanks.

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me just searched for WedIDL. Obviously he wants to get married.

[13:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm going to a wedding in less than two hours, as it happens.

[13:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, I'm going to three weddings of friends over the course of less than three weeks.

[13:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And there are at least two other people I know who are getting married in the same period, but I'm not going to their weddings.

[13:59:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Jews are apparently very uncreative in deciding when to get married.

[14:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Approximately 50% of people in the world are so uncreative that they get married at exactly the same time as someone else, and in exactly the same place

[14:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
True.  I guess I can't complain.

[14:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me just misspelled WebIDL as WedIDL too

[14:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This gives me an OOM error in the console on Opera . . . o_O http://aryeh.name/tests/reflection.html

[14:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
10.60 on Ubuntu 10.04.  Can anyone reproduce?

[14:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Kind of inconvenient for testing purposes.

[14:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(and yikes, neither Gecko nor WebKit handles numeric IDL attributes anything like what the spec says)

[14:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Urgh, the difference between IDL and [sg]etAttribute with large values is kinda scary.

[14:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I wonder if testing DOMException === e.constructor is supposed to work

[14:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
It feels like it should but I haven't read the relevant specs in detail

[14:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
Works in Gecko, not in Opera and Webkit failed to throw at all in my testcase

[14:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I see the OOM message

[14:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
el.setAttribute(x, y) followed by el.getAttribute(x) should always return (string)y, right?

[14:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There is no way I'm going to file all these Gecko and WebKit bugs individually, that would be crazy.

[14:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: You should turn the tests into a giant smiling face remeniscient of early 90s rave culture. Then vendors will be compelled to fix them

[14:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
without you filing any bugs

[14:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or maybe I'll just submit the tests to the W3C, that might also get their attention (you'd hope).

[14:41:03.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Yes, please do

[14:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was planning to iron them out some more.

[14:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
I can help with that if necessary

[14:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You know, go through all the failures and figure out which of the tests are bad.

[14:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But there are rather a lot of failures by now.

[14:42:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Amazing how everything fell apart when I got to numbers, was doing okay before then.

[14:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me has only filed six bugs so far: http://aryeh.name/tests/bugs_filed.txt

[14:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
Is it me or is your server being slow?

[14:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The page usually doesn't start rendering until the script finishes executing.

[14:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm running the tests inline, not onload.

[14:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: It might be nice to port some of your code to the test harness in the repo so that it is easy to reuse in other contexts

[14:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I think that's probably the problem.

[14:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
What test harness in what repo?

[14:47:03.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: (I meant the git part)

[14:47:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh.

[14:47:05.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: (but I have what I want now so it is fine)

[14:47:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Fast for me.

[14:47:07.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: In the html5 repo

[14:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html/file/f1101b5cbb47/tests/resources/testharness.js

[14:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
That is being reused in some other contexts (e.g. bits of WebApps stuff)

[14:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Looks like it would be easy to port.

[14:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
So it would be nice if one could do assert_{something} to test the properties on interfaces reflect in the expected way

[15:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
all XHR tests use that framework

[15:01:01.0000] <annevk5>
and EventSource too

[15:01:02.0000] <annevk5>
hopefully gonna release XHR tomorrow, not sure about EventSource

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: ok i can register punycoded subdomains again if you still want a one-character variant of c.whatwg.org to go to multipage... what character do you want me to use? c-cedilla you said wasn't convenient? (it's alt-c on mac en-US, but I don't know what's conveinient in your locale and platform)

[15:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what is wrong with "m", really

[15:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or are we expecting a mobile version of the site soon?

[15:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
"d" is also easy to type on a variety of keyboard layouts and operating systems

[15:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
"m" is boring

[15:55:00.0000] <aho>
µ

[15:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: But functional...

[15:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
pah

[15:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
we have two multipage specs, which should "m" go to?

[15:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
If I were going to be less utilitarian in one part of whatwg.org I would not chose the domain names

[15:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
have "a" go to complete/ (standing for "all")

[15:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
I thought the deal was that ordinary spe was whatwg.org/html5

[15:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
anyway I am also open to mc.whatwg.org

[15:57:03.0000] <jgraham>
for multipage complete

[15:58:00.0000] <annevk5>
but really whatwg.org/C wfm

[15:58:01.0000] <annevk5>
also, XHR and HTML5 email?

[15:58:02.0000] <annevk5>
o_O

[15:58:03.0000] <annevk5>
time to get some sleep

[15:58:04.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, left a bunch of comments for you in some other channel

[15:58:05.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, about seven hours ago

[15:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: Replied o them, I think

[15:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
*to

[15:59:02.0000] <jgraham>
But I may have missed osme

[15:59:03.0000] <jgraham>
*some

[15:59:04.0000] <annevk5>
oh, guess I'll see tomorrow then

[15:59:05.0000] <annevk5>
my other laptop has the logs

[15:59:06.0000] <jgraham>
I fixed assert_throws a bit anyway

[16:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
If there was anything else I missed it

[16:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
guess i need to resync with that file tomorrow then


2010-08-10
[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
new record for sending me feedback in awkward ways: e-mailing me a 500KB PDF with the feedback

[17:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
(only two pages, could have been done in about 30 lines in an e-mail)

[17:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Uh, what?  About what?

[17:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
some typos

[17:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wonder what sort of toolchain they employed to produce the PDF.

[17:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I think I'll use it too infrequently to remember the character or the key combination needed to enter it, so I'll probably stick with the boring and sane approach of using a bookmark keyword instead

[17:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
boooriiing

[17:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's good to be boring in this case, because it leaves more time to think about other cases that are more interesting

[17:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
like trying to find a domain name that is meaningful in both its Unicode and Punycode forms

[17:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just use non-ascii vowels, so you have txt spk in the unencoded part.

[17:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And then do some computation to find set of vowels that'll produce something cool in the encoded part.

[18:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Your argument re:<select required> seems inconsistent.  Sure, you can't not submit a value with <select>.  You can't not submit a value with <input type=text> either, though.  If you're being consistent, you either have to say that @required shouldn't apply to <input type=text>, or that submitting the empty string as the value of an <input type=text> doesn't count as "submitting a value".

[18:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can't submit <select> without a value. You can submit <input type=text> without a value.

[18:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
I don't understand the inconsistency.

[18:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
that wasn't the main argument, though, the main argument is "baby steps"

[18:29:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
No you can't.  <form><input name=foo><input type=submit></form> will produce "?foo=".

[18:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's a value - the empty string.

[18:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose you could look at that as having a value

[18:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think most users would :-)

[18:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Take it from a different tack - why do you think that that scenario is materially different from <form><select name=foo><option value="">Hahaha</option></select><input type=submit></form>

[18:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
because there the user has selected "Hahaha"

[18:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
No they haven't.  They've loaded a page and hit submit.

[18:31:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Precisely the same as the previous form.

[18:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And it produces an identical query string - "?foo=".

[18:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think the query string result is relevant here

[18:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
the point i was making was that from the user's point of view, the <select> has a value (Hahaha) whereas the <input> does not (it's empty).

[18:32:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
You have some inscrutable notion of what it means to "submit a value", then, which appears to an outside observer as "I'm making random choices for no good reason".

[18:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In my book, identical behavior producing identical outcomes points pretty strongly to them being similar.

[18:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think if you ask someone who knows nothing about html or forms whether an empty text field has a value, and whether a select box with a "Hahaha" item selected has a value, i am confident they would say the former did not, and the latter did.

[18:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
whether i'm right or wrong here is academic though since as i said, i'm not using this as an argument for anything -- i agree we should add required="" to <select>.

[18:34:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Assume that my example was semi-serious, and the default choice was "Please choose one...".

[18:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
"Please choose one..." should imho be non-conforming as an <option> value.

[18:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Since someone who knew nothing about HTML or forms wouldn't understand that the visible text and the submitted value can be different.)

[18:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i don't see how to make it non-conforming though)

[18:35:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: That opinion makes it impossible to use a dropdown for which there isn't a good default value.

[18:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
sure. just pick the first one.

[18:35:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
...like I just said, that makes it impossible to use a dropdown for which there isn't a good default value.

[18:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's what "real" UIs do (as opposed to the UI disaster that the Web has turned into)

[18:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
"The first one" is the default value by necessity due to how <select> works, not necessarily the actual correct default.

[18:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
show me an Apple-created UI where there's a <select>-equivalent that doesn't default to something valid.

[18:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's not a real argument, Hixie.  If I can't, that could just mean that Apple is only using <select> for things with a decent default value.

[18:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes, because doing otherwise is bad UI :-)

[18:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
however, again, my opinion here is irrelevant, as noted above -- I agree we should add these features to HTML in due course

[18:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
sicking pointed out a good reason to address the issue now, rather than later.

[18:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking works on a browser that hasn't even implemented what we have so far

[18:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
(what was the reason?)

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
(oh, new e-mail)

[18:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me reads

[18:40:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: the person asking for @required is the person implementing validation in firefox

[18:40:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: i.e. mounir

[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
well then he's uniquely positioned to convince me that it's time to add it :-)

[18:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
he need but implement the spec :-)

[18:41:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: it's in patches, waiting for toolkit stuff to land

[18:41:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: we have the whole thing implemented (i.e. validation)

[18:42:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: displaying error messages is the hard part, UI often is

[18:42:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: another reason to do this now is that we have browser vendors focus on this stuff. If we wait it's likely to take much longer to get focus readjusted

[18:43:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: it's like 30 extra minutes to implement @required on <select> if you're already in the code doing all the other validation stuff

[18:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
and placeholder=""

[18:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
and the other stuff people asked for

[18:43:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is surprised it would even take that long.

[18:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
there's tons of stuff in this list of stuff people want in forms

[18:43:05.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: it's weeks worth of work to refocus, implement, add addtional tests, and push out the door

[18:43:06.0000] <Hixie>
it's not like required="" is the only thing we'd be adding in v2

[18:44:00.0000] <sicking>
*shurg*

[18:44:01.0000] <sicking>
there's currently a feature that is 90% finished in the spec. no reason not to add the last 10%

[18:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
i gave the reason, so there's not no reason

[18:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
there might be good reasons to add it now though, such as the compat issue in the e-mail you sent

[18:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
your e-mail is in my list of things to respond to again

[18:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
(man, i don't normally get browser vendors telling me I shouldn't be saying no to feature requests :-P)

[18:57:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: that's not really true, is it. Many of the features originate from browser vendors, no?

[18:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
Many of the ones we add to the spec, yes

[18:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
I reject almost all feature requests.

[19:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
if I didn't, you'd have long stopped paying any attention to me

[19:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: jschuh is saying it would be *way* easier to implement @srcdoc if the URL of the browsing context was a data: url producing the same page.

[19:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(rather than "about:srcdoc".)

[19:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
tell him to send an e-mail saying why

[19:01:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk, he will do.

[19:02:00.0000] <jamesr>
why is it about:srcdoc?

[19:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
wasn't clear what else it should be

[19:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
using data: seems like it would have implications I'm not sure we want

[19:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
but off-hand I can't remember what those are

[19:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, i remember

[19:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
it would lead to all kinds of weirdness with the origin.

[19:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
we might end up having to make sure we defined the origin of data:-from-srcdoc differently from data:-from-elsewhere

[19:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
I wanted to avoid ever having to end up there.

[19:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not necessarily.  We might have to define some reasonably sane behavior for data urls used in an <iframe sandbox=allow-same-origin>, though.

[19:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Right now, I think that <iframe src=data:foo sandbox=allow-same-origin></iframe> is still unique-origin.)

[19:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
not necessarily, no, but it was a danger i figured we should avoid if at all possible

[19:13:00.0000] <Twisol>
If I may ask, what exactly is this channel used for, compared to the mailing list?

[19:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Similar things, just in IRC-sized bites.

[19:13:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: trolling

[19:14:00.0000] <Twisol>
Makes sense.

[19:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, serious ideas here often just get told to send an email to the list.

[19:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
Twisol: this is the water cooler basically

[19:15:02.0000] <Twisol>
Makes sense, sure.

[19:15:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
(So more attention is paid to them, more eyes are on them, and they enter Hixie's response queue.)

[19:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
or the peanut gallery

[19:15:05.0000] <Twisol>
Oh, perfect explanation.

[19:15:06.0000] <Twisol>
Water cooler does it for me

[19:16:00.0000] <Twisol>
And is this just for core HTML5, or does it include other specs like WebSockets?

[19:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
other specs

[19:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's not really any one topic

[19:16:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Mostly anything web-related.

[19:16:04.0000] <Twisol>
Okay, thanks.

[19:16:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[19:16:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Unless the Opera guys are up, in which case it's also anything viking-related.

[19:16:07.0000] <Hixie>
i also like to talk about model railways but everyone else just ignores me :-(

[19:17:00.0000] <Twisol>
Haha :)

[19:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah, http://gavinsharp.com/irc/whatwg.html has the most used words as 1. would, 3. should, and 6. could

[19:18:01.0000] <Twisol|away>
Ha!

[22:46:00.0000] <wirepair>
here's an interesting one...

[22:46:01.0000] <wirepair>
what would cause http://localhost to cause a file to render one way

[22:46:02.0000] <wirepair>
yet http://127.0.0.1 to render differently, in firefox?

[22:47:00.0000] <wirepair>
/me boggles

[22:59:00.0000] <Twisol>
How does it differ? O_o

[23:01:00.0000] <wirepair>
i'm using extjs and the examples are missing borders

[23:01:01.0000] <wirepair>
or the top pixel of widgets is gone

[23:01:02.0000] <wirepair>
it's the same exact code, but if i type in http://127.0.0.1 it renders just fine

[23:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: are you referring to anything by hostname, which could trigger cross-origin checks?

[23:32:00.0000] <Twisol>
localhost is just a local hostname alias (it's in /etc/hosts on my computer), so that's definitely possible...

[00:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
gah

[00:11:01.0000] <annevk5>
http auth is terrible

[00:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, you just introduced "Theh"

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
bummer.

[00:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[00:45:00.0000] <annevk5>
can someone run http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/584 in Internet Explorer?

[00:45:01.0000] <annevk5>
bonus points for IE9

[01:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
got results from Peter`

[01:22:01.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10326

[01:59:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk5, does WebKit support document.width?

[01:59:01.0000] <annevk5>
I think so

[02:04:00.0000] <Peter`>
Ms2ger: yes

[02:04:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
Thanks

[02:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
:/

[02:05:01.0000] <Peter`>
annevk: you weren't really conclusive..

[02:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
just annoying that they copied it

[02:06:01.0000] <annevk5>
it's not in IE / Opera

[02:43:00.0000] <annevk5>
ah crap

[02:43:01.0000] <annevk5>
HTML5 does not actually define in detail how to serialize XML documents

[02:45:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Sounds like something for XML5

[02:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Ms2ger: nice play :)

[02:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
i see what you did there ;p

[02:49:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
Seriously though, I think that would be a better place to spec it

[02:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
if anyone was serious about putting XML5 in a browser I would

[02:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Maybe you sohuld just spec XML5 to be what people are willing to implement?

[02:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I hear that works well.

[02:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well XML serialization could be a different spec

[02:52:01.0000] <annevk5>
could be in a web dom core

[02:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
there's not even basic support in browsers for createDocument

[02:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
document.implementation.createDocument(null,null,null) does not give an empty document :/

[02:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Is that not an illegal hierarchy?

[02:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: Web DOM Core? hahah

[02:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
a

[02:56:00.0000] <annevk5>
gsnedders, rtfs

[02:56:01.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, it's gonna happen

[02:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk5: No, it's easier to ask here.

[02:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk5: And who is going to write it?

[02:57:01.0000] <annevk5>
me maybe, xhr is more or less done now

[02:57:02.0000] <annevk5>
would be nice to work on something non-networked

[03:00:00.0000] <annevk5>
but really if you can't even rely on createDocument to work how am I supposed to test all this :/

[03:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
maybe do a request first to get a document via responseXML

[03:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
would also make it easier to test the crappy encoding requirement i guess

[08:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
Ms2ger++

[10:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: "There is the question of what to do for e.g. the <canvas> tests that use a different harness." - change them to use the same harness, perhaps?

[11:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sigh.  Getting nerd-sniped by Leif.

[11:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Under what conceivable definition of "legacy" could "is compatible with ASCII" be construed as making something more legacy?

[11:06:00.0000] <Workshiva>
In a world where everyone uses UTF-16

[11:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Granted.

[11:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Luckily, we don't live in such a world.

[11:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me kinda wishes we lived in a utf-32 world, which is just like the ascii world only 4 times the size.

[11:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The spec doesn't define any special behavior for <iframe src=data:foo sandbox=allow-same-origin/>, does it?  The iframe is still cross-origin, since data urls are unique-origin by default?

[11:15:00.0000] <erlehmann>
remysharp, can you help me with something IE-related? it seems your IE fix for new HTML5 element styling creates some kind of null namespace, which makes innerHTML then return something like <:figure></:figure>

[11:16:00.0000] <erlehmann>
any way to fix that short of simple and ugly string manipulation?

[11:16:01.0000] <remysharp>
I probably can't help - only because I'm about to head out - but do you have a live example? i.e. in something like jsbin.com?

[11:17:00.0000] <erlehmann>
remysharp, that plugin i created for GSoC is active at this page and generates the <figure> http://gsoc2010.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/?p=63

[11:18:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Click on the embed button, receive markup.

[11:19:00.0000] <remysharp>
okay, I'm starting up windows. That said, I'm pretty sure I'm going to say: It's because innerHTML is fucked in IE when it comes to unknown elements...

[11:22:00.0000] <erlehmann>
well, you may notice that the <video> element gets copied without that kind of null namespace

[11:22:01.0000] <erlehmann>
hmmm, is there a way to temporarily reverse the IE styling fix?

[11:24:00.0000] <erlehmann>
remysharp, the video has an embed button too now.

[11:25:00.0000] <remysharp>
a regex :)

[11:25:01.0000] <remysharp>
so which IE? IE9? /hopefully...

[11:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: data: URLs aren't cross-origin by default

[11:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
They're not?  I was sure they were unique-origin, and were special-cased to be same-origin in some places.  Is it the other way around?

[11:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
depends on implementation at the moment. See the WHATWG spec for details.

[11:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
urgh, which part?

[11:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
i forget

[11:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
try origin

[11:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
or search for "data:"

[11:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
"For Document objects and images... if a Document or image was obtained in some other manner (e.g. a data: URL typed in by the user...) The origin is a globally unique identifier."

[11:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The other references to data: are to a redirect to a data:, and a data: found in another Document.

[11:37:00.0000] <Ms3ger>
TabAtkins, surely that would be elem.dataset.jwBitrate

[11:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ms3ger: (a) yeah, I'm dumb.  dataset, not data.  (b) ah, I didn't realize it converted dashes to camelcase.

[11:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
ooh, an Ms3ger!

[11:39:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
Where?

[11:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
d'oh

[11:40:00.0000] <remysharp>
erlehmann: sorry dude, my time is up - gotta leave - fusion was running slow.

[11:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Ah, no, here's the relevant line: "If url does not use a server-based naming authority, or if parsing url failed, or if url is not an absolute URL, then return a new globally unique identifier."

[11:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Doesn't that mean that data: urls are unique-origin by default?

[11:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
i thought there was a line about when you navigated to a data: URL

[11:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks

[11:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
If a Document or image was generated from a data: URL found in another Document or in a script

[11:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
The origin is the origin of the Document or script that initiated the navigation to that URL.

[11:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
(which by the way means the origin of the Document isn't the same as the origin of its URL)

[11:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, I was *totally* misreading that line.

[11:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't understand what you mean by "isn't the same", though, Hixie, unless you're referring to some of the stranger special-cases that can affect the origin of the original document.

[11:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sigh.  Never mind.  I got it.

[11:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean the URL itself (the string that starts data:...) has an origin, and that origin isn't the same as the origin of the Document object (whose URL is data:...)

[11:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The url itself is unique-origin.  The Document created by following the url or using it in an iframe is the origin of the including document.

[11:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
the origin of the url is generally only used to see if something is going to be cross-origin, after that it's rarely used if at all

[12:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
you have _got_ to love the w3c's spirit of cooperation: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Aug/0099.html

[12:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Top-posting, too.  Terrible.

[12:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Can you come up with a spec the W3C publishes where it's already not the change controller?)

[12:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Are you volunteering? :)

[12:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone have any suggestion of where to go in Scotland for a few days?

[12:55:00.0000] <cheeser>
i loved Glasgow

[12:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I was thinking more of the in-the-middle-of-nowhere places

[12:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Also: I'm living in Glasgow for at least the next four years)

[12:56:02.0000] <cheeser>
ha!  fair enough.

[12:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(And don't suggest St Andrews either, I've lived there for 17)

[12:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: The caledonian canal is nice

[12:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or go up to skye or somewhere

[12:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I was thinking of Skye, somewhere around the Great Glen, or maybe following the Great Highland Way from Glen Coe up to Fort William

[13:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(I'd be tempted to do the entirity of the Great Highland Way, but that takes longer than I want, really)

[13:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
… or maybe Mull… meh. I do'nt know.

[13:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
Whisky tasting in islay? 

[13:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Heh. My sister was trying to convince me of that.

[13:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But really, does that seem my sort of thing?

[13:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
Umm

[13:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether to make another (6th today) cup of tea…

[13:41:00.0000] <Workshiva>
You're such a brit

[14:20:00.0000] <annevk5>
haha ms3er :p

[14:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
euh ms3ger

[14:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: what i find especially galling is that what i originally proposed is that both organisations be joint change controllers

[14:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: but w3c is like "no, i think we just want ultimate control"

[14:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
because, you know, the w3c has shown how incredibly good they are at maintaining HTML

[14:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
so it makes lots of sense that we'd have the W3C as sole change controller

[14:21:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
In practice, does it matter who the change controller is?

[14:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
this is such a non debate

[14:22:01.0000] <annevk5>
finding a way to get rid of IANA would be more productive

[14:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: apparently not since as far as i can tell it's impossible to actually register MIME types

[14:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
also, didn't we recently learn that "change controller" has no meaning at all?

[14:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then why not just drop the issue and give them their token victory?

[14:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Registries

[14:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: also true

[14:23:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
No one will know or care who the change controller is.

[14:23:05.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: it

[14:23:06.0000] <Hixie>
er

[14:23:07.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: it's the principle of the thing :-)

[14:23:08.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, one step ahead of me :)

[14:23:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
Better to save energy and political capital to push for more WHATWG influence in things that actually matter, like stuff authors might see (related to the specs themselves, say).

[14:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Being stubborn because of the principle of the thing is not a wise strategy unless you don't want any concessions from the other party at all, which is not the case here.

[14:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
being stubborn makes sense when you're not getting any concessions though

[14:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
which we're not as far as i can tell

[14:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, you should be generous so that you can stockpile a list of times when you were generous when you actually want to ask for concessions.

[14:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We're getting plenty of concessions from the W3C's point of view, given that their point of view is we shouldn't exist.

[14:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
name one

[14:28:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(speaking in generalities here)

[14:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Having any mention of the WHATWG in the W3C version of the spec?

[14:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
name one thing that has actually been done counter to what the w3c want, which the w3c could have done differently

[14:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
they couldn't not have a mention of the WHATWG in the W3C version, I'd just stop editing.

[14:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Thus you've forced that concession from them.

[14:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Still a concession.

[14:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Are such ultimatums benefical to the spec?

[14:29:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is not convinced they are

[14:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
at this point i don't see much advantage to having the w3c spec at all

[14:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Every time someone says "change controller" I think of the fat controller

[14:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[14:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, if your goal is to increase friction between the W3C and WHATWG until the status quo is no longer tenable, you aren't doing a terrible job of it, but it would be nice if we could get that over with more quickly instead of having it drag on for years.

[14:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
I really don't think this issue is worth getting upset over

[14:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
MIME types are mostly useless and ignored on the internet at the best of times

[14:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not really getting upset over it, i just think the w3c is being assinine

[14:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
w3c staff, that is

[14:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
What it says in some field that almost no one knows exists on the registration form for a type is really quite irrelevant

[14:33:00.0000] <annevk5>
fwiw, I doubt W3C Members would disagree with the W3C Team here

[14:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: unless it ever gets actually registered, in which case if the w3c once again dropped the ball on html, we'd be stuck unable to update the registration

[14:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does it matter?

[14:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
at least in theory, though as anne pointed out, (a) apparently they ignore that field when they feel like it and (b) apparently it's impossible to register types anyway in practice

[14:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, can't you just let the registration be wrong?

[14:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: then people like Julian will argue with you about what software will do, and e.g. servers like Apache won't update their configurations to match reality.

[14:34:04.0000] <Steve^>
Question: If I use <address> outside of an article, then my document must have a body element?

[14:34:05.0000] <nessy>
or supercede it

[14:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
Steve^: all documents must have <body> elements (though the <Body> tag itself can be omitted, it's implied)

[14:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: So the problem scenario here is a) IANA gets its shit together enough that it is registered as W3C, b) W3C stops working on HTML and c) IANA (or someone) then refuses to do (something) with future non W3C revisions of HTML even if they are the ones that have implementations

[14:35:02.0000] <Steve^>
ah of course, thanks

[14:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: right, something which has already happened (except (c) happened by default because they just stopped having their shit together)

[14:37:01.0000] <hober>
the way I see it, the change controller issue is simply a proxy issue for "who is ultimately in charge here"

[14:38:00.0000] <hober>
becuase, as has been mentioned, the iana process doesn't really matter

[14:39:00.0000] <hober>
so by pushing resolution on this issue, which isn't actually harming anyone by leaving it the way it is, people push toward an ultimate settlement of which organization is ultimately responsible for html

[14:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[14:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
and clearly the w3c shouldn't be the only such organisation

[14:41:00.0000] <hober>
if you have any interest in a (***WIKITRAP***) historical analogy, I think this is a pretty good fit: http://edward.oconnor.cx/2007/12/the-third-dail

[14:41:01.0000] <Steve^>
I see that address must be inside flow content, that's certainly not what I expected

[14:42:00.0000] <annevk5>
joint change controller would make sense to me too, maybe plh hadn't considered that

[14:42:01.0000] <annevk5>
could be that he missed it

[14:43:00.0000] <annevk5>
but if the W3C wants sole ownership that doesn't seem really bad either; it wasn't a problem in 2004 and there's no reason it will be in the future

[14:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
how was it not a problem in 2004?

[14:45:00.0000] <hober>
it wasn't a problem pre-2001 or so

[14:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
pre-2001 the w3c hadn't given up on html yet

[14:46:00.0000] <hober>
indeed

[14:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, it didn't stop (de facto) updates to the media type

[14:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes it did

[14:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: From the W3C's point of view it is an understandable position to take. It is not clear that the W3C clearly understands where it adds value so it tries to protect all the obvious written evidence of it being important and in control

[14:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Should someone point out the possibility of co-sponsorship to plh on the list?

[14:50:03.0000] <annevk5>
I guess you care more about IANA correctness than I do

[14:50:04.0000] <jgraham>
(I think the W3C does add value to be clear)

[14:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: people are _still_ arguing that you can send XHTML 1.1 as text/html

[14:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: understandable, yes. reasonable, no.

[14:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i never said i didn't understand it :-)

[14:51:02.0000] <annevk5>
that seems kind of irrespective of who is the change controller though

[14:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
just that it was inane

[14:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
that is more a case of people-like-arguing

[14:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: maybe. hard to tell since they haven't been accepting any registrations (E.g. SVG still isn't registered, ten years later)

[14:52:02.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, I lost faith in IANA a long time ago

[14:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: You could try addressing the underlying issues then. It is not clear to me that W3C have any reason to back down from their position

[14:53:01.0000] <annevk5>
and the IETF process that mostly guards it

[14:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: underlying issue to what?

[14:53:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Why they want to assert ownership when the question arises

[14:53:04.0000] <jgraham>
assuming they are not happy with joint ownership

[14:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: what do you think the underlying issue is?

[14:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I said above

[14:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
that they only add the patent policy as value?

[14:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
isn't that up to them to fix?

[14:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see why it'd be our role to shore up the w3c's relevance

[14:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really see any need for standards organisations to exist, frankly

[14:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: That they percieve that having joint ownership or non-ownership would represent a substantive value-loss to their members

[14:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
we just need some patent reform and we could replace the whole edifice (w3c, ietf, whatwg, etc) with just some public mailing lists and version control repos for each spec

[14:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i have no idea how we would address that usefully

[14:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Nor do I, but I would not expect them to back down unless you can

[14:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't expect them to back down either

[14:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
So if you can't, given that the relevance of the issue rests on the basis of a bunch of hypotheticals that can be effectively controlled, it doesn't seem worth spending any time on

[14:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
Just concede and move on

[14:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
who's spending any time on it?

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't done anything since rejecting the bug, as far as i can tell

[14:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
In particular I don't expect it to be so easy for W3C to drop the ball on HTML again. They did that experiment and it failed

[14:59:02.0000] <jgraham>
People won't forget that

[14:59:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: (you are, now)

[14:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
ranting on irc doesn't count as spending time on something :-)

[14:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
i'm busy in other windows doing real work :-)

[15:02:00.0000] <annevk5>
"Messaging API" and "Web Messaging"

[15:02:01.0000] <annevk5>
gonna be confusing

[15:02:02.0000] <annevk5>
http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/messaging/ vs http://dev.w3.org/html5/postmsg/

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: i assume dap/messaging isn't intended for the web

[15:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
since giving web pages access to the sms backend on a phone is pretty crazy

[15:06:00.0000] <abarth>
all of dap is pretty crazy

[15:06:01.0000] <annevk5>
yeah dunno; never get really concrete answers when I ask such things

[15:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
abarth, you might wanna add the "user:password" (userinfo) production to things to look at for URL handling (apparently IE still does not handle them for HTTP, but other browsers do, and HTTPbis obsoletes it...)

[15:08:01.0000] <abarth>
there's two questions:

[15:08:02.0000] <abarth>
1) how to parse

[15:08:03.0000] <abarth>
2) what to do with the parsed URL

[15:09:00.0000] <abarth>
do you mean (1) or (2)?

[15:11:00.0000] <llrcombs>
/me drops his sense of logic

[15:11:01.0000] <llrcombs>
so what's cooking?

[15:11:02.0000] <abarth>
IANA registries, apparently

[15:16:00.0000] <llrcombs>
I meant in HTML5

[15:16:01.0000] <llrcombs>
but that works too

[15:16:02.0000] <annevk5>
abarth, I think this would affect 1, at least as far as IE is concerned and where we may or may not want to align

[15:17:00.0000] <llrcombs>
lolIE

[15:17:01.0000] <llrcombs>
sorry]

[15:17:02.0000] <llrcombs>
had to say that

[15:22:00.0000] <abarth>
annevk5: ok, i have test cases for parsing userinfo.  i check to see what IE does.  my impression is that they parse it fine by then canonicalize it away or hide it in the UI

[15:22:01.0000] <annevk5>
abarth, oh, so they simply ignore it

[15:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: re your mail -- in practice, the only positions that matter are implementors

[15:23:01.0000] <annevk5>
abarth, see also http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10326 (XHR bug)

[15:23:02.0000] <abarth>
annevk5: that's my recollection, but i haven't dug back into it yet

[15:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
abarth, there's no rush really btw; though since you're here, how is the URL coming along?

[15:24:01.0000] <abarth>
i have a couple test suites and a lot of data

[15:24:02.0000] <abarth>
i need to crunch the data though :)

[15:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, you make the final decision, even if you have no real choice in some cases.

[15:25:01.0000] <abarth>
generally, IE likes to canonicalize more than FF

[15:25:02.0000] <abarth>
parsing seems largely consistent

[15:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: does one make a decision when one has no choice?

[15:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you have a choice, just other people's opinions might in some cases make all but one choice clearly stupid.  You still have to decide not to be stupid.  :)

[15:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, you do make the decision in a lot of cases, anytime implementers don't express a unified enough opinion.

[15:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure, but my decisions are powerless unless the implementors then agree that they were the right decisions

[15:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Likewise, the decisions of the President of the United States are powerless unless various government officials decide to help enforce them.  Power that's dependent on other people's cooperation is still power, just not absolute power.

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway my point was just that it wasn't so much that i have "decided" to include srcdoc="" in the WHATWG HTML spec regardless of what the W3C HTML WG decides, so much as that is the only choice that isn't, as you put it, stupid

[15:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
so insofar as that is a decision it's rather a hollow one

[15:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was really only saying that I have no say, more than that you do have a say.

[15:30:02.0000] <Steve^>
actually, the President has certain executive privileges

[15:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: i will grant you that in practice i could exert influence more easily than you, but given the way i work in practice we probably both have about as much influence on the spec

[15:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: but granted, that's because i've decided to work in a way that makes that the case

[15:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
and one could imagine that i could change that decision, though i doubt i'd remain editor for long if i did :-)

[15:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, that's not even slightly true.  You have complete power up until the point that an implementer is dissatisfied enough to say they won't implement what you say.  That's a *lot* of influence.

[15:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(and you have even more power when implementers are irrelevant, like authoring conformance requirements)

[15:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Mostly, implementers will implement whatever you say unless they think it's a bad idea for some specific reason.  You therefore have total freedom to choose from all ideas that implementers don't think are particularly bad.

[15:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
if i were to ignore feedback, sure

[15:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
all the decisions i make are based on what data and arguments people (including myself) can find and put forward

[15:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But no feedback happens if you could have done things some other way but didn't, unless someone else happens to think the other way is particularly superior.

[15:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which is only going to happen in a small minority of cases.

[15:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are zillions of things you could have done differently without raising disagreement.  Including a lot of fairly significant things, probably.

[15:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
so if everyone else would have made the same decision i have the power to make the decision unimpeded? that's even more hollow! :-)

[15:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
but sure

[15:34:03.0000] <Twisol>
Unrelated question: In your opinion, is it worthwhile to try to support both WebSockets -76 and -75, or would it be more reasonable to wait until a later revision?

[15:34:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, other people would have made a different decision.  They just don't care enough about the difference to mention it.

[15:34:05.0000] <Hixie>
Twisol: both -75 and -76 are obsolete

[15:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(or they don't bother thinking about it, since they don't have to make the decision)

[15:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: fair enough

[15:35:02.0000] <Twisol>
Oh, really? Where's the most recent draft?

[15:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: i think you undersell your ability to effect change on the spec though

[15:35:04.0000] <Steve^>
If you give people an answer they are more likely to go with it, if you got everyone to think separately beforehand, won't the best answer appear from lack of bias?

[15:35:05.0000] <annevk5>
Twisol, whatwg.org/C#network or some such

[15:35:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I didn't say I have no influence, just that I have no more influence than anyone else.  At least, beyond my ability to make more convincing arguments.

[15:35:07.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-socket-protocol/ or http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/network.html#websocket-protocol if you prefer an HTML version

[15:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wrong person.  :)

[15:36:01.0000] <Twisol>
;)

[15:36:02.0000] <Twisol>
Thanks, much appreciated.

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
er, yeah, Twisol|away, what I said to AryehGregor :-)

[15:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone got IE? what does it alert on https://bug-19967-attachments.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=60491 ?

[15:53:00.0000] <abarth>
/me boots a vm

[15:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
string,string,string

[15:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
in IE8 on W&

[15:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE6 in ies4linux says string,string,string.

[15:54:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
7

[15:54:04.0000] <llrcombs>
same with WK

[15:54:05.0000] <llrcombs>
string,string,string

[15:54:06.0000] <Hixie>
thanks!!

[15:55:00.0000] <llrcombs>
anyone know if HTML5 <video> will eventually do playlists?

[15:55:01.0000] <llrcombs>
or will that always be a task for JS?

[15:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think that's noted as a v2 feature?

[15:55:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Really?

[15:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
llrcombs: no plans to add that support so far, but it's occasionally requested

[15:55:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
That seems like it should be left up to JS, no?

[15:55:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is wrong, apparently.

[15:55:07.0000] <Hixie>
"v2" in the spec just means people requested it

[15:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
not that we'll definitely add it

[15:56:01.0000] <llrcombs>
so I'll pencil you in for a "maybe"

[15:59:00.0000] <annevk5>
what is a fun test

[15:59:01.0000] <annevk5>
s/what/that/ doh

[16:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is very annoyed at Opera's OOM error on http://aryeh.name/tests/reflection.html, since it means he only has two browsers to look for spec/test bugs in, not three.

[16:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Uh… Okay. That's weird.

[16:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, it is.

[16:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also annoying.

[16:38:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd be okay with a workaround if you can come up with one.

[16:38:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It first happened a couple of days ago, when I did some refactoring.

[16:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess I know what I'm doing tomorrow…

[16:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dunno what caused the problem, but if you want to investigate, you can look in the git history to find which one first triggered it.

[16:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
s/tomorrow/later today/

[16:39:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(I mean, I have a bunch of interns helping with the other thing I'm doing, so…)

[16:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Urgh, damn you untrusted certificates.

[16:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me doesn't want to try and resolve this.

[16:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, never mind, turned out easy.

[16:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Have you seen anything about window.parent being readonly causing site-compat problems?

[16:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(like, in any feedback sent on the spec)

[16:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
sounds vaguely familiar

[16:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't recall specifics, if any

[16:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[16:58:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I'll try and remmeber to send an email tomorrow


2010-08-11
[17:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
for the record, i meant "of the implementations" where i said "of the spec" in the e-mail i just sent. oops.

[17:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is supposed to alert "3000000000", right?  Because that's in range for an unsigned long?  Because it doesn't in any browser.  data:text/html,<!doctype html><input size=3000000000><script>alert(document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0].size);</script>

[17:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(at least not that I tested)

[17:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
what does it alert?

[17:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
0 in Gecko and WebKit, 2^32 - 1 in Opera.

[17:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
UAs are allowed to apply arbitrary limits for ridiculous input, maybe they're applying that rule

[17:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
or maybe they're just not implementing the spec :-)

[17:05:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Uh, Opera makes it bigger

[17:05:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Er, I meant 2^31 - 1.

[17:05:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
For Opera.

[17:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah

[17:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So it's like it's treating it as signed and capping it.

[17:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Opera's signing it, yeah.

[17:06:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
This doesn't seem ridiculous at all, it's within the stated bounds for the type.

[17:06:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm filing a Firefox bug, but I feel happier filing a bug if other browsers are correct.

[17:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
a text field big enough for 3000000000 characters is ridiculous. :-)

[17:06:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Otherwise we'd want to consider a spec change instead.

[17:06:07.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders why it's signed if nothing else

[17:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Not if I'm writing out a large video in binary by hand!

[17:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I thought the clause is that implementations are allowed to do arbitrary stuff when there are resource limits, not just randomly because they feel like it's ridiculous.

[17:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: true, what was i thinking! :-P

[17:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Gecko and WebKit seem to agree on returning 0 in this case.  WebKit is much crazier in other cases, though.

[17:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't understand what WebKit is doing at all

[17:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: If they try and allocate a string of that length for the text input, that's 44GiB

[17:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think WebKit is just parsing unsigned integers wrong.

[17:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: I guess that's a hardware limitation :)

[17:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, I didn't even add the element to a document.

[17:09:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Pure JS test there.

[17:09:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, my original test didn't.

[17:09:06.0000] <gsnedders>
(Though presumably this can't be happening, if Opera still goes for 2^31-1

[17:09:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
The one I just posted did.

[17:45:00.0000] <erlehmann>
>0 in Gecko and WebKit, 2^32 - 1 in Opera.

[17:45:01.0000] <erlehmann>
That's a pretty big implementation difference ;)

[17:51:00.0000] <erlehmann>
even weirder, for data:text/html,<!doctype html><input size=2147483647><script>alert(document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0].size);</script> webkit creates a tiny input field, hehe.

[17:51:01.0000] <erlehmann>
with data:text/html,<!doctype html><input size=247483647><script>alert(document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0].size);</script> it is huge in the vertical dimension …

[17:52:00.0000] <erlehmann>
but apparently at my computer (using epiphany) the webkit canvas ends at about 60% width, hahaha

[21:34:02.0000] <a-ja>
Hixie: ^^^

[21:34:03.0000] <llrcombs>
personally, I preface !! every time I call it

[21:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
llrcombs: what canPlayType situation?

[21:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
a-ja: looking

[21:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
a-ja: not sure what i should be looking at

[21:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
a-ja: what's the question?

[21:36:00.0000] <llrcombs>
it returns: "", "maybe", or "probably"

[21:36:01.0000] <llrcombs>
gimmie true/false

[21:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
llrcombs: we don't know true/false.

[21:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
llrcombs: we know "definitely not", "i don't know", and "try me"

[21:36:04.0000] <a-ja>
example output in spec implies "required", but it's not coded that way

[21:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
a-ja: how does it imply that?

[21:37:01.0000] <llrcombs>
so stop not knowing and tell me "try me" or "definitely not"

[21:37:02.0000] <a-ja>
2nd line: You cannot complete this form until the field is correct.

[21:38:00.0000] <llrcombs>
or go for true/false/filenotfound

[21:39:00.0000] <a-ja>
Hixie: basically....should title be shown when there's a pattern, or validation error msg, or both?

[21:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
llrcombs: unfortunately that's not how media frameworks work

[21:40:01.0000] <llrcombs>
well... :(

[21:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
llrcombs: and changing those is somewhat out of scope for the spec

[21:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
llrcombs: but if you can get them all to change, i'll be glad to change the spec to match

[21:41:00.0000] <llrcombs>
/me has found that, in practice, every time I've used !!document.createElement("video").canPlayType("video/video_format") and it's returned true, the format's been playable in my browser

[21:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
a-ja: i've tried to clarify the examine a little, but not sure how to make it much better

[21:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
a-ja: i'm no UI expert :-)

[21:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
a-ja: title="" with pattern="" can be shown whenever the user agent thinks the user needs to know about the pattern

[21:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
llrcombs: the ideal situation is for us to not need canPlayType at all

[21:44:01.0000] <a-ja>
k....will have a looksee

[21:44:02.0000] <llrcombs>
Hixie: agreed

[21:44:03.0000] <llrcombs>
but Apple/Google/Mozilla will never agree to support every format people use

[21:44:04.0000] <llrcombs>
and M$ won't even agree with itself

[21:44:05.0000] <Hixie>
Google and Mozilla have agreed on a format

[21:44:06.0000] <Hixie>
now go convince apple :-)

[21:45:00.0000] <llrcombs>
what, WebM?

[21:45:01.0000] <llrcombs>
/me puts another bug in RADAR

[21:46:00.0000] <jamesr>
what i want is document.createElement("img").canDisplayType("image/apng")

[21:46:01.0000] <llrcombs>
lol

[21:47:00.0000] <llrcombs>
if a browser can't display a PNG, it's made of fail

[21:47:01.0000] <llrcombs>
same if it returns maybe

[21:47:02.0000] <roc>
APNG

[21:47:03.0000] <jamesr>
APNG is less common

[21:47:04.0000] <llrcombs>
ohwait

[21:47:05.0000] <llrcombs>
you mean APNG

[21:47:06.0000] <jamesr>
the idea is still retarded :P

[21:47:07.0000] <llrcombs>
my bad

[21:47:08.0000] <llrcombs>
not strictly

[21:47:09.0000] <llrcombs>
that's actually valid

[21:48:00.0000] <jamesr>
it's strictly valid the same way as canPlayType, but it's still pretty dumb

[21:48:01.0000] <llrcombs>
animated PNG, right?

[21:48:02.0000] <llrcombs>
/me is getting a non-bouncing beachball @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Animated_PNG_example_bouncing_beach_ball.png

[21:48:03.0000] <llrcombs>
/me files a WebKit bug

[21:48:04.0000] <llrcombs>
PNG > GIF, so I wants APNG support

[21:51:00.0000] <jamesr>
the point is nobody would do that. they just figure out what image format works everywhere and use that

[21:51:01.0000] <jamesr>
APNG doesn't work everywhere so nobody uses it

[21:51:02.0000] <jamesr>
video should be the same way

[21:52:00.0000] <llrcombs>
but no one format works everywhere

[21:52:01.0000] <llrcombs>
so we have workarounds

[21:52:02.0000] <llrcombs>
remember when IE borked some image formats?

[21:52:03.0000] <jamesr>
and the solution is to get apple/microsoft to support webm

[21:52:04.0000] <llrcombs>
/me just filed a QuickTime bug report

[21:52:05.0000] <llrcombs>
for WebM support

[21:53:00.0000] <llrcombs>
as for MS, well...

[21:53:01.0000] <llrcombs>
they're so far from standard as-is

[21:53:02.0000] <llrcombs>
what formats does <video> support for IE9?

[21:57:00.0000] <llrcombs>
ahh

[21:57:01.0000] <llrcombs>
H.264-only

[21:57:02.0000] <llrcombs>
a good format in itself, but closed!

[21:58:00.0000] <llrcombs>
maybe apple will pull out some magic dust and open-sourcify H264 to try to compete with Google

[22:01:00.0000] <a-ja>
iirc, ms has said they'll support webm in ie9 *IF* you already have the codec on your system

[22:02:00.0000] <llrcombs>
same way Safari works

[22:02:01.0000] <llrcombs>
it supports QT's builtin codecs

[22:02:02.0000] <llrcombs>
and then whatever you add (I support FLV, AVI, and OGG)

[22:15:00.0000] <a-ja>
Hixie: guess that change clarifies a wee bit more.  I see that the pattern/title being displayed is a may rather than a should or must in any event

[00:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
so is per 2.2 in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawman#Reasoning Sam Ruby's email also a straw man?

[00:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
communication would work better :/

[01:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
aah

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk5>
TextWrangler does not recognize svn move

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, i keep having problems with this canvas e-mail i'm writing

[01:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've already lost the entire e-mail once

[02:22:00.0000] <B1OS>
is it possible to 'send' an audio track to a html5 player without placing it inside the <audio> tags?

[02:22:01.0000] <B1OS>
so i would click an mp3 file thats outside of the <audio> tag and it will play, somehow, in the player...

[02:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
if I understand what you mean that'd be possible using some scripting

[02:27:00.0000] <B1OS>
i'll give it a try and post back

[02:29:00.0000] <B1OS>
because the mp3 files will be a directory listing using php

[02:31:00.0000] <B1OS>
like this: http://tjn.no-ip.org/music1 and there will just be a single html5 player in the header

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
so wtf

[03:04:01.0000] <annevk5>
is greg proposing changing the framing or not?

[03:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
his message to me made it seem like he was not, but the last paragraph in his latest makes it seem like he does

[03:05:01.0000] <annevk5>
blargh

[03:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
"Can you post a summary?" "I will refrain from reiterating the detail here"

[03:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
Huh?

[03:07:02.0000] <jgraham>
Summary implies "no detail"

[05:44:00.0000] <annevk5>
euh, so now issues can be opened because a bug has not been replied to?

[05:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me asks

[05:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
I recall people attempting to do that with some issues before. It sucks that some people lack patience, but they still shouldn't be able to do that

[08:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders why an editorial issue like issue-109 is considered significant enough for even having a poll

[08:37:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Because it's less work for the chairs to put up a poll than handle the fallout of refusing? :P

[08:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe we should have a competition to try and get the most trivial issue possible taken to a poll

[08:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although I think Julian already won

[08:41:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Tabs vs spaces for indentation in markup examples, go

[08:41:03.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know, the wording of a heading seems significantly more trivial than the ascii reference.

[08:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Well I thought that, but > 0 people will read the heading title

[08:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if he can make it an Issue that Hixie edits in emacs not Vi

[08:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie does edit in Emacs already.

[08:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yes, that is the Issue

[08:43:01.0000] <Workshiva>
He should alternate between editors

[08:43:02.0000] <Workshiva>
That's the only way to reach consensus

[08:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
History shows that it's okay to rely on a single editor, as long as there's a token appearance from another editor from another organisation to assuage people's fears that the first editor will monopolise the process

[08:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
then you can drop the second editor after a couple of years when nobody cares any more

[08:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
So I suggest the issue could be resolved by just using Vi for a little bit and then switching back to Emacs for all the serious work

[08:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's not possible to use vi for a little bit; it takes a lot of concerted effort just wo work out how to insert a character

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if it's bad to use Opera's bug wizard when he's too lazy to figure out how to use the proper BTS entry form

[08:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Not really, unless you want to do something you can't do with the bug wizard like CC someone

[08:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I'm not really sure it's less of a mess

[11:44:00.0000] <annevk5>
we appreciate all your bug entries :)

[11:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
time to land some xhr tests and make everyone cry

[12:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
ah damn

[12:04:01.0000] <annevk5>
Philip`, how did you configure hg again to push?

[12:04:02.0000] <annevk5>
it was something simple but I forgot :/

[12:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk5: Do you mean configuring the username/password?

[12:05:01.0000] <annevk5>
yeah

[12:05:02.0000] <annevk5>
not the ui bit, but the actual bit that matters

[12:05:03.0000] <Philip`>
[auth]

[12:05:04.0000] <Philip`>
w3c.prefix = dvcs.w3.org/hg/

[12:05:05.0000] <Philip`>
w3c.username = ...

[12:05:06.0000] <Philip`>
w3c.password = ...

[12:05:07.0000] <Philip`>
That bit?

[12:05:08.0000] <annevk5>
yay

[12:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
Philip`, that should get read from repository/.hg/hgrc as well no?

[12:09:00.0000] <annevk5>
aah, https

[12:09:01.0000] <annevk5>
doh

[12:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
I expect it should

[12:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
how do you set a default repository to pull and push from?

[12:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
[paths]

[12:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
default = https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html/

[12:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
in the .hg/hgrc

[12:13:03.0000] <annevk5>
i should write a blog post on this too

[12:13:04.0000] <annevk5>
this is the second time I needed this info and couldn't find it in the IRC logs

[12:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
You heard of Google, right :)

[12:14:01.0000] <annevk5>
ah yeah, and then I can put the [auth] / [ui] stuff in a higher level .hgrc

[12:14:02.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, didn't help

[12:24:00.0000] <henrikbjorn>
Hey i have a question about header (the page header) and multiple nav elements. I have two main navigation parts on my site. One being a sections like "News, Gallery" etc. and the other being a based on the choice of section "submenu". would a <header><nav /><nav /></header> be the solution or a <nav> with to <ul /> in it ?

[12:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, people shouldn't use the world "halting problem" for things that aren't the halting problem.  It confuses my brain.

[12:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
henrikbjorn: Don't overthink it.  Just wrap your navigations blocks in <nav>, and place them where it feels appropriate.

[12:33:01.0000] <henrikbjorn>
so one nav with two lists?

[12:34:00.0000] <henrikbjorn>
cant seem to understand if its valid or not by the spec

[12:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
One <nav> with two <ul>s is fine, or two <nav>s with their own <ul>.  Whichever.

[12:35:00.0000] <henrikbjorn>
okay thanks :)

[13:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In Paper's email on the datatime <input> thread, anyone know what is meant by "Christian/Hebrew (Sun–Sat, no splits), US (Sun–Sat, splits)".  I don't know what a "split" is or how the US and Christain calendars differ.

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-day_week#Week_numbering

[13:50:01.0000] <aho>
TabAtkins, in some calendars the weeks starts with so - in others with mo

[13:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Sounds like it might mean whether the first week is split across two years

[13:50:03.0000] <Philip`>
or whether the first week always starts on 1 Jan

[13:50:04.0000] <aho>
eh... su :>

[13:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
aho: Nah, that's referring to a different distinction (which he makes between another calendar system running Mon-Sun).

[13:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: That makes sense.

[13:51:02.0000] <aho>
i'd like a more logical calendar... 13 months with 4 weeks each... and one extra day (or 2) :>

[13:51:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, 13 months of 28 days is horrible.

[13:51:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
You want 12 months of 30 days, with 5/6 intercalary days.

[13:51:05.0000] <aho>
why? would you miss quarters that much?

[13:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, I just hate 13 and 28.  They're very bad numbers for mental math.

[13:52:01.0000] <aho>
well... the first of each months is a monday

[13:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
tantek has a great calendar scheme up on his site.

[13:52:03.0000] <aho>
and so on

[13:52:04.0000] <aho>
would make things a lot easier

[13:52:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh yeah, in the 12/30 calendar, each week is 5 days.

[13:52:06.0000] <Philip`>
Regular calendar systems are boring, because your birthday would be on the same day every year

[13:52:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
So every month starts on Monday too.

[13:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
so some people would be stuck on weekdays and some on weekends

[13:53:01.0000] <aho>
3 days work, 2 days weekend... sound great to me

[13:53:02.0000] <aho>
;D

[13:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
which wouldn't be fair

[13:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
aho: It's not *quite* as good as it sounds, since you have more weeks.  But that's is a good bit more weekend.  To get close to the current weekend amount, you can do alternating 3/4 day workweeks.

[13:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, just adopt the convention that birthdays are all celebrated on some fixed day of the week.  Like Monday holidays.

[13:57:00.0000] <aho>
while we're at it... something regular for time would be nice too (no timezones) :>

[13:58:00.0000] <aho>
sorta like swatch beats

[13:58:01.0000] <aho>
i really liked that idea

[13:58:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Check out www.xanthir.com

[13:58:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me loves beats.

[13:58:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me just wishes they'd standardized on GMT, rather than GMT+1.

[13:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<3 millidays.

[13:59:01.0000] <aho>
heh

[13:59:02.0000] <aho>
(i see ripped mario sprites...) :>

[14:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
We need to get a group of people to agree on how we should redesign dates and times and timezones in an ideal world, and then get one member of the group to become a world dictator who can force everyone to adopt the new system

[14:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Otherwise it's just going to be a waste of effort :-(

[14:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
aho: You should see the current time in beats, written on the hill.

[14:00:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And yes, ripped mario sprites.

[14:00:04.0000] <aho>
ISO 8601 is nice http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601

[14:00:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Agreed.

[14:00:06.0000] <aho>
(the date formatting part)

[14:00:07.0000] <aho>
@879 it is :)

[14:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Honestly, who needs more than 90s resolution in the base value?  Not me.  And decimal beats are just fine for when you do.

[14:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: no leap seconds or other ridiculousness.  The length of a beat naturally changes with the length of a day.

[14:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Variable-length time units sound fun when you're trying to do any kind of precise measurements of anything

[14:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's what seconds are for.

[14:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
where by "fun" I mean "terrible"

[14:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
So we've got to have two independent time units, and remember how to translate between them?

[14:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, though switching between them should rarely be necessary in casual contexts.

[14:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
where the translation depends on continually-updated observations of the earth's rotation so you can't even write a static algorithm for it?

[14:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And in any case, we still keep the timestamp, which requires similar translation already.

[14:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
People are lazy and will write software that uses the same units internally as it uses on its UI, and if the human-readable UI units are something crazy then that'll infect the internals of the software too and cause all sorts of bugs

[14:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Might as well make the conversion somewhat harder so people will just store dates using timestamps anyway.  Yay!

[14:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Converting from timestamp -> current human-readable time is roughly equivalent to converting from timestamp -> millidays.

[14:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(In other words, pretending that we currently keep time with seconds is silly in the first place.  We keep time with a mixed-radix system based on both days (and composites of such) and seconds (and composites of such).  Converting from seconds-based time to days-and-seconds-based time is approximately equally difficult to just converting from seconds-based to days-based.)

[14:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(At least, for computers.  For humans, 1 beat is about 100 seconds (roughly 15% off, but close enough for casual work).  That's easier to do mentally than juggling multiples of 60 and 24.)

[16:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE9PP4 is a real trainwreck on my reflection tests, compared to any other browser I've tested.  Except maybe Opera, but Opera doesn't work on it anymore.  (Any progress, gsnedders?)

[16:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I mean, Opera doesn't work on the test, it gives some crazy JS error)

[16:24:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
pp4 is doing plenty of weird js things, I've found.

[16:24:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
apparently [].indexOf doesn't exist in it at the moment.

[16:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is it easier to write cross-browser JS than with previous IE versions, though?

[16:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
My tests don't even run in IE8.

[16:25:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least they complete in IE9PP4.

[16:25:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
No clue yet.  I don't write cross-browser js.

[16:25:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
You just use jQuery?

[16:25:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I either target decent browsers, or write jquery.

[16:25:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh.

[16:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Looks like IE9 will still be an odd duck, but way less than ever before.

[16:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Didn't have time to look

[16:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I doubt I'll ever have the patience to track down all its errors on my reflection tests, though.

[16:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Uh, if that was true nothing would work

[16:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Like, jQuery would be totally b0rked

[16:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm doing it for WebKit and Gecko, but IE is way more failures.

[16:27:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Hey, that's the error it gives me when I try to run my manufactoria emulator.

[16:27:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me goes to duplicate it, to be sure.

[16:27:05.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Odd

[16:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
...

[16:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I must be crazy.  It works just fine now.

[16:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Totally.

[16:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Still wont' animate SVG, but at least the presence of an animation no longer does weird scaling things.

[18:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly it was too much to hope for, that a decision on longdesc would let us move on from discussing it

[18:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, yeah.  I expected an email like that.

[18:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And now, of course, foliot claims he'll file a FO on it.

[04:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: The OOM is caused by trying to create a 2^32 - 1 square canvas.

[04:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Every other browser seems to lazily create the canvas, we don't.

[04:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: If you add it to the document, I think every browser will hit OOM.

[04:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thought most browsers had upper limits on the size (like 10000^2 or something)

[04:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe fail silently?

[04:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: (and seeming my computer doesn't have (2^32-1)^2 * 4 bytes of RAM, you're way off into impl-specific hardware limitations)

[05:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(you'd nee 64 EiB)

[05:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*need

[05:14:00.0000] <roc>
hey

[05:14:01.0000] <roc>
think data compression

[05:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
roc: But you can't have the entire thing compressed, as then when you change a single pixel you'd have to uncompress the entire canvas, no?

[05:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(and there goes all semblance of performance)

[05:33:01.0000] <roc>
depends on the scheme

[05:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
So you vary scheme based upon canvas size?

[05:33:03.0000] <roc>
in principle you could store an entire list of vector operations in the canvas and storage would be totally resolution independent

[05:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Gah, that's not what I mean at all

[05:34:01.0000] <roc>
but I'm not all that serious

[05:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
In this case it may just be down to how soon you allocate the pixel buffer

[05:34:03.0000] <roc>
actually a fairly reasonable optimization that browsers could do is cap the internal canvas buffer size and just downscale as needed

[05:36:00.0000] <roc>
that would be quite easy to implement and work pretty well in memory constrained situations

[05:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
You don't need physical memory for the parts you're not drawing onto, you just need virtual address space, so you could wait for 66-bit architectures and then allocate the entire (2^32-1)^2 bitmap at once

[05:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So setting the IDL attribute doesn't cause us to allocate the buffer, but setting the content attribute does

[05:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That's totally untrue

[05:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Remembering to save makes a difference :)

[05:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
We allocate when setting width/height, other browsers don't.

[05:54:00.0000] <cheeser>
is there a public svn/git/hg repo where the spec docs are kept?

[05:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
cheeser: http://svn.whatwg.org/webapps/

[05:56:00.0000] <cheeser>
grazie

[05:57:00.0000] <cheeser>
and the websocket spec is in there somewhere?

[05:58:00.0000] <cheeser>
ah.  section 10.3 of complete.html

[05:59:00.0000] <cheeser>
this is pretty different text than http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-socket-protocol/

[07:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
where in CSS does it state that absolute positioning happens against the padding box origin of the containing block?

[07:19:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Is it the padding or the containing box you care about?

[07:20:00.0000] <annevk5>
the padding box of the containing box

[07:20:01.0000] <annevk5>
it states absolute positioning happens against the containing block; but the containing block consists of several boxes, margin box, border box, padding box, content box

[07:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
it is not at all detailed on where the box is positioned against in most pieces of the text I read so far

[07:22:00.0000] <Workshiva>
As far as I can see it doesn't state anything on that level, it simply states that the containing box is the nearest positioned ancestor, rather than the direct parent

[07:22:01.0000] <Workshiva>
So you'd use the same box you would normally

[07:22:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
What made you think it would be detailed?

[07:22:03.0000] <annevk5>
Ms2ger, don't make me -- you ;p

[07:23:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
:)

[07:23:01.0000] <annevk5>
Workshiva, that would be against the origin of the content box, but I think that is not what happens

[07:23:02.0000] <annevk5>
/me make a better test

[07:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
see http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/588

[07:26:01.0000] <annevk5>
maybe this was already an open issue

[07:26:02.0000] <annevk5>
/me checks that

[07:37:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Hmm

[07:39:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Looks like it uses the padding box, yeah

[07:41:00.0000] <Workshiva>
"Note: For absolutely positioned elements whose containing block is based on a block-level element, the percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the padding box of that element."

[07:41:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Part of the spec seems to be aware of it

[07:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
"""The stack of open elements cannot have both a td and a th element in table scope at the same time, nor can it have neither when the insertion mode is "in cell"."""

[07:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
That is wrong in the fragment case, no?

[07:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
That is if you do tdElement.innerHTML then you will have neither <td> nor <th> in table scope

[08:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
so it is defined people

[08:09:00.0000] <annevk5>
bert bos to the recsue :)

svn up

[08:19:01.0000] <davidhund>
woops. :-/

[08:55:00.0000] <annevk5>
changed offsetTop/offsetLeft per longstanding emails on the subject

[08:56:00.0000] <annevk5>
apparently I cannot email outside of Opera until after midnight here (someone hit a cable close to Opera HQ o_O) but the change is comitted

[08:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
I guess I should now change the terminology slightly to make it more confusing

[08:57:01.0000] <annevk5>
e.g. instead of padding box of element it should be padding box of the first CSS layout box associated with element

[09:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: (in the hope you pick this up when you get back from vacation), I just changed the html5lib test format slighly to allow non-HTML elements as the container in the innerHTML case

[09:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
So if you do

[09:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
#document-fragment

[09:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
svg svg

[09:14:02.0000] <jgraham>
that will be like setting innerHTML on a SVG element in the SVG namespace

[09:17:00.0000] <annevk5>
except in theory there's no innerHTML on <svg:svg>

[09:17:01.0000] <annevk5>
are we changing that?

[09:17:02.0000] <annevk5>
(I'm in favor, fwiw)

[09:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh

[09:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well the parser spec suggests it can happen

[09:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
I didn't read the DOM APIs

[09:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
It seems crazy not to change it

[09:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
does it do the right thing?

[09:21:01.0000] <annevk5>
seems nice

[09:21:02.0000] <jgraham>
Well afaict it doesn't work in Fx at the moment

[09:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
although I wonder what happens if you call it with a this object that happens to be a svg node

[09:22:01.0000] <annevk5>
I mean in the draft

[09:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh

[09:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well the parser seems to assume it can happen

[09:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure it works, but it shouldn't obviously not work

[09:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
if you see what I mean

[09:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that since it is a setter you can't really change the this object, which is sad

[09:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh well that makes my life boring

[09:30:01.0000] <annevk5>
makes it or keeps it -- harhar

[09:30:02.0000] <annevk5>
/me is also slightly bored

[09:31:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me is looking at the mess that is scrollTop/scrollLeft and standards/quirks

[09:31:01.0000] <annevk5>
/me and also <html> / <body>; it's a big party

[09:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm, even messing around with __lookupSetter__ doesn't work

[09:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if there is a reason for that

[09:39:02.0000] <jgraham>
I mean apart from implementation complexity

[09:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh well, I guess I should leave support for it in the test format so that it is there once I convince Hixie it's a good idea :)

[09:43:00.0000] <annevk5>
ooh, I didn't quite mean it like that

[09:44:00.0000] <annevk5>
I was just wondering whether the algorithms worked nicely for cases like innerHTML = "<rect/>"

[09:44:01.0000] <annevk5>
not sure what specification should hook into it

[09:44:02.0000] <annevk5>
maybe the SVG integration spec if that's going anywhere

[09:44:03.0000] <annevk5>
but not having a spec hasn't stopped us before...

[09:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
well if you doo innerHTML = "<svg><rect/>" it should all work fine

[09:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
it's just you can't do SVGElement.innerHTML = "<rect/>"

[09:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
Which is weird and inconsistent

[09:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
I mean it shouldn't be any harder to get right than HTMLTableElement.innerHTML = "<a></table><tr>" or whatever

[09:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
and I have a local copy of html5lib that supports it now so I guess I can test

[09:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Ah, it doesn't quite work at the moment

[09:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
Because the root node is always in the HTML namespace

[09:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
But one could put the root node in the namespace of the context node and take whatever steps needed to ensure that was never popped off teh stack of opene elements

[09:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
and work from there

[10:10:00.0000] <annevk5>
so much for accepting the decision of the almighty chairs

[10:10:01.0000] <annevk5>
lol

[10:10:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Link?

[10:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html-wg/20100812#l-167

[10:12:00.0000] <Workshiva>
So there's no mechanism for doing a long alternative write-up for a complex image apart from the half a dozen ones suggested many times?

[10:13:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Talk about putting the implementation before the use case

[10:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
I don't really understand what a Formal Complaint is. I assume it is a Formal Objection

[10:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
But I don't understand what is so bad about those

[10:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
AIUI, a formal objection just means that it has to be recorded and disclosed to the director before publication.

[10:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
there's nothing inherently bad about them, it just gives one final bit of oversight, and a way for objectors to overrule the editor and the chairs, in the event that the editor and chairs made a major mistake

[10:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
Yes, but there seems to be a deeper dislike of them. Like if someone is just unhappy with a decision that is fine, but if they start using the word "Formal" people scramble to react

[10:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
mostly because most objections are just a waste of time, and a way to continue keeping an issue open well after it should have been dismissed

[10:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
AFAIK, it's rare for a formal objection to be acted upon, and it needs to be a very serious issue

[10:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I think in the HTMLWG, too many people just start throwing around calls for formal objections too much when they don't get their way.

[10:26:00.0000] <Workshiva>
As far as I understand, you can only object to the way the decision was made, not the decision itself

[10:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I observe that if the chairs actually change their mind here, then we'll be obliged to go file formal objections and make up new arguments after the decision too, whenever anything doesn't go our way.  But I guess that's what you get from having too much hierarchy, everyone can always question decisions ad infinitum.

[10:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Workshiva, well, if the decision is insane enough, ipso facto it was made through an incorrect procedure, insofar as correct procedures should prohibit excessively insane ideas.

[10:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(moderately insane is okay for the web, needless to say)

[10:27:02.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: That doesn't sound like too much heirachy. 

[10:28:00.0000] <Workshiva>
AryehGregor: I don't think you can axiomatically rule out excessively insane ideas

[10:28:01.0000] <Workshiva>
XHTML2 had a great run

[10:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
In a very heirachical system the people at the top would just make a decision and everyone would have to live with it

[10:28:03.0000] <jgraham>
Or kill them, I guess

[10:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
A characteristic of hierarchy is that most decisions are made by lower people, who can be overruled by higher people.

[10:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you can make lots of appeals.

[10:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
In a flat hierarchy, there are no appeals.

[10:29:03.0000] <Workshiva>
Well, the gamble on FOs is that the higher up in the system you go, the less the decision-maker knows about the decision, so it's more likely he will agree with you even if you're wrong

[10:29:04.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I guess that makes sense

[10:29:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
The problem with too many appeals is it allows jurisdiction-shopping.  If it doesn't go your way, try again!  And again!  And again!

[10:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well I assume that is what will happen here

[10:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The W3C isn't too bad in this respect, to be fair.  Only one of the appeal levels is insanely over-bureaucratic.

[10:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(namely, appeal to the chairs)

[10:30:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Formal Objections are pretty simple and hassle-free, plus I take it they tend to get a polite "Thank you for your concern, duly noted" response from TBL, so they're mostly a formality.

[10:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since the decision went the way it did, it will be taken up with the a11y coordination people who will make it an inter-group issue so circumventing the HTMLWG decision making process

[10:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although the danger of that is that sometimes they can randomly become not a formality and suddenly the Director actually has dictatorial power over everything at the W3C.

[10:31:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Well, I wonder if he even sees all the formal objections...

[10:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although possibly the a11y people will accept that longdesc is at best a distraction from reall accessibility issues

[10:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
*real

[10:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I was told about a professor who was denied tenure at a university, and appealed to the interim president, which is usually just a formality.  The interim president was applying to be the full president, and part of that required a vote of tenured faculty.  Curiously, he gave the person tenure in this case.  Got her vote, huh?)

[10:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The a11y people could describe an extension spec to HTML5 in their own WG, I guess.

[10:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The great thing about standards is you have so many to choose from!

[10:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yes, of course

[10:33:03.0000] <jgraham>
That would circumvent the whole issue

[10:33:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
In practice it makes no difference, since the only ones who seem to care about maintaining a validator are the WHATWG people.

[10:33:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
And as far as the general public is concerned, validators are the final arbiters of standardness.

[10:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess the PR value of being part of the full spec is deemed worthwhile

[10:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or maybe people are not making rational decisions

[10:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
That is normal, so I guess likely in this case too

[11:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, thanks for the diagnosis, fixed in the latest test version.

[12:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#the-hgroup-element

[12:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It can only contain h[123456].

[12:16:00.0000] <henrikbjorn>
that makes me sad

[12:18:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Can't you put the img inside a h123456?

[12:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure, although I will immediately point out that the word "contain" is not well-defined and therefore my answer is arguably accurate anyway.

[12:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, so MS has dropped support for distributed extensibility.  Hopefully that means it's dead.

[12:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>

gsnedders, what would be your requirements… that would lead to a web apps Choose Your blogging platform. You would select your features. If some platforms would meet all your requirements, you would get the list of them. If none, the message would be "ROLL YOUR OWN"

[13:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm vaguely thinking I want a blog too.

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: The community around it died long ago. It's now little more than a for-profit company (i.e., Automattic) paying for everything and controlling the entire project, and as far as I can tell it's even harder now than when there was a community around it (when it was hard enough) to get code in

[13:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting.

[13:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Also: it tries to output XHTML, no way to change that to HTML. No way to guarantee it is well-formed…

[13:57:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What are other choices you've considered?

[13:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Roll your own" leads to an annoying lack of features.

[13:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Hint: there's a reason why I ended up fairly heavily involved in Habari shortly after that went public (which is half the people the WP community used to be)

[13:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like no e-mail notification for comments, if comments are supported at all . . .

[13:58:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me has never heard of Habari

[13:58:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(Basically fed up with the direction of the project, started a new blogging platform)

[13:58:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: I don't think it ends up being significantly XHTML (that is, non-html-compatible), though.  My old company's blog is run on Wordpress, and it works great.

[13:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If it were non-HTML-compatible, it wouldn't work.

[13:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So, yeah.

[13:59:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Right. But even then, it's still trivial to get the things that are XML (like feeds) to not be well-formed

[14:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, yeah, probably.

[14:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Habari doesn't have that problem)

[14:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.blogkazani.com/yazi/interview-with-habari-developers has a fair bit about Habari's beginnings

[14:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(it's also really old)

[14:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(that post, not Habari)

[14:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(disclaimer: I am on the PMC of Habari)

[14:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Most of my issues with it are more down to things that PHP makes hard, like Unicode, more than anything really related to the impl)

[14:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(And my few issues with the impl are things where you'd need to rewrite large parts of it to fix)

[14:11:00.0000] <karlushi>
/me is rolling his own but has very few features requirements

[14:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
karlushi: Yeah, I don't exactly have many either.

[14:17:00.0000] <Rik`>
karlushi: http://lab.pheromone.ca/ looks like a wordpress :)

[14:17:01.0000] <karlushi>
Rik`, it is :) but that it is not my own ;) and sincerely I do not like it at all :)

[14:28:00.0000] <aho>
ah yea... just remembered... i'd like to see proper automatic hyphenation in browsers

[14:29:00.0000] <aho>
adding &shy; entities everywhere is just stupid

[14:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Discussing that right now, actually, in the www-style list.

[14:29:02.0000] <aho>
and using a script is slow and wasteful

[14:29:03.0000] <aho>
:o

[14:29:04.0000] <aho>
http://nitens.org/taraborelli/latex#justification

[14:29:05.0000] <aho>
that one reminded me :>

[14:29:06.0000] <Hixie>
hyphenation is one of those things where doing it 50% right is easy, and doing it 100% right is so insanely hard as to be ludicrous

[14:29:07.0000] <Hixie>
but 50% right is often 50% wrong :-/

[14:30:00.0000] <aho>
well, text-align:justify is currently pretty useless, isn't it? :>

[14:30:01.0000] <aho>
no               one               wants            to              read            stuff                like          this.

[14:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
just don't use long words :-D

[14:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
or don't justify :-)

[14:31:02.0000] <aho>
went with option #2

[14:31:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Use text-align-last when that gets implemented.

[14:31:04.0000] <aho>
i'm doing german sites most of the time... there will be very long words everywhere

[14:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah well there's your problem

[14:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
using german!

[14:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
should use a proper language, like french

[14:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
or english

[14:32:04.0000] <aho>
my faviorite word is "Verblödungsstrahlenkanone" by the way :>

[14:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
or one based on ideographics

[14:32:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Why did I expect you to say that about German? :)

[14:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
aho: Dementia ray gun?

[14:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: If your parents had lives a few hundred km east…

[14:33:02.0000] <aho>
pretty much, yea

[14:33:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*lived

[14:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: then they'd be in lichenstein

[14:33:05.0000] <aho>
that was from some silly cartoon

[14:33:06.0000] <Hixie>
aho: hah

[14:33:07.0000] <aho>
i just liked the word a lot :)

[14:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: How far is it from Genève to Fribourg, for example?

[14:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(I know there are closer places that are German speaking, but, in terms of major places there can't be many much closer…)

[14:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
dude switzerland is so small you can pretty much hit anywhere in switzerland by just throwing a stone

[14:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
most of fribourg speaks french, dude

[14:35:01.0000] <aho>
omelette du fromage

[14:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I remember Genève to Fribourg taking an hour or two by train. That's a long way to a ten year old. :P

[14:36:00.0000] <aho>
mh. haven't eaten that since ages

[14:36:01.0000] <aho>
thanks dexter

[14:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
geneve to zurich takes like 3 hours

[14:36:03.0000] <aho>
:>

[14:36:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Well, it's on the linguisitic fronteir, so there's more German there than in Geneva ;P

[14:36:05.0000] <gsnedders>
* :P

[14:36:06.0000] <Hixie>
geneva is an outlier

[14:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's probably more arabic or english or german or chinese or any number of other languages in geneva than any neighbouring town

[14:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me does know the relative location of places in Geneva, but has no real idea of distance

[14:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I was just writing that talking about language in a place like Geneva is a bit silly

[14:37:03.0000] <aho>
oh yea... sorta kinda... speaking of which... i'm going to the fronteers conf :D

[14:37:04.0000] <aho>
/me jumps up n down

[14:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: you're the one who brought up geneva :-P

[14:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Well, yeah. But you're the one who was brought up in Geneva. :P

[14:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Could've been born somewhere sensible like Zurich, but no…

[14:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
zurich is just a localised build of geneva

[14:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
in my experience

[14:40:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Speaking of Zürich

[14:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, I remember it feeling a lot cooler than Geneva. There again, the one day I was out in Geneva was 39°C, and the hottest day on record

[14:41:01.0000] <Workshiva>
There was a Schwingen flash mob here this week, apparently

[14:41:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Saw it in the newspaper this morning

[14:41:03.0000] <Steve^>
Hey gsnedders, the outliner on your website doesn't seem to be working when you upload files

[14:41:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Steve^: Seems plausible.

[14:41:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me never uses it

[14:41:06.0000] <Steve^>
Is there another one on the web?

[14:41:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Steve^: can you email me?

[14:42:00.0000] <Steve^>
I could do...

[14:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me heads off to sleep

[14:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(there is no other one AFAIK)

[14:42:03.0000] <Steve^>
shame

[14:42:04.0000] <Steve^>
I don't have your email address

[14:42:05.0000] <Steve^>
nor am I sure why I'm emailing you

[14:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
me⊙gc to tell me it's b0rked when uploading files?

[14:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
So I actually remember? :P

[14:43:02.0000] <Steve^>
ok, ok

[14:45:00.0000] <Steve^>
seems like everyone on the internets links to that same outliner

[14:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
what do you call the blanket that that peanuts character used to take around with him everywhere?

[14:47:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Safety blanket?

[14:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
a blanket someone uses for comfort?

[14:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
ok, that's what i thought

[14:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
but the web is not supporting my belief

[14:48:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Steve^: As long as the existing one works, there's no incentive to create a second version

[14:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
aha, wikipedia says Security blanket

[14:48:02.0000] <Steve^>
indeed

[14:55:00.0000] <paul_irish>
anyone by chance know if the dataTransfer object is accessible outside of an event in webkit? (Mozilla exposes it globally)

[15:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, so why is document.createElement("output").htmlFor an object in Firefox?

[15:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's the last Firefox failure on my reflection tests for now that I haven't filed either spec or browser bugs on, other than just missing features.

[15:18:00.0000] <Workshiva>
readonly attribute DOMSettableTokenList htmlFor;

[15:18:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Hum

[15:20:00.0000] <Workshiva>
How do you test the type?

[15:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, wait.

[15:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's my bad.

[15:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
My test is wrong.

[15:21:03.0000] <Workshiva>
And all's right with the world

[15:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I see, it's a string on <label> but a settable token list on <output>.

[15:26:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Yeah, because output can "label" multiple controls

[15:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me discovers that his ad hoc data storage format can't cope with an IDL attribute on two different elements having the same name but different type if the content attribute name is different from the IDL attribute name

[15:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, so I've identified about four different bugs in Gecko from my tests.

[15:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I see about that many WebKit bugs too.

[15:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Opera is considerably more, probably because it tries to copy IE . . . IE9PP4 is a *lot*.

[15:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me calls it quits for today

[15:41:01.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: bugs about ?

[15:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Reflection.

[15:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://aryeh.name/tests/bugs_filed.txt

[15:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Mostly I've found spec bugs, in fact.)

[15:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I haven't found many WebKit/IE bugs yet, but only because I haven't systematically filed them yet.)

[15:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(One of the Firefox bugs I filed is more legitimately a spec bug.)

[16:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, oh nice

[16:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which part, that someone is actually attempting to write tests?

[16:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or some other part?

[16:07:01.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, are you meanwhile trying to find out if we can make all enumerated attributes limited to known values?

[16:07:02.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, spec/browser QA of course :)

[16:07:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk5, that depends on website compat, doesn't it?

[16:07:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't see that I'd be able to help with that testing.

[16:08:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Enumerated attributes are such a mess

[16:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The whatwg thread seems to have died.

[16:08:02.0000] <Workshiva>
I haven't been reading whatwg mail, I wonder if Hixie replied to mine yet

[16:09:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, it depends mostly on what browsers implement now

[16:09:01.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, and what ms2ger can get patched in Gecko :)

[16:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't replied to anything sent in the last month or so

[16:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
and am way behind on specific topics like appcache

[16:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
and anything involving new features

[16:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
you can try searching for the subject line of your e-mail on http://whatwg.org/issues/

[16:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk5, browsers mostly implement per spec now, with some deviations.  Like WebKit implements preload as limited to only known values.

[16:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
apologies for that not being the most easy-to-search tool

[16:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, that seems like the only issue, outside maybe of IE (which I can't easily look at since IE8 doesn't run the tests right and IE9 is down the hall, so I can't be bothered to check it too often).

[16:13:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Hixie: It's easier to search than the email archives :P

[16:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Workshiva, the e-mail archive search is called "Google".

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
Workshiva: possibly

[16:14:01.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, sounds like we should make preload limited to known values in the spec too

[16:14:02.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, I guess the rest can be done by encouraging browsers to experiment

[16:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, will you get to my email on XHR/HTML5 by somewhere next week?

[16:16:01.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, there's not really lots of hurry anymore

[16:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
if there's no hurry, then maybe

[16:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
if there's hurry i can prioritise it

[16:16:04.0000] <annevk5>
maybe is fine at this point, ta

[16:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[16:17:01.0000] <annevk5>
if the W3C test server was working it would've been nice, but now I'll just wait and work on something else

[16:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
The test server is not working?

[16:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, webapps repository is not properly reflected on test.w3.org

[16:19:00.0000] <Workshiva>
So what is the benefit of having an enumerated attribute not limited to known values?

[16:19:01.0000] <annevk5>
compat potentially

[16:21:00.0000] <Workshiva>
And the main compat surface would be reading an invalid state

[16:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I doubt it will cause many compat issues.

[16:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Only one or two of the properties are likely to see nontrivial use at all, IIRC.

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me points AryehGregor to the /topic

[16:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh.

[16:31:00.0000] <annevk5>
just file some bugs to get people to experiment

[16:31:01.0000] <annevk5>
the guy from Mozilla who's implementing WF2 is interested in it as well

[16:31:02.0000] <annevk5>
if Gecko or WebKit can ship it without running into issues it's prolly fine


2010-08-13
[17:13:00.0000] <annevk5>
o_O lol at hybi

[17:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
o_O indeed

[17:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
they even want to remove the paragraph that says to send feedback to the hybi list!

[17:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
someone just sent me a mail saying that they weren't receiving mail from the mailing list

[17:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
they didn't say which mailing list...

[17:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
oops

[17:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
also, clearly it's too late, explaining people that whatwg.org is not nytimes.com is really not all that interesting

[17:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is quite lost.

[17:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn! :-)

[17:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: go left

[17:25:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me goes left, and walks off the Cliff of Comprehension.

[17:27:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, nn :) gonna spec the scroll event tomorrow

[17:27:01.0000] <annevk5>
hopefully I remember what I just figured out

[17:37:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i smiled a litte when I read annevk's statement about not being the NY times site :)

[17:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Definitely.  ^_^

[17:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you're reading the spec using IE6, You're Doing It Wrong(tm).

[17:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
sweet kittens

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i got the main bucket down to only mail that's about a month old, about 300 mails

[17:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
and there's about 300 mails in the buckets that are new features delayed for various reasons

[17:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
but the pile is at 900 mails

[17:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
and i was like, where are all the other 300 mails?

[17:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
turns out they're ALL ABOUT VIDEO

[17:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Work's cut out for you, then.

[17:54:00.0000] <cheeser>
video on the web will never take off anyway.  just a fad, i'm afraid.

[17:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wonder if you could make a web site which is entirely rendered through <video>

[17:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
with live streaming of the page generated on the server

[17:56:01.0000] <cheeser>
javascript+canvas?

[17:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
using Web Sockets to transmit user input to the server

[17:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
server-side canvas, transcoded to video and piped to the browser

[17:56:04.0000] <Philip`>
cheeser: Nah, that's not thin client and is therefore uncool

[17:56:05.0000] <Philip`>
Got to do all the rendering in the cloud

[17:56:06.0000] <cheeser>
heh

[17:57:00.0000] <cheeser>
was actually thinking of writing a websocket based irc client.

[17:57:01.0000] <cheeser>
because i'm dumb that way.

[17:59:00.0000] <abarth>
cheeser: you should write an irc-based websocket client

[17:59:01.0000] <cheeser>
heh

[18:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
That'd be good when you want to write an efficient user-friendly web-based frontend to the IRC-based control system of a botnet

[18:03:00.0000] <cheeser>
and the world definitely needs better botnet tools.

[18:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
abarth: Man, are you trying to get sites hacked now? :P

[18:40:00.0000] <abarth>
gsnedders: ?

[18:40:01.0000] <abarth>
ah

[18:40:02.0000] <abarth>
i see :)

[18:49:00.0000] <mcarter>
greetings

[18:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
yo

[18:52:00.0000] <mcarter>
Why did we add the sec-websocket-protocol header anyway?

[18:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: ^^^

[18:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[18:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
as opposed to what?

[18:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
as opposed to WebSocket-Protocol? (i.e. why the sec-?)

[18:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
or the entire protocol negotiation thing at all?

[18:53:00.0000] <mcarter>
sorry, I mean the protocol negotiation -- what is the use case?

[18:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's for when we are in a situaton where there's a dozen different IM protocols, and there are IM clients that can support many

[18:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the user just gives a hostname

[18:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and port and so on)

[18:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
the client can just say "i speak all these subprotocols"

[18:55:00.0000] <mcarter>
I see. Why not just handle that in application space?

[18:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
the protocols would all have to do it in the same way to do it in the app space

[18:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
so for example, if you invent a new protocol that just starts off with expecting the client says FOO, you can't detect that

[18:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
except by just trying to connect with many differnet protocols, etc

[18:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
which becomes hellish

[18:56:01.0000] <mcarter>
The way people use network protocols now is with apriori knowledge

[18:56:02.0000] <mcarter>
"I know there's an http server on example.org port 3232, so connect and download a web page."

[18:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
at the TCP level, yeah

[18:57:01.0000] <mcarter>
I mean, when I type  "http://example.org:3232" into my web browser, we don't depend on any tcp-level protocol negotiation

[18:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[18:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's one of the reasons we've had so many problems with websockets

[18:57:04.0000] <Hixie>
and why we're using HTTP's Upgrade mechanism

[18:59:00.0000] <mcarter>
fair enough

[19:01:00.0000] <mcarter>
I'm not particularly against it; I just have this feeling like its opened the flood gates to people wanting some giant meta protocol for negotiating everything with some super-complicated framing/handshake scheme

[19:01:01.0000] <mcarter>
I mean, my default response to things like multiplexing is "do it in the app level."

[19:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[19:34:00.0000] <mcarter>
What is our current stance on reverse proxy traversal -- "rewrite the proxy" ?

[20:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
mcarter: depends on the reverse proxy

[20:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
mcarter: from the spec's point of view, reverse proxies are part of the server

[00:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, shouldn't NPN also obsolete usage of the other handshake in part?

[00:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me thought that was part of the appeal

[00:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: that seems like it would make transitioning to TLS a pain

[00:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: the current system, you just stick it on the front.

[00:48:00.0000] <annevk5>
i guess it depends on how you see it

[00:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
but if you do it like this you are not getting rid of the additional roundtrip?

[00:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: yes, that is a sad problem with TLS

[00:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
I thought the whole idea of using NPN was to prevent that

[00:57:01.0000] <annevk5>
otherwise there's presumably not much point in doing it

[00:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
(though I'm not 100% sure... NPN seems to require a three-way handshake anyway, so maybe the WebSocket handshake only adds a single additional round-trip?)

[00:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
well it makes it impossible to have a cross-protocol attack

[00:58:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me wonders if abarth is around

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is a significant aid

[00:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
you still need the WebSocket handshake for lots of other things

[00:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
like opting into extensions, the origin model, etc

[01:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if the TLS/NPN handshake can carry whatever information would be in the HTTP-based WebSocket handshake

[01:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
it sounded like that was the idea

[01:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
Ian Fette keeps making more complicated frame proposals :/

[01:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure why he thinks random reserved bits in the header are helpful

[01:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm, I see I am getting all the mail from yesterday

[01:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: actually, ping here instead

[01:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
The first screenful is about 70% [hybi] and 30% [whatwg]

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: when you have a moment, i would like to make http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10213 your proposal rather than mine :-)

[02:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, scroll* is slightly more complicated it seems

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, maybe not

[02:23:00.0000] <abarth>
Hixie: sorry, i've had a bit too much to drink tonight

[02:23:01.0000] <abarth>
Hixie: i'd be happy to look at it tomorrow

[02:24:00.0000] <abarth>
Hixie: that bug looks like URL parsing, which i'm happy to have be my problem

[02:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: cool

[02:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
abarth: Well, getting people to write IRC clients for Web sockets, I bet you some sites are going to fail to do proper auth…

[03:59:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, scrollIntoView seems rather complex

[04:00:00.0000] <adactio>
A blog post on the BBC about the "split" between W3C and WHAT WG http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2010/08/html5_open_standards_and_the_b.html The quoted source... Shelley. :-/

[04:00:01.0000] <adactio>
I hope my license fee didn't pay for that drivel.

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk5>
and lastweekinhtml5 lol

[04:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is trollweek still going?

[04:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
Jesus

[04:03:02.0000] <annevk5>
dunno, but that bbc blog post links to something on it

[04:03:03.0000] <annevk5>
"Erik Huggers is Director of BBC Future Media & Technology" haha

[04:03:04.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if I should register just to post a comment

[04:03:05.0000] <annevk5>
glad we have sane people in NL running gov-sponsored media

[04:03:06.0000] <annevk5>
well, somewhat saner

[04:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
The BBC is generally quite awesome and it is sad when they fuck up

[04:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm glad the small bit of gov-sponsored media in the US is irrelevant

[04:04:02.0000] <annevk5>
they make a lot of good shows

[04:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so that when I see poor journalism I can simply refrain from giving my money to the responsible organization

[04:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I love that the trollweek link is hyperlinked to the text "Professional integrity"

[04:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
That was quite mystifying

[04:06:02.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, this is quite a joke

[04:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
apparently, professional integrity calls for a great deal of anatomical photography

[04:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe this guy *is* MLW ;)

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm

[04:13:01.0000] <annevk5>
Safari does not support scrollIntoView?

[04:13:02.0000] <annevk5>
Opera in a vastly different way from Mozilla

[04:13:03.0000] <annevk5>
and only Gecko dispatches a scroll event

[04:13:04.0000] <annevk5>
interop win

[04:13:05.0000] <annevk5>
no wonder hixie asks me to take over

[04:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
but chrome does it like Firefox

[04:14:01.0000] <annevk5>
hmm

[04:14:02.0000] <annevk5>
maybe WebKit recently fixed something

[04:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
haha. I find it ironic that the link to MLW says "Professional integrity", which is something that MLW doesn't have.

[04:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we certainly have a scrollIntoView method

[04:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/589 was my basic test

[04:18:02.0000] <annevk5>
it "tests" whether scrolling happens and whether an event is dispatched on Document

[04:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
clearly registering rel values is nigh-on impossible

[04:25:00.0000] <annevk5>
this is exactly the problem with the IANA registries, they don't reflect actual practice making it harder to make informed decisions

[04:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
what is the process for registering links relationships in the IANA registry?

[04:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Take one newborn goat and one full moon

[04:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
Arm yourself with a dagger made from unicorn horn

[04:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Sacrifice the goat in a pool of virgin tears under the light of the full moon

[04:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
There will then be a committe decision on whether to accept your relation or not

[04:39:00.0000] <gratz|home>
wow

[04:50:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Latest BBC news: WHATWG intends to sacrifice goats

[04:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
I doubt it'll be as popular as that news story about the man marrying his goat

[04:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
Unless, of course, that's the goat we sacrifice

[05:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
"[Link relationship] Registration requests should be sent to the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list" -- http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-link-header-10#section-6.2.1

[05:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
so it's currently not possible to send in a registration request

[05:27:00.0000] <annevk5>
so for scrollIntoView() Chrome/Firefox also scroll the outer frame but Opera does not

[05:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
can anyone check the link I pasted before in IE9?

[05:33:00.0000] <Peter`>
IE9 does the same as Gecko/WebKit

[05:33:01.0000] <Peter`>
which indeed is different from Opera

[05:34:00.0000] <annevk5>
ta

[05:37:00.0000] <annevk5>
I wonder if an event is dispatched in each document that performs scrolling behavior

[05:37:01.0000] <annevk5>
and presumably for RTL content rules might be slightly different, hmm

[05:39:00.0000] <roc>
it would be in Firefox

[05:39:01.0000] <roc>
we also dispatch non-bubbling "scroll" events to overflow:auto/scroll elements that are scrolled by scrollIntoView

[05:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
that makes sense

[05:40:01.0000] <annevk5>
is multi-document not an issue for cross-origin?

[05:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
even just the scrolling somehow triggered by a subframe seems suboptimal

[05:43:00.0000] <roc>
it hasn't come up

[05:43:01.0000] <roc>
maybe some enterprising miscreant could figure something out

[05:44:00.0000] <annevk5>
it should probably at least not work for <iframe> with sandbox set

[05:45:00.0000] <annevk5>
I guess I should probably define something like "scroll element to x,y" and "scroll document to x,y" which do the relevant "alignment" and event dispatching

[05:46:00.0000] <annevk5>
or would some other model make more sense?

[05:50:00.0000] <roc>
no, that's more or less how it's implemented

[05:51:00.0000] <roc>
annevk5: about the offset* properties ... honestly, I don't want to touch those with a ten-foot pole

[05:51:01.0000] <annevk5>
dhyatt said something similar about the HTML parser in WebKit

[05:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
but they should match Gecko more or less now

[05:52:01.0000] <roc>
it would be great if we could converge on something interoperable, but with ten years of non-interoperable behavior, and Web pages sniffing, it's just too fragile

[05:52:02.0000] <annevk5>
apart from something related to the root element I think, where they match WebKit/Opera

[05:52:03.0000] <roc>
annevk5: people don't emit different HTML based on UA sniffing

[05:53:00.0000] <roc>
at least, not very often

[05:53:01.0000] <roc>
plus, we've interoperated pretty well on common cases

[05:53:02.0000] <roc>
which is why people don't have to UA-sniff

[05:53:03.0000] <roc>
the situation with offset is ... less good

[05:53:04.0000] <annevk5>
yeah :/

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
but I don't want people to have UA sniff forever and make it hard for new UAs either

[05:55:00.0000] <roc>
if we were able to converge offset behavior, then authors could remove sniffing and rewrite their offset code paths to use a single code path

[05:55:01.0000] <roc>
OR they could just rewrite those code paths to use getClientRects/getBoundingClientRect, right now

[05:56:00.0000] <roc>
I'm not convinced it's worth investing in the former option

[05:56:01.0000] <annevk5>
well, not every UA is sniffed for

[05:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
and although we try to convince authors to do the right thing... it's usually a somewhat hopeless cause

[06:00:00.0000] <roc>
whatever you specced, if it was implemented by all browsers, would lead to a lot of sites being broken for a lot of users

[06:00:01.0000] <roc>
and I'm not sure who would be helped

[06:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
so what does a new UA do?

[06:01:01.0000] <annevk5>
I guess it gets an even longer UA string

[06:01:02.0000] <roc>
new UAs would have to deal with a) new sites, which are using getClientRects anyway, so no issue and b) old sites, which haven't updated their code anyway so whatever you specced is irrelevant

[06:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
I think the situation is somewhat less hopeless than you paint it

[06:03:01.0000] <annevk5>
as Firefox / WebKit do the same for most tests (apart that root element test)

[06:03:02.0000] <annevk5>
and Opera has two issues because of not following Firefox / WebKit

[06:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
and new-IE follows Firefox mostly

[06:06:00.0000] <roc>
IE changed their behavior?

[06:06:01.0000] <roc>
hmm

[06:06:02.0000] <annevk5>
(this does not take into account the <table> issue though)

[06:06:03.0000] <annevk5>
they did several times afaik

[06:07:00.0000] <roc>
ok

[06:07:01.0000] <annevk5>
time to get expenses done before accounting leaves

[06:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
guess scrollintoview will have to wait

[06:09:00.0000] <roc>
thanks for all this

[06:11:00.0000] <darkangel>
Hi, has there been any discussion recently regarding tri-state checkboxes?

[06:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
darkangel: What kind of discussion?

[06:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
'indeterminate' was added to the spec some time ago to support that

[06:15:01.0000] <darkangel>
Philip`: Discussion of its possible inclusion in HTML5.

[06:15:02.0000] <darkangel>
^ Really? Is that an attribute?

[06:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use <input type=checkbox> then set input.indeterminate = true

[06:16:01.0000] <darkangel>
With JS?

[06:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
See http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/number-state.html#checkbox-state

[06:16:03.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[06:17:00.0000] <roc>
'indeterminate' is an IE-compat feature, it's not a great APPI

[06:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, it's older than I remembered

[06:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/commit-watchers-whatwg.org/2008/001807.html

[06:22:00.0000] <darkangel>
Philip`: It would be best to be able to use an attribute, something like: <input type="checkbox" tristate="true" />

[06:44:00.0000] <darkangel>
I don't really get the point of indeterminate, it behaves exactly the same (I know, that is mentioned in the spec).

[06:45:00.0000] <darkangel>
Lachy: There?

[06:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[06:46:00.0000] <darkangel>
Lachy: Hello. What was the result of your discussion about tri-state checkboxes back in 2007? (http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html-wg/20070914)

[06:48:00.0000] <Workshiva>
darkangel: It doesn't look the same, and indeterminate can be used for validation

[06:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
the result was what's in the spec now, which occured after the discovery of the indeterminate property in IE

[06:49:00.0000] <Workshiva>
"If the element is required and its checkedness is false, then the element is suffering from being missing."

[06:49:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Poor element has to suffer because of the user's negligence

[06:50:00.0000] <darkangel>
Lachy: But that's visual only, only two states can be determined on the server, right?

[06:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[06:51:00.0000] <darkangel>
Lachy: Then it's rather pointless IMHO. What if I want an explicit yes/no/no selection?

[06:52:00.0000] <Workshiva>
You control what state the checkbox is in when it enters indeterminate state

[06:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
use radio buttons.

[06:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
or <select>

[06:52:03.0000] <Workshiva>
If you can't make a sensible default, can't use client side validation, there's <select> and radio buttons

[06:52:04.0000] <darkangel>
Lachy: ^ It forces a user to make a selection if the field is required.

[06:53:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Or just two checkboxes :)

[06:54:00.0000] <darkangel>
Imagine a tree of checkboxes for preferences or access control ... would it look nice (or be easy to view) if each item had three radio buttons?

[06:54:01.0000] <Workshiva>
If it's actually tristate, yes

[06:55:00.0000] <darkangel>
allow/deny/no rule

[06:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
when you have a tree like that, the indeterminate state of a parent checkbox is determined based on the selected state of its children

[06:55:02.0000] <Workshiva>
But you might as well use selects, that way it's crystal clear what state it is in

[06:57:00.0000] <darkangel>
Look here ... http://www.jstree.com/documentation/checkbox

[06:57:01.0000] <darkangel>
I was planning on using this script, not realising they had built-in support for tri-state ...

[06:58:00.0000] <darkangel>
But that just shows the need.

[06:59:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Well, it seems like you'd want a custom widget there so you can control what the indeterminate state looks like

[06:59:01.0000] <Workshiva>
But for pure functionality, indeterminate should work fine

[07:00:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Just make checked=false when you set indeterminate=true

[07:03:00.0000] <darkangel>
Alternatively, you could just add a full-featured tree widget to HTML5. :D

[07:04:00.0000] <Workshiva>
It's not impossible, but it won't happen for a few years at least, while browsers implement what's already waiting

[07:05:00.0000] <darkangel>
right

[07:05:01.0000] <darkangel>
Workshiva: I would suggest the indeterminate state be no value submitted, checked=1, unchecked=2.

[07:06:00.0000] <Workshiva>
I don't know for sure, but I suspect there is content out there that depends on indeterminate submitting a value

[07:07:00.0000] <darkangel>
^ unchecked=0 I mean.

[07:07:01.0000] <darkangel>
It differs from the current 2-state checkbox, however you would have to opt-in using an attribute.

[07:08:00.0000] <darkangel>
Existing content or future content?

[07:08:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Existing

[07:08:02.0000] <darkangel>
Existing content would be unaffected.

[07:09:00.0000] <darkangel>
You would have to use: <input type="checkbox" tristate="true" />

[07:11:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Then it makes more sense to make it a separate type

[07:11:01.0000] <Workshiva>
It doesn't seem very compatible at all

[07:12:00.0000] <darkangel>
You mean <input type="tristate-checkbox" />

[07:12:01.0000] <darkangel>
?

[07:13:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Yeah, plus some bikeshedding on the exact type

[07:15:00.0000] <darkangel>
bikeshedding?

[07:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
we're planning on adding that tree widget at some point so maybe it isn't needed?

[07:16:01.0000] <annevk5>
look for <datagrid> in older drafts

[07:16:02.0000] <annevk5>
it will come back at some point

[07:17:00.0000] <darkangel>
annevk5: Will it be a combined tree/datagrid control?

[07:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
darkangel: http://hotpink.bikeshed.org/

[07:21:00.0000] <darkangel>

This HTML WG decision process doesn't seem to work terribly well at resolving conflicts

[07:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
If a decision is made one way, then the WHATWG spec ignores it and does the other thing

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
If the decision goes the other way, then people start repeating all their arguments about the topic and object to the decision and to the decision process and to the decision makers and want to reopen or escalate the issue

[07:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why can't we all just get along?

[07:29:00.0000] <annevk5>
expenses done

[07:30:00.0000] <annevk5>
darkangel, iirc, something like that

[07:30:01.0000] <darkangel>
annevk5: cool.

[07:30:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
Philip`, because we disagree about the way specifications should be written on a rather fundamental level?

[07:30:03.0000] <annevk5>
darkangel, .e.g http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080610/interactive-elements.html#datagrid has an old draft

[07:31:00.0000] <annevk5>
darkangel, http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-html5-20090423/interactive-elements.html#datagrid is the latest version that includes it

[07:31:01.0000] <annevk5>
darkangel, will prolly come back at some point

[07:31:02.0000] <annevk5>
darkangel, when most other controls are somewhat stable

[07:32:00.0000] <darkangel>
annevk5: I hope so.

[07:33:00.0000] <annevk5>
Philip`, sounds utopical

[07:34:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Philip`: We can't get along because we can't get along

[07:37:00.0000] <darkangel>
Will an editor control be added in future? (designMode is rather painful)

[07:39:00.0000] <annevk5>
there's vague plans to make contenteditable work

[07:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
first by fixing dom range

[07:40:01.0000] <annevk5>
then by step-by-step fixing the interoperability holes

[07:40:02.0000] <annevk5>
there's a couple of people working on something I believe, but nothing concrete just yet

[07:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
I assumed we couldn't get along because HTMLWG is the contiuation of a generations-long holy war, the origins of which have been lost in the mists of time

[07:41:01.0000] <Workshiva>
It's mostly just because people are wrong on the internet

[07:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
Of course it has become less serious now it takes the form of stiffly worded letters

[07:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
rather than bloody battles in the desert

[07:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
But still

[07:42:02.0000] <darkangel>
annevk5: Thank you.

[07:44:00.0000] <darkangel>
I'm surprised the default timezone for datetime is UTC, I would have thought it'd be more user-friendly to let the user enter times in their own timezone. (I realise the UA can make that possible, just think it should be the default).

[07:45:00.0000] <annevk5>
it is in UTC for servers, not users

[07:46:00.0000] <annevk5>
if you want local time for servers, use datatime-local

[07:46:01.0000] <annevk5>
datetime-local*

[07:47:00.0000] <jeromegn>
Hey guys, I'm having a weird WebSocket issue right now. Works perfectly from everywhere else I tried it. But from this specific place I am it doesn't. For some reason, I can't connect to a remote websocket. But if I run it locally, I can connect just fine. What could cause that? ISP? Router? Firewall? I thought it was supposed to passthrough without any issue :)

[07:50:00.0000] <darkangel>
jeromegn: Wrong channel me-thinks.

[07:50:01.0000] <jeromegn>
hmm

[07:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
right channel me-thinks

[07:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks firewall issue

[07:50:04.0000] <jeromegn>
:)

[07:50:05.0000] <jeromegn>
hmm

[07:51:00.0000] <jeromegn>
At first I thought it was that option on the router: "Block all outgoing connection requests"

[07:52:00.0000] <jeromegn>
but disabling it didn't help.

[07:52:01.0000] <darkangel>
annevk5: I kinda misread the spec, but it does only say "may" -- "User agents may display the date and time in whatever time zone is appropriate for the user." maybe that should be "should", or maybe all UAs will do it anyway. :)

[07:52:02.0000] <annevk5>
jeromegn, use some kind of network analyzer?

[07:52:03.0000] <jeromegn>
annevk5: I'll look that up

[07:52:04.0000] <annevk5>
darkangel, just use the UA with the behavior you prefer :)

[07:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
jeromegn, if you don't any, i've used wireshark with some success, but mostly for http traffic but it should do everything

[07:53:01.0000] <annevk5>
have any*

[07:53:02.0000] <jeromegn>
hehe, first result on google, I'm going to try it out

[07:53:03.0000] <darkangel>
annevk5: Will there be a visual indication of the TZ?

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk5>
darkangel, depends on the UA

[07:56:01.0000] <darkangel>
annevk5: Okay.

[07:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
our implementation is not very nice; data:text/html,<input type=datetime> just says UTC for me

[07:57:01.0000] <annevk5>
but then we haven't given it much UI polish, it was mostly to show the XForms types it could work

[07:58:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Speaking of xforms, I haven't heard much about that lately

[07:59:00.0000] <annevk5>
it's all in the verticals

[07:59:01.0000] <annevk5>
hard to spot

[08:01:00.0000] <darkangel>
annevk5: Hmm ... small bug: if you select the hour and click up/down, it will increment/decrement once and then lose focus, so additional clicks will affect the minutes instead.

[08:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
ugh

[08:03:01.0000] <annevk5>
we are making some progress now in making changes though, so hopefully that's included too

[08:03:02.0000] <annevk5>
/me is not closely involved in the UI fixing

[08:03:03.0000] <darkangel>
:)

[08:04:00.0000] <darkangel>
+1 for actually implementing datetime. ;)

[08:22:00.0000] <jeromegn>
annevk5: what should I be looking for after filtering my websocket port in wireshark? I see a few entries but all that data is a little out of my league

[08:25:00.0000] <jeromegn>
it looks like this... I did twice "new WebSocket": http://cl.ly/6e2920fc6e5abdf3594b

[08:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
jeromegn, when click one of those lines you get the data flow

[08:29:00.0000] <annevk5>
but I'm not quite familiar how one finds a failure, though you could compare the two stacks of it working and not working I suppose

[08:34:00.0000] <jeromegn>
oh my

[08:34:01.0000] <jeromegn>
took hours for a ridiculous problem

[08:39:00.0000] <annevk5>
Peter`, what does this do in IE

[08:39:01.0000] <annevk5>

[08:43:00.0000] <Peter`>
could you give me the html snippet? IE says the URL cannot be opened

[08:43:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
<!DOCTYPE html> <style> img {  } </style> <img src=image onload=init(this)> <script> function init(i) {  w(i.x); w(i.y) } </script>

[08:43:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
Peter`, ^

[08:44:00.0000] <Peter`>
thank you

[08:44:07.0000] <annevk5>
and then click

[08:44:08.0000] <annevk5>
ooh

[08:44:09.0000] <Peter`>
same, but four times undefined

[08:45:00.0000] <annevk5>
so it's a WebKit/Firefox thing that is biting us

[08:45:01.0000] <annevk5>
maybe it can still be fixed

jgraham: How do you say "I don't speak Norwegian" in norwegian?

[10:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me finds that that is a very useful phrase to have in any language.

[10:46:00.0000] <kling>
TabAtkins: jeg snakker ikke norsk :]

[10:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And how do I pronounce that?

[10:48:00.0000] <kling>
yay snacker icky narsque? i dunno. i just live in norway :)

[10:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haha, sounds fun to say.

[10:49:00.0000] <daedb_>
Norwegian always sounds disturbingly upbeat.

[11:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
kling, TabAtkins, it's pronounced more like: yay snakker ikka norsk

[11:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All right, hopefully I can avoid having to talk norwegian at anybody until I can say it in front of a friendly native.

[11:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me agrees that's a useful thing to know

[11:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can only say it in French, though.

[11:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I got it in German.

[11:10:03.0000] <Workshiva>
You can only say you don't speak Norwegian in French?

[11:10:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
And spanish, I guess.

[11:10:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me sighs.  He knew someone would catch that awkward phrasing.

[11:10:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Workshiva, no, I can say that in English, Hebrew, or French (if I look up the word for "Norwegian" in Hebrew and French).

[11:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
"Sprekken sie deutsch nicht", and "No hablo espanol".

[11:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, I guess I can do Spanish too.

[11:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Though I've been told the german is slightly wrong?)

[11:11:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Kind of easy to learn Spanish in Manhattan, just look at all the ads.

[11:11:04.0000] <Workshiva>
... very wrong

[11:11:05.0000] <KaOSoFt>
No idea the german version, but spanish's just missing the "�"

[11:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well then, it serves its purpose of indicating that I can't speak german.

[11:12:01.0000] <Workshiva>
The German one sounds like... a weird "You don't speak German"

[11:12:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
KaOSoFt: Yeah, I can't easily express that letter on this keyboard.

[11:12:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I have an Android phone, so I can say it in any language supported by the voice version of Google Translate.

[11:12:04.0000] <Workshiva>
Possibly an awkward "Please don't speak German"

[11:12:05.0000] <KaOSoFt>
TabAtkins- Alt + 164

[11:12:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
KaOSoFt, on Windows, maybe.

[11:12:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
KaOSoFt: Your windows key combinations do nothing for me!

[11:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, that looks like it's a Windows-1252 code point.

[11:13:01.0000] <KaOSoFt>
What are you on: Linux, Macintosh?

[11:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(if I remember the numbers right)

[11:13:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
linux

[11:13:04.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Yeah, I sometimes have problems with that on Arch.

[11:13:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ctrl-Shift-uF1 on GNOME.

[11:13:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
ñ

[11:16:00.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Hmm... never thought about it, but there certainly should be a way to do those extra characters on console (Linux).

[11:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ctrl-Shift-uXXXX works in GNOME, generally.

[11:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Except in some programs where some letters break because they're bound to something else.

[11:20:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
(Like Opera)

[14:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sigh.  If you're going to replace the native checkboxes with js-driven images, at least make sure your images are *pretty*.

[15:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So, it seems like Oracle is suing Google because technically the Java patent grants didn't apply to modified versions.  Now, why is it that everyone is calling the VP8 implementation open-source when the patent grant doesn't cover modified versions?

[15:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, I seem to explicitly remember someone from Mozilla objecting on www-font to use of font compression with field-of-use restrictions on the relevant patent licenses.  Apparently that wasn't an overriding concern when it came to VP8.

[15:02:00.0000] <cheeser>

[15:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: myself and jgraham live/work in Sweden. Our Norwegian is, uh, bad.

[15:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Also, you'll get by fine with just English

[15:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>

[15:45:00.0000] <cheeser>

w00t!

[15:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Nah, in the Linköping office

[15:45:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, kk.

[15:45:04.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Where all the cool stuff like Carakan happens ;P

[15:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: This is why it's somewhat notable both of us being in Oslo for the week of the CSS WG meeting

[15:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Was that just accidental, or were you guys coming down on purpose?

[15:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: In my case at least, I was going to be in Oslo some time this month anyway, and it made some sort of sense for it to be that week. He's primarily coming for it.

[15:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(made sense for it to be that week because of the meeting, that is)

[15:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[15:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(What I've been working on for the majority of my time since Carakan shipped in March is with a team which is completely in Oslo, except me)

[16:29:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: is it possible to put a challenge towards the IETF mailing list?

[16:30:00.0000] <micheil>
a challenge that is: every time they propose a new change to the protocol of websockets that they implement a working reference implementation which has a clean-ish API?

[16:30:01.0000] <micheil>
because I'm sure it's far easier to send an email than what it is to write some code to show your point.

Make thinking about it a SEP?

[06:23:00.0000] <Workshiva>
This talk about meta charset=utf-16 (yes, I'm a month behind) seems like an accident waiting to happen

[06:30:00.0000] <Workshiva>
"@srcdoc, for the first time, introduces HTML markup into attribute values. This is bad design."

[06:30:01.0000] <Workshiva>
But the alternative solution, using data: URLs, is of course completely cool

[06:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
A data: URI isn't markup, it's an identifier of a resource representation that contains markup

[06:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Totally different things

[06:34:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Of course

[06:34:02.0000] <Workshiva>
That's why it's completely cool

[06:35:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Wow, that's a lot of mail about @alt in private email

[06:45:00.0000] <Workshiva>
/me wonders how the mimeheads expect servers to be configured to provide correct audio and video codec subparameters in content-type without looking at the file contents

[06:49:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Workshiva: file ?

[06:50:00.0000] <Workshiva>
jcranmer: ?

[06:51:00.0000] <jcranmer>
use the file program

[06:51:01.0000] <jcranmer>
yes it looks at file contents, but you can assume it's a black box

[06:51:02.0000] <jcranmer>
and plead operational ig

[06:51:03.0000] <jcranmer>
norancce

[06:51:04.0000] <Workshiva>
Sure, but that's still sniffing

[06:52:00.0000] <jcranmer>
either that, or you require that the filename contains the codec in there

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Store the files with metadata

[06:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
either in the filesystem or in a database or something

[06:54:00.0000] <erlehmann>
use file extension :P

[06:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
rather than sticking with the boring old primitive view that one URL = one file on the disk

[06:54:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Well, you can replace file with resource representation

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
The representation already has content-type metdata so there's no problem from that point

[06:55:01.0000] <Workshiva>
We're at the stage where the server is trying to decide what to emit 

[07:49:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Is there a test suite for serving media files? I figured out I had to handle range-requests and send an X-Content-Duration request but am unsure if my ad-hoc webserver is doing it right.

[07:50:00.0000] <erlehmann>
And having curl as your only validation tool is kinda weak.

[07:50:01.0000] <Workshiva>
Try redbot.org

[07:58:00.0000] <erlehmann>
thx, interesting.

[08:08:00.0000] <erlehmann>
My content-lenght is 248 bytes too long. Everytime.

[08:08:01.0000] <erlehmann>
o.0

[08:58:00.0000] <micheil>
hmm... anne's not here anymore?

[09:00:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
<annevk5> anyway, boarding time

[09:01:00.0000] <micheil>
k, I didn't see the part message

[09:02:00.0000] <micheil>
hmm.. Is someone trying to change the WebSocket protocol further away from where it was starting to head?

[09:02:01.0000] <micheil>
or, rather proposing a different client-side API?

[09:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: no to the secod part. Possiblyt to the first part depending on what you meant

[09:05:01.0000] <micheil>
well, what's that thing on the hybi list about a)  sendTextMessage(char []buffer, int offset, int length); // JavaScript 16-bit text send

[09:06:00.0000] <micheil>
because the one thing I constantly hear from developers is how easy the client side websocket API is to work with.

[09:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: I think that was not about the js-api

[09:07:00.0000] <micheil>
I actually have a proposal for the client-side api (which is/should be backwards compatible), if we do get a consensus on the binary sending of data

[09:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
It was examples of possible api styles in general

[09:07:02.0000] <jgraham>
People seem to be interested in non-js clients

[09:07:03.0000] <micheil>
I'm thinking to indicate binary data, you would add on a second argument

[09:07:04.0000] <micheil>
there should be one client side api.

[09:08:00.0000] <micheil>
no matter what. Because really, why would you need to change it.

[09:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: If you build e.g. a python client the api will likely look different

[09:08:02.0000] <micheil>
not really

[09:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: Well python code is not necessarily evented

[09:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
depending on what you are doing

[09:09:02.0000] <micheil>
well, the sending on a websocket isn't evented at all.

[09:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
To take a more extreme example, a Haskell impl would likely be even more radical

[09:09:04.0000] <micheil>
it's actually blocking, iirc.

[09:09:05.0000] <jgraham>
Receiving is also part of the api

[09:09:06.0000] <micheil>
okay, true, functional programming languages would be different, but an object oriented or similar language would not

[09:10:00.0000] <micheil>
true

[09:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway, in the js case, you don't need any parameters to indicate binary or not

[09:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: (please don't murder me for mentioning Haskell)

[09:10:03.0000] <micheil>
yeah, you could use typeof

[09:10:04.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: What? You make no sense

[09:10:05.0000] <micheil>
(and similar methods)

[09:10:06.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Well every time I've mentioned Haskell on IRC with you around recently…

[09:10:07.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: in the implementation you just have send(data)

[09:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
and if data is a String you make a text frame and if it is a Blob you make a binary frame

[09:11:01.0000] <micheil>
currently a thing we do in node.js, is that in order to send non-utf8 data but by storing it as a string, we do something like:

[09:11:02.0000] <jgraham>
s/Blob/BinaryArray/ or whatever

[09:11:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: You still make no sense

[09:11:04.0000] <micheil>
socket.write("\xff", "binary");

[09:11:05.0000] <jgraham>
All I have said is that Haskell has a steep learning curve

[09:11:06.0000] <micheil>
if the second argument is blank, I believe it'll actually default to UTF8

[09:12:00.0000] <micheil>
or ascii

[09:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Why I would murder you because of that fact is not at all clear

[09:12:02.0000] <micheil>
which ever is the default set by socket.setEncoding

[09:12:03.0000] <jgraham>
I don't evcen think it is a controversial statement

[09:14:00.0000] <micheil>
annevk5: moin.

[09:14:01.0000] <annevk5>
hey hey

[09:15:00.0000] <annevk5>
discussion on list is about the wire format (well, apart from the current Shelby Moore entertainment)

[09:15:01.0000] <annevk5>
the API is unlikely to be affected

[09:15:02.0000] <micheil>
what's with that, any way?

[09:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
the wire format?

[09:16:01.0000] <annevk5>
it seems like we will get something more complicated

[09:17:00.0000] <micheil>
currently I'm really liking the direction of having a length indicator

[09:17:01.0000] <annevk5>
mostly due to Google

[09:17:02.0000] <annevk5>
sure

[09:17:03.0000] <micheil>
perhaps have two length indicators? The first which is the metadata length, the second which is the message length

[09:17:04.0000] <micheil>
if that's part of the issue?

[09:22:00.0000] <micheil>
annevk5: what's the issue google has with the protocol?

[09:25:00.0000] <annevk5>
they want more features in the initial version essentially

[09:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
gotta run

[09:26:01.0000] <micheil>
ouch

[09:26:02.0000] <micheil>
is there a list of these features?

[10:27:00.0000] <henrikbjorn>
from what i understand in the spec a <article> dosent have to includ a <header> is that right ?

[10:30:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Sounds right

[10:30:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
You'll probably want a h1, though

[11:24:00.0000] <henrikbjorn>
Ms2ger: the problem is the article is a comment and comments dont have a headline

[11:24:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
Then I guess it's fine

[17:44:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Workshiva, that looks good :) http://redbot.org/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgsoc2010.dieweltistgarnichtso.net%2Fwp-content-x%2Fplugins-x%2Fwordpress-cc-plugin%2Fembed-helper.php%3Fid%3D49

[19:05:00.0000] <jamesr>
Hixie: entities support is inconsistent

[19:05:01.0000] <jamesr>
Hixie: frex WebKit supports &percnt; but IE and FFx do not

[19:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
once everyone implements the spec, problem solved

[19:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
(you are right that today it's a mess)

[19:07:00.0000] <jamesr>
yeah, but it's causing compat issues today

[19:07:01.0000] <jamesr>
for example if you save a document in chrome and then open it in IE it's broken

[19:07:02.0000] <jamesr>
so right now we exclude some entities when you save a page in chrome

[19:07:03.0000] <jamesr>
which is not really good either

[19:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
why wouls saving have any effect

[19:07:05.0000] <jamesr>
and if you load up data:text/html;charset=utf-8,<html>%0A<body>%0Aamp:%20%26amp;%0A<br>%0Agt:%20%26gt;%0A<br>%0Apercnt:%20%26percnt;%0A<br>%0Ansup:%20%26nsup;%0A<br>%0Asupl:%20%26supl;%0A</body>%0A</html>%0A it looks different

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
the HTML serisalisation algorithm never serialises entities

[19:08:01.0000] <jamesr>
i'm not sure why the serialization code does that

[19:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
fix it :-)

[19:08:03.0000] <jamesr>
sure. but that page still looks different

[19:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[19:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's why we defined it once and for all

[19:12:00.0000] <jamesr>
so you took the superset of supported entities?

[19:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, i took whatever the mathml working group came up with -- my build script just slurps in their table and converts it to HTML each time i regen the spec

[19:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it is, i believe, a superset

[19:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
if there are any missing we can get them added

[02:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, are you testing invalid values as well for your reflecting tests?

[02:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, e.g. WebKit seems to just check if enctype contains "text" or "multipart" rather than check the full media type...

[02:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
/me was playing around with form.encoding

[04:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk5, I'm testing some invalid values, but it's hardly comprehensive.  For enums that are limited only to known values, I test the two values "" and "Something that's hopefully not defined here".

[04:15:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, if it's easy to add I suggest testing "xtext/plain" and "xtext" and "xmultipart" or some such

[04:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, if you are building a test suite that is

[04:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk5, I don't see any extra failures when I do that, on Chrome dev.

[04:17:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3Cform%20enctype%3D%22xtext%22%3E%3C/form%3E%0A%0A%3Cscript%3E%0A%20w(document.forms[0].enctype)%0A%3C/script%3E

[04:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[04:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I see it when I test manually.

[04:17:03.0000] <annevk5>
gives text/plain rather than application/x-... for me

[04:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me double-checks his text code

[04:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
s/text/test/

[04:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, whoops.

[04:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
How silly of me.

[04:19:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was using .concat() instead of .push().

[04:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
There we go.

[04:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://aryeh.name/tests/reflection.html

[04:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me thinks his tests might be wrong, though

[04:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me will look later

[04:26:02.0000] <annevk5>
sweet test suite

[04:27:00.0000] <micheil>
annevk5: did my _idea_ email actually reach the hybi mailing list?

[04:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
micheil: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg03269.html ?

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
micheil, yes

[04:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, something more is wrong with my enum tests.  I'll look later.

[04:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg03233.html - it's good to know that security can be proven from fundamental theorems of computer science and the laws of thermodynamics

[04:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
in Opera <button>.type is limited to known values per your test

[04:40:01.0000] <annevk5>
in Firefox too

[04:40:02.0000] <annevk5>
/me checks HTML5

[04:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
seems your test is wrong

[04:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anything under the "enum" column is limited to only known values.

[04:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Other enumerated attributes reflect as strings, so they're classified as strings.

[04:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, there's something buggy there.

[04:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll look at it later.

[04:43:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't see offhand from the code how it could possibly be expecting anything not on the list of known values.

[04:45:00.0000] <annevk5>
it seems to be expecting the input value for some

[04:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I dunno why.

[04:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, wait.

[04:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dur.

[04:45:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
No.

[04:45:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
unsigned long for <canvas> also seems wrong

[04:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
In what way?

[04:47:02.0000] <annevk5>
or maybe not

[04:47:03.0000] <annevk5>
nm

[04:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Browsers are inconsistent on that one.

[04:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But unsigned long seems to make the most sense.

[04:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
var tests = values; <-- Does this mean changes to tests will affect values too, in JavaScript?

[04:48:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
If so, that's my problem.

[04:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(then how do I get around it?)

[04:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't know much JS

[04:49:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, that would explain the infinite loop too.

[04:49:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
var tests = values.slice(0)?

[04:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
what do you want?

[04:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: "=" just copies the reference, it doesn't deep-copy the data structure

[04:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I want an independent copy.

[04:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
.slice(0) seems to work.

[04:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
Like values[:] in Python?

[04:51:03.0000] <annevk5>
http://my.opera.com/GreyWyvern/blog/show.dml/1725165 is the first hit on Google that explains this :)

[04:51:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me found that, yeah

[04:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, but now this uncovers the fact that my enum tests are wrong in all sorts of other ways.

[04:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll handle that later.

[04:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
heh

[04:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess I need to handle invalid value defaults and missing value defaults.

[04:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(as well as floats, token lists, and a whole bunch of other TODOs)

what adjective can we use to describe document.write in the cases where it implies a document.open()?

[12:58:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Destructive

[12:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[12:58:02.0000] <Workshiva>
I seem to recall 'blow away the current document' being common, so maybe something inspired by that

[12:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
destructive is good

[13:00:00.0000] <cheeser>
makes me think of:  xml is like violence; if it's not working, you're not using enough of it.

[14:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
Rik`, Safari has one of those?

[14:18:01.0000] <Rik`>
annevk5: yep, since Safari 5 I think

[14:18:02.0000] <annevk5>
oh god

[14:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Chrome has long had problems with W()

[14:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/W/w/

[14:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
I find if you write a constant string first it generally works

[14:19:03.0000] <Rik`>
so maybe that's this you're seeing, maybe that's note

[14:19:04.0000] <jgraham>
like w("a")

[14:19:05.0000] <Rik`>
-e

[14:19:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
The live DOM viewer totally failed to work for me on IE8.

[14:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because it reported reflected XSS.

[14:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(which is accurate, obviously)

[14:20:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah Live DOM Viewer + IE === disaster

[14:20:03.0000] <gsnedders>
And IE9?

[14:20:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me finds an annoying Opera bug which causes the cursor to disappear

[14:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>

[14:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I have a feeling it is known

[14:21:02.0000] <jgraham>
But I can check, obviously

[14:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Many bugs are known. That doesn't mean you shouldn't file another.

[14:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
did Hixie cave to the citing of number of bugs criticism? ;p

[14:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
though admittedly I also have some bugs filed that could do with an answer

[14:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: You appear to be encouraging the filing of duplicates, which is nonsensical

[14:24:02.0000] <jamesr>
refiling a known bug is great

[14:24:03.0000] <jamesr>
it means that it's not yet fixed

[14:24:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, IIRC, Live DOM Viewer works in IE9, maybe because it's pre-beta.

[14:24:05.0000] <jamesr>
which is always a question when i'm looking through our bug tracker at old bugs that are difficult for me to reproduce

[14:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jamesr, surely you should just update the existing bug to say it's still present.

[14:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: It tends to be less effort for someone who knows a duplicate exists to find the dulicate than for you

[14:25:02.0000] <jamesr>
that's even better

[14:25:03.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: live dom viewer used to work on IE8, when typing the code

[14:25:04.0000] <jamesr>
but most people don't want to try to find the correct bug

[14:25:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me agrees with gsnedders on that point

[14:25:06.0000] <gsnedders>
jamesr: Or simply it's hard to know what to search for in a lot of cases

[14:25:07.0000] <jamesr>
yeah

[14:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me spends around 30s looking for a dupe before filing

[14:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The number of extra dupes I find myself by spending 60x that amount of time is neglible

[14:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me too, maybe a couple of minutes

[14:26:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I think that depends on the bug tracker though. Some have better search than others

[14:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What annoys me is when I see a bug I _know_ is a duplicate but can't find the original

[14:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Totally.

[14:27:02.0000] <annevk5>
Rik`, so I guess I would have to disable that then?

[14:27:03.0000] <annevk5>
that sounds annoying

[14:27:04.0000] <annevk5>
I guess I can just use Chrome

[14:29:00.0000] <jamesr>
also it really bothers me when i'm trying to fix a bug and someone has attempted to helpfully filter down some bug reporting data but left out some important bit of data

[14:29:01.0000] <jamesr>
it's pretty hard to predict what data will actually be useful for fixing a bug. i often don't even know what data i want until i've spent a few hours digging through the code

[14:30:00.0000] <jamesr>
so i'd rather have a raw dump of way more data than i need and pick out the bits i really need. it's not hard to ignore extraneous data, much harder to reconstruct missing data. /rant

[14:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jamesr: Deal with more immature code, then it's easier. :)

[14:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The latest IEBlog post is kind of amusing.  "We think Google's plugin to disable Analytics for your machine is such a great idea that we'll tell you about it if you didn't know, and also tell you an even better way to do it without installing yet more of the plugins that make our browser slow and crashy and that we obviously hate."

[14:34:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: I find the fact that Microsoft explains how to disable a Google service much more interesting

[14:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, that was part of the interesting bit.

[14:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't get why people are so upset about Google's net neutrality thing.  It's a proposal for a compromise that (if you favor net neutrality) is an unambiguous win over the current situation, and a proposal that goes too much further would evidently be unlikely to pass, so why is anyone viewing it as some kind of betrayal or reversal?  It's just a compromise, no?

[14:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me thinks legislated net neutrality is probably a bad idea anyway, though, so . . .

[14:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, cool.  Wikipedia says Vint Cerf is in favor of legislated net neutrality, and Bob Kahn is against it.  Fight!

[14:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
is html5lib up to date?

[14:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
notwithstanding the changes i made today, i mean

[14:45:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, if you go from net neutrality everywhere to net neutrality just for non-wireless it seems quite clear why some people are upset

[14:45:01.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, especially if it seems to be just because of a business deal and not some realization that it is actually better

[14:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk5, they didn't say they don't support net neutrality on wireless in principle.  They explicitly stated that they want Congress to pass their proposal, so there's no reason to think they actually support it as an ideal solution or anything close, just an improvement.

[14:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's in the right direction, if you support net neutrality.

[14:48:00.0000] <annevk5>
they did not state

[14:48:01.0000] <annevk5>
that

[14:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Verizon and Google are pleased to discuss the principled compromise our companies have developed . . . a proposal that we hope will make a constructive contribution to the dialogue . . . Crafting a compromise proposal has not been an easy process, and we have certainly had our differences along the way. . . ."

[14:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Clearly billed as a compromise proposal to get the telecoms on their side, not something they view as ideal.

[14:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which they clarified even more explicitly in the follow-up blog post.

[14:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
"But given political realities, this particular issue has been intractable in Washington for several years now. . . . We’re not saying this solution is perfect, but we believe that a proposal that locks in key enforceable protections for consumers is preferable to no protection at all."

[14:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
I read it

[14:52:01.0000] <annevk5>
it seems like a lot of handwaving to me

[14:52:02.0000] <annevk5>
nothing concrete

[14:52:03.0000] <annevk5>
it doesn't state what part they consider to be a compromise and in what way, etc.

[14:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
anyway, maybe NYT (or who wrote that again?) is right and America should just get more broadband competition

[14:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, obviously.  Net neutrality isn't a big problem for me in practice, but customer service is atrocious.  I have basically one real choice for broadband here.

[14:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It took like an hour on the phone to get a new IP address assigned to my account.  Seriously.

[14:54:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No government regulation's going to improve that.  And if you've got more competition, net neutrality is less of an issue too (if it's really an issue to start with).

[14:55:00.0000] <annevk5>
you might need some regulation to improve competition actually

[14:55:01.0000] <annevk5>
for instance in the Netherlands network operators are required to allow others to use their market (against some price) so they can be an internet provider without having to have their own network

[14:56:00.0000] <annevk5>
I think that goes for much of Europe

[14:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, that's often true.  Like requiring them to allow competitors to use their network at reasonable rates.  In my bedroom, I often lose T-Mobile connectivity but have Verizon, so why the heck shouldn't I be able to just use whichever network has the strongest signal right here?

[14:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, it would make a lot of sense to have all the nearby towers that your phone can detect bid on who will route your call on a call-by-call basis, instead of having to choose in advance.

[14:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then you could have a small startup that could provide cell service in only a small area, so you'd use that where it's cheapest and switch to a big network like AT&T when you're elsewhere.

[15:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Currently you have to set up a ridiculously huge network to get any customers.  I'd think it would be easier for wired ISPs, though, since they just have to hook you up to a backbone . . . why aren't people setting up ISPs that initially only cover a few blocks or whatever?

[15:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me shrugs

[15:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
startup costs are prolly pretty big

[15:02:00.0000] <Rik`>
or you could have the network infrastructure built and run by a state company

[15:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, big like ten million or ten billion?  It's pretty easy to get a handful million dollars for a startup.  That should be enough to set up a small datacenter and hook up some customers.

[15:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless it's too hard to lay lines, which might be a problem.

[15:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, unlikely to be a popular idea in the United States.  :)

[15:03:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Should be

[15:03:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(although state monopolies are often less horrible than private monopolies, which are what we sometimes have now)

[15:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me needs to monitor the ratio of off-topic bytes per minute here posted by him vs. everyone else, and scale output accordingly

[15:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll go do some Wikimedia stuff now and then work on my test suite some more.

[15:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: (python version of course)

[15:07:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, a few customers does not a business make :) might be interesting to see how Google's experiment goes with providing fast internet (what speed was it again?) to a small town

[15:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you start with a few customers and grow.

[15:08:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: oh, talking about wikimedia, is there an update on the mobile website to display the list of languages for an article ?

[15:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think they were laying fiber optics directly to the house, which means basically unlimited last-mile speed, you're limited by routers.

[15:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: k. well, it no longer is, i just made a bunch of spec changes. :-)

[15:08:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: BTW we should make the parser work with .innerHTML on non-HTML content

[15:08:04.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: OK

[15:08:05.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I will likely fix tomorrow

[15:08:06.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: the spec parser?

[15:08:07.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: yeah

[15:08:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, you mean you want the language list on the mobile version?  I'm guessing that's just omitted, to save bytes.

[15:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Then we can add the API as soon as we can convinve people it is a good idea :)

[15:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
*convince

[15:09:02.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: in fact, I just want to see if there is an english or french version

[15:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, you can use the full version, I guess.

[15:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
Because it seems bizzare that <div>.innerHTML = "<math><mo> ..." works but not <math>.innerHTML = "<mo> ..."

[15:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, I would expect us to implement <svg>.innerHTML at least at some point

[15:11:01.0000] <Rik`>
"to save bytes" :)

[15:11:02.0000] <Rik`>
I don't mind getting the list of languages after an XHR call

[15:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, are you willing to write the code?  :)

[15:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: what happens today if you do that? Do we not reset the insertion mode appropriately?

[15:23:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: I might yeah

[15:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, unfortunately I'm not quite sure where to submit it.  I have some recollection that the developer of the mobile site decided it'd be a great idea to write it in Ruby and put it in his own personal git repository rather than in PHP and using Wikimedia's SVN.

[15:26:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: well, if you find a way to contribute, tell me

[15:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: That is the first problem. The second is if you enter something like "</svg>" it all goes to hell

[15:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
So you need some special cases for the fragment mode

[15:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
that link relation registration discussion is getting irritating. Hixie, can we just remove the IANA registry crap from the spec, since it's obviously a complete failure, and its advocates clearly have no interest in actually addressing the needs of HTML

[15:38:01.0000] <seankoole>
What's Wg man

[15:39:00.0000] <seankoole>
everything wg'in over there

[15:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
so let's just stop pretending that the IANA registry applies to HTML, and create a better system that provides a simple registration form, some small moderation to prevent spam and the ability to get machine readable link relation data from it in JSON or plain text

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: ah, yeah

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: can we "v2" this issue for now? I'd love to get innerHTML actually interoperable before we start extending it...

[15:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: done

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: please see mike's comment in bug 10002

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
was the decision to use <figcaption> a poll decision? and if so, does anyone remember when it was made? I can't see it on the list of wg decisions, but the list seems out of date

[16:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I remember it as resolved by consensus.

[16:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or, specifically, the people who objected deciding not to bother with a change proposal.

[16:19:00.0000] <hober>
Hixie: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0032.html

[16:20:00.0000] <hober>
more specifically, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0344.html

[16:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
there, i resolved a bunch of bugs

[16:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
hopefully that will get people off my back for a short while and i can go back to dealing with whatwg e-mails

[16:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Are whatwg e-mails generally more useful or important than bugs?

[16:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
they're older

[16:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what's the current oldest unanswered email?

[16:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also, thanks for resolving some bugs

[16:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
Oldest e-mail is from march 2007, but it's in a folder i've put on hold (datagrid). Oldest e-mail that isn't on hold is from March this year.

[17:40:00.0000] <rubys>
$ curl --head http://www.whatwg.org/

[17:40:01.0000] <rubys>
curl: (7) couldn't connect to host

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm rebooting it

[17:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
it should be up momentarily

[17:41:02.0000] <rubys>
cool, thx

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
the server's been acting flaky for a couple of weeks now, but i can't work out exactly what's wrong which makes it hard to report

[17:44:00.0000] <rubys>
while I hadn't thought deeply about it until now, I guess I'm amazed that it is just one server.

[17:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's a VM that's hosting a dozen or so domains running on a shared server that itself is probably running dozens of VMs

[17:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, i've escalated this to a proper outage request, it's not responding to my requests to reboot

[17:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
i expect some disk died or something

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, it's up again

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
ish

[17:49:00.0000] <rubys>
lol.  I noticed that some things seem sluggish... the first thing I noted was the simple serving of /images/logo took a several seconds.  Subsequent requests were fine.

[17:51:00.0000] <rubys>
... anyway, I assume that you are on top of it, and it will get resolved (either fixed where it is, or the site will move to a more reliable host, or whatever)

[18:32:00.0000] <nessy>
is the whatwg server hosted at Google? just curious..

[18:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
nessy: Dreamhost

[18:40:00.0000] <nessy>
ah, ok - I expected Google to manage having servers up all the time, but I kinda do that from Dreamhost, too - anyway, good luck debugging the problems!

[23:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
is it normal for a php.cgi process to be long lived?

[23:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
php5.cgi, sorry

[23:58:00.0000] <annevk5>
i suppose it could be if it's doing heavy processing

[23:58:01.0000] <annevk5>
but I believe typically they're done rather fast

[23:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's what i thought

[23:59:01.0000] <Peter`>
lighttpd tends to spawn one of these for each process

[23:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
some of the blog php5.cgis and some of the wiki php5.cgis have been running for more than 15 minutes

[23:59:03.0000] <Peter`>
depends on the way the httpd communicates with them I guess, are they using resources?

[00:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
over 60 megs of RAM each

[00:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
maybe we should get some more caching for the blog?

[00:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
gruber makes fun of taking down wordpress blogs all the time too... so not sure if that'd help

[00:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem isn't the blog

[00:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's something fishy with the server

[00:07:02.0000] <annevk5>
oh, maybe today the XHR test suite will start to work

[00:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
btw, about this registry stuff

[00:48:00.0000] <annevk5>
the XPointer people didn't use IANA either and have set up a registry that is pretty much what we want

[00:48:01.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.w3.org/2005/04/xpointer-schemes/

[00:48:02.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.w3.org/2005/04/xpointer-policy.html

[00:48:03.0000] <annevk5>
"first come, first served", put directly in the registry, and then subject to further review

[00:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
URL to a detailed spec is optional

[00:49:01.0000] <annevk5>
it requires a W3C account, but everyone can get one of those

[00:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd prefer a system that put less of a load on w3c staff and relied more on an open community, but otherwise yeah, that's pretty much what we need

[00:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm going to suggest to my fellow co-chairs that it's time for alternate / counter proposals, so if anyone wants to suggest a registry in that style, that would make a reasonable proposal

[00:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that does seem like a much more lightweight approach

[00:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
right, I'd still prefer a wiki over the thing above

[00:58:00.0000] <annevk5>
if someone prefers nice export et al they can write a wiki-to-JSON bridge

[00:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if anyone wants to propose using the wiki that is fine too

[00:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't care that much how this all works

[00:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I think a wiki sucks for purposes of consumption the validator

[00:59:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and the validator is one of the most important consumers for this data

[01:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would not expect a random wiki page to retain a sufficiently consistent format that you could soundly screen-scrape it to JSON

[01:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
Henri already wrote a wiki scraper for UI strings

[01:04:01.0000] <annevk5>
on purpose, since he could have hosted them in the repository or some such instead

[01:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
so I think that concern is rather theoretical

[01:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
a wiki has an auth system, it has lots of people looking at it, it deals with spam, etc.

[01:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems needlessly sloppy to me

[01:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
there's really no benefit to the wiki page being a free-form editable piece of text

[01:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it doesn't really need the ability to be anything but a table with the appropriate N columns or whatever

[01:06:04.0000] <annevk5>
sure, but having to write new software to do everything a wiki already does is no benefit either

[01:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I could also imagine a setup where you use a wiki page for provisional registration, and something more structured for full "approved" registration

[01:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
since the later is the only part that affects conformance

[01:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well, in theory anyway

[01:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
IIRC the HTML5 spec does not define how the contents of the wiki affect conformance

[01:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hmm I guess it does say now

[01:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and it says both "proposed" and "ratified" count as conforming

[01:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
strikes me as more generous than necessary (fail to validate, edit wiki, step 3 profit?)

[01:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but as I said, I don't care much about the details here

[01:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
proposed should prolly be a warning of some sorts

[02:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: there is one benefit to it being a free-form editable piece of text -- the code to do that already exists.

[02:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
and is deployed

[02:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
and has an active spam-fighting community

[02:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
(hober)

[02:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, and the HTML4.01 spec is already written and been published as REC

[02:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there's lots of things we could choose not to do because something exists

[02:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not saying this case is of nearly equal importance

[02:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure, i'm just disagreeing with "there's really no benefit to the wiki page being a free-form editable piece of text"

[02:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm happy to have something better

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
but unless someone steps up and writes the code for it, that's theoretical.

[02:11:01.0000] <annevk5>
and maintains it

[02:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i think it would be better to have a wiki on the w3c's site than the whatwg site, btw)

[02:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
(wikipedia or wikibooks would be even better if they were up for it)

[02:13:00.0000] <annevk5>
maybe they can create wikistry

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[02:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that would probably deliver more of a promise of long-term continuity and be politically more congenial to some

[02:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
still strikes me personally as too unstructured

[02:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I have already talked way too much about a topic I profess to care little about

[02:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[02:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: We can leave the innerHTML-on-foreign-content stuff to "v2" of course, but I would expect it to be in demand given that many js libraries rely heavily on innerHTML

[02:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
and will presumably be used in more situations with mixed namespace content once it is supported in text/html

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: yeah, agreed

[02:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok bed time

[02:36:01.0000] <Hixie>

gsnedders: I think I drink about a gallon of green tea before lunch

[02:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and two gallons after

[02:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: I normally drink a lot of green tea, but today has been black

[02:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can't drink that much black tea

[02:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it gives me ick mouth after a point

[02:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if I drank that much coffee, i'm pretty sure I'd have to be hospitalized

[02:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ewww, coffee

[02:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: btw, I get the impression you have lost interest, but I will soon be unleashing on you an enhancement patch for anolis

[02:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if nothing else it should provide you with some laughing-at-my-expense entertainment value

[02:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: I've said as much

[02:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, at this will olet you get a glimpse of my, um, approach to coding

[02:59:02.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: I'll probably dump the code I have for Anolis 2 somewhere public soon and just let anyone who wants xdoc support to get it to work

[02:59:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, well, I'll have something you can add to the dump

[03:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and possibly something you can contribute to the Daily WTF and get an award or something

[03:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hugs MikeSmith 

[03:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Self-confidence!

[03:01:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: your code is nice and refined, like a jeweler working on a watch movement

[03:01:03.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: …

[03:01:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
mine is like a guy bashing a TV on the side to make it show a better picture

[03:01:05.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: Anolis was the first thing I ever wrote in Python. It's horrific.

[03:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[03:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
you ain't seen nothing yet

[03:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I've written cleaner Perl than the Python of Anolis.

[03:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, I've seen plenty of bad code.

[03:02:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will say that this exercise of trying to add a new feature to anolis has given me a whole new appreciation for the etree API

[03:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which is not saying much, because my appreciation for that API was previously zero

[03:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I would not have ever tried to use it unless it seemed like the quickest and bash-the-TV-iest way to get done what I wanted to get done

[03:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but now that I've messed around with it a bit, I have to say it has its own appeal

[03:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
kind of like Bizarro Superman

[03:04:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It has some fairly horrible flaws, though

[03:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
true that

[03:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
The etree api as implemented in lxml is pretty good

[03:05:02.0000] <jgraham>
Could do with a .textContent

[03:05:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it doesn't have one of its own?

[03:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
.text_content() ?

[03:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or is that part of lxml?

[03:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah

[03:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
Umm, maybe it does now

[03:06:04.0000] <gsnedders>
You can't do anything better than etree.to_string(node, type="unicode")

[03:06:05.0000] <gsnedders>
oh, lxml.html does

[03:06:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Odd

[03:06:07.0000] <jgraham>
"".join(node.xpath(".//text()"))

[03:06:08.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Slow, comparitively

[03:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Anolis used to do that)

[03:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
i recall this thing:

[03:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
etree.tostring(foo, method='text')

[03:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
return etree.tostring(Element, encoding=unicode, method='text', with_fail=False) is what Anolis does now

[03:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think I used that etree.tostring(foo, method='text') for about 3 seconds, before I found some right-er way of doing it

[03:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
anolislib.utils.textContent(foo)

[03:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[03:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, it's a nice respite for the pain of working with native W3C DOM directly

[03:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
s/respite for/respite from/

[03:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the entire W3C DOM should be enshrined in Daily WTF in a place of high honor

[03:11:01.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, adding more features to XMLHttpRequest Level 2 while change requests are ongoing for Level 1

[03:11:02.0000] <annevk5>
this is gonna be fun

[03:11:03.0000] <annevk5>
maybe I should wait

[03:13:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, I think that leaves CSS values

[03:13:01.0000] <annevk5>
I don't really like working on that

[03:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
W3C DOM Daily WTF award: The guy who couldn't conceive that path/selector node selection is way better the constant redundant tree walking all the freaking time

[03:13:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
what is CSS values?

[03:13:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
a political document?

[03:13:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
that should be a lot of fun to work on

[03:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
its like ele.style.values.width.px++

[03:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[03:14:02.0000] <annevk5>
it's even

[03:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
even?

[03:15:01.0000] <annevk5>
but I guess I should at least take a stab at it, working on XHR2 can wait a little longer, and I'm not sure if I want to start on Web DOM Core just yet

[03:15:02.0000] <annevk5>
it's rather than its

[03:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
correcting a typo

[03:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[03:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Web Notifications fun will be ramping up pretty soon

[03:16:03.0000] <annevk5>
I think Web DOM Core might be my next challenge in cleaning up legacy stuff

[03:16:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, do that

[03:16:05.0000] <annevk5>
ah yeah, that will be my challenge at adding cruft to the platform that creates future legacy problems ;p

[03:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[03:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"and people thought pop-up windows *within* their browser were annoying..."

[03:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's what people will be saying next year

[03:18:02.0000] <annevk5>
hopefully we do it right

[03:18:03.0000] <annevk5>
harhar

[03:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least there's no additional telcons

[03:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hopefully

[03:20:00.0000] <annevk5>
as long as I remain chair that seems unlikely

[03:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I like your chairing already

[03:21:01.0000] <Peter`>
lol

[03:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
keep it up

[04:27:00.0000] <annevk5>
complicated: http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/cssom

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk5>
now i wonder what license the IANA registry is under

[04:29:01.0000] <annevk5>
i guess that issue was never solved...

[04:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Presumably the typical "look but don't touch" licenses

[05:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
<!doctype html><form><table></form><form></table></form>

[05:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
Is it me or is that broken with the changes to make <form> in <table> set the form pointer

[05:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
or it could just be bad wording in the spec

[05:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
But when you hit the final <form> there is *a* form element in scope; the first one

[05:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
But that is not the one the form element pointer points to

[05:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
so when you try to remove the one the form element pointer points to, badness happens

[05:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
The end tag ... form stuff says "the stack of open elements does not have node in scope", but the scope stuff only deals with elements of a specific type (presumably meaning (ns, name)), not specific nodes

[05:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
No wait I am misreading

[05:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
OK so the problem is that _almost_always_ you just look for an element with a specific name

[05:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
But the algorithm is wordded so that you are always looking for a specific ID

[05:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/id/node/

[06:02:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, not much spec updates but email is now below 400

[06:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
might be lowest point in 3-4 years

[06:04:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
It was at zero last October, wasn't it?

[06:04:01.0000] <annevk5>
that seems unlikely

[06:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
I have email from 2006 here :)

[06:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
Which spec do you mean?

[06:05:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
Oh, you

[06:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Wasn;t it 0 excluding datagrid or something

[06:06:01.0000] <annevk5>
Philip`, various; cssom; cssom view; xhr; xhr2; etc.

[06:07:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html?period=6 is slightly worse

[06:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
"Estimated date for last e-mail based on the data above: 2006-02-02"

[06:09:01.0000] <annevk5>
it says 2013-03-20 here

[06:09:02.0000] <jgraham>
Set it to period=12

[06:10:00.0000] <annevk5>
when set to max it gives 2011-07-19

[06:10:01.0000] <annevk5>
heh

[06:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hint taht your estimation algorithm is bad: it depends on the amount of data you are displaying :)

[06:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
to be fair it does state that

[06:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's not like it'd be less wildly inaccurate and meaningless if it used more of the data

[06:11:02.0000] <matjas>
Is there such a thing as XHTML5 + RDFa? I found http://dev.w3.org/html5/rdfa/rdfa-module.html — does this mean it’s just not available yet?

[06:11:03.0000] <jgraham>
Well only if you consider "the data above" to be the range that you happen to be displaying

[06:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
rather than the full dataset

[06:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wants a sing-along (heck, just a DVD would be a start) copy of Avenue Q :D :D :D

[06:15:00.0000] <matjas>
Re: XHTML5 + RDFa — I'm asking because a client of mine explicitly asked for XHTML + RDFa. Do I have to use old-school XHTML 1 + RDFa or is there a way for me to use (X)HTML5 here?

[06:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wants to never hear the words "singalong" and "gsnedders" in the same sentence without the words "will be forbidden from"

[06:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Aww, even though you missed the Sound of Music sing-along at the weekend?

[06:15:03.0000] <jgraham>
"missed"

[06:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It was awesome.

[06:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/esome/ful/

[06:17:01.0000] <annevk5>
matjas, dunno, we don't do RDFa

[06:17:02.0000] <annevk5>
matjas, tell him about Microdata

[06:17:03.0000] <annevk5>
or her

[06:17:04.0000] <gsnedders>
or them

[06:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
or everyone really

[06:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
up to you ;p

[06:18:02.0000] <matjas>
annevk5: sadly, there's no convincing him. His company provides "XML and RDFa services"…

[06:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
So what we're saying is because you asked a question about RDFa you have to become a Microdata evangelist now

[06:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
to atone for your sins

[06:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me almost types sines

[06:19:03.0000] <matjas>
he just asked for "XHTML+RDFa"; I'm sure he's not gonna make any use of RDFa though.

[06:19:04.0000] <annevk5>
matjas, there was this article on ALA about nicely rejecting clients ;p

[06:19:05.0000] <annevk5>
matjas, but euh, there some proposal for HTML5+RDFa

[06:20:00.0000] <matjas>
annevk5: haha. wish i was popular enough to just do that :)

[06:20:01.0000] <matjas>
annevk5: this? http://dev.w3.org/html5/rdfa/rdfa-module.html

[06:20:02.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-in-html/

[06:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/rdfa/ is the editor's draft

[06:23:00.0000] <matjas>
Hmm, so atm <html version="HTML+RDFa 1.1" lang="en"> is the way to go. Sadly the HTML5 spec considers this an error, since @version is obsolete. :'(

[06:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
You could probably invoke the "other applicable specifications" clause

[06:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since I think they made an @version specification

[06:29:00.0000] <matjas>
I guess I’ll have to stick to XHTML1+RDFa then. *cries*

[06:29:01.0000] <matjas>
I’d love to tell my client he doesn’t really need it, but that would be the equivalent of telling him to start a new business

[06:29:02.0000] <matjas>
DO NOT WANT

[06:34:00.0000] <annevk5>
you can map RDF to Microdata

[06:34:01.0000] <annevk5>
why not do that?

[06:54:00.0000] <matjas>
annevk5: heh, wut? got an example of that?

[07:00:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
matjas, http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#examples-4 is one example

[07:01:00.0000] <matjas>
Thanks

[07:02:00.0000] <annevk5>
so Ms2ger, wdyt, attempt to remove lowsrc as well or keep it? Firefox has the ability to figure it out, but I'm not sure how much they like being guinea pigs :)

no i didn't

[07:41:00.0000] <boblet>
hey all, I wrote some stuff about microformats in HTML5 http://html5doctor.com/microformats/

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, forgot to get back to my WAI-ARIA comments

[07:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
guess it's too late now :/

[08:02:00.0000] <annevk5>
it's still hopelessly complicated too

[08:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
e.g. http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/20100616/roles#textalternativecomputation

[08:03:01.0000] <annevk5>
would be interesting to see the test suite for that section

[08:37:00.0000] <annevk5>
whoa, that took long

[08:37:01.0000] <annevk5>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pfwg-comments/2010JulSep/0023.html

[08:56:00.0000] <cheeser>
how close are we to a stable-ish websocket spec?

[08:56:01.0000] <cheeser>
trying to decide if should update to the latest spec now or just wait a bit.

[08:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Good question.

[08:56:03.0000] <cheeser>
it's likely the browsers haven't caught up anyway

[08:58:00.0000] <annevk5>
cheeser, about as close as yesterday or a couple of weeks ago

[08:59:00.0000] <cheeser>
yeah.  that's what i'm afraid of.  ;)

[08:59:01.0000] <cheeser>
i think the only real change i'm missing is the frame formatting

[09:00:00.0000] <cheeser>
which, i have to say, i'm excited about.  makes frame parsing much simpler.

[09:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
cheeser: The editor changed and the new one wants something much more complex

[09:00:02.0000] <jgraham>
Unless that is what you mean

[09:01:00.0000] <cheeser>
i mean the change that made all frame length delimited.

[09:01:01.0000] <cheeser>
is Hixie no longer the editor?

[09:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
He is editing the API

[09:01:03.0000] <jgraham>
Ian Fette is editing the protocol

[09:01:04.0000] <jgraham>
He wants something way more complex

[09:01:05.0000] <cheeser>
ah

[09:01:06.0000] <cheeser>
any url on that?  or a mailing list?

[09:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
looking....

[09:02:01.0000] <cheeser>
looks like maybe thehybi list

[09:02:02.0000] <smaug____>
was it actually announced somewhere that I.Fette is the new editor

[09:02:03.0000] <smaug____>
/me needs to read all the hybi emails

[09:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
smaug____: Yeah, on the list

[09:03:01.0000] <cheeser>
i'm afraid to sign for that list.  it's not *entirely* job related excpet for the websockets bits.

[09:03:02.0000] <cheeser>
so what's he want?

[09:03:03.0000] <jgraham>
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg03154.html

[09:03:04.0000] <jgraham>
cheeser: It is all WebSockets related now

[09:03:05.0000] <jgraham>
But it is fairly high traffic

[09:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
My long term average is to read about 30% of the mail

[09:05:00.0000] <cheeser>
ouch

[09:05:01.0000] <jre>
cheeser, if your job has to do with websockets, it seems really strange if you aren't following the mailing list where the protocol is being developed.

[09:05:02.0000] <cheeser>
i'm not entirely sure how to read that "image"

[09:05:03.0000] <cheeser>
wth?

[09:05:04.0000] <cheeser>
wtf was that?

[09:05:05.0000] <cheeser>
:)

[09:05:06.0000] <jgraham>
That was Julian I guess

[09:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dunno why he joined to say that one thing

[09:06:01.0000] <annevk5>
that's his style

[09:06:02.0000] <cheeser>
or how he even knew about it

[09:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
At least we know who reads the logs now :)

[09:06:04.0000] <annevk5>
irc logs

[09:06:05.0000] <cheeser>
heh

[09:06:06.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, that's nothing new

[09:06:07.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: I knjow :)

[09:07:00.0000] <annevk5>
though i wonder if he runs some kind of script as refreshing it all the time seems rather time consuming

[09:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
cheeser: Anyway, the diagram is, I think just bits across the top

[09:07:02.0000] <jgraham>
split into 32 bit lines

[09:08:00.0000] <cheeser>
yeah.  i was noticing that.  so the payload length is either 7bits or 64bits long if the frame-length == 127

[09:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Something like that

[09:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: Maybe he has a script that outputs it to his irc window

[09:12:00.0000] <cheeser>
i should subscribe, though.  i'll just have to manage the volume of it.  i end up skimming enough of the dev lists i'm already on.  and if it is mostly WS these days, it can't hurt.

[09:12:01.0000] <cheeser>
are these framing questions also a subset of hybi then?

[09:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
In what way?

[09:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
They are about WebSockets

[09:13:02.0000] <cheeser>
i'm not sure what the relationship between websockets and hybi is.

[09:13:03.0000] <jgraham>
The HyBi list is currently focused entirely on WebSockets

[09:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
It is of course not impossible that that will change in the future

[09:14:01.0000] <cheeser>
seems like WS is a bidi addition on top of HTTP while hybi is really looking at replacing all of HTTP with something a bit more modern and bidi in general

[09:14:02.0000] <jgraham>
You might be thinking od spdy? That's not really related

[09:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
WebSockets is only really tangentially related to HTTP

[09:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
It's just 2 way comunication that works with the requirements of browsers

[09:15:02.0000] <cheeser>
right.  i get the websocket/http distinction.

[09:15:03.0000] <jgraham>
So hybi is a bit of a misnomer

[09:16:00.0000] <cheeser>
isn't hybi a full protocol spec?

[09:16:01.0000] <cheeser>
or more of just an umbrella project?

[09:16:02.0000] <jgraham>
hybi doesn't really exit

[09:16:03.0000] <jgraham>
*exist

[09:16:04.0000] <jgraham>
it is just the name of the mailing list

[09:16:05.0000] <cheeser>
oh, i see.

[09:16:06.0000] <jgraham>
not a concrete technology

[09:16:07.0000] <cheeser>
i thought it was an actuall proposed spec

[09:17:00.0000] <cheeser>
i see.  and spdy then is the actuall "let's get rid of http and use this" tech then.  yes?

[09:19:00.0000] <cheeser>
so how do I subscribe to that mailing list?  not seeing anything in the messages in the archive or on the ietf site

[09:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hybi

[09:20:00.0000] <cheeser>
ah.  just found that.  thanks.

[09:20:01.0000] <olivvv>
hi. quick question, is there in the whole package to come with html5, things that allow to communicate with locally installed apps ?

[09:21:00.0000] <olivvv>
its possible in with flash, java applets 

[09:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
olivvv: No. What are you trying to achieve?

[09:23:00.0000] <cheeser>
there.  signed up.

[09:24:00.0000] <cheeser>
how stable is spdy?  is that on topic here?  i've been eyeballing implementing that in glassfish/grizzly as well.

[09:24:01.0000] <olivvv>
jgraham:Computer - telephony Integration

[09:25:00.0000] <olivvv>
jgraham:its for a call center, using a small soft, the clients can provided cc number through the phone without the operator to see it

[09:26:00.0000] <olivvv>
this software needs then to communicate with the webapp in the browser

[09:27:00.0000] <olivvv>
anyone ?

[09:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
cheeser: There is not much that is off-topic here (see the /topic) but I don;t think most people follow spdy closely

[09:28:01.0000] <cheeser>
/me nods.

[09:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
olivvv: I'm not sure that is possible. It at least sounds like a non-Web use case which is typically not such a high priority

[09:29:01.0000] <cheeser>
spdy seems mostly a google effort at this point but it's certainly intriguing

[09:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
olivvv: Although maybe it could work with <device> or so somehow

[09:30:00.0000] <olivvv>
jgraham: I know it is strange, but since flash and applets are able to do that, I thought somebody would have thought of a standard alternative

[09:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
olivvv: Communicating with local devices is generally hard because there are all sorts of security problems

[09:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
But the <device> element is under development for e.g. video cameras

[09:32:00.0000] <olivvv>
jgraham:thx I ll google that

[09:50:00.0000] <sean`>
up

[10:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yay progress: http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/08/16/dnssectls.html

[10:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me would not mind getting rid of CAs if that was possible

[10:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
that blog is pretty interesting

[10:49:01.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html

[10:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
apparently Google Chrome is using SPDY to some extent already?

[10:51:00.0000] <cheeser>
seems like it supports it, yeah.

[10:51:01.0000] <cheeser>
i'm not aware of any servers that do, though.

[10:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
it says Google servers do

[10:52:01.0000] <cheeser>
what do they run, do you know?

[10:52:02.0000] <cheeser>
not stock anything i'm aware of.

[11:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
whatwg.org is kind of flaky sometimes.  Maybe it should get better hosting.

[11:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(w3.org isn't perfect either, but it seems to be more reliable, which makes us look bad)

[11:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: there's some problem that's been affecting stability recently. hardware or something. not sure what, still studying it.

[11:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is innocent… this time.

[11:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The ellipsis character looks very annoying in fixed-width fonts.

[11:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: did you see my comment about bug 10002? (i think it was 10002)

[11:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't know why it exists, it's usually much narrower than an ellipsis is supposed to be, even in proportional fonts

[11:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: See what myself and MikeSmithX discussed earlier

[11:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
k

[11:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
in #whatwg?

[11:51:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[11:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
got it

[12:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh cool, dreamhost replied to my extremely vague request. They've done something to fix the problem and they'll move us to another server if the problems continue anyway.

[12:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe you should upgrade to dedicated hosting.

[12:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure, send me the money to fund it and i'll get right on that :-)

[12:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is dedicated hosting really so much more expensive?

[12:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
right now the dreamhost hosting is essentially free

[12:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
How does that work out?

[12:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
the money i get back on referrals is higher than the cost of my account

[12:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
and my account has unlimited everything -- bandwidth, disk, domains, users, etc

[12:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
because i've been a customer for so long

[12:08:02.0000] <Mukke|home>
i wonna implement html 5, where to start ?

[12:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me cringes at a VPS provider claiming to provide "unlimited" anything

[12:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: "unlimited" just means they don't charge me by the byte or whatnot

[12:08:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah.

[12:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
if i run out of disk, they move me to a machine with more disk

[12:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
etc

[12:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I say all this as someone whose personal website is hosted on a machine I happen to run, where the main site costs $500/month for bandwidth alone, so I haven't really had any reason to look into the lower end of the market.

[12:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
for the last 6 months of hosting several dozen domains and subdomains i've paid $21

[12:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Mukke|home, you should start by saying "What features do I want to add that my users will want?", and go from there.  If you just want to be able to claim that your pages are HTML5, change the doctype to <!doctype html>, run it through validator.nu, and fix all the errors it reports.

[12:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is probably not worth the effort, though.

[12:11:02.0000] <Mukke|home>
yeh

[12:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, well, I've paid $0, since I don't pay the bills for my server.  I just freeload.  :)

[12:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[12:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
In exchange for having fun administering the machine as root.

[12:12:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like fixing it when we have downtime.

[12:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
i have root too, but don't have to admin it :-)

[12:12:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, that's the disadvantage of colocation, you have to handle everything.

[12:12:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Down to failed hardware.

[12:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It sure saves on cost, though.

[12:13:01.0000] <Mukke|home>
AryehGregor,  i never have written html 4 like i should have, i wanno do it right and with proper coding in html 5 now

[12:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Mukke|home, you can use http://validator.nu/ as a guide to see if your website is good HTML5.  You might also look at: http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/

[12:16:00.0000] <Mukke|home>
AryehGregor,  i need a special featere and i'm almost sure it doesn't excists that whyi came here aswell

[12:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then ask.

[12:16:02.0000] <Mukke|home>
can i shape a div hexagon ?

[12:17:00.0000] <Mukke|home>
or any elemnt at all that can have a background_image

[12:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, all elements in CSS are boxes.

[12:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
This might be a question for #css, though.

[12:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Case canonicalization for reflected enumerated attributes limited to known values"

[12:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I like it when you can write massive strings of gibberish like that and they're actually the only reasonable way to refer to something, not gratuitous at all.

[12:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
My favorite math theorem name is "Parametrized Transfinite Recursion Theorem".

[13:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Where the verb there?

[13:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Where's the verb where?

[13:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Indeed.

[13:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[13:05:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(Freudian slip?)

[13:05:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, wait, this is weirder than I thought.

[13:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nobody seems to be properly implementing IDL gets at all on reflected enumerated attributes limited to known values.

[13:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Except maybe IE.

[13:06:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me admits to copy-pasting the phrase "reflected enumerated attributes limited to known values"

[13:06:03.0000] <cheeser>
ugh.  CORBA flashbacks.

[13:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think I pressed Ctrl-Shift-W or something by mistake.

[13:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Whoever decided to make an easy-to-press way to quit in any application, ever, deserves to be smacked on the head.

[13:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
i hit command-q instead of command-w all the time

[13:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
drives me crazy

[13:09:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Good thing I have a shell script that positions my XChat windows exactly as I want them on startup.

[13:09:05.0000] <cheeser>
i love how w and q are right next to each other so it's easy to do cmd-q instead.

[13:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me like his dvorak keyboard for that reason :-)

[13:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
One of my first commits to MediaWiki was to remove the keyboard shortcut for "log out".

[13:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Run stuff in a screen so you can just reattach your terminal to it after restarting your terminal? :P

[13:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't happen for me with terminals.

[13:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(That does seriously work quite well for me)

[13:11:02.0000] <cheeser>
screen+irssi ftw

[13:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
screen+* ftw.

[13:11:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The only risk is that Ctrl-Shift-uXXXX is used for Unicode characters, and the X's sometimes need to be E, which is right next to W, and Ctrl-Shift-W exits.

[13:11:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
For some bizarre reason.

[13:11:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I actually never learned how to use screen.

[13:11:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Never needed to yet.

[13:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: That's what you say before you use it.

[13:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What else does it do?

[13:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
screen(1) is fantastic.

[13:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
it makes the mapping of terminal client to terminal be many-to-many

[13:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
so you can just reconnect to an open session

[13:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
or have multiple open sessions

[13:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
or whatever

[13:13:02.0000] <cheeser>
you can share screens remotely  ;)

[13:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
And then you can hit ctrl+c when someone else is at a password prompt!

[13:13:04.0000] <gsnedders>
And then before they realize it, you've got their password!

[13:13:05.0000] <cheeser>
or press space randomly since they can't see the nonechoed input anyway.

[13:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
indeed

[13:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
my favourite use: i was ssh'ed into a session on a remote host from a laptop. My partner's cat walks over and sits on my keyboard to get my attention. So I drag out my other laptop and just ssh in -- yay screen, i could pick up where i left off.

[13:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
the cat was quite miffed.

[13:14:03.0000] <cheeser>
heh

[13:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, I'm sold.

[13:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll have to learn how to use it.

[13:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: How many cats do you have around you now? :P

[13:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
one and three quarters.

[13:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
actually the three quarters is outside

[13:15:05.0000] <Hixie>
so one

[13:15:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, not at this very moment in time.

[13:15:07.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: put  screen -a -A -xRR -U -e^Pp  in your .bash_profile

[13:15:08.0000] <gsnedders>
But in general

[13:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But how many cats does your partner have?

[13:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me original wrote that with cats and partner the other way around… uh…

[13:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: then hit ^P ^C to open a new terminal, ^P ^N and ^P ^H to go to the next/previous terminal, ^P ^P to toggle with the last terminal, and ^P 0-9 to jump to the 0-9th terminal

[13:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
^P " to list all termianls

[13:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*terminals

[13:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why ^P instead of the default ^A?

[13:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
because i use ^A to go to the start of the line

[13:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I use Home for that, since I only use desktops.

[13:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh and ^P ? to get help if you need it

[13:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you don't use ^A then feel free to remove the -e^Pp part of the command line :-)

[13:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is there any reason to use screen to manage multiple terminals, instead of just using tabs?

[13:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, does anything bad happen now if I close my terminal without typing "exit" or such?

[13:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(like lots of screens accumulating forever?)

[13:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can use tabs too

[13:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
do both

[13:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
that way if you need to connect from a single tab, you can still do that and use all the screens

[13:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
but you can still connect multiple times and have each tab be a different screen in screen(1)

[13:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
(that's what all the "-a -A -xRR -U" stuff does -- it makes it so there's one session and you can connect as many times as you want)

[13:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, so now if I connect from multiple tabs, I'll get the same screen in all of them, right?  So I'll want to do ^A^C to make some new ones, or occupy my existing ones once I've got them established.

[13:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, let me fiddle with this now.

[13:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, by default with those arguments each instance will connect to the same screen, but then you can change it to be whichever you want

[13:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
basically it's like each tab can see all the other tabs

[13:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why does it say "Attaching from inside of screen?" every time I connect?

[13:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you put it in .bash_profile, then opening a shell connects already

[13:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I did.

[13:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
gotta go, bbiab, sorry for leaving you with a weird setup :-) you'll figure it out :-) see man screen !

[13:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or ask here :)

[13:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
You get that message every time you connect to a screen from within sceen

[13:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What does "from within screen" mean?

[13:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me reads man screen

[13:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Like, when you're in a terminal in a screen window

[13:27:00.0000] <cheeser>
recursive screen connects

[13:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Basically: you probably don't want screen running within screen

[13:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I just put the command Hixie told me to into my .bash_profile or equivalent.

[13:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: (if you are using Ubuntu it comes wih some utility to make fancy .screen files)

[13:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I am.

[13:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
screen-profile or something. I think it is supposed to run the first time you run screen though

[13:32:03.0000] <jgraham>
So if it didn't I don't know how to fix it

[13:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Because I tried installing it and it didn't work...

[13:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
(after I was already using screen)

[13:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me finds screen on Solaris behaves differently, adds a conditional to his .bash_profile to avoid it

[13:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, hmm.

[13:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe what happens is that I log in, it starts a screen, the screen starts bash, bash tries to start screen, . . .

[13:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me got a whole procession of screens on Solaris, had to hold down Ctrl-D to kill them all

[13:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me uses if ! [ "$TERM" = 'screen' ]; then ...

[13:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Now I feel like I'm living in the Matrix.  I have this magical screen thing, and if I do Ctrl-A d I get back to real life temporarily.

[13:52:00.0000] <cheeser>
that's so 20th century.  Inception is the modern meme.  ;)

[13:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, the Matrix movies were practically the last movies I ever watched, so I probably won't watch that.

[13:54:01.0000] <cheeser>
haha.  nice.

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Inception  was pretty good

[14:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, "man screen" is absurdly long.

[14:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
$ man screen | wc

[14:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
   2566   21969  152831

[14:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Uh, yeah. I've never read it all.

[14:02:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
No way am I reading that whole thing.

[14:02:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll work it out as I go along.

[14:02:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Irn-bru cocktails? Oh dear…

[14:02:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Sometimes things on Facebook scare me

[14:07:00.0000] <hober>
put "nethack on" in .screenrc for extra awesomeness

[14:11:00.0000] <hober>
also, "term screen-256color" is great assuming the terminal app you use supports 256 colors (sadly Mac OS X's Terminal.app doesn't)

[15:33:00.0000] <llrcombs>
OK, http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/timers.html#dom-navigator-registercontenthandler has a couple flaws I'd like to point out

[15:33:01.0000] <llrcombs>
1. no explanation on how/if registerContentHandler can cause local resources to be opened in a web app

[15:34:00.0000] <llrcombs>
2. no explanation/example for what exactly %s is replaced with in registerProtocolHandler

[15:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
1. Surely this follows from the inability for local files to be read by sites? What it applies to seems like intrensically impl-specific behaviour.

[15:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
2. The definition of the url argument seems to have that

[15:37:02.0000] <llrcombs>
well, then it should be explicitly defined in the spec

[15:38:00.0000] <llrcombs>
and the url param spec doesn't define if it's supposed to include the protocol name, etc

[15:38:01.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.boingboing.net/2010/08/17/is-the-web-really-de.html -- lol wtf did Wired do

[15:39:00.0000] <annevk5>
llrcombs, you can file bugs

[15:39:01.0000] <annevk5>
llrcombs, or email

[15:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
llrcombs: In terms of conformance requirements for calls to it?

[15:39:03.0000] <gsnedders>
llrcombs: The UA behaviour is clearly defined

[15:39:04.0000] <gsnedders>
llrcombs: 'When the user agent uses this URL, it must replace the first occurrence of the exact literal string "%s" with an escaped version of the absolute URL of the content in question (as defined below), then resolve the resulting URL, relative to the base URL of the entry script at the time the registerContentHandler() or registerProtocolHandler() methods were invoked…'

[15:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(follow the xref for resolve, and you'll find out it will work with any relative URL)

[15:41:00.0000] <llrcombs>
so that's 2

[15:41:01.0000] <llrcombs>
alrighty

[15:41:02.0000] <llrcombs>
upon first reading the first bit of this spec, I thought it might send a POST request with the file's contents

[15:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
llrcombs: for 1?

[15:42:01.0000] <llrcombs>
yeah

[15:42:02.0000] <llrcombs>
then read a bit more

[15:42:03.0000] <gsnedders>
llrcombs: No, it's quite clearly a GET request

[15:42:04.0000] <llrcombs>
found it sent a GET request with a URL

[15:42:05.0000] <llrcombs>
yeah, that's clea

[15:42:06.0000] <llrcombs>
r

[15:42:07.0000] <llrcombs>
I just meant that was my thought when i read the first tiny bit of the spec

[15:42:08.0000] <llrcombs>
no issue in wording or anything

[15:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, there's plenty of stuff that relies rather heavily on cross-references

[15:43:01.0000] <llrcombs>
I was a bit confuzed when I saw it was a GET request, as I know web apps can't access file: URLs

[15:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But making it clear everywhere would probably double the length of the spec

[15:43:03.0000] <llrcombs>
yeah

[15:43:04.0000] <llrcombs>
I get that

[15:43:05.0000] <llrcombs>
I didn't say there was a clarity issue with the fact that it's a GET request with the URL

[15:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I saw a "the browser is dead, apps are the future" article someplace else a while ago.  The Atlantic, I think.

[15:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
All pretty silly stuff.

[15:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I hope, otherwise I'm wasting my time here)

[15:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"The defenders of the unfettered Web have their hopes set on HTML5 — the latest version of Web-building code that offers applike flexibility — as an open way to satisfy the desire for quality of service."

[16:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dang right.

[16:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I like the commenter who points out that according to Wired's graph, DNS died in about 1995.

2010-08-18
[17:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: yt?

[17:52:01.0000] <roc>
yes

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i'm looking at this feedback regarding startTime and so forth

[17:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
for video

[17:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
and i'm trying to work out what timeline we should use

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
it seems everyone gave about 3 mutually contradictory opinions and everyone agreed and disagreed with everyone else

[17:54:01.0000] <roc>
paging in data

[17:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
in the static case of a video file whose timeline is not zero-based, it seems we want to expose the timeline as being 0..duration, regardless of the actual in-video "official" timeline

[17:54:03.0000] <roc>
that is my belief

[17:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
for streaming data, presumably we want currentTime=0 to be at least as far back as you can seek

[17:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
do we ever want it to be further back? e.g. the actual start of the streaming performance?

[17:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
(do we even have that data in all streaming cases?)

[17:56:01.0000] <roc>
I don't think so

[17:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
so basically currentTime=0 should be the earliest seekable point, or whatever the first frame was, if you can't seek before the start of receiving the stream, right?

[17:57:01.0000] <roc>
I think so

[17:58:00.0000] <roc>
Actually I don't think it really matters if you can't seek to currentTime=0

[17:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[17:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's just that we don't ever want to seek to currentTime<0

[17:58:03.0000] <roc>
Hmm, and I don't want currentTime=0 to change dynamically as what is seekable changes

[17:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[17:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
definitely won't change

[17:59:01.0000] <roc>
So I think currentTime=0 should be seen as something arbitrary defined by the resource

[17:59:02.0000] <roc>
with the guarantee that you can't ever seek before it

[17:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
that seems inconsistent with your earlier statement about non-streaming videos that have internal timeliens

[18:01:00.0000] <roc>
which statement?

[18:01:01.0000] <roc>
(I believe you)

[18:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
that in the static case of a video file whose timeline is not zero-based, we want to expose the timeline as being 0..duration, regardless of the actual in-video "official" timeline

[18:02:00.0000] <roc>
ah yes

[18:02:01.0000] <roc>
the basic problem here is dealing with video resources where you can seek to before the start position

[18:03:00.0000] <roc>
that is something that authors will find difficult to deal with

[18:03:01.0000] <roc>
I think

[18:04:00.0000] <roc>
since 99% of resources have the nice properties that a) they start at time 0 and b) all relevant times are between 0 and duration

[18:04:01.0000] <roc>
so something has to give

[18:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
agreed

[18:05:01.0000] <roc>
maybe the best option would be to break the second assumption

[18:06:00.0000] <roc>
and allow negative seekable times 

[18:06:01.0000] <roc>
that means if the author hasn't accounted for seekable times, they might not handle seeking to negative times, but if they don't care about that, they don't have any trouble

[18:06:02.0000] <roc>
I mangled that sentence, sorry

[18:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
allowing negative times seems very dodgy

[18:08:00.0000] <roc>
it also frees the implementation somewhat. Requiring currentTime=0 to be earlier than any time you can ever seek to might be difficult if it's hard to know in advance what is eventually going to be seekable

[18:08:01.0000] <roc>
I don't think negative times are particularly dodgy. It's an arbitrary time scale anyway.

[18:09:00.0000] <roc>
negative *durations* would be dodgy

[18:11:00.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: do you have opinions on ime-mode (the CSS property)

[18:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i'm very skeptical of the ability of web authors to handle drawing good seek bars and buffer-status bars if we have a signed timeline

[18:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: not off-hand

[18:11:03.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: we're considering whether it's worth adding to WebKit and i see you mentioned on the relevant mozilla bug

[18:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
uri?

[18:13:00.0000] <ojan>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279246

[18:13:01.0000] <roc>
ojan: I think it's a reasonable feature

[18:14:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: so am I. I expect most authors are going to build UIs that assume only non-negative times

[18:14:01.0000] <roc>
I think that's OK

[18:14:02.0000] <ojan>
roc: yeah, i think we might try and add it

[18:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: yeah, still have no opinion off-hand

[18:14:04.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: k

[18:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: iirc Jungshik Shin is at google now, try asking him

[18:15:01.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I mean, it's not great, but I'm also skeptical of authors handling videos that don't start at time 0

[18:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: yeah

[18:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ojan: if it's needed for compatibility, it's probably worth adding

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: then again, how common are videos that don't start at t=0?

[18:16:02.0000] <roc>
not very

[18:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(I don't understand exactly why you would want to turn off IME support per-field or what that even means, though)

[18:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: maybe we just honour the explicit timeline if any, and if there isn't one, assert t=0 as being the earliest possible point we're aware of?

[18:17:01.0000] <roc>
possibly ime-mode would be better done as an HTML5 forms feature these days

[18:17:02.0000] <roc>
Hixie: can you clarify what that means?

[18:18:00.0000] <ojan>
othermaciej: yeah. there seem to be some sites that use it. it makes multiform editing easier because there are some form controls you'll always want to start in ascii (e.g. full urls)

[18:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[18:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: sounds like it'd be better in html than css, but that ship may have sailed

[18:18:03.0000] <ojan>
othermaciej: i'm not convinced it's worth implementing.

[18:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
roc: which part?

[18:19:00.0000] <roc>
"maybe we just honour the explicit timeline if any"

[18:19:01.0000] <ojan>
but it does seem useful.

[18:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: we set t=0 to be wherever the video file has t=0

[18:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ojan: I wonder how plausible it is to implement this on Mac, since current input method is a system-wide setting

[18:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: going back to what you said earlier, if we allow negative numbers then we definitely need some way to establish what the earliest known time is, so that it is possible to know how to draw the seek bar, right?

[18:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
ojan: strikes me as dodgy to change it system-wide (even if temporarily) based on tabbing around in form fields

[18:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
roc: eh, i'll poke around and see what i come up with

[18:20:04.0000] <roc>
Hixie: well, I still don't want the initial time of the video to be nonzero

[18:20:05.0000] <Hixie>
initial time?

[18:21:00.0000] <roc>
the start time I guess

[18:21:01.0000] <ojan>
othermaciej: FF mac appears to modify the system-wide setting permanently :)_

[18:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: you mean in the absence of an explicit seek at the start?

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: if you can seek to before t=0, i don't see what the importance of anchoring anything at t=0 is, really

[18:22:01.0000] <roc>
Hixie: for example, if the player is displaying the current time, the duration (if any), the seekable ranges, and the buffered ranges, then at any moment it can take the minimum and the maximum of all relevant times and use that to scale its display bar

[18:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
also there's no such thing as "no input method", at least from the UI perspective - "U.S." or "French" are no different than Kotoeri Hiragana (which is one of the more likely Japanese settings)

[18:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
There is also Kotoeri Romaji which you could validly consider "no input method" (since ASCII keys type ASCII)

[18:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
changing the system setting permanently seems highly bogus

[18:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
on Mac it's super easy to toggle between different input methods (just hit cmd+space if you have more than one enabled) so maybe this ime-mode feature only really makes sense on Windows

[18:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
certainly our international text folks in and/or from Japan have never asked for it

[18:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't cmd-space do spotlight?

[18:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess it does with default settings (which I have changed cause I don't Spotlight much)

[18:27:01.0000] <ttepasse>
ctrl-space ist keyboard layout switching, if I remember correctly

[18:28:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I'm guessing that authors who implement "play from the beginning" are going to do it by setting currentTime=0

[18:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe if you pick US english and don't add any input methods it is spotlight

[18:29:01.0000] <nessy>
Hixie, roc: are dealing with durations or with end times? - if we deal with start and end times, then the seekable ranges are wrong when we use the maximum of all end times for seeeking

[18:29:02.0000] <nessy>
and scale the display bar

[18:31:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I'm also guessing that authors are going to create players with an initial UI state that assumes the video starts at the left end of the bar

[18:31:01.0000] <nessy>
Hixie, roc: another question - if we have a media fragment URI like http://ex.com/video.webm?t=50,80 - wouldn't it be more useful to display a bar with 50-80?

[18:32:00.0000] <nessy>
(note: I haven't made up my mind which is better - just trying to find examples where displaying from 0 might not be so useful)

[18:32:01.0000] <roc>
nessy: I think we should have another attribute which maps 'currentTime' to a time for display

[18:34:00.0000] <nessy>
roc: is this also for the case where you may have created a playlist and want to keep track of how long you have actually played?

[18:34:01.0000] <roc>
I don't know about that case

[18:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: ?t=50,80 or #t=50,80?

[18:36:01.0000] <nessy>
the first case - the second one is just a byte range out of the full file, so I would expect the transport bar to display from 0 to end time, but jump straight to the time offset

[18:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
the first case would depend entirely on what the server sent back, the UA wouldn't be awware of it, presumably

[18:37:01.0000] <nessy>
I was making the assumption that the server would create a shortened video from the long one that is just 30 sec long and starts at 50sec and has that information in the binary media resource

[18:38:00.0000] <nessy>
if you cannot get the time offset out of the media resource, then displaying the time offset is basically impossible

[18:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh that reminds me of the other question i wanted to ask

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
it was suggested that we have a startTimeOffset that returns a Date object representing the actual date/time of t=0

[18:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
if we force the first frame to t=0, should we have a startTimeOffset-like attribute to return the offset in seconds from t=0 to the original media timeline?

[18:40:00.0000] <nessy>
that is possible where the media resource has the actual real-world clock time that is associated with t=0 stored

[18:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'd rather just expose the original media timeline, since it'll be so rare

[18:41:00.0000] <nessy>
is that startTimeOffset attribute an attribute that the author of the webpage provides or just a readonly exposing a media resource state?

[18:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
the latter

[18:41:02.0000] <nessy>
ok, good

[18:42:00.0000] <nessy>
when you say "expose the original media timeline" do you mean to expose what is stored in the media resource?

[18:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[18:43:01.0000] <nessy>
ok, I think I agree with that

[19:16:00.0000] <llrcombs>
@ http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#devices <-- as for generic-ness, it seems as though USB support would be fine (as long as permission is asked of the user), IMHO

[19:16:01.0000] <llrcombs>
++1 for asking permission before getting an AV stream

[19:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
ooh, USB, good idea

[19:26:00.0000] <nessy>
I assume you saw https://labs.ericsson.com/blog/beyond-html5-implementing-device-and-stream-management-webkit

[19:55:00.0000] <llrcombs>
no, I haven't

[19:55:01.0000] <llrcombs>
/me reads

[20:00:00.0000] <llrcombs>
nessy: how is that applicible to USB/other non-video support?

[20:01:00.0000] <llrcombs>
that's cool and all

[20:01:01.0000] <llrcombs>
working <device> support

[20:02:00.0000] <llrcombs>
Hixie: is USB support honestly something that hasn't been brought up, or was that sarcasm?

[20:04:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah, I just wanted to point out that somebody implemented <device> support - not directly related to your usb discussion

[20:04:01.0000] <llrcombs>
alright

[20:04:02.0000] <llrcombs>
/me wants the code

[20:06:00.0000] <llrcombs>

[20:09:00.0000] <nessy>
might be just Ericsson's way of solving that problem - might be a good idea to add, actually!

[20:22:00.0000] <llrcombs>
well, there's a media device

[20:33:00.0000] <Hixie>

where could i look for an indication of the default styling of <canvas>?

[23:13:01.0000] <paul_irish>
in particular.. display inline or block.

[23:13:02.0000] <paul_irish>
(I'm 90% it should be inline, but want some backup on this. :)

[23:14:00.0000] <aho>
inline (like img)

[23:19:00.0000] <aho>
paul_irish, http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#flow-content-0

[23:22:00.0000] <aho>
oh zomg... noscript in head was legalized... (worked everywhere anyway) http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/scripting-1.html#the-noscript-element

[23:22:01.0000] <aho>
:o

[23:23:00.0000] <paul_irish>
aho: but i didnt think flow content implied inline.

[23:23:01.0000] <paul_irish>
div and h1 are flow content , for example.

[23:23:02.0000] <aho>
mh. good point

[23:24:00.0000] <aho>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#phrasing-content

[23:24:01.0000] <aho>
phrasing content, however, does imply inline (i think) :>

[23:25:00.0000] <paul_irish>
looks like a winner

[23:25:01.0000] <paul_irish>
thanks aho!

[23:25:02.0000] <aho>
:)

[23:31:00.0000] <micheil>
paul_irish: oh look, it's paul irish.

[23:31:01.0000] <micheil>
hi there

[23:31:02.0000] <paul_irish>
hey micheil!

[23:33:00.0000] <micheil>
paul_irish: hmm.. why do I get the feeling that canvas questions may be related to js1k?

[23:34:00.0000] <paul_irish>
oh believe me, they arent. :) i'd get my ass whooped.

[23:34:01.0000] <paul_irish>
though qFox gave me the idea of doing jQuery in 1k of js.... which i _may_ do.

[23:35:00.0000] <micheil>
paul_irish: that could be interesting

[23:35:01.0000] <micheil>
/me is currently struggling with YUI to write a webapp.

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk5>
lol

[01:42:01.0000] <annevk5>
shelby moore vs adam barth

[01:43:00.0000] <annevk5>
someone could easily do another one of those glazou blog posts with selective quotes

[01:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://diveintohtml5.org/peeks-pokes-and-pointers.html

[01:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
"As we have done with other standards-based features, opacity is implemented so that the same markup used in other browsers just works in IE9?s standard mode." -- they keep trying hard with that "same markup" nonsense

[01:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh lol, at the end they endorse w3schools

[01:57:00.0000] <Rik`>
annevk5: why nonsense ?

[02:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
Rik`, it's not about markup

[02:22:00.0000] <MasJono>
Hi there

[03:15:00.0000] <Rik`>
annevk5: yeah, not it's not markup but is that important ? :)

[03:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
no, it's just nonsense

[03:16:01.0000] <annevk5>
anyway, http://www.w3.org/2010/08/09-ab-minutes (W3C Member-only, quite interesting)

[03:36:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.xanthir.com/diagrams/scrollwidth-clientwidth.html is really quite nice

[03:46:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
so I'm doing an appendChild within a script and I wanted to know when it's actually finished loading the node... how to check?

[03:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the deal is that right after that appendChild, I'm doing a getElementById on the current document, with the id I'm looking for being in the node I just appended

[03:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
appendChild happens directly

[03:49:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
MikeSmith, WFM

[03:49:02.0000] <annevk5>
but I'm not quite sure what you are saying since if you have the node already why do you need another reference to it?

[03:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ms2ger: don't seem to be working for me in this case.. maybe could be because the node I'm appending is 1MB+

[03:52:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
MikeSmith, what do you mean by it being 1MB+?

[03:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: the node is contents of a file read from XHR into a newly created node

[03:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ms2ger: the contents of the file I'm reading in is ~1.1MB

[03:53:01.0000] <annevk5>
so what do you do?

[03:53:02.0000] <annevk5>
node.textContent = xhr.responseText

[03:53:03.0000] <annevk5>
then appendChild(node)

[03:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
then getElementById(searchInNodeForId(node)) ?!

[03:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[03:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and then I get an error because the ID can't be found

[03:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but then if I check again right after that, it *can* be found

[03:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which perhaps naively led me to believe the first ID check was getting executed for the appendChild had completed loading

[03:56:00.0000] <annevk5>
this happens in all browsers?

[03:56:01.0000] <annevk5>
sounds like a bug of some sorts

[03:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
lemme doublecheck

[03:56:03.0000] <annevk5>
you could find the id first and then append...

[03:57:00.0000] <Rik`>
I heard that browsers were single threaded :)

[03:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, yeah, true

[03:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Rik`: just like Emacs, and just like God intended

[04:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dammit.. how do I turn off caching temporarily in Minefield?

[04:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
start Private Browsing mode?

[04:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me tries that

[04:02:00.0000] <Rik`>
MikeSmith: web developer toolbar

[04:03:00.0000] <Rik`>
or about:config -> browser.cache.disk.enable, browser.cache.memory.enable

[04:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[04:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: this is probably a really dumb question... but how do I find an ID in a node without first appending it to the document and using getElementById?

[04:22:01.0000] <annevk5>
if you have a node object you can do all normal operations on it

[04:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
in fact, if your finding function just takes a string you can do it on responseText directly

[04:23:01.0000] <annevk5>
but I'm not quite sure what you are doing, no pointer?

[04:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
code is in my workspace.. gimme a second and I'll pastebin it

[04:34:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm

[04:35:00.0000] <annevk5>
maybe CSSValue.type should be a space-separated list of all interfaces that are implemented

[04:35:01.0000] <annevk5>
or rather, a DOMStringList or some such

[04:35:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://pastebin.ca/1919359

[04:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: ↑

[04:36:01.0000] <annevk5>
somewhat unorthodox but it at least allows for the crazy extensions CSS does all the time

[05:25:00.0000] <annevk5>
sorry MikeSmith

[05:25:01.0000] <annevk5>
looking now

[05:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, I don't really understand how fileContents is used

[05:40:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
MikeSmith, you the element you return from initDfn doesn't have an id attribute yet

[05:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ms2ger: yeah, I'm not checking that anyway.. not at this point at least

[05:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: fileContents is a bunch of <div> index entries, with IDs on each of them

[05:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I look for an ID and show the contents of that div

[05:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
trying something else now, inside the callback

[05:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so when I do an xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {...} can I pass parameters to the function?

[05:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: closures

[05:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: I've tried hard to avoid any need to learn about closures... I suppose I can't escape it

[05:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: Nothing to be scared of

[05:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Well, there's a few things to be scared of

[05:48:01.0000] <annevk5>
you can do function() { test(.., .., ..) }

[05:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, aah, when do you check if the <div> is there?

[05:50:01.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, you can only assume the <div> is there after the resource has been fetched

[05:51:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, because the fetching happens asynchronously

[05:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: yeah, I have since (re)discovered that

[05:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me is rewriting his code now

[05:52:02.0000] <annevk5>
these things bite people all the time

[05:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
earlier today I checked a testcase someone wrote that fetched an image and assumed it was loaded by the time he got to invoke ctx.createPattern

[05:53:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk5, easy, just use sync XHR :)

[05:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
holy crap... I actually just made it work

[05:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
Ms2ger: You know there is a special level of hell reserved for people who say things like that — even in jest

[05:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: It seems I already understood what closures are, but was trying to make it more complicated by explicitly passing args to the inner function when I didn't really need to

[05:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
I say "level"

[05:55:02.0000] <jgraham>
It's more like a whole wing

[05:55:03.0000] <Ms2ger>
jgraham, I do

[05:55:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe I could get into the Daily WTF as "The Man Who Discovered Closures"

[05:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
maybe in MikeSmith's Daily WTF

[05:57:01.0000] <annevk5>
great name for a blog

[06:01:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me would read that

[06:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[06:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, fwiw, here's the updated source that now actually seems to work -

[06:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://pastebin.ca/1919394

[06:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gimme a minute to commit it and you can have the pleasure of seeing it in action

[06:36:00.0000] <Peter`>
The HTML5 specification often refers to data: URIs, sometimes even require it, but doesn't have a reference to rfc2397. Neither is it documented when data: URIs are expected to work (for images, scripts, stylesheets, entire documents?). Is this intentional?

[06:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
Peter`, don't think so

[06:42:00.0000] <Peter`>
should I write a mail to the whatwg list about it?

[06:43:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah

[06:44:00.0000] <annevk5>
or file a bug or some such, the idea is for the document to not be vague on these things :)

[06:45:00.0000] <Peter`>
alright, thanks

[06:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Peter`: I assume data: uris should work eeverywhere URIs should work unless stated otherwise

[07:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, if anybody has a couple minutes, please try http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/dom.html

[07:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or anything other multipage file in the author view of the spec there

[07:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and click on a boldfaced term -- any dfn

[07:13:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and let me know if it works for you

[07:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
seems to work

[07:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: Slow and the styleheet changes?

[07:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
The status annotations become red at least

[07:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
rather than blue

[07:15:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm.. the stylesheet shouldn't be changing.. dunno why it is

[07:15:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: if you click another term now, it should no longer be slow

[07:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
should be immediate, hopefully

[07:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the first time you click on a term, it loads a 1.2MB file and appends it to the document

[07:16:02.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: I complained about the slowness

[07:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, it is fast the second time

[07:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[07:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[07:17:03.0000] <jgraham>
But it is *really* slow the first time

[07:17:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[07:17:05.0000] <jgraham>
Like "I wonder if this actually works" slow

[07:17:06.0000] <jgraham>
"oh no it doesn't"

[07:17:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah.. I'm not sure what to do about that -- except maybe to provide a better status indicator

[07:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
"oh wait yes it does"

[07:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: Why is it loading 1.2 MB of data?

[07:18:02.0000] <jgraham>
surely the cross references aren't that big?

[07:18:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
the alternative is to slurp in  the whole 1.2MB on document load every time

[07:18:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: yeah, they are

[07:18:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
hang on a minute, I'll give you a link

[07:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or in the mean time you can use a DOM inspector and see

[07:19:01.0000] <Rik`>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/index-of-terms.html ?

[07:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Rik`: bingo

[07:20:00.0000] <Workshiva>
What about requesting just the term clicked?

[07:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's a static index of every hyperlinked reference to a dfn in the spec 

[07:20:02.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: Surely a sensible file format + compression would solve this?

[07:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
Can't you store it in a much more efficient format and generate the markup client-side, instead of downloading as HTML?

[07:20:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I guess I could

[07:21:00.0000] <Rik`>
either store in a more compact format or only serve the part you need

[07:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I'm being lazy and just reusing the same index that I'm adding to the full version of the spec

[07:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[07:21:03.0000] <Philip`>
Rik`: Or both :-)

[07:21:04.0000] <Workshiva>
Sounds like a job for XSLT!

[07:21:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[07:21:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
I figured this was good enough for a proof of concept at least

[07:21:07.0000] <annevk5>
wfm

[07:21:08.0000] <Rik`>
Philip`: well, sending only the relevant part directly in HTML should be faster overall

[07:21:09.0000] <annevk5>
it's funny, when you give people more bandwidth, they'll use it

[07:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Do you think MikeSmith wears a lycra outfit with a big X on the chest when coding XSLT?

[07:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, as a consequence, the full version of the spec now has an index of terms also -

[07:22:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/spec.html#index-of-terms

[07:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wear a dunce cap when coding XSLT

[07:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I still do it

[07:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm a glutton for punishment

[07:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so at least this is better than nothing, hopefully

[07:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
"nothing" being that previously, the dfn pop-ups didn't work at all in the multipage version of the spec 

[07:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
baby steps

[07:25:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Yeah, don't be dissuaded by high expectations :)

[07:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
me being the baby, doing the coding

[07:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
It may not be better for people who are charged per megabyte for traffic and who accidentally click on a definition

[07:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: sure it will be

[07:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it'll be a "learning moment" for them

[07:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
It'll learn them not to read the spec?

[07:26:03.0000] <jgraham>
Not to tust things written by MikeSmith maybe

[07:26:04.0000] <jgraham>
*trust

[07:26:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[07:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe we can have a WBS survey to ask people which they find more frustrating: This vs Trying to load the full single-page version of the spec

[07:29:00.0000] <annevk5>
or maybe "This" vs "That"

[07:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Can we have an option for "I have never tried to open the spec"

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: "Less frustrating than loading the single-page spec" is not really a great challenge

[07:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[07:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
Printing the spec onto paper and then dropping all the sheets and getting them all out of order is likely to be less frustrating than opening the single-page version

[07:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what about if it's windy?

[07:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
since at least it won't freeze everything else you're currently working on

[07:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you won't have people telling you that you're silly for using obsolete (i.e. publicly released) browser versions

[07:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think what we need as a solution to this is a new "This page best viewed in..." button: "This page best viewed in any browser that doesn't crash or freeze every time you try to view it."

[07:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
The Acid3 test should have contained a <iframe src="http://whatwg.org/c"> to more strongly encourage browser developers to optimise for it

[07:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
<snicker>

[07:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Rik`: loading only the relevant part would be my preferred solution

[07:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but lacking a standard way to load fragments of another document, I guess I'd need to write some server-side way to do it

[07:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as I can see

[07:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: does XHR2 enable addressing and loading of document fragments?

[07:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Could you just split the index into one static .html file per letter?

[07:43:01.0000] <Rik`>
MikeSmith: can't you use html5lib for that ? :)

[07:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: yeah, I guess I could

[07:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
apparently there are about 1060 dfn instances in the spec

[07:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
would it be too obnoxious to just have the doc build write a separate file for each?

[07:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
(in a subdirectory of course)

[07:55:00.0000] <Workshiva>
That would certainly be cache-friendly :)

[07:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, yeah -- that too

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, that seems like something for the server to implement

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Who would find it obnoxious?

[07:57:01.0000] <cheeser>
ugh.  reading the hybi list is making me sad.

[07:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
I assume users wouldn't care, because they'll only download the files they need (which will usually be 0 or 1)

[07:57:03.0000] <cheeser>
websockets used to be such a simple protocol.

[07:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
cheeser: You should say that on the list

[07:58:01.0000] <annevk5>
the evil part of Google ran away with it

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it wouldn't be fun on the server side if you have to commit a thousand files to an SVN repository on every change, but if they're just static files then I don't see why it'd be a problem

[07:59:01.0000] <cheeser>
jgraham: good call.  will do.  i'll probably get flamed but hey.  i'm trying to implement all this so i should say something.

[07:59:02.0000] <annevk5>
there's a few people arguing for keeping the initial version simple

[08:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
I was quite sad when I was having a conversation with someone from Google on the list and he basically said "if it doesn't work for Google-sized installations in V1 it is useless because all end-user value comes from Google-sized companies"

[08:00:01.0000] <annevk5>
Ian Hickson, Martin Thompson, myself, ...?

[08:00:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me raises hand

[08:00:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I didn't see that.

[08:00:04.0000] <boblet>
regarding the epic <time> for year & year-month debate, did anyone mention formatting Japanese dates as a use case? eg 18-8-2010 is 2010年8月18日… (ping: Hixie)

[08:00:05.0000] <gsnedders>
You liar.

[08:00:06.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Me?

[08:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah.

[08:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
Why?

[08:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I didn't see you raise your hand.

[08:01:03.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I thought you meant about the Google thing

[08:01:04.0000] <annevk5>
boblet, formatting does not seem to have anything to do with it

[08:02:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk5: Hixie wrote one of the three primary use cases was “The ability to restyle dates that contain a "day" component so that they follow user conventions (2000-12-31 vs 31-12-2000 vs 12-31-2000).”

[08:02:01.0000] <boblet>
http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018888.html

[08:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, via CSS

[08:03:01.0000] <boblet>
so possibly related given adding the year, month, day kanji are Japanese user conventions

[08:03:02.0000] <jgraham>
(for the record, he probably didn't say "all" but used words like "weighted". But the message was basically the same)

[08:03:03.0000] <annevk5>
only the input format is considered relevant for HTML

[08:03:04.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, wasn't it more like it's of no use to Google if there's no multiplexing?

[08:04:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk5: wouldn’t this use case apply equally to 8-2010 and 2010-8?

[08:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: Yeah, but then he said that it being no use to Google meant that it was useless in general because end users mostly get value from Google and similarly large companies

[08:04:02.0000] <jgraham>
It is true that those people provide value

[08:05:00.0000] <cheeser>
sent

[08:05:01.0000] <annevk5>
boblet, i almost never see that tbh

[08:05:02.0000] <jgraham>
It is not true that adding support for their needs in V2 is a disaster

[08:05:03.0000] <annevk5>
wow really?

[08:05:04.0000] <annevk5>
glad i missed that

[08:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: OK, I'll tweak it to have the build also generate separate files and give it a try that way as well

[08:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: the means I'm using for generating the index is a patch i wrote for anolis

[08:06:02.0000] <annevk5>
cheeser, +1 to you

[08:07:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me is somewhat interested in Microsoft/Apple/Mozilla voicing their opinion

[08:08:00.0000] <smaug____>
I prefer simple protocol for v1

[08:08:01.0000] <smaug____>
though the v76 is still ugly as hell

[08:08:02.0000] <jgraham>
smaug____: You feel like saying that on the list?

[08:08:03.0000] <jgraham>
(v76 is outdated)

[08:08:04.0000] <jgraham>
(although the handshake is still there)

[08:08:05.0000] <annevk5>
smaug____, I think everyone is agreed upon that what v76 did is not very great

[08:08:06.0000] <smaug____>
well, whatever is the v76 like protocol nowadays

[08:08:07.0000] <boblet>
annevk5: if you mean yyyy-mm that’s the common order in Japan (eg Japanese blog archives etc)

[08:09:00.0000] <annevk5>
smaug____, you mean you don't like the non-sentinel design either?

[08:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
The only serious alternative to the handshake is abarth's SSL stuff

[08:09:02.0000] <smaug____>
the handshake is the ugly part

[08:09:03.0000] <annevk5>
kk

[08:09:04.0000] <jgraham>
although the hybi people hate the 8 bytes

[08:09:05.0000] <jgraham>
s/hybi/server/

[08:09:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
smaug____: when you say it on the list, please also say that are certain the Apple and Microsoft fully agree with you.. then they will be compelled to comment in some way at least -- even if it's only to contradict you

[08:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
or some of them at least

[08:10:01.0000] <annevk5>
I don't really understand the cross-protocol issues well enough to come forward with a better handshake...

[08:10:02.0000] <smaug____>
it is a big problem that google is pushing very hard something they want

[08:10:03.0000] <smaug____>
imo

[08:11:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, that's why the other Ian was better, he doesn't care about Google

[08:12:00.0000] <annevk5>
Ian Fette basically said at the meeting that whatever complexity was needed to buy them a few milliseconds was worth it

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if it's partly a consequence of performance being easy to measure and complexity being hard to measure

[08:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's easy to provide numerical evidence arguing for an extra feature, and hard to say more than "I don't like that because it looks a bit complicated to me" against it)

[08:14:01.0000] <annevk5>
Similarly Google has proposed a bunch of TLS extensions to increase performance

[08:15:00.0000] <annevk5>
I wonder if at some point you can only compete if you have some ridiculously complex setup. That'd be really bad.

[08:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Do you know what is supposed to happen about rounding in drawImage()?

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Implementation-defined, I think - conceptually the canvas has infinite resolution and you approximate it to a finite grid of pixels using whatever antialiasing and filtering you fancy

[08:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
So if you have something that is epsilon outside of the image you can raise INDEX_SIZE_ERR or draw it?

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Oh - if it's about exceptions rather than rendering, I'd expect you'd convert the arguments to 32-bit floats (per WebIDL) and then do an exact comparison against the image's (integer) size

[08:20:01.0000] <cheeser>
i think complicating the spec to suppor the random 6TB frame is the wrong thing to do.

[08:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
cheeser: Most of the complication doesn't come from large frame sizes does it?

[08:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
so you'd get an exception if the epsilon is large enough to make a representable difference after conversion to 32-bit float

[08:21:02.0000] <cheeser>
e.g., i see websocket as a great replace for XHR for ajax.

[08:21:03.0000] <cheeser>
well, there's the whole framing debate going on right now.

[08:21:04.0000] <jgraham>
It seems that framentation and all the mandatory but empty extension stuff adds most of the complexity

[08:21:05.0000] <cheeser>
an initial 7 bits plus an option 64 if the first 7 == 127 blahblahlbah

[08:21:06.0000] <jgraham>
and the variable-but-not-very frame length

[08:22:00.0000] <cheeser>
i liked the 64 frame length delimiter.  makes it every straight forward to parse.

[08:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (and WebIDL seems to define precisely how you round during conversion to 32-bit float)

[08:22:02.0000] <cheeser>
if you need more than that in your frame, fragment it.

[08:22:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Hmm, OK

[08:22:04.0000] <cheeser>
that'd solve the blocking of subsequent requests behind larger ones.

[08:22:05.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: There is an obvious race to the bottom here if someone gets it wrong though...

[08:23:00.0000] <cheeser>
as it is, that's a huge payload anyway

[08:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Yeah - I don't like it when algorithms depend on floating-point values and have discontinuities in the output

[08:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
(like drawing an arc vs not drawing an arc, or drawing an image vs throwing an exception, based on epsilon changes to arguments)

[08:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't know if it's feasible to avoid those situations entirely, though

[08:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Possibly not, but we have a bug report on this one :)

[08:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure if we are wrong; I need to check the WebIDL

[08:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
spec

[08:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose the non-discontinuous behaviour would be for drawImage to interpret pixels outside the image as transparent

[08:25:03.0000] <Philip`>
since then it won't matter if you are slightly over the edge or not

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: A bug from real code that breaks, or from an artificial test case?

[08:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think real code

[08:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
real code

[08:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it might not be too late to redefine drawImage to be less dangerous, since hopefully people don't rely on it throwing exceptions

[08:31:00.0000] <payman>
Philip`: This is the test case: http://www.jigzone.com/xmockup/oCanvasBug.php

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cscript%3Ew%28%2879%2F7%29*6%20%2B%2079%2F7%20-%2079%29%3C%2Fscript%3E

[08:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like Opera's computing the same value as Firefox

[08:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
floats only do ~6 digits so 79.00000000000001 == 79 so it sounds like an Opera bug if they're handled differently

[08:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
(in the implementation of the WebIDL layer)

[08:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Agreed

[08:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess that kind of code could still trigger an exception after the correct float conversion, if it was sufficiently unlucky

[08:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually, maybe it couldn't

[08:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me shrugs

[08:43:00.0000] <payman>
Philip`: Are there any tests for float conversion?

[08:43:01.0000] <payman>
(in WebIDL or the canvas test suite)

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
payman: I don't think I have any tests that rely on the float rounding

[08:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
I have no idea whether WebIDL has any tests at all

[08:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
payman: I don't know if anyone has really tried to write a WebIDL testsuite. I'm not even sure how easy that would be, in general

[08:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me supposes he could add some to his tests, at some unknown point in the future

[08:47:00.0000] <masjonosumitro>
hi

[08:48:00.0000] <Peter->
jgraham (re: dataurl): I agree, I would expect them to work at all, but if it's not written down it's an assumption. Right now IE differs from other browsers by only supporting data URLs for <script> and <img>

[08:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Someone had something that checked WebIDL bindings

[08:48:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Checked what?

[08:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: http://suika.fam.cx/www/webidl2tests/readme

[08:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
YOu can check stuff like readonly fairly easilly

[08:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
Peter-: Should it be written down that you can use http: and ftp: and file: and etc, in each one of those places?

[08:49:03.0000] <payman>
Philip`: You can always add it to your TODO...like you did to my tests about non-finite clockwise ;)

[08:49:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Checked quite a lot, I think

[08:49:05.0000] <Philip`>
payman: I have done so :-)

[08:49:06.0000] <Philip`>
Unlike most of my todo lists, I occasionally even read this one

[08:51:00.0000] <annevk5>
Peter-, HTML5 should prolly not require data: URL support specifically; and if it does only for certain conformance classes

[08:51:01.0000] <Peter->
Philip`: section 2.5.1 defines the aglorithm for url parsing, according to rfc 3987 (iri)

[08:56:00.0000] <Peter->
annevk5: I'm not sure if data: URLs validate against URI or IRI references

[08:57:00.0000] <Peter->
annevk5: if not, then they technically aren't valid values for the attributes

[08:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Peter-, we went through this here once before -- IIRC, the conclusion was that data: and javascript: aren't legitimate URIs.

[08:58:00.0000] <Peter->
require them, I'm not sure, haven't been around long enough to make such a judgement call, but listing them as valid values certainly would help

[09:00:00.0000] <jre>
Aryeh, why would a "data" URI not be legitimate?

[09:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't match the production given in the RFC.

[09:01:01.0000] <jre>
and how concluded that?

[09:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me looks it up again

[09:01:03.0000] <jre>
I don't believe that's true

[09:01:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986

[09:02:00.0000] <jre>
if it was, there should be an erratum on RFC 2397.

[09:02:01.0000] <jre>
yes?

[09:02:02.0000] <annevk5>
Peter-, all valid URIs are valid IRIs

[09:02:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm looking for the exact section.

[09:02:04.0000] <Peter->
annevk5: ok, thanks

[09:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
      URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

[09:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
      hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty / path-absolute / path-rootless / path-empty

[09:03:02.0000] <annevk5>
jre, so script or refresh?

[09:03:03.0000] <jre>
Anne, occasional refreshs

[09:03:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
But data: and javascript: allow arbitrary strings after the ":", including those that don't match any of those four hier-part descriptions.

[09:03:05.0000] <Peter->
But if data: and javacript: URIs aren't valid, that would imply that any document using them wouldn't validate against HTML5

[09:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Possibly.  I dunno.

[09:04:01.0000] <jre>
they match one of the path- productions.

[09:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which one?

[09:04:03.0000] <jre>
path-rootless, I'd say

[09:04:04.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, browser usually does the percent-escaping

[09:04:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Certainly not the first, there's no authority.  Nor path-absolute, that must start with "/".  Nor path-empty.

[09:04:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[09:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you percent-escaped them they'd be path-rootless, yes.

[09:05:01.0000] <annevk5>
data:text/html,<!doctype html> works fine, but only valid when escaped

[09:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you could argue that they're really URIs but we just don't escape them because we're lazy?

[09:05:03.0000] <annevk5>
but that also goes for http://example.org/path with spaces/

[09:05:04.0000] <jre>
do you really believe RFC 3986 would be a full internet standard with a bug like that?

[09:05:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure, why not?  Plenty of specs have gaping errors.

[09:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
AryehGregor, in a way

[09:06:01.0000] <jre>
Not this one :-).

[09:06:02.0000] <annevk5>
should prolly just allow a bunch more characters when there's no harm

[09:06:03.0000] <annevk5>
kind of curious to see what abarth comes up with

[09:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I don't see why schemes shouldn't be allowed to just say that the stuff after the colon is opaque.

[09:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's no sense in requiring escaping in that case.

[09:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
the escaping might be needed if e.g. you have a space-separated list of them

[09:09:00.0000] <annevk5>
but that requirement should not come from the URL spec imo

[09:13:00.0000] <umbrae>
Just curious your guys' opinion on this: I have blog entry (as an <article>), and a pull quote that is repeated inside of this article for visual distinction. Should that pull quote go inside of an <aside>, or a <figure>? Or something else?

[09:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The spec specifically suggests <aside> for pull quotes.

[09:16:00.0000] <umbrae>
I feel like aside is right as well, just questioned myself a bit because figure doesn't explicitly say 'media', so I was curious what the consensus might be.

[09:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Aside and figure are pretty similar in concept.

[09:19:00.0000] <umbrae>
Seems so. I still think the distinction is semantically useful, though.

[10:17:00.0000] <badcat>
hello guys! Not sure if this is the right channel to ask, but I'm looking for a javascript library that helps me a bit with the html5 canvas - basically something that makes having interactive scenes/interfaces with canvas a bit easier

[10:18:00.0000] <badcat>
qt (the c++ framework) has a graphics scene class that allows me to add and manipulate objects in real time and have events dispatched whenever the user drag/drops or clicks on scene items

[10:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
you might wanna look at SVG instead

[10:22:00.0000] <badcat>
annevk5: why?

[10:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
it has objects and events et al

[10:24:00.0000] <badcat>
annevk5: canvas has that too, also I have to visualize data and objects that I receive as JSON via ajax, so that might be a problem

[10:26:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Why would that be a problem? The WG likes to call it Scriptable Vector Graphics, after all...

[10:27:00.0000] <badcat>
hmm, i'll take a look into that. but I really loved the fact that I could simply parse the JSON data, and iterate over the javascript objects to draw my objects to the canvas. unfortunately making it interactive is a whole different story

[10:29:00.0000] <umbrae>
Are you looking to help contribute code, badcat? Carena looks a bit like what you're talking about but is still incredibly early in development: http://github.com/tmpvar/carena

[10:30:00.0000] <badcat>
umbrae: not really, I'm looking for something that already exists. I've found progressing.js, but it doesn't seem like what I need

[10:49:00.0000] <vsedach>
hello

[10:49:01.0000] <vsedach>
I have a question about canvas clipping regions

[10:50:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
vsedach, just ask

[10:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
badcat: You can interate over the JSON data to draw your objects by using DOM functions to construct an SVG document

[10:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
*iterate

[10:50:03.0000] <vsedach>
as far as I can see from the spec, there's no way to reset a clipping region, only add to it

[10:50:04.0000] <vsedach>
so the way to manage clipping regions is save/restore

[10:50:05.0000] <vsedach>
is that correct?

[10:51:00.0000] <vsedach>
if so, that's pretty annoying

[10:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
vsedach: Yes

[10:51:02.0000] <badcat>
Philip`: I'm reading about it right now.. looking for some concrete examples

[10:52:00.0000] <vsedach>
are there plans to add a resetClip method?

[10:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
vsedach: Why is it annoying to use save/restore?

[10:53:00.0000] <vsedach>
Philip`: if you want to change the clipping region but keep the rest of the state the same, you basically end up with your own save/restore clip region method that fakes resetClip

[10:54:00.0000] <vsedach>
this isn't a problem with new code, but I'm working on an application that generates drawing commands assuming there's a resetClip (it's written for cairo)

[10:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's some vague desire to redesign the path API, which I guess includes the clipping, but I don't think that's been worked out in any detail

[10:58:00.0000] <vsedach>
Philip`: thanks for the info! I guess I'll have to make do :)

[12:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
so... video and Content-Type headers

[12:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
are we calling a time of death and requiring well-defined interoperable sniffing?

[12:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't even know where to begin to test what browsers do with this

[12:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i searched for a random webm file

[12:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
first one i found was text/plain

[12:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
that bodes well

[12:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why does anyone care if browsers sniff here, again?  Other than theoretical purity?  As long as they're not interpreting non-scripted content as scripted . . .

[12:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not aware of any reason other than theoretical purity

[12:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: It helps users who see a <video> that plays, and right-click and say "open in new tab", and get a load of text/plain garbage displayed instead

[12:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, they can sniff on direct viewing too.

[12:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's a pain, but servers just don't set MIME types right, so . . .

[12:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: they wouldn't get text/plain garbage

[12:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: since we're already sniffing in that case

[12:30:00.0000] <karlushi>
I do not think it is "servers that just don't set MIME types right" but more "servers administrators/configuration UIs make it hard for users to add MIME types" (when new stuff is coming).

[12:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Are you saying that users should be required to manually add new MIME types to their server for stuff to work properly?

[12:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That seems undesirable.

[12:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
People should be able to just dump stuff from FTP and have it work, if possible.

[12:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
To some extent that's not possible, of course.

[12:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really see the point of MIME types for binary data types

[12:32:00.0000] <karlushi>
:) FTP is not part of the Web, the failure of mime type on the Web is partly because of that :) but that is a long story.

[12:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe we should just officially switch from MIME types to file extensions.  The latter are probably much more reliable for random files . . .

[12:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But for binary types, sniffing is usually fairly easy, if the formats are designed to support it.

[12:32:03.0000] <karlushi>
I would expect that yes for some hosting platform giving the possibilities for users to set up some mime types might be useful and will distribute the management of issues. 

[12:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or you could just not require MIME types to be set up at all.  Practically speaking, why is that not the better solution?

[12:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: file extensions are as bad as mime types as far as i can tell

[12:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You shouldn't have to know what a MIME type is to put up some video on your website.

[12:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
possibly worse since the receiver specifies it

[12:33:04.0000] <karlushi>
AryehGregor, you might want to put things online without file extension.

[12:33:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, they can't be as bad as MIME types, because servers usually base the MIME type on the extension.  At least extensions work without server configuration.

[12:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I'm not talking about stuff that passes through scripts, though.)

[12:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
karlushi, well, so then use MIME.

[12:34:02.0000] <karlushi>
AryehGregor, exactly :)

[12:34:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But most people use file extensions.

[12:34:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even for well-known types, it will usually be served with a MIME type that's just inferred from the extension.

[12:34:05.0000] <Hixie>
whatever solution we use, we definitely want something that the is picked by the sender, not the receiver

[12:35:00.0000] <karlushi>
but if you use the bloggers, the tumblr, etc. of this world. You enter in issues on configuration for new mime types such as WebM

[12:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Who are the sender and receiver here?

[12:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
ideally something that can't be wrong, e.g., defined sniffing for binary data

[12:35:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sniffing for binary data can be wrong, see GIFAR.

[12:36:00.0000] <karlushi>
Maybe it could be mime types config file distribution ala SpamAssassin (sa-update), We could have a mime type update mt-update

[12:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which people on shared hosting will deploy how?

[12:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
GIFARs rely on undefined sniffing

[12:36:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, if every binary format chose a unique binary string to prefix the file, then sniffing would always work.

[12:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's too bad that's not a universally-accepted standard.

[12:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
we don't have a universally-accepted standard :-)

[12:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But the cat is out of the bag with JAR anyway, so a WebMAR vulnerability makes no difference at this point.

[12:37:03.0000] <karlushi>
There is a lot of social engineering which could be put in place to improve the situation (not fixing everything but improving)

[12:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or you could skip the social aspect, acknowledge it's a technical problem, and go with an easy-to-deploy technical solution without demanding special effort from anyone.

[12:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which seems like the best option here.

[12:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although sniffing on a large scale is massively headache-inducing.  I reported a bug to freedesktop.org because it would sniff any file beginning with "--" as a VHDL document.

[12:39:01.0000] <karlushi>
http://www.w3.org/TR/chips/#gl7

[12:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But in the limited context of a web browser having to figure out how to handle a small number of types, I guess it's feasible.

[12:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, great, let's try to resurrect content negotiation.  Have fun with that.

[12:40:00.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.5.3 This distinction doesn't exist in HTML5 right?

[12:40:01.0000] <karlushi>
:) we do not have to resurrect it. We already use it :)

[12:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
ojan, it does, it's just not called that.

[12:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably because it's confusing, since the same terms are used by CSS.

[12:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML5 calls them "flow content" and "phrasing content" or something.

[12:41:02.0000] <ojan>
AryehGregor: specifically, i'm wondering whether it's valid to put block-level elements inside inlines

[12:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: we have a slightly different distinction

[12:41:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
ojan, check each element for what its content model is.

[12:41:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It says in the spec what any given element can contain.

[12:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
karlushi, for compression options, maybe.  It's not generally used for serving entirely different data formats from the same URL.

[12:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: some elements that used to be "inline" (e.g. <a>) are allowed to contain elements that used to be "block" (e.g. <p>), but as AryehGregor says, best to just look at the spec's content models to get a precise answer.

[12:43:00.0000] <ojan>
Hixie, AryehGregor: thx. we're trying to figure out what sort of rules webkit's editing code should use

[12:43:01.0000] <karlushi>
"not generally used" :) generally is important here. Some people are using it ;) Some people do not use it :) that's fine by me.

[12:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Content negotiation is used by a few standards diehards as a proof-of-concept, but not actually used by any nontrivial number of production sites.

[12:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I will grant that its adoption probably exceeds that of XHTML2, for example.

[12:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But by any reasonable metric of success, content negotiation was and is a failure, and it should be treated as such.

[12:44:01.0000] <karlushi>
/me wonders why do you hate so much freedom :)

[12:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, of course, I hate freedom.  Also puppies, and charity.

[12:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me hands karlushi some more straw to help him make his strawmen :-)

[12:45:02.0000] <karlushi>
puppies!

[12:46:00.0000] <karlushi>
what I meant is that it is possible to use it. :) It doesn't hurt anyone. The only thing I wish is that some server config UIs give more freedom to people than just the sys admin. 

[12:47:00.0000] <karlushi>
I have no issues with it, because I roll my own

[12:47:01.0000] <karlushi>
but I have control on my server. 

[12:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't hurt anyone, but it's a failure, as a standard.  Our goal here is to come up with specs that are not failures.

[12:47:03.0000] <karlushi>
not everyone has this freedom :)

[12:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
content negotiation does "hurt" people; it costs bytes on every single HTTP transaction

[12:47:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Therefore we should be citing content negotiation solely as something to avoid.

[12:47:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
(that too)

[12:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
in general though it's water under the bridge, it's only relevant as a technology from which to learn what mistakes to avoid when making new ones

[12:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, time to go

[12:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[12:48:03.0000] <karlushi>
AryehGregor, I guess I'm less… hmmm… absolutist? (not sure it is the right word)

[12:48:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Less interested in making specs that are actually adopted and not just a waste of implementer resources"?

[12:50:00.0000] <karlushi>
AryehGregor, more on the line of "it is not possible a specification which is 100% perfect" (utopia) and there are some features which are used by minorities which do not necessary create issues for the larger crowd.  

[12:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It looks like the enum reflection logic in HTML5 is lifted from IE, and not implemented by any other browser at all.

[12:51:00.0000] <karlushi>
(*) possible to create

[12:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
karlushi, in this case, the minority is like <0.001% of users/authors, and the effect of content negotiation could be replicated even if it didn't exist.  Implementers do not want to spend their time on such features.  They have limited time, and have more important things to do.

[12:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Things that, say, 80% of people will find useful instead of <0.001%.

[12:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If an implementer spends time creating your niche feature instead of one that's useful to the majority, then yes, that feature does hurt the majority.

[12:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Accept-Language has the same problems (hardly used, adds bytes to every request) and also makes user fingerprinting easier

[12:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Accept-Encoding is used in practice, though.

[12:55:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(very widely)

[12:55:03.0000] <karlushi>
This will be very hard for discussing because we will turn in a series of useless arguments about new features of the specification which are not implemented at all, or not used at all (in a meaningful way) but still in the spec. :) If we stay on the initial question, we were talking about content negociation which is already implemented. 

[12:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And it was a waste of time.  We'd all be better off if it had not been implemented (except for encodings, maybe).

[12:56:01.0000] <karlushi>
…

[12:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
:)

[12:57:01.0000] <karlushi>
/me repeat repeat the cycle: wash,  rinse and dry. Not sure there is a solution in the discussion. running into circles. 

[12:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yep!

[12:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Thankfully, the question is pretty much settled in the WHATWG, and people who disagree can just go off and write their own specs and be ignored.

[12:58:02.0000] <karlushi>
/me is happily using content negociation ;) as long as it is here. 

[12:58:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But if you're participating in the WHATWG, then citing content negotiation as anything but a failure is unlikely to convince anyone.

[13:00:00.0000] <karlushi>
… hmmm. interesting. The only thought I have right now is "Peace".  

[13:59:00.0000] <miketaylr>
is there any reason that reading pixels via ctx.getImageData() from an image with svg doc set as its source should raise a security exception (same domain, etc)

[13:59:01.0000] <miketaylr>
http://paulirish.com/i/f4c0.png is what i'm looking at

[14:02:00.0000] <miketaylr>
/me scratches head

[16:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, the conclusion from this afternoon's work is that browsers suck except for firefox

[16:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
and possibly opera

[16:57:00.0000] <daedb>
what do they suck at?

[16:57:01.0000] <Workshiva>
All browsers suck, really

[16:57:02.0000] <Workshiva>
It's just a question of magnitude

[16:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/video/001.html - temporarily hangs safari, chrome sniffs but lets the mime type affect UI behaviour, opera sniffs (per html spec), and firefox refuses to sniff at all (per http spec)

[16:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
haven't been able to test IE9

[16:59:00.0000] <daedb>
/me tests IE9...


2010-08-19
[17:00:00.0000] <daedb>
Hixie: IE9 shows the h264 video for all mime types

[17:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
and nothing for the others?

[17:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
and it starts at the same point for all of the ones that play?

[17:01:00.0000] <daedb>
nothing under ogg or webm columns

[17:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
k, thanks

[17:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
well of the browsers that sniff, that's the most rational behaviour

[17:02:00.0000] <daedb>
all videos that play look the same to me

[17:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
excellent

[17:03:00.0000] <daedb>
I'm only doing a quick look though, nothing too thorough :)

[17:09:00.0000] <Hixie>

just when I thought dealing with WebSocket protocol stuff couldn't get any more tine-consuming

[20:54:00.0000] <erlehmann>
anyone aware of a gzip compression implementation in javascript?

[20:55:00.0000] <jacobolus>
mcarter: did anyone ever do gzip in javascript that you know of?

[20:55:01.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: you might try asking in channels w/ more specifically javascript devs

[20:55:02.0000] <jacobolus>
erlehmann: e.g. someone in #node.js might have some idea

[20:56:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i found one that writes zip files, but behaves funny … it does not compress.

[20:56:01.0000] <jacobolus>
anyway, good luck. I'm outta here

[22:08:00.0000] <nimbupani>

[23:36:00.0000] <micheil>
annevk5: has anyone bothered to ask the biggest question of websockets: do we actually need protocol extensions?

[23:37:00.0000] <micheil>
like, I mean, what percentage of users / developers are actually going to use them?

[23:38:00.0000] <hober>
yes, that point has been raised on a number of occasions on the hybi list

[23:38:01.0000] <hober>
by maciej, ian, adam, and others

[23:38:02.0000] <micheil>
right, just thought I'd check

[23:39:00.0000] <micheil>
because really, I think we're going a little bit over the top with it all.

[23:39:01.0000] <micheil>
it's meant to be a simple transport method.

[23:39:02.0000] <micheil>
not the one-and-only ring-to-rule-them-all transport method.

[23:40:00.0000] <micheil>
like, sending a DVD over websockets, you probably should be doing that. Just use file transfers using http, that's already existent.

[23:41:00.0000] <micheil>
s/you probably should be doing/you probably shouldn't be doing

[23:46:00.0000] <cardona507>
one-and-only-ring-to-rule-them-all transport method - nice

[23:46:01.0000] <hober>
I'm sure you can easily imagine that you're preaching to the choir here. :)

[23:47:00.0000] <micheil>
good point.

[23:47:01.0000] <micheil>
I should get a few of the guys I know at Yahoo! to weigh in on it.

[23:47:02.0000] <micheil>
because I know some of the things they are planning to do / try with websockets are quite what it was necessarily designed for.

[23:47:03.0000] <cardona507>
you going to the crockford tech talk at yahoo! on the 27th?

[23:48:00.0000] <micheil>
sadly not.

[23:48:01.0000] <cardona507>
Yeah - I am looking forward to it

[23:48:02.0000] <cardona507>
talking about node

[23:48:03.0000] <micheil>
(well, not that I've been invited to have a plane fair paid :P)

[23:48:04.0000] <micheil>
wait. 27th august?

[23:48:05.0000] <cardona507>
heh

[23:48:06.0000] <cardona507>
yep

[23:48:07.0000] <cardona507>
next week

[23:49:00.0000] <micheil>
dang. wouldn't be able to go even if I wanted to.

[23:49:01.0000] <micheil>
curse exams.

curse exams indeed :)

[23:50:00.0000] <micheil>
seriously.. pretty much missed any possibility to go to jsconf this year due to exams too. and I get to miss WDS due to more exams.

[23:50:01.0000] <micheil>
what's with that?

[23:50:02.0000] <cardona507>
hopefully a good degree

[23:50:03.0000] <cardona507>
or a good startup partner

[23:50:04.0000] <micheil>
actually, it's not a degree at all.

[23:51:00.0000] <micheil>
wrong level of education.

[23:52:00.0000] <micheil>
cardona507: this would be high school (final year) level.

[23:52:01.0000] <cardona507>
no way - nice - congrats

[23:52:02.0000] <cardona507>
I was about to type 'dr?'

[23:52:03.0000] <cardona507>
:)

[23:53:00.0000] <micheil>
haha, well, I've actually started my uni degree as well.

[23:53:01.0000] <cardona507>
computer science?

[23:53:02.0000] <micheil>
(well, I've completed one of the modules, I still have about 6 core modules of compsci left.)

[23:53:03.0000] <micheil>
yeah, a computer science degree.

[23:54:00.0000] <cardona507>
what languages?

[23:54:01.0000] <micheil>
it's just general at the moment

[23:54:02.0000] <cardona507>
what language do you intend to focus on?

[23:54:03.0000] <micheil>
javascript?

[23:54:04.0000] <micheil>
:P

[23:54:05.0000] <cardona507>
cool

[23:55:00.0000] <cardona507>
FTW

[23:55:01.0000] <micheil>
probably either javascript, C, or Erlang

[23:55:02.0000] <micheil>
not that I've done much of the latter two

[23:56:00.0000] <cardona507>
me neither

[23:56:01.0000] <cardona507>
i like JS though

[23:57:00.0000] <micheil>
/me will bbl.

[01:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, cvs update kinda seems to take a long time when you have a directory with 1034 files in it

[02:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: This is where we mock you for using CVS, right?

[02:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[03:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
netsplit much?

[03:16:01.0000] <annevk5>
actually, sending DVDs over WebSocket is something the pro-simple camp brought up

[03:30:00.0000] <Rik`_>
MikeSmith: yeah you're right, other than testing people won't click twice

[03:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: lunch soonish?

[03:31:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: yeah, I'm starting to get hungry. But if I eat to early I will get hungry again to soon

[03:31:01.0000] <Rik`>
but I see this message while downloading : "loading… loading…"

[03:31:02.0000] <Rik`>
MikeSmith: is it intended ?

[03:31:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[03:31:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Rik`: no, that's a bug

[03:31:05.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: Have more meals! :)

[03:31:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
Rik`: that I will fix in a bit

[03:33:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: that wouldn't work. If I eat 11 I need food again around 17, but that's to early for my girlfriend to eat dinner. So I'd have to eat dinner at 19 as well. That just wouldn't work ><

[03:35:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: so what would you like to eat? Would a salad at fräcka frökens work?

[03:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: I'd rather something bigger

[03:36:01.0000] <eighty4>
pizza at forno italia?

[03:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That works for me

[03:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
eighty4: Meeting outside here at 11:55 work for you?

[03:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(or 12?)

[03:40:00.0000] <eighty4>
11.55 works good. Or I could just go right now

[03:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Okay

[03:41:00.0000] <eighty4>
try to get to forno 2 minutes earlier then everybody else

[03:41:01.0000] <eighty4>
*me leaves*

Rik`: fixed the loading… loading… loading… thing

[03:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks for the feedback and checking, btw

[03:51:00.0000] <micheil>
hmm.. anyone know who that Shelby Moore on the hybi mailing list represents?

[03:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
it's some kind of troll

[03:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it trolling if you don't recognise or accept that that's what you're doing?

[03:56:00.0000] <micheil>
I believe so.

[03:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
micheil: Have you seen http://www.glazman.org/weblog/newarchive/2003_01_05_glazblogarc.html#s87008479 for relevant background information?

[04:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1041735552&count=1

[04:36:00.0000] <micheil>
Philip`, jgraham: do you think it'd be allowed to be mandated that for each protocol extension that a person / group wishes to have, that they show code for the implementation and provide documentation as to how it follows the original intent and goals of the websocket protocol?

[04:37:00.0000] <micheil>
like, not just psuedo code, but actual code showing how much complexity it would add to the parsing of the packets, etc.

[04:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Has anyone agreed to follow the original intent and goals, or even agreed on what the intent and goals are?

[04:39:00.0000] <micheil>
I always thought that they were to create a simple bi-directional communication channel for which browsers could communicate with servers and servers could communicate with browsers in an asynchronous way.

[04:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: What do you mean "protocol extension"?

[04:41:00.0000] <micheil>
as in, anything added to the framing, handshaking or otherwise that isn't absolutely necessary for the communication of plain data

[04:41:01.0000] <micheil>
for instance, you message format, as simple as it may seem could be as simple as:

[04:41:02.0000] <micheil>
[frame-type][frame-length][frame-data]

[04:42:00.0000] <micheil>
frame-type being something like the flags currently defined

[04:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
Right, I think it is reasonable to ask people to show the code for cases where they want complexity. And people have been doing that

[04:43:00.0000] <micheil>
frame-length being the 7bits or what ever we're currently at

[04:43:01.0000] <micheil>
jgraham: so far I haven't seen much code

[04:43:02.0000] <micheil>
I've seen outlines of the packet format, but no implementations of it

[04:44:00.0000] <micheil>
(I'm not too sure I'm even reading the outlines of the packet format correctly)

[04:45:00.0000] <micheil>
bbl.

[04:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: There was one recent message with code

[04:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
and someone pointed out that it assumed a particularly simple case

[04:45:03.0000] <jgraham>
so there is evidence that code focuses the discussion somewhat

[05:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://twitter.com/kangax/status/21506116839 hmm

[05:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
I guess they are not doing that in quirks mode...

[08:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
goddammit

[08:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
is there a way to have mercurial use actual pathnames in diffs

[08:51:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
instead of whatever this a/ b/ shit

[08:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jesus

[08:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I want to meet the jackass who came up with that

[08:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
Why do you want that?

[08:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you're passing it to patch you can just add '-p1' or whatever to strip it off

[08:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm really the diff from one level above the directory where the .hg subdir is

[08:54:01.0000] <davidhund>
tidy

[08:54:02.0000] <davidhund>
erm, oops

[08:54:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I do hg diff anolis/

[08:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I get a diff with: +++ b/anolislib/processes/terms.py Fri Aug 20 00:00:23 2010 +0900

[08:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if I do -p1, I will just get +++ anolislib/processes/terms.py Fri Aug 20 00:00:23 2010

[08:55:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
right?

[08:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes (I think)

[08:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
patch -p1 -d anolis < example.diff

[08:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
might do something useful

[08:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
(or might not)

[08:57:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[08:57:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
will try

[10:13:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
http://www.w3.org/Public/Bugs seems to be down

[10:13:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hopefully not for long

[10:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmithX: Plz fix. Kthxbai.

[10:13:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
heh

[10:14:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I've already pinged systems team

[10:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmithX: Did you try M-x butterfly?

[10:16:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
jgraham: will try it if I can do it in Vim…

[10:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Also: The Birthday Massacre are awesome.

[10:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: I wish you luck finding musical playpals

[10:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
most of my friends dislike most of the music I like

[10:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
so the only appropriate reaction is, too bad

[10:18:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
friends have their pros and cons

[10:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
A managed to not get murdered for putting on metalcore with friend round yesterday. I guess I'm lucky.

[10:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
Evidence that metal is just silly item #55467 The stupid number of sub-genres

[10:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it would help if you weren't so keen on Christian Metalic Emo Noise Rock

[10:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: What? I thought he was into Christian Metalic Emo Rock Noise!

[10:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
no, gsnedders hates that stuff

[10:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: what's wrong with just listening to. e.g. Belle and Sebastian?

[10:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
girls love that stuff

[10:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well he would, if he's into Christian Metalic Emo Noise Rock

[10:21:02.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: More variety needed.

[10:21:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean it's a great way to impress girls with your sensitivity

[10:21:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me confirms this works :)

[10:21:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I think ending up curled up in their arms in tears shows sensitivity too.

[10:23:00.0000] <vals_>
it also gets you closer to their interesting parts

[10:23:01.0000] <vals_>
but anyway. does anybody know why the talk about which kind of pizza to eat is marked as "important lines" in the logs?

[10:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Because someone marked it as important.

[10:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Probably someone hungry.

[10:24:02.0000] <vals_>
8-D

[10:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Also: girls' "interesting parts" are overrated.

[10:26:01.0000] <paul_irish>
o.O

[10:27:00.0000] <vals_>
I guess that depends on your taste

[10:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has been pretty much asexual for the majority of this year

[10:28:01.0000] <pesla>
:o

[10:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . .

[10:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(and more or less aromantic as well)

[10:29:02.0000] <pesla>
Will the real gsnedders please stand up?

[10:30:00.0000] <vals_>
I've been aromatic for the majority of this summer

[10:30:01.0000] <vals_>
too frigging hot

[10:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*aromantic

[10:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
No, I did spell it correctly.

[10:31:00.0000] <vals_>
anyway, I have an actual questio about the new web standard, and specifically the relation between hN and sections

[10:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Damnit, confusing me!

[10:31:02.0000] <vals_>
yeah, you spelled it correctly 8-D

[10:31:03.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm, I should probably get the outliner back up

[10:31:04.0000] <vals_>
(outliner?)

[10:31:05.0000] <gsnedders>
http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/

[10:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, it's working again

[10:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That makes it simpler

[10:33:00.0000] <vals_>
so, the question is the following: h1, h2, ... h6 represent headings of (implied) sections, with the relative rank being useful to determine whether a new section starts or just a subsection starts

[10:33:01.0000] <vals_>
is that correct so far?

[10:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you use them that way, yes.  The other acceptable thing is to just use <h1> for everything.

[10:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
with hn, n is meaningless within section

[10:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
outwith of section, n is used to determine whether a new section or subsection starts

[10:34:02.0000] <vals_>
that's exactly what I wanted to get to. so if I do my sectioning explicitly for each heading, it doesn't really matter what section level I use, right?

[10:34:03.0000] <gsnedders>
right.

[10:35:00.0000] <vals_>
now, if I was using CSS for styling, one of the advantages of using different hN is that styling would be automatic, more or less

[10:35:01.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, isn't it at http://www.w3.org/Bugs/

[10:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: yeah

[10:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
just typoed it

[10:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, I think it's back up now

[10:36:03.0000] <vals_>
if I only use h1 and do the sectioning manually, I have to do something to say "style this way every h1 that happens under exactly N sections"

[10:36:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think the mysql server was stopped and restarted

[10:36:05.0000] <vals_>
(more or less)

[10:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
vals_: yeah

[10:40:00.0000] <vals_>
that's going to be a little painful 8-P

[10:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's part of why :any() is proposed.

[10:44:00.0000] <vals_>
yes, :any() would help a lot, and not just in this case

[10:56:00.0000] <jeromegn>
hey guys

[10:57:00.0000] <jeromegn>
is there an easy way to reconnect a websocket when it's closed?

[10:57:01.0000] <jeromegn>
I'm guessing I have to manually implement that in my app...

[11:02:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: aroudn?

[11:02:01.0000] <eighty4>
*around

[11:03:00.0000] <eighty4>
gsnedders: I've found you a FF bug that Opera handles as it should (IMO at least :))

[11:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: btw, hg diff seems to have neither a -p nor -d option

[11:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so its name is not wholly accurate

[11:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: They're optons on patch

[11:53:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe it should be call hg deficient-diff

[11:53:04.0000] <Philip`>
diff doesn't have those options either

[11:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe hg not-quite-as-deficient-as-the-diff-in-svn-diff

[11:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
(at least not any with those effects)

[11:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me scrolls back to read what Philip` said

[11:54:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[11:54:04.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: patch.

[11:54:05.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how all these formal objections will be handled

[11:54:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
hai hai hai

[11:54:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders, Philip` - I was just testing you guys

[11:54:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
so, congrats in passing the test

[11:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/FormalObjection

[11:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean whether tim is going to do anything with them

[11:56:01.0000] <payman>
/me is away: 

[11:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
(cos there's a number of things i don't particularly like the decisions of, and if tim is going to actually revert any of the decisions, it seems like it'd be worth giving it a shot)

[11:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yeah, I imagine that same thought is crossing a few other people's minds

[11:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It seems like overruling a WG decision would piss off a load of people, probably more so than the people already pissed off enough to be raising it

[11:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So, uh, I'd doubt it.

[11:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which is why, of course, most FOs just get stamped with a "Thanks for raising, move along now.", as far as I know.

[11:59:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: indeed

[12:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i've only been on one transition call, which had an FO discussed, and while I don't think Tim had any idea what the objection was about, I will give him ample credit for apparently giving it quite a fair hearing

[12:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
(to be fair it was an XBL2 issue so it's not clear anyone actually understood the issue)

[12:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So no, Hixie, I don't expect anything to happen with the FOs, and I don't think it would be useful to raise any yourself, unless the WG does something *really* stupid.

[12:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: I don't recommend acting on the assumption that nothing with happen with the formal objections

[12:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and for any given decision the WG had made, I reckon I can find someone who thinks it is really stupid

[12:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, MikeSmith, while you're here: Who do I talk to to see if there's anything weird going on with w3's mailing systems that would cause someone to get spammed with over a thousand copies of one of my emails to the CSSWG over the past 2 months?

[12:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: I recommend going on #sysreq on irc.w3.org 

[12:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and getting attention of the systems team

[12:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and trying to get a response in real time

[12:06:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[12:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if the person who received the messages can forward them, with the headers

[12:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that would of course be a huge help

[12:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
sigh -- http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10202

[12:49:01.0000] <annevk5>
I should have advocated more strongly for a codecs attribute of some sorts

[12:49:02.0000] <annevk5>
any type of media type parsing that involves parameters always gets ugly

[13:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: Does 12 opcodes seem like enough?

[13:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
It feels like you could quite quickly be adding opcodes that mean "there are more opcodes"

[13:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
Also, I am increasingly worried about the complete message length stuff. There are lots of SHOULDs and MAYs floating around which I expect to cause interoperability problems

[13:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
I expect some servers will break with fragmented messages unless clients fragment from the start (e.g. simple servers that only deal with text)

[13:39:00.0000] <annevk5>
not sure

[13:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
i suspect you want something for video

[13:40:01.0000] <annevk5>
maybe json

[13:40:02.0000] <annevk5>
can't really think of much else

[13:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
of course, famous last words and all :)

[13:47:00.0000] <llrcombs>
hmmm

[13:47:01.0000] <llrcombs>
y'know, a copy/paste API would be great

[13:48:00.0000] <annevk5>
spec it

[13:48:01.0000] <vals_>
hm is it just me or it's imposttible to style list item numbers independently from the list item themselves without nesting a p in the li and resetting the style in the p?

[13:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, ::marker might solve that at some point

[13:51:00.0000] <llrcombs>
http://pastebin.com/tJMFxt2t

[13:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
llrcombs, not a spec :)

[13:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
content should be a list

[13:55:01.0000] <llrcombs>
so like a copybuffer?

[13:55:02.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, so I expect clients to not use fragments

[13:55:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
so that you can have a history

[13:55:04.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, but the magical intermediaries might fragment

[13:55:05.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, but since the magical intermediaries are written much later

[13:55:06.0000] <llrcombs>
like with Jumpcut?

[13:55:07.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, deploying them might be impossible if servers do not play ball

[13:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey, where's Simon?

[13:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcor..

[13:56:02.0000] <annevk5>
long break

[13:56:03.0000] <llrcombs>
so, now I'm pretty much directly cloning UndoManager

[13:56:04.0000] <llrcombs>
http://pastebin.com/XgZn9Tsi

[13:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
my completion on "zcor..." doesn't work

[13:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
due to lack of Simon presence

[13:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I have to wait til he gets back

[14:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: Yeah the client doesn't fragment -> server doesn't support fragmentation properly -> intermediaries that fragment break applications to be a problem

[14:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
+ I expect

[14:09:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah well

[14:09:01.0000] <annevk5>
these transcoding proxies always seem a bit of a myth

[14:09:02.0000] <annevk5>
but who knows

[15:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Going forward, I hope that the recommendations made after deliberation by the HTML A11y TF are taken more seriously by the wider group and not unilaterally dismissed."

[15:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can't see any way to read that other than "We should make the final decision on anything accessibility-related, not you."

[15:36:01.0000] <hober>
IIRC N-1 TF recommendations have gone over quite well in the wider WG

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
clearly #whatwg should send a similar e-mail :-P

[15:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I was thinking of responding.

[15:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I probably shouldn't.

[15:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Stuff like: "The HTML5 A11y TF made the recommendation after much discussion and debate, onlist, off-list and via F2F.  We are very aware of the pros and cons of @longdesc but decided that its retention was currently the best option."

[15:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could replace "HTML5 A11y TF" with "WHATWG", and "retention" by "removal".

[15:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it's not worth getting into an argument over.  Won't accomplish anything.

[15:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
i strongly recommend letting them make fools of themselves and not doing the same for yourself

[15:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm still waiting to see how the appeals turn out.

[16:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: do you know who is responsible for the video codec selection part of chrome?

[16:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. what decides to use WebM vs Ogg vs H.264?

[16:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: ping

[16:20:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
hixie: Scherkus, I'm told.

[16:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
any idea if he's on #chromium?

[16:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
scherkus: ah, he is

[16:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[16:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, good.  I wasn't about to go searching down that list of /who.

[16:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just typed "sch<tab>" :-)

[16:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i wasn't expecting him to use his name :-)

[16:22:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's only useful about 50% of the time...

[16:23:00.0000] <roc>
hi

[16:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: you got roc back now too

[16:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
woohoo, roc's here too!

[16:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: trying to work out what to do with <video> and content-type sniffing

[16:27:02.0000] <jgraham>
Party!

[16:27:03.0000] <jgraham>
Or maybe sleep

[16:27:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me goes with that

[16:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: looks like we have five browsers and more or less five different implementations

[16:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: what's your position on this topic?

[16:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/video/001.html and http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/video/NOTES may be of interest

[16:35:00.0000] <roc>
personally I get the feeling we've raced halfway down to the bottom of the slippery slope of the poisoned well

[16:36:00.0000] <roc>
and much as I hate to do it, we're likely to have to sniff, at least for <video> loads

[16:36:01.0000] <roc>
and there's a pretty strong argument that if you sniff for <video> loads, you should sniff the same for browsing context loads

[16:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
would you want to not even sniff for streams with missing content-types?

[16:37:01.0000] <roc>
otherwise stuff like a "View Video" context menu item breaks oddly

[16:37:02.0000] <roc>
I think sniffing for streams with no content-type is fine no matter what

[16:38:00.0000] <roc>
*however* I think the other video guys in the office are more keen to hold the non-sniffing line than I am

[16:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's the benefit of not sniffing when there is a type, given that these types are basically unambiguously sniffable? or are they not?

[16:38:02.0000] <roc>
but they're not here right now

[16:38:03.0000] <roc>
here's one

[16:40:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I don't know. It's possible that in some containers you have to read a lot of data to figure out what codecs are present, where that information can be given in the MIME type. Our experts in that area are in the process of joining us...

[16:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh you'd want to respect the codecs="" parameter even when it's wrong?

[16:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
or do you just mean to throw out the content early?

[16:41:02.0000] <roc>
the latter

[16:42:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I assume if we were to sniff, we'd still not even try to load resources whose <source type> is something we cannot render?

[16:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
i assume so

[16:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
there wouldn't be any point in the type="" attribute otherwise

[16:42:03.0000] <roc>
right

[16:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
haven't tested that though

[16:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
but that seems like a case that's much more unambiguously useful to honour

[16:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
right now firefox seems to look at the mime type to pick the codec, and refuses to render mislabelled content, but i haven't tested the codecs="" parameter

[16:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/codec/wrapper/

[16:44:02.0000] <roc>
yeah, we try not to be first in the race to the bottom :)

[16:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
(whatever you call the code that does that)

[16:45:01.0000] <roc>
but we don't want to be last either :-)

[16:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[16:45:03.0000] <kinetik>
Hixie: with Matroska (and WebM, since the WebM spec doesn't exclude this "feature"), you may have to read an arbitrary amount of ASCII at the start of the file before you can identify it as a valid Matroska file (see the first paragraph of http://matroska.org/technical/specs/notes.html)

[16:45:04.0000] <roc>
we should be honoring the codecs parameter correctly, we have code (and tests!) for that

[16:46:00.0000] <kinetik>
but I'm going to propose that the WebM spec is changed to exclude that feature

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: so if you supported codecs A and B, and a file used A but was labelled video/somethingsupported;codecs=B, you would not play it?

[16:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
kinetik: wow, that's lame

[16:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
kinetik: please indeed have them fix that!

[16:47:01.0000] <roc>
Hixie: that is correct, that's what we do

[16:47:02.0000] <roc>
or is it? hmm

[16:47:03.0000] <roc>
/me thinks

[16:47:04.0000] <roc>
no I guess it's not

[16:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
i guess you don't support enough codecs to actually test that

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
or do you do the webm codec in ogg?

[16:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess that'd be one way to test it?

[16:48:02.0000] <roc>
if the container type is mislabelled, we will reject even if both the label and the resource are something we support

[16:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[16:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
that i have indeed found

[16:48:05.0000] <roc>
but we don't check that the codecs we got in the resource are the ones advertised

[16:48:06.0000] <roc>
that would be pretty easy for us to do if we wanted to

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't seem like either of these checks are especially useful to the author or user

[16:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
but they would definitely (if implemented everywhere) lead to mare accurately labeled content

[16:52:00.0000] <roc>
the brutal truth is that almost all the time, if it's done consistently and can be done unambiguously in a predictable way, sniffing is the most useful for authors and users

[16:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know that that's particularly brutal :-)

[16:54:00.0000] <roc>
it feels brutal to me :-)

[16:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
the consistency is the hard part

[16:54:02.0000] <roc>
yeah, those are big "ifs"

[16:55:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: there's a small ease-of-implementation benefit for us the way we do things; we can set up the decoder based on the container label early in the load process, instead of having to buffer data, sniff it, construct the decoder, and feed the data back into it

[16:55:01.0000] <roc>
but clearly that benefit is low priority

[16:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's the container decoder right?

[16:55:03.0000] <roc>
yeah

[16:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
the chrome guy was telling me that one of his requirements is that the decoding happens out-of-process, and so he wants to just hand the bytes straight to that other process, and for some reason for them it's easier to just have that work without knowing the type

[16:56:01.0000] <roc>
the container formats contain authoritative metadata telling you what the codecs are

[16:56:02.0000] <roc>
we don't have to sniff again

[16:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
though he said he could add (what he called "artificial") checks for the type

[16:56:04.0000] <roc>
thankfully

[16:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we could limit how much you have to buffer, would that help?

[16:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
or is buffering any of the payload vs the headers a problem?


2010-08-20
[17:00:00.0000] <roc>
It's really not a problem

[17:00:01.0000] <roc>
it's just extra code

[17:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[17:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i get the feeling some of the other implementations have the opposite situation because they just hand the whole shebang over to a Multimedia Framework and have that figure it out on its own

[17:02:00.0000] <roc>
yeah, for them it's definitely easier to sniff

[17:02:01.0000] <roc>
if you have a framework that always sniffs

[17:02:02.0000] <roc>
like Quicktime

[17:04:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I think kinetik and I are pretty much resigned to sniffing everything at this point, but doublec may not be, so I'll get him to chime in when he shows up

[17:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
awesome, thanks

[17:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm hoping we don't have to sniff everything

[17:05:00.0000] <roc>
ok

[17:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm hoping we can do what opera does rather than safari/IE/chrome

[17:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is to use the mime type as a "no" but not as a "yes", basically

[17:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
so it can be wrong, so long as it's a supported type

[17:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
since that at least has the benefit of minimising network usage

[17:06:00.0000] <roc>
I suspect you'll get a lot of pushback against that from Apple, but I should let them speak for themselves

[17:06:01.0000] <roc>
we'd certainly be happy with that if you can get everyone on board

[17:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i've been trying to get in touch with the relevant apple people

[17:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't even know who to contact on the IE side

[17:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Can we get @srcdoc to imply @sandbox?  Sandboxing is basically the entire *point* of @srcdoc, and it would help security in the common case.

[17:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not a huge fan of implying security attributes, but maybe... does abarth have an opinion?

[17:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haven't asked him; I was just talking to jschuh, who's implementing @srcdoc right now.

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
it'd be good to get his take on it

[17:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm just afraid of it being common for authors to do <iframe srcdoc="<script>evilcode()</script>"></iframe> and not realizing that this is insecure.

[17:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, understood

[17:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
it removes the ability to not have a sandbox though

[17:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
and often you'll want to say sandbox=allow-same-origin or whatever the keyword is

[17:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
and also add seamless

[17:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
so will it really help? hard to say

[17:51:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you don't need a sandbox, then you can just splice it into your page directly.

[17:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
not always

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
it can be convenient to stick something in its own document

[17:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
agreed that it's not the main use case though

[17:52:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Asking abarth now.

[18:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
abarth says it sounds godo.

[18:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm thinking that for the more advanced use-cases that want an iframe but not the sandbox, we can just say "use data: urls".

[18:01:01.0000] <abarth>
does this cause problems for @seamless?

[18:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think it causes problems

[18:02:01.0000] <abarth>
you want srcdoc+seamless to work without sandbox="allow-same-origin"

[18:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Do you?

[18:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
i just assumed you'd still have to list sandbox explicitly if you wanted seamless

[18:03:00.0000] <abarth>
isn't the common case that you want srcdoc + seamless + all the sandbox bits turned on

[18:03:01.0000] <abarth>
e.g., blog comments

[18:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
not all of them, but yes

[18:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
not all the bits, i mean

[18:03:04.0000] <abarth>
which bits do you want off in the common case?

[18:04:00.0000] <abarth>
put another way, the reason restrict @seamless to same-origin is to stop you from screwing with / learning about other people's content

[18:04:01.0000] <abarth>
but if the content comes from srcdoc

[18:04:02.0000] <abarth>
it's your own content anyway

[18:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
you want allow-same-origin and maybe allow-top-navigation, but you probably don't want allow-forms or allow-scripts (or allow-plugins when we have updated the API)

[18:05:00.0000] <abarth>
i keep forgetting that allow-top-navigation is really useful when you have script disabled

[18:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
(you definitely don't want allow-forms or allow-scripts if you have allow-same-origin)

[18:06:00.0000] <mcarter>
anyone happen to know what verison of javascript IE9 supports/will support?

[18:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
(you usually don't need allow-top-navigation if you have seamless)

[18:06:02.0000] <abarth>
it complicates the model, but i seems like we should let @seamless work for srcdoc documents, even if they're sandboxed into a different origin

[18:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd like @seamless to work with @srcdoc, without necessarily even saying @sandbox=allow-same-origin.

[18:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[18:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
that would need careful thought

[18:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
but seems reasonable on the face of it

[18:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
send mail

[18:07:05.0000] <abarth>
ok

[18:07:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Kk.

[18:07:07.0000] <abarth>
btw, there's a patch under review in webkit to add srcdoc

[18:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43683

[18:08:01.0000] <abarth>
so now is a good time to work out these things :)

[18:08:02.0000] <abarth>
no seamless yet though

[18:08:03.0000] <abarth>
TabAtkins: are you sending this mail or am i?

[18:08:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can do it.

[18:08:05.0000] <abarth>
thx

[18:08:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me will send it tomorrow morning.

[18:09:00.0000] <abarth>
getting the HTTP WG to do anything is ridiculously painful

[18:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like we already allow text/html-sandboxed to be seamless when it's not sandboxed, even though it's cross-origin

[18:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
this seems equivalent

[18:13:00.0000] <abarth>
Hixie: yes

[18:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
mcarter, IE9 aims to support ES5, from what I read.

[18:15:00.0000] <mcarter>
AryehGregor, thanks

[18:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: re html-sandboxed and seamless, are you referring to the line "or the browsing context's active document's address has the same origin as the iframe element's document"?

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[18:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[18:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's the only case i can think of off-hand

[18:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was wondering about that, since a naive reading seems to make it equivalent to the other horn of the or clause.

[18:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are lots of cases of a url being cross-origin but the doc being same-origin, but the only case i can think of of a url being same-origin but a doc cross-origin is html-sandboxed

[18:20:00.0000] <abarth>
why not just @sandbox ?

[18:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
?

[18:20:02.0000] <abarth>
@sandbox doesn't alter the URL of the document

[18:20:03.0000] <abarth>
it just makes it cross-origin

[18:21:00.0000] <abarth>
you can't tell if something is same-origin by looking at it's URL

[18:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Right, that'll do it too.

[18:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[18:21:03.0000] <abarth>
it's URL just initializes the origin

[18:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
abarth: the sandox case is handled separately in this instance

[18:24:01.0000] <abarth>
ah, ok

[18:49:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: re: use cases for time element, your March 2009 summary email lists automated adding to a calendar, restyling dates for user conventions and encoding output of input element unambiguously. Is that still accurate?

[18:49:01.0000] <boblet>
ref: http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018888.html

[19:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: yes, though also add a less-dubious-than-abbr solution for microformats and microdata encoding dates

[19:03:00.0000] <boblet>
hixie: ok. I’m curious about year and year-month. for adding to calendar, what about future dates which are not yet confirmed? eg 5 year plans

[19:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
do you have an example of a page where it would be helpful for the user to be able to add a five-year plan to his calendar by clicking one thing on the page?

[19:06:00.0000] <boblet>
personally I’d like to add dates for future events I’m organising (Web Directions) to my calendar, but adding a day when they’re only accurate to a month seems like false detail.

[19:06:01.0000] <boblet>
current workaround is to add for the first of the month then try to remember what dates are set and which ones are vague

[19:07:00.0000] <boblet>
(these are on a private planning site)

[19:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
wouldn't it be more likely that you'd add those to the calendar before making a web page

[19:23:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: there are several of us planning, plus others who need read/write or just read access. I’m making a list of dates in the planning site, then we’re adding dates to a shared Google Calendar. However I’d also like to do this from HTML

[19:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
you just want to add the dates? not event names, locations, etc?

[19:25:01.0000] <boblet>
(that way I’d only have to make the page with event info inc. microformatted dates, not add the events to a calendar plus make the page)

[19:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't follow

[19:32:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: I’d like a list of events in a planning site, plus to be able to add them to a calendar. current process is create events in calendar plus create list on planning site. with microformats I could just do planning site then one-click to add to calendar

[19:32:01.0000] <boblet>
(the less time in iCal.app the better :/ )

[19:40:00.0000] <knowtheory>
sup?

[19:40:01.0000] <knowtheory>
oops sorry wrong channel :P

[19:42:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: for the 2nd point (automatic formatting to follow user conventions), in Japan it’s common to write dates with kanji separators; 2010年8月20日. using time it’d be possible to do this automatically, but these also apply to year-month and year dates (eg weblog archive titles)

[19:43:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: for the 3rd point (encode output of input element unambiguously) that should apply to year-month input too, no?

[20:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: re your example, i don't see why you'd need anything new from <time> if you're going to use a microformat or microdata. For example, vEvent is based on dates as used with <time>, not months or years, iirc.

[20:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: even for multi-day or -year events

[20:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: regarding your 2nd point, good to know.

[20:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: regarding your 3rd point, i don't know; do people ever print the output of type=month in that way?

[20:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
the main use case for type=month is credit card expiry dates, but those get pretty printed easily as far as i can tell

[20:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
no need for <time> for that

[20:04:01.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: print the output? pretty printed?

[20:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
as in, sites just do printf "%04d-%02m", $year, $month

[20:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
or vice versa

[20:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't need anything complex

[20:05:03.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: aah

[20:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
and might even actively not need anything complex, i dunno... how do japanese e-commerce sites echo expiry dates?

[20:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
what do japanese credit cards look like?

[20:05:06.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: I’m pretty sure I’ve seen Japanese ecommerce sites that have the year as 2-digit

[20:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure but do they have the kanji sepuarators?

[20:06:01.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: yeah, some Japanese credit cards have the expiry date as eg 10/15

[20:07:00.0000] <boblet>
(with English “Month/Year” printed faintly above)

[20:07:01.0000] <boblet>
but then there’s the whole Japanese year format thing… (wikipedia-ing…)

[20:14:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: found it; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_era_name 2010 is actually 22年 (the 22nd year of the Heisei era). in long form today is 20-8-2010 or 2010年8月20日 or 平22年8月20日 (the 平 being the first kanji of 平成 or the Heisei era)

[20:19:00.0000] <boblet>
actually it would be useful to use <time datetime="1935">昭9年</time> (the ninth year of the Shōwa era) as even Japanese people have trouble with this system outside of dates they’re familiar with. I’ve got a free iPhone converter app for this :)

[20:19:01.0000] <boblet>

Hixie: I’ll add this info to the wiki page, want me to also email the list about it?

[20:27:01.0000] <boblet>

[20:39:00.0000] <Hixie>

/me is back.. rejoice! ..[after 2120wks1day3h56m25s]

[22:02:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: ok, thanks

[22:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: about the index of terms and handling of how to distinguish references to defining instances of terms from the others

[22:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I implemented your suggestion

[22:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/index-of-terms.html

[22:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the links to the defining instances are now just shown in the same order as they occur in document order

[22:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in bold

[22:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
could of course maybe even make them a different color or something

[22:50:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
eventually

[22:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but bolding them seems to make them stand out well enough

[22:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
one perhaps quirky thing is that some of them dfns are not the first mentions of the terms in the sections where they occur

[22:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so instead of the hypertext for them themselves being a section title

[22:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it is instead a counter number

[22:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is, one of the (2), (3), etc. numbers

[22:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I had thought would turn out to look weird

[22:53:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but even that seems to work OK

[22:53:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
to me at least

[23:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: yeah, looks good. Probably should drop the "no references" thing though since now the dfns are basically references.

[23:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: what about "no other references" maybe?

[23:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno that it even needs to be there at all, i mean, if you're looking up a term in an index, and there's only one reference, that's ok

[23:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[23:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will it so

[23:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: not sure what to do about the conflicting terms... "align" in particular looks weird

[23:49:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will make it so

[23:49:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[23:49:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's one of the downsides

[23:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can maybe work on figuring out how to merge those

[23:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
"command" is similarly kind of a disaster

[23:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's four of them and even i don't know which is which :-)

[23:50:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[23:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh you know what would be cool? if you could detect if the <dfn>ing instance used <code> or not

[23:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
so that elements got styled "correctly" in the index

[23:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno how easy that would be

[23:51:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's doable

[23:51:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's easy

[23:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[23:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
this is awesome, i really love this index

[23:51:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think I could also deal with the align. command, etc., stuff by having anolis do another pass on the contents

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
can't wait to see what it looks like for complete.html :-D

[23:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and merging stuff

[23:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[23:52:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[23:52:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will say that this is going to slow down your build/checkin times

[23:52:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
when you make changes

[23:52:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
dunno if you care

[23:52:07.0000] <Hixie>
a lot of the duplicates are in the non-conforming section, which makes merging them ok

[23:52:08.0000] <Hixie>
it's the other ones i'm worried about

[23:52:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[23:52:10.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: does it slow down anolis? Or just the splitter?

[23:52:11.0000] <Hixie>
or what?

[23:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anolis, mainly.. on my machine it takes about 6 minutes to have it build the author view

[23:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh yikes

[23:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there might be some way I can speed it up, I dunno

[23:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we can have the spec splitters do the anolis pass as well

[23:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[23:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
right now i subcontract out to jgraham's pimpmyspec for the anolis part, get one file back, then subcontract out to annevk and Philip`'s spec splitters, which send be tarballs back.

[23:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm

[23:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[23:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
but if i could just send a source file to anne and Philip` that would work fine for me too

[23:55:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
that can be combined for sure

[23:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
well i only do the splitting once i checkin at the moment

[23:55:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's all python

[23:55:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[23:55:07.0000] <Hixie>
and the anolis part when i regen

[23:55:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[23:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the anolis part was not terrifically fast before anyway

[23:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I can't remember how long it took but it was a minute or two, it seemed like

[23:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the splitter is much faster

[00:57:00.0000] <boblet>
nice work MikeSmith :)

<svg><[CDATA[]]>

[09:09:02.0000] <jgraham>
A character token with the empty string or no character token?

[09:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
"""Consume every character up to the next occurrence of the three character sequence U+005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET U+005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (]]>), or the end of the file (EOF), whichever comes first. Emit a series of character tokens consisting of all the characters consumed except the matching three character sequence at the end (if one was found before the end of the file)."""

[09:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
Suggests no character tokens, but it is not really clear

[09:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I thought character tokens contained characters, not strings

[09:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
and the empty string is not a character

[09:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
so it wouldn't make type-sense to have that

[09:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: That could be true

[09:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: the spec soesn't really say though

[09:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
it just says "Character tokens have data"

[09:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
It says "Character tokens"

[09:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
not "string tokens" or "text tokens" or "characters tokens"

[09:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
Right but "character" is just an opaque string unless it is defined

[09:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I'm generally willing to believe it's for a character

[09:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
though it could be more explicit

[09:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
Why is it more of an opaque strings than the words that would be used in its definition?

[09:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway, I agree with you

[10:50:00.0000] <variable>
can someone please explain the use-case behind <device> ? If you have ml references that would be better

[10:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Input from web cams and microphones are the two biggest use-cases.

[10:52:00.0000] <variable>
AryehGregor, I'm a little confused then on how it would work

[10:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's not fully specced yet, is it?

[10:53:00.0000] <variable>
AryehGregor, no, but I'm not even sure what possible specs there could be. <device webcam>If you don't have a webcam then you see this</device> otherwise you see a permission box ?

[10:54:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
variable: https://labs.ericsson.com/blog/beyond-html5-implementing-device-and-stream-management-webkit may or may not provide some insights

[10:54:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't think the spec will dictate UI.

[10:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But that's the general idea.  It's an element that will provide an API to read from various devices.

[10:54:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not sure why it's an HTML element instead of just a JS interface, though.

[10:55:00.0000] <variable>
Thats why I'm confused. I could only see this being used as a JS interface. 

[10:55:01.0000] <variable>
I don't see what value an element offers 

[10:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Can't help you there.

[10:58:00.0000] <variable>
"Web browsers are not the only programs that use HTML. Sometimes elements and features are needed even when browsers won't use them in any meaningful way. Document authoring tools, validators, search engines, screen readers, outliners, researchers, etc. all need and can use more information than a browser can. Furthermore if you provide more information than is currently used by browsers it opens up room for innovation. " --> does this paragraph

[10:58:01.0000] <variable>
 make sense? Should I change anything? it is meant to go under a section "It isn't just about web browsers"

[11:11:00.0000] <variable>
MikeSmithXX, thanks for that link btw

[11:11:01.0000] <MikeSmithXX>

[11:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why does HTML5 link to the text versions of RFCs instead of the HTML versions?  It seems a bit perverse, considering.

[11:29:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
AryehGregor, my fault, I guess. No good reason I can remember, file a bug if you want

"Mozilla Firefox 63.05%" - that too

[15:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
"Microsoft Internet Explorer 19.82%" - I don't know how they're counting that

[15:56:00.0000] <llrcombs>
anyone know of a RTMP client in JS using WebSocket?

[15:57:00.0000] <Workshiva>
I thought the usual flash number quoted was 98%

[15:58:00.0000] <llrcombs>
I just thought "Hey, maybe if someone exposed a huge security flaw in Flash, people might stop using it!"

[15:58:01.0000] <llrcombs>
then I thought, "Wait, that's happened before, and people didn't stop using it (neither did web devs)"

[15:59:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Awh, Steam at 100%

[15:59:01.0000] <Workshiva>
I was hoping for a surprise there

[15:59:02.0000] <llrcombs>
lol

[16:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
I assume these numbers are hugely weighted towards home computers vs office computers, and somewhat towards more technical vs less technical users

[16:01:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Philip`: The browser entries add up to more than 100%, so it can't be default browser either

[16:02:00.0000] <llrcombs>
is it a survey or a detection software?

[16:02:01.0000] <llrcombs>
if it's a survey, it's possible that people interpreted as whatever software they _use_

[16:02:02.0000] <Workshiva>
It's most certainly detection

[16:03:00.0000] <llrcombs>
so... I've got nothing

[16:03:01.0000] <llrcombs>
anyone know anything abou that HTML5 RTMP client?

[16:04:00.0000] <llrcombs>
I dev a Safari extension that replaces Flash video players with HTML5 ones

[16:04:01.0000] <llrcombs>
RTMP is kinda pointless to use for media

[16:04:02.0000] <llrcombs>
and I don't support it

[16:05:00.0000] <llrcombs>
but still, to get more support for more video sites, I'd need an RTMP client

[16:05:01.0000] <llrcombs>
oh, RTMP/RTSP

[16:06:00.0000] <llrcombs>
ohwait RTSP is already supported

[16:06:01.0000] <llrcombs>
so I take back the RTSP bit

I can't find anything right about that article

[16:09:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
llrcombs: I don't think any browser supports RTSP at the moment

[16:09:01.0000] <llrcombs>
eric: Safari on OSX does!

[16:09:02.0000] <llrcombs>
because Core Video does!

[16:10:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
llrcombs: No, QuickTime supports it

[16:10:01.0000] <llrcombs>
am I mistaken?

[16:11:00.0000] <llrcombs>
I was under the impression that it did

[16:11:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
llrcombs: but Safari does not because it is disabled in WebKit (or was the last time I checked)

[16:11:02.0000] <midgard>
is there an html5 validator from the whatwg?

[16:11:03.0000] <llrcombs>

[16:11:04.0000] <llrcombs>
migard: W3C has one

[16:12:00.0000] <llrcombs>
heh

[16:12:01.0000] <llrcombs>
I guess it doesn't!

[16:12:02.0000] <llrcombs>
wow

[16:12:03.0000] <llrcombs>
I wonder why that's disabled

[16:12:04.0000] <llrcombs>
sorry for my rudeness

[16:13:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
llrcombs: QuickTime does support RTSP, but WebKit blocks it because it caused crashes

[16:14:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
llrcombs: that was when antti originally added the media element to WebKit

[16:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
midgard: http://html5.validator.nu/

[16:14:02.0000] <eric_carlson>

[16:22:02.0000] <Workshiva>
llrcombs: Technically, he's correct

[16:22:03.0000] <Workshiva>
Since <device> is part of post-HTML5 HTML 

[16:23:00.0000] <llrcombs>
ooooh, it is?

[16:23:01.0000] <llrcombs>
wait, post-html5?

[16:23:02.0000] <llrcombs>
that implies that HTML5 is done

[16:28:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Well, HTML5 is mostly feature complete

[16:29:00.0000] <Workshiva>
New features are typically marked for "v2" or "v3", or some other not-now-but-later label

[16:52:00.0000] <midgard>
I thought <device> will be part of html6?

[16:52:01.0000] <midgard>
Or am I wrong?

[16:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
if i have my way, there won't be an "html6", we'll just have a continually maintained "html"

[18:48:00.0000] <jamesr>
does silvia pfeiffer hang out here?

[18:48:01.0000] <nessy>
yes, hi!

[18:49:00.0000] <jamesr>
nessy: hi!

[18:49:01.0000] <nessy>
wassup? :)

[18:49:02.0000] <jamesr>
nessy: i think a source of confusion in the volume thread is that your TV does not really increase the volume past what the video says. it attenuates the volume down (from some maximum that it supports)

[18:50:00.0000] <jamesr>
in fact more sophisticated systems always express volume controls in terms of negative dB 

[18:50:01.0000] <nessy>
are you trying to tell me that the video that comes over the air is encoded as loud as the maximum setting of my TV?

[18:50:02.0000] <jamesr>
think about it this way

[18:51:00.0000] <jamesr>
if you put the volume on your TV at 100% that's the same as setting it to -0dB

[18:51:01.0000] <nessy>
sure, if we go with dB - but the video and audio elements don't go with dB

[18:51:02.0000] <jamesr>
well it's the same thing

[18:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
volume=1.0 means "play at maximum volume"

[18:51:04.0000] <jamesr>
it's a % of the max

[18:52:00.0000] <jamesr>
1.0 or 100% = -0dB

[18:52:01.0000] <jamesr>
0.5 or 50% = whatever that is in dB

[18:52:02.0000] <jamesr>
i dunno what that is, bad at logs

[18:52:03.0000] <nessy>
how come then that most videos on the web are so quiet that they all the max settings on my computer cannot make them audible when my TV is easily able to go louder than my vacuum cleaner

[18:52:04.0000] <jamesr>
i think that's around -60dB

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: your speakers are turned down :-)

[18:53:01.0000] <jamesr>
nah that can't be right. i dunno what 50% would be

[18:53:02.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: now, everything is cranked all the way up

[18:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
jamesr: wouldn't 0 be -infinity?

[18:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: how loud are system sounds?

[18:54:00.0000] <nessy>
I'm on a MacBook

[18:54:01.0000] <jamesr>
Hixie: the mapping isn't really mathematical because perceived loudness doesn't map linearly to energy output

[18:54:02.0000] <jamesr>
or it's not a strict interpretation

[18:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
jamesr: ah ok

[18:54:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: right so does the system beep beep loudly?

[18:54:05.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: do is that quiet too?

[18:54:06.0000] <Hixie>
s/do/or/

[18:54:07.0000] <nessy>
yes, very much so

[18:55:00.0000] <nessy>
I get a little shock every time :)

[18:55:01.0000] <jamesr>
what that means is that the browser (or flash) is attenuating the audio down more than system sounds

[18:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
and when you hit the red button on http://instantrimshot.com/ does it play as loudly?

[18:55:03.0000] <nessy>
yeah, that's fairly loud

[18:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
what videos play quietly for you?

[18:56:01.0000] <nessy>
it's not all of them obviously - but a lot are encoded too quietly

[18:56:02.0000] <nessy>
that's not something that happens on TV, where 0dB seems fairly standardised

[18:57:00.0000] <jamesr>
my TV at 0dB is unbearably loud

[18:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
welcome to the web, where anyone and their dog can publish content

[18:57:02.0000] <nessy>
what I am saying is that a volume setting of 1 isn't 0dB

[18:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
including people who know jack about audio engineering

[18:58:00.0000] <jamesr>
Hixie: we should make it go to 11

[18:58:01.0000] <jamesr>
that'd be one louder

[18:58:02.0000] <jamesr>
problem solved!

[19:00:00.0000] <nessy>
the problem is that 0dB on TV refers to a standard reference level, but our 0-1 volume range doesn't

[19:00:01.0000] <jamesr>
i don't think that's true and i'm not sure how else to explain it

[19:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
0 means muted. 1 means do not attenuate.

[19:01:01.0000] <jamesr>
do not attentuate is by definition the same thing as attenuate by 0dB

[19:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
exactly

[19:01:03.0000] <nessy>
that means 0dB in reference to the SPL at which the video or audio file were encoded

[19:02:00.0000] <nessy>
it doesn't mean in reference to a SPL of human perception, e.g. where 0dB would equate to 20 Pa

[19:03:00.0000] <nessy>
think of the Web as a radio station where every song is played back at a different level - so every Web page you go to with a video will play back at a different level

[19:04:00.0000] <nessy>
it would make a lot more sense to define the 0-1 range as a SPL range

[19:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
we're not saying 0dB volume, we're saying 0dB relative attentuation

[19:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's further attenuated (or amplified) by your system volume control(s), amplifier(s), speaker(s), etc

[19:04:03.0000] <nessy>
and I am saying relative attenuation is the wrong thing to optimise on

[19:05:00.0000] <nessy>
assuming all other things are fixed - volume controls, amplifiers, speakers - I would expect any video set at 0.5 volume to play back at the same perceived loudness

[19:05:01.0000] <nessy>
that's what my radio station does (unless they screw up)

[19:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh you're saying you want the browser to do volume normalisation?

[19:06:01.0000] <nessy>
exactly :)

[19:06:02.0000] <jamesr>
that's orthogonal to the 'volume' attribute

[19:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh, well

[19:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's a whole different ball of wax

[19:06:05.0000] <nessy>
but volume 0-1 is what the user / web developer sees 

[19:06:06.0000] <Hixie>
has nothing to do with the .volume IDL attribute

[19:07:00.0000] <jamesr>
CDs can be encoded at different volume levels as well which results in the exact same issue

[19:07:01.0000] <jamesr>
in fact some labels have historically tried to jack up the encoded volume to make their albums sound louder or cooler. which hurts the dynamic range and quality, etc

[19:07:02.0000] <nessy>
indeed, jamesr, the Web is more like a CD collection than a radio station - and I don't think that makes any sense at all

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
can you even do volume normalisation on streams?

[19:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
i thought you needed the whole track to do it

[19:08:02.0000] <jamesr>
Hixie: you can't do it very well

[19:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
how would you do it in real time?

[19:08:04.0000] <jamesr>
itunes volume normalization scans the whole track and figures out the dynamic range

[19:09:00.0000] <jamesr>
it kind of sucks too

[19:09:01.0000] <jamesr>
because i have CDs with quiet and loud tracks. itunes would make the quiet ones louder

[19:09:02.0000] <nessy>
you can do a heuristic with the distribution of volume ranges

[19:09:03.0000] <jamesr>
i don't want The Great gig in The Sky to be as loud as Money

[19:09:04.0000] <nessy>
fair enough :)

[19:10:00.0000] <nessy>
but something should be possible - it really is a horrendous situation to not be able to turn some audio tracks even up into the audible range

[19:11:00.0000] <jamesr>
but you wouldn't expose that to the author. the author (presumably) controls the encoding process

[19:11:01.0000] <nessy>
when I stick in external speakers, it's a lot better - so if they can increase the volume, so should we - and often people don't care about the loss in quality if it's something important they want to catch

[19:12:00.0000] <nessy>
jamesr, the web page author is most of the time not the same person that creates the content

[19:12:01.0000] <nessy>
just like a radio station isn't most of the time the one who creates the content

[19:13:00.0000] <jamesr>
yeah, but radio stations control the volume of what they broadcast at transmission time

[19:13:01.0000] <nessy>
exactly - so why can't the browser do that for us

[19:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
the browser is a radio, not a transmission tower

[19:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
the server is the tower

[19:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, gotta go. bbl!

[19:14:03.0000] <nessy>
I would have thought that's the purpose of the volume attribute to normalise to a certain SPL range and then the original setting can be the one at which the volume bar starts - but I'd be happy with an extra attribute for normalization

[19:15:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: I am aware that the browser is the radio, that's where the comparison falls down - it doesn't change the user perception issue though :)

[19:17:00.0000] <jamesr>
well, i guess you could propose that as a separate feature

[19:19:00.0000] <nessy>
on high-tech receivers your volume know also goes above 0dB

[19:21:00.0000] <nessy>
anyway - seems like this is going back to the list :)

my favorite Ghandi quote is the one where he asks, "Is there anything funnier in the world than depictions of familiar cartoon characters have sex with each other?"

Heh, I'm reading the link registry saga

[08:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Whose idea was it to suggest the HTML use a global link registry and then reject any link relation that was specific to HTML?

[08:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: some might say it as maybe the idea of those who were acting in bad faith from the beginning

[08:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
without naming any names

[08:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
of either the people who might say that, or the people they might say it about

[08:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, if the link registry is not going to be useful in the way it was supposed to be, everybody will just do an end run around it

[08:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and spec out mechanisms that violate the link-relations RFC

[08:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and it will be hard to blame them for doing so

[08:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, hopefully there won't be too much wasted effort as a result

[09:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm somewhat amused by the @longdesc comic having an obviously invalid @alt

[09:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the continuing lack of explicit depictions of sex between cartoon characters in those comics is depressing

[09:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The crossdressing wasn't enough for you?

[09:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Haha, this is great

[09:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Julian demands large changes to existing specs to register link relations, but we can't fix the registry because the RFC defining it is almost final

[10:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Julian: The pingback specification has been final for almost a decade. Didn't stop you from requiring that it was rewritten as a RFC.

[10:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You seem to miss the point about HTML-specific link registrations. If everything can't fit in the IANA registry, then we need a second registry to handle the rest, and then we might as well use the second registry for everything and save massive overhead.

[10:38:00.0000] <JulianReschke>
I found the earlier exchanges about the link relations stuff not helpful. Apparently it's not trivial to understand what was and what is going on.

[10:38:01.0000] <JulianReschke>

[10:38:02.0000] <JulianReschke>
Rather than talking 2 each other, I'd recommend that you include those into the conversation who actually were part of the discussion.

[10:39:00.0000] <JulianReschke>
The best place to do so would be the HTML WG mailing list.

the stuff erlang is good at

ok

[12:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
erlang sets the bar pretty high

[12:53:02.0000] <Moo^_^>
the thing with python, ruby et. al. is that you can get open source libaries for them

[12:54:00.0000] <Moo^_^>
like "rss reader"

[12:54:01.0000] <Moo^_^>
for erlang, you need to build everything by hand

[12:54:02.0000] <Moo^_^>
so the scope of the use is limited

[12:54:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah

[07:32:00.0000] <matthiasr>
about r2220 <http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/commit-watchers-whatwg.org/2008/001395.html> - I don't think this is right. -wap-input-format replaces <input format=, not inputmode=

[07:33:00.0000] <matthiasr>
at least if http://www.developershome.com/wap/wcss/wcss_tutorial.asp?page=inputExtension2 is correct

[07:33:01.0000] <matthiasr>
inputmode is about something else, namely initializing the input on mobile/restricted devices

[07:34:00.0000] <matthiasr>
e.g. http://www.w3.org/2004/CDF/TestSuite/WICD_CDR_WP1/test-xhtml-basic11.xhtml

[07:36:00.0000] <matthiasr>
http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/#mode-syntax

[07:39:00.0000] <matthiasr>
or have I gotten it all horribly wrong?

[09:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
matthiasr:  -wap-input-format also is about initializing the input on keyboard-less mobile devices

[09:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., ones that only have 5-way keypads

[09:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it's also about specifying the datatype of the input

[09:06:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
-wap-input-format is basically poorly designed and overengineered

[09:07:00.0000] <matthiasr>
but I don't think it covers all cases of inputmode

[09:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nothing covers all cases of inputmode

[09:07:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it doesn't matter, but no browsers actually support inputmode anyway

[09:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
inputmode is a pipe dream that only exists in a spec

[09:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
there are not production browsers that implement support for it

[09:08:02.0000] <matthiasr>
:(

[09:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for better or worse, -wap-input-format is the only thing that's actually supported in browsers that are actually preinstalled on keyboard-less mobile devices

[09:09:01.0000] <matthiasr>
(and there will never be, if it's not specified)

[09:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
inputmode is specified

[09:09:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
in XHTML 1.1

[09:09:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
the reason that it's not been implemented is that there has been no market demand for it

[09:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's not for lack of people trying to convince browser vendors to implement it

[09:15:00.0000] <matthiasr>
so it's basically been removed because no implementation cared about it anyway?

[10:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
matthiasr: it wasn't removed.. it was part of XHTML 1.1, not XHTML 1.0

[10:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if they had been using the current criteria we are using now for determining when some feature can be included in an Recommendation, inputmode comes nowhere even close

[10:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is, lacking any implementations, it would not be included in a Recommendation

[10:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
lacking any an test cases that demonstrate it worked interoperably, it would never have made it out of CR

[11:27:00.0000] <henrikbjorn>
i have a dl where the dt's arent the most descriptive in the world, and my solution atm. for accessability is to hide there more descriptive part of the dt in a span. But i was wondering if theres a attribute or aria or something i could use for the more descriptive text

[11:28:00.0000] <henrikbjorn>
or maybe the title attribute is enough ?

[14:34:00.0000] <abernier>
hi

[14:35:00.0000] <abernier>
is a header necessarily within a section element, or can I set a header inside a <li> ?

[14:38:00.0000] <abernier>
In a resume, I've got an 'Experiences" section where I list different experiences in a <ol>, and for each of them, I've got a title (job) and a date so I'd like to group them into a <header> but I wonder if it is correct doing this directly within the <li> ?

[14:41:00.0000] <nimbupani>
a header is necessarily within a sectioning element. 

[14:41:01.0000] <abernier>
nimbupani: ok, thanks

[14:41:02.0000] <nimbupani>
abernier: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#sectioning-content

[14:43:00.0000] <abernier>
so for work experiences : <ol><li><section><header>{job title} {date}</header>{description}</section></li>...</ol> seems ok?

[14:50:00.0000] <abernier>
and is there something to markup a range of dates, eg: from April 08 to may 09 ?

hello

[00:03:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I want to draw a pie using html4 canvas how do I do it ?

[00:04:00.0000] <espadrine>
canvas is html5

[00:04:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
a simple circle with limited start/end angle isn't working

[00:04:02.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
sorry html5 was a typo

[00:04:03.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
or else I would ask in #html :P

[00:04:04.0000] <espadrine>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element

[00:04:05.0000] <espadrine>
This link gives the api

[00:05:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
no actually I want to get the logic of drawing a pie

[00:06:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
pie can't be drawn using an arc

[00:06:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
so what do I do ?

[00:07:00.0000] <espadrine>
why can't they?

[00:08:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
arc works somewhat differently it connects the start and end angles with a straight line but in a pie the line must first go to the center and then connect the other end

[00:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
ruby_on_tails: http://bit.ly/dyFrYu

[00:10:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
Hixie: cool, thanks

[00:33:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
Hixie: I get something like this http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/?c.clearRect(0%2C%200%2C%20640%2C%20480)%3B%0Ac.save()%3B%0Ac.fillStyle%20%3D%20c.createPattern(img3%2C%20%27repeat%27)%3B%0Ac.beginPath()%3B%0Ac.arc(500%2C%20100%2C%20100%2C%203.742133239061344%2C%206.178465552059927%2C%20true)%3B%0Ac.closePath()%3B%0Ac.fill()%3B%0Ac.restore()%3B%0A

[00:33:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
why ?

[00:34:00.0000] <espadrine>
You should start the path at the center using ctx.moveTo(x)

[00:34:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
oh

[00:34:02.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
ok, cool, thanks

[01:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Hixie: Check out your livedomviewer - I think you got pwned.

[01:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins_>
The live dom has some huge ad-based block of code attached to it.

[02:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins_: I don't see anything like that

[02:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Philip`: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!doctype%20html%3E%0D%0A%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color:blue;%20%20text-decoration:%20underline;%0D%0A%22%3E01%0D%0A%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color:red;%20%20%20text-decoration:%20underline;%20%0D%0Avisibility:hidden;%22%3E11%0D%0A%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color:green;%20text-decoration:%20none;%20%0D%0Avisibility:visible;%22%3E21%0D%0A

[02:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins_: Still don't see anything unexpected

[02:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Huh.

[07:43:00.0000] <matjas>
When using XHTML5 (don’t ask), `document.compatMode` === `undefined` in WebKit. Is this a bug or am I missing something?

[07:48:00.0000] <matjas>
<!-- comment --><!doctype html> → does this still trigger quirks mode in HTML5?

[07:49:00.0000] <espadrine>
It should, I think

[07:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, it doesn't

[07:50:01.0000] <matjas>
It used to anyways

[07:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
matjas: it has never triggered the quirks mode in HTML5

[07:50:03.0000] <Lachy>
it only did in IE6, and that's been fixed since IE7

[07:51:00.0000] <matjas>
hsivonen: Yeah, but it used to before (right?), that’s what I meant

[07:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
matjas: only in IE

[07:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(IIRC)

[07:52:00.0000] <matjas>
So is <!-- comment --><!doctype html> still a problem in IE6, or is that only the case for other DOCTYPEs?

[08:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
matjas: <!-- comment --><!doctype html> is quirks in IE6

[08:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(yes, I actually tested)

[08:11:00.0000] <Workshiva>
He uses IE6, burn him!

[08:11:01.0000] <matjas>
hsivonen: Thanks. Out of curiosity, how did you test it? Is there a bulletproof way to detect quirks/standards mode?

[08:11:02.0000] <Workshiva>
document.compatMode?

[08:11:03.0000] <matjas>
alert(document.compatMode === 'CSS1Compat' ? 'Standards mode' : 'Quirks mode');

[08:12:00.0000] <matjas>
Like that?

[08:12:01.0000] <matjas>
I’m asking because… [15:49:02] <matjas> When using XHTML5 (don’t ask), `document.compatMode` === `undefined` in WebKit. Is this a bug or am I missing something?

[08:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
matjas: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/test-quirks.php?doctype=%3C!--+comment+--%3E%3C!DOCTYPE+html%3E

[08:12:03.0000] <Workshiva>
There is no quirks mode in XHTML5

[08:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I looked at the rendering of the boxes under "Mac IE 5, Windows IE 6&7 and Opera 7 & 8 Test (Not applicable to Opera 9!)"

[08:13:01.0000] <matjas>
Workshiva: Looks like in WebKit, there’s no document.compatMode either

[08:13:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
matjas, bug in WebKit

[08:13:03.0000] <matjas>
Thanks hsivonen

[08:13:04.0000] <matjas>
Thanks Ms2ger, I’ll file it then

[08:14:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Thanks

[08:25:00.0000] <matjas>
Ms2ger and others who might be interested — here’s the bug ticket: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44422

[08:28:00.0000] <tantek>
What are the chances that scoped style sheets will get dropped from HTML5?

[08:28:01.0000] <tantek>
Does anyone implement them at all? (not AFAIK)

[08:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: my understanding is that they are in the spec in the hope that two UAs implement them. if not, the Process requires taking the feature out in a later transition stage.

[08:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'm not aware of any implementations)

[08:30:02.0000] <tantek>
that's an unusually optimistic approach towards a new feature, given how many totally new features are rejected

[08:30:03.0000] <tantek>
ok

[08:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: <style scoped> has been in the spec for quite some time, so it predates many current spec editing patterns

[08:31:01.0000] <tantek>
ah ok - early new idea - gotcha

[08:31:02.0000] <tantek>
thanks for the background

[08:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oooh hsivonen is back

[08:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I hope you had a nice vacation :)

[08:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I did. thanks

[09:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It's good to go off the grid into the wilderness where phones don't work sometimes

[09:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the downside is that Google Maps doesn't work, either, there

[09:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
not that batteries would last anyway

[12:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: i think you got pwned by your ISP, i don't see it

[12:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: <style scoped> was one of those things i added on the principle that so many people want it that it's a no brainer that it'd get implemented. ;-)

[12:55:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, makes complete sense. :)

[12:56:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie, please leave your sense of logic at the door

[12:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
Ms2ger: yeah, as demonstrated by the complete lack of implementations, shows what i know ;-)

[12:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
ping="" was the added for similar reasons -- it seemed like such an obvious user win

[12:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
and then somehow it became the evilest feature in the spec

[12:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
so...

[12:58:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Are you suggesting you thought that people would consider the pros and cons of a feature before judging it?

[13:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
more that the pros and cons were so obvious there was no need to worry about people not considering them

[13:02:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
I might be a little more cynical than you were, then :)

[13:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If ping="" were actually used by authors, implementers would immediately be under pressure from users to disable it.  The situation where ping="" works and is used is a Pareto improvement over the situation where it doesn't exist, but the latter is a Nash equilibrium and the former is not.

[13:02:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
There have been similar cases where the feature has actually worked, though.

[13:02:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like autocomplete=false.

[13:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But users are more sympathetic to "banks don't want to get hacked" than "Google wants to track you more efficiently", I guess.

[13:05:00.0000] <Rik`>
ping is a cool idea to give more control but authors wouldn't use it that much since it can easily be bypassed

[13:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Kind of like if you asked them to use an <advertisement> tag for all ads.  There are some semantics that authors explicitly do not want to be machine-readable.

[13:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or even more extreme, if you asked them to put alt text on their captchas.  :)

[13:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
autocomplete=false works due to banks being willing to lock out browsers, not due to user sympathy

[13:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is that how it arose?  Did banks just only allow browsers that respected it, in the early days?

[13:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That explains the situation neatly.

[13:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know if it arose that way, but I know at least some banks are now willing to lock out browsers that do not respect it

[13:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So there's your equilibrium.

[13:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
Ms2ger: it was many years ago, i've grown more cynical since :-)

[13:11:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie, hard not to, I guess

[13:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: in a sane world, there'd be no point pressuring people to disable ping="", since that would just make sites not use it, and would thus lose all the benefits

[13:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, only if browsers can coordinate sufficiently.  If each implementer is deciding independently, then they gain (at least temporarily) from disabling it if all other browsers have it enabled, because that way they temporarily protect privacy better.

[13:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, in the medium term they gain nothing, but they don't lose anything either relative to the other browsers.

[13:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm talking about users losing out

[13:15:00.0000] <Rik`>
it's obvious that ping will be less reliable than the situation right now

[13:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You're looking at different possible worlds and identifying the one that's better, without sufficient regard to the fact that you need decision-makers to have the correct incentives to play along.  Implementer incentives don't exist for ping="", for any particular implementer.

[13:15:02.0000] <Rik`>
it takes 5 minutes to write an extension to disable ping

[13:15:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Implementing it can only strictly increase the amount of tracking done on your users.

[13:16:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: increase ?

[13:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes.

[13:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
As long as at least one site uses ping.

[13:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, there are plenty of extensions to disable redirect URLs of various types.  They'll certainly handle the big players like Google reliably already.

[13:16:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
But yes, it would be easier to disable ping.

[13:16:05.0000] <Rik`>
how can you disable redirect urls ?

[13:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Have the extension detect and rewrite them.

[13:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe using a fixed set of patterns for popular sites, maybe using heuristics.

[13:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
ping="" has benefits for the sites too

[13:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
one of the main benefits is that it reduces latency compared to the redirect method

[13:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It has benefits for sites and users.  It has only drawbacks for implementers.

[13:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least if you consider them one at a time.

[13:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not a Nash equilibrium.  The incentives all lean toward defecting.

[13:19:00.0000] <Rik`>
Hixie: that's why it's a good idea, but does it make sense to have less reliable data with only that benefit ?

[13:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unlike with most features, where they pressure you to conform so that your page renders the same (unless you have a large market share and want to mess up anyone else).

[13:19:02.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: I don't see how it has drawbacks for implementers

[13:19:03.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: a site willing to use ping would have to detect @ping support to provide a fallback for non supporting browsers

[13:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, because users don't like being tracked.  A browser that implements it can only possibly cause more tracking of its users.  Thus the incentive is for browsers to not implement it (*especially* if it's widely used) so that they can tell their users that they're tracked less.

[13:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
Rik`: on the long run, once everyone supports ping="", yes

[13:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
Rik`: because the data you'd miss out on is the data from people who would have opted out of whatever server-side solution you had

[13:20:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
This holds as long as at least one site does ping="" without fallback.

[13:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You have to look at the incentives for the individual actors, not the relative merits of particular situations.

[13:21:01.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: why would a website implement ping without fallback?

[13:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because it's easy.

[13:21:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, browsers could just lie.

[13:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They already lie about tons of things (just look at the UA string).

[13:22:01.0000] <Rik`>
the next day the metrics team would tell them that they have far less data

[13:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure, maybe.

[13:22:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would be temporary, as I said.

[13:23:00.0000] <Rik`>
you're also assuming that the marketing would think implementing ping is bad for privacy

[13:23:01.0000] <Rik`>
whereas it's the contrary, it gives the user even more control

[13:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Suppose everyone implemented ping.

[13:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
on a more concrete note, any csswg people around?

[13:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then suppose I go to Firefox (or whatever) and complain: "Hey!  You're sending data to Company X about my browsing habits.  You could disable this with a few lines of code, in which case all sites using ping without fallback will stop collecting data on Firefox users (at least temporarily).  If you care about user privacy, you should disable ping."

[13:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then either they do, or someone else does . . . then that browser will temporarily be more private, so some users will move to it, Slashdot will have a story about how it protects your privacy better . . . then the feature is useless since it's completely unreliable, so everyone stops using it, so all the browsers stop implementing it.

[13:26:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Sort of like how ads are useless because everyone has ad blockers?

[13:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, if all ads were in an <advertisement> tag and browsers could easily just ignore them.

[13:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(without false positives or much work)

[13:26:03.0000] <Workshiva>
Browsers could also easily ship with ad filters

[13:26:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
They do.

[13:27:00.0000] <Workshiva>
No, they don't

[13:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(for pop-up ads, at least)

[13:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not for all types of ads.

[13:27:03.0000] <Rik`>
they already ship with malware filters

[13:27:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
They could be more aggressive about ad filtering, it's true.  I've wondered before why no one is willing to take that step.

[13:27:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's a competitive market, after all.

[13:28:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: because they all take money from Google ?

[13:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Microsoft, Apple, and Opera take money from Google?

[13:28:02.0000] <Rik`>
yes

[13:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . what money?

[13:29:00.0000] <Rik`>
being the default search engine

[13:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Google isn't the default search engine in IE, I'm awfully sure of that.

[13:29:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Maybe not Microsoft, but they have enough business interests otherwise

[13:29:03.0000] <Rik`>
and a percentage of ads clicked on the search results

[13:29:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I also thought Yahoo! was the default search engine in Opera, but it seems that's changed, or maybe was never true.

[13:29:05.0000] <Workshiva>
Yahoo is the default (or was) on the speed dial only

[13:30:00.0000] <Rik`>
yeah, not Microsoft, but they take money from Bing :)

[13:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I doubt Apple receives enough money from Google to be of consequence to their business, compared to their strategic interest in weakening Google.

[13:30:02.0000] <Rik`>
I said Google but you can replace it with "search engines"

[13:30:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But Microsoft doesn't make its money from advertising.

[13:30:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It makes it from software sales.

[13:30:05.0000] <Rik`>
mostly

[13:30:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
It probably only runs an ad network at all to try leeching business from Google.

[13:30:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Overwhelmingly, not mostly.

[13:30:08.0000] <Workshiva>
That just makes it worse

[13:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If all web advertising collapsed tomorrow, it would destroy Google while leaving Apple and Microsoft almost unscathed (at least directly).

[13:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe Microsoft would be afraid of antitrust suits if it blocked Google ads.

[13:31:02.0000] <Rik`>
but they know Windows and Office won't be there forever

[13:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
They'll be there for the next five years, and no one plans ahead further than that.

[13:31:04.0000] <Rik`>
and Apple can't "kill" Google, they have business deals (think Google Maps on iOs)

[13:31:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Plus, MS has tens of billions of dollars in cash.

[13:32:00.0000] <Rik`>
if MS kills ads, it also kills a lot of websites relying on Google ads

[13:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The point is, MS and Apple are not going to be harmed much overall by making ads less profitable, but one of their biggest competitors will be harmed a lot, so they surely have an interest in hurting ad profitability.

[13:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Plus they have a large immediate interest in encouraging users to use their browser because it blocks ads by default.

[13:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I'm really wondering why no one's tried it.

[13:34:00.0000] <Rik`>
it's an ecosystem

[13:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure, but as competition increases, the actors are forced to start looking more to their short-term interest or become irrelevant.

[13:35:01.0000] <Workshiva>
What about the fact that microsoft runs a lot of ads themselves?

[13:35:02.0000] <Rik`>
if a browser adds a default filtering, websites will block access

[13:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's a point.

[13:36:01.0000] <Rik`>
why wasting bandwith if you're not paid ?

[13:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which brings us back to the observation about why browsers have to support autocomplete=false.

[13:37:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: btw, have you found mobile wikipedia source code ?

[13:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
On the other hand, no one much blocked browsers that implemented popup blockers, right?  Browsers could still block progressively more of the annoying ads while still leaving ways to advertise.

[13:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, dunno, but Googling "mobile wikipedia git" gives http://github.com/hcatlin/wikimedia-mobile/ as the first result.

[13:39:00.0000] <Rik`>
oh great

[13:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me catches up with some other list mail and notices that Webkit project will finally be renaming their LayoutTests stuff

[13:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me now gets to thread about dumpAsMarkup

[15:17:00.0000] <webben>
AryehGregor: I think you may be underestimating the impact of MS's own ad business: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703467304575383530439838568.html

[15:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Am I the only one who has never heard a TV ad that plays back louder than the content?

[15:18:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Me not either, but I don't watch TV

[15:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
webben, maybe.  I think sites blocking the browser is a more plausible reason for why they don't get too aggressive, though.

[15:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Plus the trickiness of getting the heuristics right, without resorting to domain-based blacklists (which AdBlock can get away with, major browsers maybe not).

[15:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Peter`: http://peter.sh/2010/08/last-week-in-webkit-and-chromium/ is great

[15:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I was going to say I wonder if dumpAsMarkup might have deserved a mention

[15:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I guess that change went in a long while back

[15:22:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I had just not caught up on webkit-dev mail until today

[15:22:03.0000] <Peter->
it isn't in last week's changelogs

[15:22:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[15:24:00.0000] <Peter->
http://peter.sh/data/last-week/chromium/report-week-33.html btw :p

[15:25:00.0000] <Peter->
and thank you

[15:26:00.0000] <Rik`>
I should have coded something like this when I was doing those weekly summaries

[15:26:01.0000] <Peter->
there's http://peter.sh/data/last-week/webkit/report-week-33.html for webkit

[15:27:00.0000] <Peter->
I'm going to create such a page for Mozilla as well, through I haven't compiled Mercurial support in yet

[15:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, 396 Webkit commits during the week, 717 Chromium commits

[15:30:01.0000] <Rik`>
MikeSmith: chromium is a browser

[15:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
true

[15:30:03.0000] <Rik`>
Peter-: Mozilla commits are harder to understand, commit messages are one liners

[15:31:00.0000] <Peter->
I can perfectly read code, so I'm not expecting any huge problems with that

[15:31:01.0000] <Peter->
though I agree it's more inconvenient

[15:32:00.0000] <Rik`>
yeah harder to get a sense of what's going on quickly

[15:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm noticing that abarth and Eric's Treebuilder failure triage page is now down to just 19 items

[15:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[15:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe not

[15:34:03.0000] <abarth>
MikeSmith: yeah, the grey ones are not bugs

[15:34:04.0000] <abarth>
the tree builder is turned on

[15:34:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[15:34:06.0000] <abarth>
we're working on fragment parsing

[15:34:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I saw that

[15:34:08.0000] <abarth>
we have three test failures left

[15:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
beautiful

[15:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
what about entities?

[15:38:00.0000] <abarth>
entities are done

Summary: for text, gzip works better than trying to encode as a PNG.

[16:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can't say I'm completely surprised.

[16:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not much of a difference

[16:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Less than 1% it looks like?

[16:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not bad for compression that's server-independent

[16:43:01.0000] <Rik`>
gzip is server independent 

[16:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Are you saying browsers would sniff out that a script src was actually a .js.gz?

[16:47:00.0000] <Rik`>
with the right headers I can serve a gzipped JS, yes

[16:47:01.0000] <Rik`>
content negociation is only there to check browser support

[16:47:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Sure, but then it isn't server-independent anymore

[16:47:03.0000] <Rik`>
on your desktop, it will work too

[16:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, I think we have a misunderstanding

[16:48:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't mean that it would work without a server. I mean it would work without requiring server support.

[16:49:00.0000] <Rik`>
no it won't

[16:49:01.0000] <Rik`>
you need to tell your server to serve your images with the right content-type

[16:49:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Why? Browsers sniff images

[16:49:03.0000] <Rik`>
I don't think Firefox does

[16:50:00.0000] <Rik`>
or is it Safari ?

[16:51:00.0000] <Rik`>
anyway, I'm pretty sure one browser does not do sniffing

[16:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm sure abarth can tell us when he returns :)

[16:53:00.0000] <abarth>
hi

[16:53:01.0000] <abarth>
all browsers sniff images

[16:54:00.0000] <Rik`>
I'm pretty sure I've seen a bunch of strange characters when viewing some images sent as text/plain

[16:54:01.0000] <abarth>
to be more precise

[16:55:00.0000] <abarth>
the <img> element ignore the content-type header

[16:55:01.0000] <abarth>
what happens when you load an image in a frame is more complex

[16:56:00.0000] <Rik`>
is it the same for CSS backgrounds ?

[16:58:00.0000] <abarth>
not sure

[16:58:01.0000] <abarth>
probably

[16:59:00.0000] <Rik`>
anyway, the PNG technique is quite useless


2010-08-24
[17:00:00.0000] <Rik`>
funny for a contest but useless

[17:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, it's only within 1% if you don't account for the JS required to decode it.

[19:28:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: reading http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#event-loops … would events from different devices, such as a mouse and a keyboard, go into the same or different task queues (for the same task loop)?

[19:28:01.0000] <shepazu>
I was a little confused by your example

[19:29:00.0000] <abarth>
MikeSmith: enabling fragment parsing is now in the commit pipeline

[19:29:01.0000] <shepazu>
is it intended that different implementations may organize their task queues differently?

[19:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: looking...

[19:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: (as an aside, you really don't want to be using the TR/ version, it's woefully out of date)

[19:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
looking at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/webappapis.html#event-loops now

[19:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: they'd likely all go into the user interaction task source

[19:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: the rule of thumb is that you'd use the same task source for two tasks if it matters in what order those two tasks are processed

[19:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: that is in fact the reason we have different task sources -- so that we don't define that, e.g., a packet coming from the network before a keystroke must be processed in that order

[19:32:00.0000] <shepazu>
/me is adding a section in DOM3Events about task loops and how they relate to the model used by D3E

[19:32:01.0000] <shepazu>
I see

[19:32:02.0000] <shepazu>
it's essentially defining a state machine, right?

[19:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
how so?

[19:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's an event loop

[19:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
basic building block of software for the past 20 or 30 years :-)

[19:37:00.0000] <shepazu>
maybe I've got that relationship reversed :)

[19:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
which relationship?

[19:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused

[19:43:00.0000] <shepazu>
nm

[19:43:01.0000] <shepazu>
/me goes back to editing D3E

[22:03:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
but that sentence on its own is nice too

[22:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
abarth|afk: I predict that your statement "Claiming something is obsolete or deprecated without giving authors better tools for solving their problems is waste of time." is going to end up being quoted quite a lot.

[23:37:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: with websockets, what happens if key3 is > 8 bytes long?

[23:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
how can it be?

[23:38:00.0000] <micheil>
for instance, a malformed connection

[23:38:01.0000] <micheil>
eg, extra 0x0d 0x0a bytes

[23:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
those wouldn't be part of the key

[23:38:03.0000] <micheil>
so something like: '^n:ds[4U\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'

[23:38:04.0000] <micheil>
was sent

[23:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
the 8 characters after the CR LF CR LF are key3

[23:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
everything after that is frames

[23:39:02.0000] <micheil>
as the last part of the message, should the server only "read" 8 bytes for key3?

[23:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
the server should do what the spec says, which is indeed to just read 8 bytes

[23:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
read the spec :-)

[23:39:05.0000] <micheil>
k

[23:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm assuming it hasn't changed since i last touched it -- i don't edit that spec anymore so i could be wrong)

[23:39:07.0000] <micheil>
I wasn't sure from reading the spec.

[23:39:08.0000] <micheil>
good point.

[23:39:09.0000] <Hixie>
really?

[23:39:10.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it was pretty clear

[23:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't it just say "read 8 bytes"

[23:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm i guess it doesn't actually say how you get them

[23:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
it just says "The eight random bytes sent after the first 0x0D 0x0A 0x0D 0x0A sequence in the client's handshake"

[23:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
but that's still pretty unambiguous

[23:41:00.0000] <micheil>
it just mentions that the key3 should be 8 random bytes, not what to do if it isn't.

[23:42:00.0000] <micheil>
(for what ever reason, should the 8 random bytes get separated from the headers, I've got stuff to stitch the two back together, is that actually to spec?)

[23:42:01.0000] <micheil>
or should we just assume that the client is invalid and reject the connection?

[23:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
it says that key3 is "The eight random bytes sent after the first 0x0D 0x0A 0x0D 0x0A sequence in the client's handshake"

[23:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
the only way there could not be a key3, therefore, is if the client disconnects

[23:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
in which case it doesn't much matter what you do

[23:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
if the client disconnects, then you just have to keep reading til you get an 0x0D 0x0A 0x0D 0x0A sequence, and then the next 8 bytes are key3

[23:44:01.0000] <micheil>
hmm..

[23:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't matter if there's a frame after that or not

[23:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
er

[23:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
s/if the client disconnects/if the client doesn't disconnect/

[23:44:05.0000] <micheil>
that's the slightly annoying thing about the websocket protocol; it assumes that you read() from the socket, not that you get data events

[23:46:00.0000] <micheil>
hmm.. I think I'll just reject the connection then, if key3 is missing / not correct length.

[23:47:00.0000] <abarth>
MikeSmith: hopefully in a good way...

[23:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
micheil: i still don't understand what you mean by "not correct length"

[23:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
micheil: if the server disconnects, though, then obviously you can also just reject the connection

[23:48:01.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: in my case, under node.js, we don't have a read(), we have to wait until we get a data event

[23:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
micheil: how is that different

[23:48:03.0000] <micheil>
if you connect to a websocket server using something like telnet, and pass correct headers, but send \r\n after the key3, then key3 ends up being 10 bytes instead of 8 bytes

[23:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
no

[23:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's just 8 bytes

[23:49:02.0000] <micheil>
we are left to guess what key3 is.

[23:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
the \r\n are the start of first frame

[23:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
after the key

[23:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
imagine a client sending the handshake, \r\n\r\n, 8 bytes, and then 0xFF [length] [data] 0xFF [length] [data]

[23:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
all at once

[23:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
abarth: yeah

[23:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
you should treat that as a handshake followed by two frames

[23:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
(at least unless the spec is changed)

[23:51:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: fair point. just trying to work out how to represent that in code for node.js

[23:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: thanks, i threw your mail onto my pile

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i'll think about how to do it... maybe a data- attribute?

[23:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: though then i guess i'll have to strip it for the w3.org version

[23:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
data- attribute sounds fine to me

[23:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
k

[23:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, afk for now

[23:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if you do go that route, please leave it in the w3.org version too.. I'll deal with teh consequences

[23:58:00.0000] <boblet>
argh, CSS3 animation plus transition on same element is a world of hurt

[01:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting. Google search puts <link rel=prefetch> inside an <ol>

[01:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sure looks like a use case for <a rel=prefetch>

[01:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
since the same link follows as an <a href>

[01:21:02.0000] <Peter`>
<a rel=prefetch> is allowed now afaik

[01:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Peter`: but is it supported by Gecko, etc.? (AFAIK, no.)

[01:22:00.0000] <Peter`>
The WebKit change should be trivial

[01:22:01.0000] <Peter`>
for <a> and <area> support anyway

[01:22:02.0000] <Peter`>
if the <link> version already works, outside of <head> as well, it makes sense for Google to be using it I guess

[01:23:00.0000] <Peter`>
even though it's not exactly clean

[01:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not saying it doesn't make sense for them

[01:25:00.0000] <Peter`>
I didn't interpreted it as that

[01:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
<iframe name=wgjf style=display:none src="" onload="google.j.l()" onerror="google.j.e()">

[01:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that's also in Google's search results

[01:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
relying an about:blank's onload can't be good...

[01:31:00.0000] <annevk5>
why not?

[01:31:01.0000] <annevk5>
it ought to work

[01:32:00.0000] <abarth>
it's pretty fast too

[01:32:01.0000] <abarth>
synchronous even

[01:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
relying on synchronous stuff is suspicious when a page is breaking...

[01:33:00.0000] <annevk5>
the onerror is a bit dubious though

[01:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder why this CSS is brought in as a script as opposed to straight CSS file: http://www.google.com.au/extern_chrome/46e7c64d3eb6ebfb.js

[01:33:02.0000] <annevk5>
that should never fire, though maybe they load more in it later?

[01:34:00.0000] <annevk5>
"The requested URL /extern_chrome/46e7c64d3eb6ebfb.js was not found on this server."

[01:34:01.0000] <annevk5>
what are you researching btw?

[01:34:02.0000] <annevk5>
fun parser things?

[01:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm researching why google.com.au serves single-pixel GIFs as data: URLs when UA substring "Firefox" exists *and* html5.enable=true but serves the right JPEGs as data: URLs when the UA substring "Firefox" exists and html5.enable=false

[01:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(aside: when even Google sniffs for "Firefox" rather than "Gecko/", the "Gecko is Gecko" thing should be recognized as a lost cause.)

[01:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
ooh, hsivonen has returned!

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it appears the purpose of this over-complex setup is to both put the images and the HTML in the same resource *and* to order them in such a way that the text loads before the image data is loaded

[01:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if this optimization is really necessary and really an optimization

[01:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
SPDY could help here...

[01:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me worders why Google puts single-letter comments all over the place

[01:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
*wonders

[01:45:01.0000] <dbaron>
Hmmm... I can't quite yet mark Mozilla bug 915 invalid based on HTML5, since a tiny piece of the presentational attributes on col/colgroup crept in to HTML5.

[01:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
what part!

[01:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
tell me where so i can nuke it!

[01:45:04.0000] <dbaron>
Hixie, see my most recent message to public-html

[01:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
/me gets out the gattling run

[01:45:06.0000] <annevk5>

Hixie, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Aug/0265.html

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
gatling gun even

[01:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
who knew that only had one t

[01:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and there's no useless use of <em> and <cite> where they could save a few bytes by using <b>

[01:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
s/no//?

[01:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: oops. yes

[01:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
or s/no/now/, rather

[01:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: fixed

[01:48:01.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, fun stuff (in a way)

[01:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, you changed thead into head

[01:50:01.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, for the first set of rules

[01:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
oops

[01:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and yes, they do end up loading something else into the iframe

[01:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it would be nice if Google had a non-minified debug mode...

[02:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
hsivonen: There's been a feature request for that for a while now.

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Is there someone at Google who I could CC in the Mozilla bug to find out what exactly they are trying to do?

[02:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
you can mail me (ianh⊙gc) if you want me to stick someone on the bug

[02:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: thanks

[02:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
please mention in the e-mail what general area we're talking about

[02:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
since, you know, it's a big company and all

[02:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
good evening

[02:11:01.0000] <abarth>
othermaciej: evening

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I sent email with my @mozilla.com address in the From field

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>

[02:31:00.0000] <annevk5>
g'n

[02:36:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie, "... then always assume the normative part is wrong." Really?

[02:41:00.0000] <roc>
TabAtkins: do you remember off the top of your head what was the result of that interminable www-style thread about what a 10px blur means in box-shadow?

[02:42:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
hello

[02:42:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
why don't I see a shadow here http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/?c.clearRect(0%2C%200%2C%20640%2C%20480)%3B%0Ac.save()%3B%0Ac.fillStyle%20%3D%20c.createPattern(img3%2C%20%27repeat%27)%3B%0Ac.strokeStyle%20%3D%20%27black%27%3B%0Ac.lineWidth%20%3D%208%3B%0Ac.lineCap%20%3D%20%27round%27%3B%0Ac.beginPath()%3B%0Ac.moveTo(300%2C%20200)%3B%0Ac.arc(300%2C%20200%2C%20100%2C%20-Math.PI%2F4%2C%20Math.PI%2F4%2C%20true)%3B%0Ac.closePath()%3B%0Ac.fill()

[02:44:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
anyone alive :-/

[02:45:00.0000] <espadrine>
perhaps the intent was to c.stroke() ?

[02:45:01.0000] <espadrine>
since you set c.strokeStyle...

[02:45:02.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
so I can't have a shadow with a stroke ?

[02:46:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I removed stroke, still no shadow :(

[02:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
roc: Yeah.

[02:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins_>
roc: The blur should approximate a gaussian with a stdev of half the specified length.

[02:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
roc: So, for that case, blur with a stdev of 5px.

[02:48:01.0000] <roc>
hmmmm ok

[02:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins_>
That gives you 97% transparency or so at the specified length.

[02:49:00.0000] <micheil>
anyone know if any browsers actually support websockets over TLS?

[02:49:01.0000] <micheil>
(using wss:// instead of ws://)

[02:50:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
anyone can tell why I can't see a shadow ?

[02:50:01.0000] <espadrine>
ruby_on_tails: you get a shadow with c.shadowOffsetX and c.shadowColor set

[02:51:00.0000] <espadrine>
ruby_on_tails: read the spec: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element

[02:51:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I am on that page

[02:52:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
but I applied those on the link I pasted yet I don't see the shadow 

[02:52:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
is it visible on your screen ?

[02:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins_: I am hella curious about your recent twitter posts about "sunk costs" and all that

[02:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins_: was there some kind of fight over something?

[02:52:04.0000] <TabAtkins_>
othermaciej: Minor.

[02:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me enjoys watching drama that he doesn't have to be involved in

[02:53:01.0000] <espadrine>
ruby_on_tails: add the lines c.shadowOffsetX = 5 and c.shadowColor = 'blue'

[02:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins_>
/me deleted a few tweets in that vein.

[02:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins_: was it about the test suite or something?

[02:53:04.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Yeah.

[02:53:05.0000] <othermaciej>
are you at liberty to state what the actual point of controversy was?

[02:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I was trying to guess from the twitter record (from you and others) and I couldn't even guess wtf people were talking about

[02:54:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
espadrine: http://tinyurl.com/3yqwuaw

[02:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
I dunno.  I'll take it private just in case.

[02:56:00.0000] <espadrine>
ruby_on_tails: if you don't have a shadow here, use a browser that implements canvas shadows

[02:56:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I have been drawing on canvas since 2 days using this browser, shadows can be missing ?

[02:56:02.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I am on FF 3.0.8

[02:57:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
oh well I see the shadow on Shiretoko

[02:57:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
damn

[02:57:02.0000] <roc>
FF 3.0.8 is somewhat ... old

[02:57:03.0000] <espadrine>
ruby_on_tails: yes, they can. I don't know if FF 3 has it

[02:58:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
hmm

[03:00:00.0000] <espadrine>
roc: tell that to my website designer, she is still using FF 2.0

[03:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins_>
lolwut

[03:04:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
oh well, now the shadow is getting applied to all stuff, why is that happening ?

[03:05:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
is shadow applied to everything as a rule ?

[03:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins_>
"All drawing operations are affected by the four global shadow attributes."

[03:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ruby_on_tails: it's a really bad idea to continue to use a Web browser that's no longer getting security patches

[03:06:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
TabAtkins_: missed that, sorry

[03:06:02.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
set it to transparent

[03:06:03.0000] <hsivonen>
oops, I meant Firefox 2.0 but that was mentioned by espadrine instead

[03:06:04.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
hsivonen: am too lazy :P my lappy is in a bad condition latesty wise

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, actually, Firefox 3.0 has been EOLed, too

[03:08:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
EOLed means ?

[03:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
end-of-life'ed

[03:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
no longer maintained

[03:09:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
ok

[03:10:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I actually don't use the latest FF because it doesn't have anti-aliased text

[03:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ruby_on_tails: huh? which platform?

[03:12:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
ubuntu

[03:12:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
my FF3.0.8 has it

[03:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
that's really odd.

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Ever since at least dapper, every version of Firefox I've seen on Ubuntu has respected the Gnome anti-aliasing prefs

[03:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Works for me on Lucid

[03:13:02.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I am on 9.04

[03:14:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
the only way to make hover effects like tooltips are possible with divs on above the canvas?

[03:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ruby_on_tails: anti-aliased text worked for me on 9.04

[03:15:01.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
my laptop is broken maybe lol

[03:15:02.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
god knows

[03:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
ruby_on_tails: how did you obtain Firefox?

[03:15:04.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I need a complete reformat

[03:15:05.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I don't remember

[03:15:06.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
I have FF 3.0.8 and Shiretoko(from synaptec)

[03:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. a-a text in Shiretoko from backports worked for me, too

[03:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if there's a pref that allows you to override the Gnome AA prefs in Gecko...

[03:21:00.0000] <ruby_on_tails>
hmm

[04:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I thought the spec explicitly disallowed the xml declaration in text/html documents

[04:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I can't find any statement of that constraint in the spec

[04:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: it parses as a bogus comment and bogus comments are parse errors

[04:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: that might not count as "explicit", though

[04:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ok

[04:34:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[04:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
It seems like that it needs to be explicitly defined as a document-conformance error as well

[04:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
all parse errors are

[04:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and I believe there's nothing in the "writing" section permitting it

[04:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what's not permitted is prohibited

[04:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(unlike in RSS...)

[04:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[04:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I still think it would be better to explicitly disallow it

[04:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for the sake of clarity

[04:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it probably makes sense to have a note that calls it out

[04:38:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[05:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how many Objection Polls I missed while I was on vacation... I've noticed 2 so far.

[05:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, what was the last poll you did see before you went on vacation?

[05:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: versioning and ascii-ref

[05:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
<math><mi><object><span></span></object></mi><mi>

[05:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
The second <mi> ends up in the HTML namespace

[05:16:02.0000] <jgraham>
spec bug?

[05:16:03.0000] <jgraham>
Or bug in my head?

[05:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm positively surprised by http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Aug/0116.html

[05:28:00.0000] <tantek>
hsivonen - whoa - I missed that too, similarly positively/pleasantly surprised.

[05:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
what have we had since those two polls? Have I missed some too?

[05:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: aria section title + characterization and removing srcdoc

[05:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(and indeed, there haven't been more)

[05:40:00.0000] <wirepair>
silly question, how would one remove a nameless cookie?

[05:40:01.0000] <wirepair>
like document.cookie = '=asdf';

[05:42:00.0000] <wirepair>
er. how would one remove the nameless cookie from javascript ;)

[05:46:00.0000] <wirepair>
nevermind got it

[05:55:00.0000] <david_carlisle>
jgraham: "The second <mi> ends up in the HTML namespace," watching with interest... sort of related to bug 9887

[05:57:00.0000] <david_carlisle>
also who registered the irc name "davidc" ?  nickserv told me to rename myself, what you need is namespaces  to avoid such clashes.

[05:58:00.0000] <annevk5>
namespaces on IRC? haha

[06:00:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
/nick http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML/davidc?

[06:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
obviously, we need a prefix mechanism to make that more usable

[06:01:01.0000] <Peter`>
david_carlisle: he registered almost 10 years ago

[06:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
david_carlisle: The problem is, I think that when you have a scoping element inside a <mn> then an end tag causes you to switch back to the secondary insertion mode i.e. out of the mode in which you insert things in a non-HTML namespace

[06:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
or <mi>

[06:02:02.0000] <jgraham>
even

[06:02:03.0000] <jgraham>
it looks like a simple bug in the spec

[06:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Any opinion?

[06:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: if the second <mi> is not in the MathML namespace, I'd consider it a bug somewher

[06:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
e

[06:03:03.0000] <jgraham>
(I say "simple bug" but I'm not quite sure what the right fix is of if it is simple)

[06:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
(possibly it shouldn't worry about scoping elements when deciding to switch or not)

[06:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
(maybe that plays badly with <foreignContent> though)

[06:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
foreignObject definitely needs to be scoping

[06:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(and everyone keeps calling it foreignContent)

[06:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe I misunderstood your remark about scopingness here

[06:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Argh

[06:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
I always do that :)

[06:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: The point is that in the "Any other end tag" part of In Foreign Content, you switch to the SIM if there is no non-HTML element in scope. But there can be a non-HTML element on the stack of open elements even if it is not in scope

[06:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
In which case you switch too early

[06:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: oh

[06:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think

[06:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
this context-dependent stuff is harder than it first seemed

[06:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
At least that is consistent with what gecko and html5lib do

[06:13:03.0000] <hsivonen>
still beats making the author use xmlns

[06:13:04.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, but it is disappointingly complex

[06:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is it just me or isn't it rather out of orderish to start discussing longdesc use cases right *after* the poll on the topic?

[06:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
AFAICT the main conclusion from that is that there exists a contingent who believe that Process is important and must be strictly followed whilst they percieve it is helping their cause, but who ignore it once a decision goes against them

[06:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: shocking

[07:43:00.0000] <cyberix_>
Is browser support for XHR2 being tested/tacked somewhere?

[07:44:00.0000] <annevk5>
not really

[07:45:00.0000] <annevk5>
I plan to write XHR2 tests at some point, but haven't done it so far

[07:45:01.0000] <cyberix_>
I found out that you could use the file writer API to generate blobs from raw data

[07:45:02.0000] <annevk5>
CSSOM has somewhat higher priority and XHR1 tests are still not properly published (but they are at least written)

[07:46:00.0000] <cyberix_>
so I guess it should then be possible to post raw data with XHR2

[07:46:01.0000] <annevk5>
cyberix_, well, that feature hasn't even made it into the draft yet

[07:46:02.0000] <annevk5>
cyberix_, oh, posting Blob objects is in there, yes

[07:47:00.0000] <annevk5>
responseBlob not yet, but I think we pretty much agreed on how it ought to work

[07:47:01.0000] <cyberix_>
Well, that we already have working

[07:49:00.0000] <cyberix_>
we just read it as a string, and do (charcode & 0xff)

[07:49:01.0000] <annevk5>
cyberix_, cross-origin support is in WebKit/Gecko

[07:49:02.0000] <cyberix_>
I have tried it out

[07:49:03.0000] <annevk5>
cyberix_, I think posting Blob might be too

[07:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
there's too much going on to really keep track, even being the editor

[07:50:01.0000] <cyberix_>
not blaming you

[07:51:00.0000] <annevk5>
no worries, I don't feel blamed :)

[07:51:01.0000] <cyberix_>
just scared of writing this without seeing a working example first :-)

[07:56:00.0000] <boblet>
any chrome ppl around? I’ve found a fun CSS3 transform+animation issue; works when in head, doesn’t when linked

[07:56:01.0000] <annevk5>
are you sure the linked style sheet applies?

[07:57:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk5: well, the anim fires in both situations, and I can see styles applied in inspector, but animated object ends up in different place when linked

[07:58:00.0000] <boblet>
not sure if I’m just doing something wrong or not

[07:58:01.0000] <boblet>
also only happens in new tab, not on reload

[07:59:00.0000] <cyberix_>
annevk5: Should there not be one "HTML5: the Blob" document that would explain the datatype?

[08:00:00.0000] <cyberix_>
at the moment it is defined in, what, ten places?

[08:00:01.0000] <boblet>
annevk5: will set up example to show you…

[08:02:00.0000] <annevk5>
cyberix_, I'm not very happy with the whole Blob/File mess to be honest

[08:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
cyberix_, but I don't want to make it my problem

[08:07:00.0000] <cyberix_>
I see

[08:08:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk5: this is as intended (animation and transition CSS in head, other CSS in linked stylesheet): http://east.webdirections.org/wde/2010/

[08:08:01.0000] <boblet>
annevk5: this is the same code moved from head to stylesheet: http://east.webdirections.org/wde/2010/test.html

[08:09:00.0000] <boblet>
in Chrome the animated arrows bg-img jumps after animating when in linked styles, but not in Safari

[08:10:00.0000] <boblet>
this new-fangled CSS3 stuff is confounding me

[08:14:00.0000] <cheeser>
it's awesome  :)

[08:15:00.0000] <Rik`>
boblet: why are you putting some transitions if you use animations ?

[08:16:00.0000] <boblet>
Rik`: better browser support for transitions, but the transition on page load can only be done via an animation or JS

[08:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: is HTML parsing in responseXML still a possibility for XHR2?

[08:17:01.0000] <boblet>
cheeser: was that re: my links? heh, thanks :) apart from the broken bit (and occasional flashing after transition in Safari, mostly sorted)

[08:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, it's still part of XHR2

[08:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, I tried getting it in XHR1 but that was controversial

[08:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: OK

[08:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wishes responseXML didn't exist

[08:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Also I wish the live DOM viewer showed namespaces

[08:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
and a pony

[08:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
with a single horn from its forehead

[08:22:03.0000] <Rik`>
boblet: you're only using -webkit-transition so, browser support is quite the same as animations

[08:22:04.0000] <annevk5>
responseXML is nice

[08:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: Why? being able to parse XML from a string is much more flexible

[08:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
and it is hardly any more code

[08:23:02.0000] <boblet>
Rik`: once it actually works… :p

[08:23:03.0000] <jgraham>
or any slower

[08:25:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, and strings are not needed either if we have binary

[08:26:00.0000] <annevk5>
but okay...

[08:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Not really a reasonable argument

[08:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
I mean we don't have responseJSON or responseSexp or whatever

[08:27:02.0000] <annevk5>
Sexp?

[08:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
s-expression

[08:28:01.0000] <annevk5>
we will get responseBlob

[08:28:02.0000] <annevk5>
responseJSON has been proposed at some point

[08:28:03.0000] <jgraham>
It just seems like API bloat to me

[08:28:04.0000] <espadrine>
Isn't there some JSONRequest adoption in browsers?

[08:28:05.0000] <jgraham>
making priviledged accessors for some formats

[08:29:00.0000] <espadrine>
I know XHR doesn't like that

[08:29:01.0000] <annevk5>
XHR doesn't like it?

[08:29:02.0000] <espadrine>
meaning the spec says it doesn't want JSONRequest

[08:30:00.0000] <annevk5>
that's CORS

[08:30:01.0000] <espadrine>
yep

[08:30:02.0000] <annevk5>
but yeah, it's not going into browsers

[09:00:00.0000] <boblet>
nn

[09:09:00.0000] <Fyrd>
Does anyone here know if being able to load a data URI as a standalone file in a browser window is part of a standard?

[09:11:00.0000] <Fyrd>
Currently all browsers but IE support this...I'd like IE9 to support it too, but they probably won't if there isn't a spec that says they should. 

[09:11:01.0000] <cyberix_>
BlobBuilder seems to only work for text. Is there a way of turning a data url into a blob?

[09:12:00.0000] <Peter`>
Fyrd: http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-August/028011.html

[09:12:01.0000] <Peter`>
Currently data: URLs actually don't even validate

[09:14:00.0000] <Fyrd>
Ah, thanks Peter` . So this information is currently lacking, I see...

[09:17:00.0000] <Fyrd>
Too bad no one's responded to that email yet.

[09:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Fyrd: IE doesn't allow it as a "security issue".  Not sure of the details.

[09:20:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh, hybi realizes Shelby Moore is a troll

[09:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
that's about time

[09:21:01.0000] <annevk5>
I've ignored most emails from the past week or so

[09:22:00.0000] <Fyrd>
TabAtkins_: Yeah, that's what I suspected, though they never did explain the reason in the bug I submitted...

[09:22:01.0000] <Rik`>
is there a definitive answer in one spec about what "'onload' in window" should return ?

[09:22:02.0000] <annevk5>
Peter`, data: URLs should validate...

[09:22:03.0000] <annevk5>
Peter`, why do you keep insisting they don't?

[09:22:04.0000] <Ms2ger>
Rik`, I expect WebIDL would say yes

[09:23:00.0000] <Rik`>
Ms2ger: so it is a bug in Firefox if it doesn't ?

[09:23:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
It doesn't? Could you file a bug?

[09:24:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
(And cc me)

[09:24:01.0000] <Rik`>
Ms2ger: I'm just doing some background research first

[09:24:02.0000] <Rik`>
'onhashchange' in window returns true

[09:24:03.0000] <annevk5>
Opera also says false

[09:24:04.0000] <Rik`>
but 'onpopstate' in window returns false

[09:24:05.0000] <Rik`>
it's very inconsistent

[09:37:00.0000] <Rik`>
ok, IDL is too strange for me to absorb right now, so i'll file a bug :)

[10:41:00.0000] <Rik`>
Ms2ger: created https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590198

[10:43:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me wonders why none of tantek's time/date proposals have gotten any response

[10:43:01.0000] <tantek>
GPHemsley - quite a bit of follow-up on the wiki

[10:43:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
positive? because so far I like all of your ideas :)

[10:43:03.0000] <tantek>
(which is where my emails requested people follow-up, rather than getting lost in email arhives :) )

[10:43:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
(I'm currently catching up on my WHATWG e-mail)

[10:43:05.0000] <tantek>
mostly positive yes

[10:45:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh, hmm... actually, I'm not sure I agree with your AM/PM proposal

[10:46:00.0000] <tantek>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Time_element

[10:46:01.0000] <tantek>
what are your concerns about am/pm?

[10:46:02.0000] <tantek>
we've found it quite useful in microformats

[10:47:00.0000] <tantek>
(already have multiple interoperable implementations)

[10:47:01.0000] <tantek>
(and it helps reduce duplicate data)

[10:47:02.0000] <tantek>
parsing it is trivial

[10:47:03.0000] <tantek>
and it really helps content stay slimmer

[10:47:04.0000] <tantek>
(markup in particular)

[10:48:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
I just don't see the DRY value

[10:49:00.0000] <Cesarino>
Hi all, HTML4 and so on works in a html5 page?

[10:50:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
tantek: Well, alright, I concede that the proposal addresses my immediate concerns... but I personally don't like it, still

[10:51:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Rik`, thanks

[10:51:01.0000] <tantek_>
what don't you like about it?

[10:52:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
tantek_: It just doesn't feel right. IDK, I have no evidence to back up my opinion :P

[11:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me gives kudos to mpilgrim on http://wearehugh.com/public/2010/08/html5-video-accessibility/ and http://wearehugh.com/public/2010/08/html5-web-workers/, both awesome

[11:30:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Rik`, fwiw, we've got a test for `"onhashchange" in window`

[11:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
Ms2ger: ah crap, i means the non-normative part

[11:37:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie, thought so

[12:57:00.0000] <annevk5>
latest Shelby Moore: "I knew that, I just wanted you to admit it. \I have known for a while what sort of systems you are building."

[12:59:00.0000] <abarth|adoptPtr>
i didn't realize he's the axiomatic proof guy

[13:00:00.0000] <annevk5>
I hope my links will make people realize they are wasting their time and have the chairs put a ban on him

[13:00:01.0000] <annevk5>
but maybe I'm optimistic

[13:08:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh, "Last email to the list."

[13:09:00.0000] <annevk5>
curious to see how long that lasts

[13:11:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
So is this Shelby or Shelly?

[13:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
they are distinct people

[13:17:00.0000] <gavin>
what list is this?

[13:17:01.0000] <annevk5>
hybi

[13:17:02.0000] <annevk5>
it's the same Shelby Moore from www-style 2002-2005 (fwiw)

[13:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
more like 2002,2005 iirc :-)

[13:21:00.0000] <ojan>
annevk5: are there any cases where returning "auto" from getComputedStyle is correct?

[13:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah

[13:22:01.0000] <dbaron>
/me looks around for scrollback

[13:22:02.0000] <annevk5>
ojan, e.g. for 'top'

[13:22:03.0000] <annevk5>
iirc

[13:23:00.0000] <ojan>
annevk5: i'm looking at https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43559. there's a case where WebKit returns 0px and Gecko returns auto

[13:23:01.0000] <dbaron>
also for other things that are display:none or inside something display:none, I think

[13:23:02.0000] <annevk5>
ojan, the reason for that is because I aligned with WebKit; Gecko returns the used value there

[13:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
ojan, oh, that's the reverse

[13:24:01.0000] <annevk5>
/me looks

[13:24:02.0000] <ojan>
it's getting the computed width/height on an uncached image

[13:24:03.0000] <annevk5>
dbaron, yeah, or where the property is in the special list and does not apply to the element

[13:24:04.0000] <ojan>
shift+reload http://tinyurl.com/24qmgck to see the difference

[13:25:00.0000] <annevk5>
ojan, I guess that is because in Gecko the image is treated as inline element so 'width' does not apply and therefore returns the computed value rather than the used value

[13:26:00.0000] <ojan>
oh, interesting.

[13:26:01.0000] <annevk5>
ojan, pretty sucky that pages can depend on how browsers generate boxes for replaced elements while loading :/

[13:27:00.0000] <ojan>
this sounds like a scary thing to change (for webkit or gecko) :(

[13:27:01.0000] <annevk5>
sounds like an annoying thing to define too

[13:27:02.0000] <annevk5>
i guess HTML5 should define that

[13:28:00.0000] <annevk5>
/me checks the rendering chapter

[13:30:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/rendering.html#images-0 has the WebKit behavior

[13:30:01.0000] <ojan>
annevk5: i'm missing something. according to http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#specified0, the computed value should never be "auto" no?

[13:31:00.0000] <ojan>
oh, nm

[13:31:01.0000] <ojan>
i misread

[13:31:02.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#the-height-property "the percentage or 'auto' (see prose under <percentage>) or the absolute length; 'auto' if the property does not apply"

[13:32:00.0000] <annevk5>
(and it does not apply with the Gecko <img> model; assuming I guessed all this correctly)

[13:34:00.0000] <crash\>
there is a Bug for that

[13:34:01.0000] <crash\>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321919

[13:34:02.0000] <crash\>
pretty much the same problem

[13:35:00.0000] <annevk5>
crash\, with the same conclusions

[13:35:01.0000] <annevk5>
:)

[13:36:00.0000] <crash\>
what does getPropertyValue("width") for <input type=hidden> return?

[13:36:01.0000] <crash\>
should be auto too, right?

[13:37:00.0000] <annevk5>
yes

[13:39:00.0000] <crash\>
maybe I should create a bug and test case for that to clarify that

[13:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
Ms2ger: any idea what you meant on http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9642 ?

[13:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
make a test suite for getComputedStyle, that'd be neat :)

[13:42:00.0000] <crash\>
I can't see where the specs say. what behaviour is right

[13:43:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#dom-window-getcomputedstyle defines it

[13:43:01.0000] <annevk5>
if anything is unclear please email www-style

[13:43:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie, that pre eats the first linefeed, if that is relevant to the section I filed it on

[13:43:03.0000] <annevk5>
Ms2ger, not if you are in PLAINTEXT mode

[13:43:04.0000] <annevk5>
(I think)

[13:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
i really didn't understand the bug at all

[13:45:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me checks

[13:46:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh actually, it just emits it as character token

[13:46:01.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, if you're plain text file starts with a newline the parser would eat it

[13:46:02.0000] <annevk5>
s/you're/your/ geez

[13:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
good to know

[13:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll fix it, no need to file a bug

[13:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
(since i'm between bugs right now)

[13:47:02.0000] <crash\>
"If the property applies to the element or pseudo-element and the resolved value of the 'display' property is not none, the resolved value is the used value." for width/height

[13:47:03.0000] <annevk5>
(that is the bug from Ms2ger :) )

[13:47:04.0000] <crash\>
but a not loaded image is not of type display:none;

[13:48:00.0000] <annevk5>
crash\, no, it's of type inline in Gecko

[13:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk5: no it wouldn't

[13:48:02.0000] <crash\>
yes, so it should be the computed value

[13:48:03.0000] <crash\>
so I guess 0px would be right

[13:48:04.0000] <annevk5>
no, auto

[13:48:05.0000] <annevk5>
we just discussed this in this channel

[13:48:06.0000] <Hixie>
however, document.open('text/plain');document.write('\n'); would, so i'll fix that instead

[13:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
I even quoted http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#the-height-property

[13:49:01.0000] <crash\>
ok, since it's inline

[13:49:02.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, ah yeah, that is the bug

[13:49:03.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie, only because I filed the text/plain one earlier :)

[13:49:04.0000] <annevk5>
Hixie, didn't mean text/plain loading

[13:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
Ms2ger: :-D

[13:50:00.0000] <crash\>
but when it was replaced it can have a width/height

[13:50:01.0000] <crash\>
wired

[13:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
I never said this was easy ;p

[13:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
man some of these bugs are remarkably terse

[13:52:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me pleads guilty

[13:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
not all yours!

[13:54:00.0000] <crash\>
ist still dont think "auto" is right ;)

[13:54:01.0000] <crash\>
why it can't be 0px and when it can't be replaced and then alt="" is used be "auto"?

[13:55:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Be happy I didn't file >300 bugs ;)

[13:55:01.0000] <annevk5>
hmm, one email and now I get private spam from Shelby Moore

[13:55:02.0000] <annevk5>
crash\, sure, that is what HTML5 defines right now

[13:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
i love bugs like http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9633

[13:55:04.0000] <annevk5>
crash\, but apparently that breaks sites

[13:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
i have no idea WHAT should read that way...

[13:55:06.0000] <annevk5>
crash\, again see above for the WebKit bug report

[13:56:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie, add more ids

[13:57:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
When trying to use types other than image/png, authors can check if the image was really returned in the requested format by checking to see if the returned string starts with one the exact strings

[13:57:01.0000] <crash\>
ok, that confident me

[13:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
Ms2ger: yeah, i worked it out already, don't worry :-)

[13:58:01.0000] <annevk5>
anyways, nn

[13:59:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Hixie, if you can work out HTML parsing, terse bug reports shouldn't be much of a challenge

[14:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
how about http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9664

[14:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
does that make any sense to anyone?

[14:29:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Hixie: possible interpretations

[14:29:01.0000] <jcranmer>
1. The bug reporter wants more identification of the meanings of a, b, etc.

[14:29:02.0000] <jcranmer>
2. The bug reporter wants an explanation of transformation matrices

[14:31:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I'm not quite sure what he intends in the last clause of the disjunction

[14:31:01.0000] <jcranmer>
but the most clue I can get out of it is that the user lacks knowledge of transformations

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
jcranmer: yeah that's as much as i could get out of it

[15:00:00.0000] <jcranmer>
an informative reference to 2D transformations may be helpful

[15:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
should i link to http://lmgtfy.com/?q=2d+transformations ?

[15:02:00.0000] <jcranmer>
too unstable a site

[15:02:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I said "may be"

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[15:27:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: you are aware that the spec currently does mandate filtering <option>s with empty values only in <datalist> and not in <select>, right?

[15:29:00.0000] <sicking>
sorry, i don't think we explicitly mentioned this in the original bug filing

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: sure but <select> still needs live updating

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: i don't see why it would be harder to decide not to show an option than it would be to show it with different text

[15:57:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: updating the UI is a wholly different set of code than the code that implements the .options list

[15:58:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: also, changing the value in the UI is very different from shrinking the length of the UI, or the length of the .options list

[15:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
wait, what's .options got to do with anything

[15:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
i thought we were talking about the autocompletion ui

[15:59:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: the .options list is what the spec says should should be affected by .value

[16:00:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: oh, hmm.. i guess it doesn't

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
you mean datalist.options ?

[16:01:01.0000] <sicking>
yeah

[16:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's just a list of <option> elements

[16:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
no magic

[16:01:04.0000] <sicking>
ok, cool

[16:01:05.0000] <sicking>
we probably won't filter the UI either, for the same performance reasons

[16:02:00.0000] <sicking>
but since you can't test that, i care less what the spec says :)

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[16:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's mostly a quality of implementation issue

[16:02:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: for implementing lists like that, you generally want to know the number of options

[16:02:04.0000] <sicking>
as to calculate how big you make the scrollbar

[16:02:05.0000] <sicking>
so it's actually a lot more work to filter out empty-string ones, than to just show them as empty

[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough

[16:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure you'd ever want a scrollbar for this stuff anyway

[16:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
but that's another story

[16:03:03.0000] <sicking>
true

[16:05:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: it's still a strange difference between <select> and <datalist>, <select> doesn't mention filtering out empty-value <option>s

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it doesn't make much sense to show the ones whose value is empty

[16:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
since the behaviour would be to autocomplete nothing

[16:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
but it makes sense with <select>

[16:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
since the empty string is a valid value

[16:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
does css have a feature yet so that you can use the first inline box in a block as a marker, and have everything else indented as far as needed to get past that box on subsequent lines?

[16:38:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, as a marker like a list-item marker? or do you mean something else by marker?

[16:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
tantek: yeah like a list item marker

[16:48:00.0000] <tantek>
I don't know how you specify what the first inline box in a block would be.  There's the first line box.  And the first letter. But assuming you mean something different.

[16:48:01.0000] <tantek>
(since I have no AXIOMATIC PROOF ;) )

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean something like   <span> <input type=radio> foo bar baz </span> -- i want the foo bar baz to flow to multiple lines but all aligned so that subsequent lines start immediately below the "foo"

[16:50:00.0000] <tantek>
ah, you're talking about (essentially) display:marker

[16:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes, essentially

[16:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't mind if it's actually that

[16:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
just wandering if such a feature exists yet

[16:50:04.0000] <tantek>
I don't think that has made any progress since you and I touched that draft

[16:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
k

[16:50:06.0000] <tantek>
I can check tomorrow

[16:50:07.0000] <tantek>

[17:23:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, ping

[17:23:01.0000] <jonnybarnes>
say your page is in english, so has html lang=en at start, and your quoting some french, is there any way of marking that up in the document?

[17:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: pong

[17:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
jonnybarnes: yes, put lang=fr around the bit that's french

[17:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
as in <blockquote lang=fr> say

[17:24:03.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, I'm having difficulty keeping up with these changes:

[17:24:04.0000] <jonnybarnes>
ah cool, thanks Hixie

[17:25:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, if I type http://google.com into my address bar, does Google get a popstate?

[17:25:01.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41372

[17:25:02.0000] <jlebar>
/me has re-read the relevant sections too many times now to make any sense of it.  :)

[17:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: search for "popstate" in the spec, it doesn't happen often :-)

[17:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are exactly two times popstate is fired

[17:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
1. during history traversal, if the document readiness is already "complete"

[17:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
2. after the browser stops parsing

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
does that answer your question?

[17:30:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, I think so, yes.  Thanks.

[17:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
np

[17:40:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, this seems to be a point of a lot of confusion.  People see "traverse the history" and assume that it means "go back to a page that you've been to before."  Perhaps you could clarify this.

[17:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: any suggestion on how to do that?

[17:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: i could rename the algorithm somehow

[17:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: dunno what to rename it to, though

[17:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: that you traverse the history in more cases than just going back is clear just from clicking the name of the algorith, which lists where it is mentioned (assuming you're using the single-page version of the spec)

[17:51:00.0000] <cardona507>
what args does lineTo() take?

[17:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
x,y

[17:52:00.0000] <cardona507>
cool - thnx Hixie 

[17:53:00.0000] <cardona507>
darn FF is acting like IE 

[17:54:00.0000] <jlebar>
cardona507, :(  How?

[17:55:00.0000] <cardona507>
for some weird reason FF is not liking an AJAX call that I am doing to populate the jQuery graph plugin visualizer

[17:55:01.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, you could add a note under 6.5.9 saying "This algorithm is triggered by: * navigating to a fragment identifier (always) * navigating across documents (sometimes)" or whatever.

[17:55:02.0000] <cardona507>
I am only joking about FF acting like IE

[17:55:03.0000] <cardona507>
nothing could be that bad :)

[17:55:04.0000] <jlebar>
ha.

[17:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: i don't like doing that because when i change how the algorithm is invoked, i forget to update the note, and then things get out of sync, and people get even more confused

[18:00:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/24/motorola-snaps-up-280-north-for-20-million/

[18:01:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
good on them

[18:02:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, Hm...that's fair.  You could just be vague and say "Note: One need not traverse the history to an existing history entry.  See e.g. #navigating-across-documents."

[18:07:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hm...that wording is pretty bad.

[18:07:01.0000] <jlebar>
Note: The UA can traverse the history to either an existing history entry or a new history entry.

[18:07:02.0000] <jlebar>
s/can/may

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: never use "may" in a note, "may" has normative meaning and notes are non-normative

[18:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
however, i've put in some text

[18:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
regenning now

[18:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
let me know what you think when it's up

[18:14:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, Looks great to me.  We'll see if it helps the WebKit devs figure things out.  :)

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: :-)

[19:40:00.0000] <boblet>
hixie: re: bug 9743, the lack of examples meant it was unclear that four different styles were valid. The examples you added make it much clearer, thanks.

[19:41:00.0000] <boblet>
it would still be nice to link to 12.1.2.3, but I think it’s clear enough as it is

[19:42:00.0000] <boblet>
changing to resolved:fixed

[20:50:00.0000] <annevk5>
is there a known bug of some kind of the spec not defining what should be on the object versus what should be on the prototype chain?

[20:50:01.0000] <annevk5>
e.g. w(HTMLElement.prototype.title) gives wildly different results

[20:51:00.0000] <annevk5>
same for HTMLElement.prototype.onclick etc.

[20:51:01.0000] <annevk5>
actually, that one always returns undefined, but WebIDL suggests it shouldn't

[21:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'm wanting to change the spam-management I've been using with my mail server .. what's the recommended solution for dealing with spam these days?

[21:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm runnin Exim

[21:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and have been using spamassassin and sa-exim

[21:48:00.0000] <wirepair>
forward it to gmail and let them worry about it

[21:48:01.0000] <wirepair>
s'what i do ;D

[21:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[21:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I guess that's the easiest way

[21:51:01.0000] <wirepair>
seriously, my sh0dan.org domain has the mx forwarding to gmail ehe

[21:51:02.0000] <wirepair>
wow only 25,926 spams

[21:51:03.0000] <boblet>
but doing that would take all the masochism out of running your own mail server

[21:52:00.0000] <wirepair>
boblet, good point!

[21:52:01.0000] <wirepair>
then i suggest sendmail 8.10 with a perl script filtering emails by hand

[21:52:02.0000] <wirepair>
;)

[21:52:03.0000] <boblet>
and that basically removes the reason for managing your own mail server, no?

[21:53:00.0000] <wirepair>
'Would you like to accept this as spam? [y/n]: '

[21:53:01.0000] <boblet>
wirepair: yeah, much more like it

[21:53:02.0000] <wirepair>
ehe

[21:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I should quit running my own web server also

[21:55:01.0000] <wirepair>
thanks MikeSmith, that actually reminded me to check my email

[21:55:02.0000] <wirepair>
and my first email says your domain will expire in 3 days

[21:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[21:56:01.0000] <wirepair>
so 

[21:56:02.0000] <wirepair>
/me tips hat to MikeSmith 

[22:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rolandsteiner: hey

[22:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
have you guys all moved to a new office?

[22:17:00.0000] <volkmar>
Hixie: can you have a look at that: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590363 ?

[23:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wirepair: I also run my own name server

[23:13:00.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: if I heard rightly a few weeks back, some smart node.js developers are writing a node.js powered nameserver (yes, taking over the world by stealth almost)

[23:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wow

[23:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I guess that's sort to be expected

[23:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
a natural evolution

[23:15:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
like how CSS is eventually going to become Turing-complete

[23:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
man, I just did a massive upgrade of my Debian server to the latest testing

[23:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
after many months of having done no package updates at all

[23:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe even a year or more

[23:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I had to manually deal with some package conflict problems

[23:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but otherwise, I got everything upgraded

[23:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and amazingly, everything actually seems to be working

[23:18:00.0000] <Ankheg>
it's so unusual for Debian?

[23:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I had some conflicts before

[23:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which is why I had held off on upgrading

[23:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
volkmar: what about it?

[23:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ankheg: upgrades were totally borking my mail delivery, among other things

[23:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I found that the main problem was spamassassin

[23:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I solved it by removing spamassassin

[23:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
now I need to find some other other way of dealing with spam

[23:20:04.0000] <Ankheg>
So much for the stable releases )

[23:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, it's what I get for running the testing distro

[23:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess

[23:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, it wasn't anything I couldn't deal with

[23:21:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
in the long run

[23:21:04.0000] <Ankheg>
that's the case, I presume

[23:21:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
just took me a while to get back to it

[23:22:00.0000] <Ankheg>
then I hope this update will be of without much trouble

[23:24:00.0000] <volkmar>
Hixie: do you think the spec should take into considering this behavior?

[23:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
volkmar: you mean the old firefox behaviour?

[23:25:00.0000] <volkmar>
the old firefox behavior and the current webkit/opera

[23:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
that behaviour was taken into account

[23:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
and considered silly :-)

[23:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
or inconsistent

[23:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
or some such

[23:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
this was stuff i studied quite carefully at the time

[23:26:01.0000] <volkmar>
ok, good to know it's kwown :)

[23:26:02.0000] <volkmar>
and do you have any idea how much that could break the web?

[23:27:00.0000] <volkmar>
... or you are expecting us to test that :)

[23:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i expect it won't break the web at all

[23:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't know off-hand

[23:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
iirc, IE didn't let you change the type at all dynamically

[23:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
so i doubt much content relies on it

[23:27:05.0000] <volkmar>
ok, fine

[23:35:00.0000] <rsteiner>
MikeSmith: hey! sorry for the late response (was having lunch)

[23:37:00.0000] <rsteiner>
MikeSmith: yep, new and shiny office! :D

[23:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rsteiner: btw, have you see the Mozilla bug about implementing CSS support for ruby?

[23:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=256274

[23:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, I see that Anne has already commented there as well

[23:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=256274#c86

[23:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
[[

[23:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
So is Mozilla planning on supporting more of ruby than the other browsers? I.e.

[23:42:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
more than HTML5 requires? I am asking because comment 84 mentions various

[23:42:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
concepts not present in HTML5 or implementations of WebKit/Trident.

[23:42:05.0000] <MikeSmith>

[23:42:06.0000] <MikeSmith>

[00:05:00.0000] <rsteiner>
MikeSmith: interesting thread - confirms that complex ruby is a headache in implementation details... ;)

[00:07:00.0000] <rsteiner>
/me wonders if pointing out Mozilla is working on this will make WebKit folks more receptive to a complex ruby implementation

[01:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
in response to my own question earlier

[01:05:01.0000] <annevk5>
it seems WebIDL has this sentence

[01:05:02.0000] <annevk5>
"If a host object implements an interface, then for each attribute defined on the interface, there must be a corresponding property on the host object"

[01:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
which suggests properties are not on the prototype chain

[01:13:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: great to see you back!

[01:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: great to be back :-) (and caught up with email!)

[01:14:01.0000] <nessy>
congrats - that would have been hard work!

[01:17:00.0000] <nessy>
your question made me wonder if I should put the effort in to add a processing model to the WMML spec

[01:18:00.0000] <nessy>
what would you want to see in a processing model? Something like a DTD or XML schema?

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: neither of those!

[01:19:00.0000] <nessy>
I didn't think so ;-) but what are you after?

[01:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: I think it makes sense to put effort into the processing model if you want to push the proposal despite the discussions we had at Whistler

[01:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: if not, then not

[01:19:03.0000] <nessy>
the mapping to display it in an iframe-like construct?

[01:20:00.0000] <myakura>
Hixie: typo in http://whatwg.org/C#boolean-attribute . the example uses checked and disabled attributes but the text above says "The checked and readonly attributes..."

[01:20:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: if nobody wants to implement a xml format, I am not going to push it

[01:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: what I'd like to see is a detailed description of what parser what, how it integrates with the task queues, etc.

[01:20:03.0000] <nessy>
ah ok, that would be simple - mostly a copy of what WebSRT describes, I guess...

[01:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
my point is that I don't expect it to be at all simple if done in sufficient detail

[01:21:01.0000] <nessy>
like this bit? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/websrt.html#parsing

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: parsing isn't enough. also the task queue interaction of how stuff is displayed is needed, etc., etc.

[01:22:01.0000] <nessy>
hmm… I wonder if that is specified for WebSRT yet even

[01:22:02.0000] <nessy>
might be more useful to try doing that for WebSRT

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: it's less important to define it for WebSRT on that level of detail, because WebSRT reuses CSS in a limited way and doesn't import all possible HTML/DOM interactions with the task queue

[01:24:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: unless we stick innerHTML into WebSRT, right?

[01:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: the reason why my WebSRT with innerHTML cues is so simple is that it defines everything in terms of existing operations, so everything flows out of that

[01:24:02.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: I don't understand - why would that be different for WMML?

[01:24:03.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: if we stick innerHTML in WebSRT, the task queue interactions need to be answered

[01:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: I already have proposed an answer, but foolip's second to last email to the thread suggests he might not like my answer...

[01:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: you haven't defined how WMML works to the point I have defined how my WebSRT with innerHTML would work

[01:26:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: probably because I don't know enough about that part to define it and just assumed that what you defined would work the same in WMML as in WebSRT

[01:26:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: I could just basically copy your proposal then?

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: to do that, you'd have to define how you extract from WMML the string you assign to innerHTML

[01:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: and as we already discussed, that step would suck more with a markup-like framing than with WebSRT-like framing of the strings

[01:28:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: is that difficult or unclear? it's just what's in a <cue> element

[01:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: you need to define "what's in the cue" element

[01:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: does it work like "what's in the noscript element" or "what's in the div element" or in another way

[01:29:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: as in: take the text and throw it into a <body> element of a iframe

[01:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: I mean "take the text" needs defining

[01:30:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: ok … 

[01:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: and I can't think of how to define it in a way that wouldn't be bad

[01:30:02.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: what would be a bad way? (sorry if you have to repeat this from Whistler - I seem pretty clueless here but do want to understand)

[01:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
bad way #1: Parse as XML, take .innerHTML. Bad because the whole document needs to be well-formed. Bad because the XML people would object to no end.

[01:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
bad way #2: Define a custom parser that takes the text with whatever mechanism. Bad because such a custom parser would have to have a tokenizer that's of comparable complexity to the HTML tokenizer and it's not at all a good idea to have to develop another one of those.

[01:33:00.0000] <nessy>
yup, #1 was my thinking, but if XML people would object, then there is no reason to go with XML in the first place

[01:33:01.0000] <nessy>
so, I'm happy to just drop it (until somebody asks for a XML version again and then we can have this whole argument again)

[01:33:02.0000] <annevk5>
I really don't want XML for subtitles btw

[01:34:00.0000] <annevk5>
I'd object to no end, too

[01:34:01.0000] <nessy>
hehe :)

[01:34:02.0000] <nessy>
what are your reasons annevk5?

[01:34:03.0000] <annevk5>
XML failing was the whole reason we started HTML5

[01:34:04.0000] <nessy>
ah, but XML failed for HTML - that doesn't mean XML failed for the whole industru

[01:35:00.0000] <nessy>
I don't like namespaces either and XSL-FO is just… why does it even exist?

[01:35:01.0000] <annevk5>
some people think XML is salvation

[01:35:02.0000] <annevk5>
so everything ought to be expressed in it

[01:35:03.0000] <nessy>
but XML is being used in a lot of places successfully to define exchange formats and re-use a well-defined parser

[01:36:00.0000] <annevk5>
XQueryX is probably the worst example of that

[01:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
bad way #3: Use the HTML tokenizer with a custom tree builder that treats <cue> like <iframe>. Bad because the two-level parsing would be non-obvious (people are already confused by how the contents of iframe and noscript work). Bad because the appearance of the markup document as a whole suggests CSS selectors match on the whole tree when they'd actually match on a different tree.

[01:36:02.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, not really on the scale HTML is used

[01:36:03.0000] <nessy>
I am just developing a video application for somebody who has all their formats in XML and I have to use all the XML stuff including XSLT, XML schema etc - but it's actually helpful to some extent

[01:36:04.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, and most of those uses are generated and not hand edited

[01:37:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
... unlike HTML and subtitles

[01:37:01.0000] <annevk5>
(if you're thinking of Atom / RSS)

[01:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
bad way #4: Use the HTML tokenizer *and* a hacked HTML tree builder and get rid of the two-level parsing. Bad because you'd have to hack the tree builder not to implicitly generate the html and body elements.

[01:37:03.0000] <nessy>
no, no, subtitles will be a lot more generated in future

[01:37:04.0000] <hsivonen>
bad way #5: Rename wmml to html and cuelist to body, then use the HTML parser as a whole without the innerHTML step but instead clone the subtrees. Bad because of the CSS reason above.

[01:38:00.0000] <annevk5>
Ms2ger, I expect way more people to touch HTML (either directly or via templates) than they touch e.g. Atom

[01:38:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
Exactly

[01:38:02.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, "the future" is what people said about HTML too

[01:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I think those are pretty much the cases I recall discussing at Whistler.

[01:39:00.0000] <annevk5>
if we can prevent requiring tools to generate something as simple as subtitles (and we can) we should

[01:39:01.0000] <nessy>
I am actually not sure if there are more html pages on the planet than xml files - you don't know what's going on behind closed doors in companies

[01:39:02.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: you have a fair number there! wow!

[01:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
closed systems using XML is not really a convincing argument imo

[01:40:01.0000] <annevk5>
of course closed systems will work fine

[01:40:02.0000] <annevk5>
they're easy to get right

[01:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
having a lot of XML behind close doors isn't a particularly relevant point for the Web

[01:43:00.0000] <nessy>
annevk5: I was just making an argument about the number of documents in existence and therefore the importance of a format - I am by no means suggesting to move HTML to XML (we know that failed)

[01:44:00.0000] <nessy>
XML as an of itself is not a bad format just because it didn't work for HTML

[01:44:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
It's not really a fair comparison, though

[01:45:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
XML and HTML are on rather different levels

[01:46:00.0000] <nessy>
Ms2ger: I know - and thus I don't really see why a subtitle format should not be XML just because XML didn't work for HTML - but hsivonen obviously has a lot of arguments against a subtitle format that is meant to work with HTML, so that makes sense

[01:46:01.0000] <annevk5>
It is a bad format for formats that will be hand generated or with string concatenation, etc. as making errors is easy (and they slip in easily as e.g. Philip` has demonstrated lots of times). I expect subtitles to be much closer to HTML in this regard than to e.g. Atom. Especially if I look at the SRT files I often fetch when looking at a movie.

[01:48:00.0000] <nessy>
annevk5: this is an argument about enforcing strict parsing rather than about XML

[01:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the issues arising from Draconian failure and Namespaces apply to any prospective Web formats based on XML

[01:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: strict parsing is a key part of the XML package

[01:49:01.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, strict parsing is intrinsic to XML

[01:49:02.0000] <nessy>
annevk5: foolip found a lot of SRT files that do not have empty lines as separaters between caption cues, which would not be conformant with WebSRT - would you want a WebSRT parser to accept that?

[01:49:03.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, until everyone does XML5 XML is just not a suitable format for any kind of language that web authors need to deploy

[01:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(it wouldn't have to be that way, but to change it, you'd need to take action against the wishes of the XML community--compare with your argument not to use SRT due to community concerns)

[01:50:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
Look, another thread about the HTML6 doctype!

[01:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Ms2ger: yeah, it's so sad

[01:50:03.0000] <nessy>
annevk5: I don't see strict parsing as inherently bad either - in fact, I am really annoyed that Firefox lets me get away with broken JavaScript, that then breaks other browsers - I do like to develop in Firefox...

[01:50:04.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, maybe it should; but that seems rather separate discussion

[01:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: there's going to be the ES5 strict mode, but as I understand it, it hasn't been designed to be a stable equilibrium, so who knows how long it's going to last...

[01:52:00.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, JavaScript is somewhat resilient to authoring errors as well; e.g. it's per script element, per event handler attribute, etc.

[01:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2008Dec/0132.html might of interest to you

[01:53:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen, annevk5: so, what I wanted with WMML was a XML format that doesn't have any of these restrictions - namespaces, XSL-FO, strict parsing - but that seems to be a bit ahead of the curve 

[01:54:00.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, strict parsing and namespaces are intrinsic to XML; you do not just get rid of them

[01:54:01.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, unless you replace XML wholesale, as I proposed at some point

[01:55:00.0000] <nessy>
I want a different word for it then - it seems using the single word "XML" makes everyone go religious ;)

[01:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: there's no point is using almost-XML, since you don't get the reuse benefits that are typically used to justify XML in the first place

[01:55:02.0000] <annevk5>
nessy, euh, didn't I give a bunch of arguments? it's a bit more than a belief

[01:56:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: yes, that's correct - and I am not religious about it and I understand where you come from (mostly)

[01:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: note that my list of bad solutions included solutions that didn't use an XML parser but would have parsed similar tags by other means

[01:57:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: yeah, but mostly because you went from XML to HTML, which I don't see as a solution

[01:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: bad way #2 used neither XML nor HTML parser

[01:59:00.0000] <nessy>
then WebSRT falls under bad way #2, too - I don't really accept #2 to be honest

[01:59:01.0000] <nessy>
but  I accept that there are issues and I have accepted that nobody wants a XML based format

[02:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: WebSRT does require a new parser for the container format, but the container doesn't have gratuitously XML/HTML-like complexity like attributes and character references

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
or DOCTYPEs / <script>

[02:01:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: it will get there once all the requirements are satisfied by WebSRT

[02:02:00.0000] <nessy>
it will hopefully stay simpler though, I agree

[02:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: we can say "no" to any requirement that isn't about making the HTML5 feature set from before the supposed feature freeze accessible

[02:02:02.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: did you see the requirements list of the a11y group?

[02:03:00.0000] <nessy>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_Accessibility_Requirements

[02:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: if you ask any accessibility group for requirements, they'll require the kitchen sink, because this looks like the one opportunity to get more features since the introduction of U.S. TV captioning

[02:04:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: wouldn't you in their situation?

[02:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: maybe, though I would like to think I'd be able to show the kind of restraint I'd now like them to show

[02:05:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: if you are a disabled user and have not had the possibilities that the Web allows you to have to make your life easier, wouldn't you want it all, too?

[02:05:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: so, it's a matter or managing what is achievable now and what is important to meet without obstructing to meet further needs later

[02:06:00.0000] <nessy>
s/or/of/

[02:06:01.0000] <annevk5>
note that adding a bunch of features does not necessarily improve the situation

[02:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: well, let's put it this way: on the internationalization front, the people who are supposed to be advocating on my behalf in Working Groups claim that I need this and that to be able to write my mother tongue, but I don't really need all they claim I need

[02:06:03.0000] <annevk5>
e.g. longdesc was at some point added to the language also based on requirements, but it didn't work at all

[02:06:04.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: I agree we should address true user needs, though

[02:08:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: I think there are bare needs, things that are really important, and then there are things that are less important - and we just have to find a way to find out which is which and then manage to create a path to achieve the bare needs without obstructing the later introduction of the more fancy features

[02:09:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: I say "just", but that is the really difficult part and it is particularly difficult because those that understand the needs don't know what is difficult and those that understand what is difficult don't understand the needs 

[02:10:00.0000] <nessy>
but I'm sure we will get there :)

[02:13:00.0000] <salty-horse>
hey. why doesn't the first <article> get styled correctly? the border appears on the two <time> elements instead: http://pastehtml.com/view/1ar9mj2.html

[02:13:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
salty-horse, works for me, try article { display: block; }

[02:13:02.0000] <salty-horse>
articles aren't blocks by default? :/

[02:14:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
Only in recent browsers

[02:15:00.0000] <salty-horse>
you're right. it works in firefox nightly

[02:15:01.0000] <salty-horse>
if it's not a block, the "bleeding" onto the "time" elements is correct?

[02:15:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: (or anybody else who has insight into this) -

[02:15:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I notice here -

[02:15:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
"character encoding used must be an ASCII-compatible character encoding"

[02:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
does that mean that <meta charset=utf-16> is not conformant?

[02:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
because UTF-16 is not ascii-compatible, is it?

[02:17:00.0000] <salty-horse>
thanks Ms2ger 

[02:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I notice a related statement here:

[02:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/semantics.html#html-documents-15

[02:17:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
prefaced with "If an HTML document does not start with a BOM..."

[02:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which would seem to apply to the non-UTF-16 case

[02:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but the other one is not qualified in any way

[02:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yeah, <meta charset=utf-16> is non-conforming. (Very deliberately.)

[02:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok, thanks

[02:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so at the risk of revealing my ignorance as usual, what is the reason for it being deliberately non-conforming?

[02:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
abarth|adoptPtr: XBL is the thing that's eventually going to save us all

The XML Binding Language (XBL) describes the ability to associate elements in a document with script, event handlers, CSS, and more complex content models, which can be stored in another document. This can be used to re-order and wrap content so that, for instance, simple HTML or XHTML markup can have complex CSS styles applied without requiring that the markup be polluted with multiple semantically neutral div elements.

[02:28:04.0000] <annevk5>
why not just use <iframe srcdoc> ?

[02:29:00.0000] <abarth>
can you put an iframe srcdoc in an attribute?

[02:29:01.0000] <abarth>
also, that's huge overkill to display someone's name

[02:30:00.0000] <annevk5>
no and fair enough

[02:32:00.0000] <abarth>
<link rel="entities" href="entites.json"> seems better than the script API

[02:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
abarth: Please, no :)

[02:36:01.0000] <abarth>
annevk5: also, <firame srcdoc> is rectangular.  you might want the text to flow around a float, for example

[02:36:02.0000] <abarth>
jgraham: i think we want some kind of templating system

[02:36:03.0000] <abarth>
jgraham: so folks don't have to worry too much about escaping

[02:37:00.0000] <abarth>
to prevent XSS

[02:37:01.0000] <abarth>
i'm certainly open to other ideas.  this was the simplest thing i could think of

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: the reason is that it never has an effect, so using it is always a sign of deep author confusion of how stuff works

[02:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: umm. actually, it's worse than that. Sometimes it has an effect but a non-obvious effect (says UTF-16 but means UTF-8).

[02:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
abarth: It seems pretty complex one you take DOM into account. And the fallback isn't exacly wonderful

[02:40:01.0000] <abarth>
jgraham: what do you mean by taking DOM into account?

[02:41:00.0000] <abarth>
yeah, i need to experiment with what sort of fallback options exist

[02:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
abarth: Well presumably you need to be able to inject an entity through the DOM somehow

[02:41:02.0000] <abarth>
and entity definition?

[02:41:03.0000] <hsivonen>
abarth: your entity proposal scares me

[02:41:04.0000] <abarth>
or an entity itself?

[02:41:05.0000] <jgraham>
abarth: Both a new definition and a reference to an existing entity

[02:41:06.0000] <abarth>
elmt.innerHTML = "Hi there &$name;"

[02:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
sure innerHTML works

[02:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
But if you don;t use that?

[02:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
Also, you have to block load on the entity <link>

[02:42:03.0000] <abarth>
document.decodeEntity("$name")

[02:42:04.0000] <annevk5>
why make it more complicated than innerHTML?

[02:42:05.0000] <jgraham>
so what happens if you want to load a new entity definition file and use it

[02:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK

[02:43:01.0000] <abarth>
yeah, there's a basic tension of wanting to put the untrusted content in a different resource

[02:44:00.0000] <abarth>
and needing two network requests to render your document

[02:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the untrusted content could be put in a data: URL! :-)

[02:44:02.0000] <abarth>
if you like

[02:44:03.0000] <abarth>
i wouldn't recommend it

[02:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I wouldn't, either.)

[02:45:01.0000] <abarth>
another option, and this might be crazy,

[02:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if the two resource thing would be enough to stop people actually using this

[02:45:03.0000] <abarth>
:)

[02:45:04.0000] <jgraham>
I mean Facebook or whoever

[02:45:05.0000] <abarth>
is that you could define the parsing so that the entities always got their own text nodes

[02:45:06.0000] <abarth>
and as long as you didn't mutate them

[02:45:07.0000] <abarth>
they'd be "live"

[02:45:08.0000] <abarth>
so when you later encountered an entity

[02:45:09.0000] <abarth>
it would magically fill in those text nodes

[02:46:00.0000] <abarth>
i'm not sure that's a great idea

[02:46:01.0000] <abarth>
but it's a way to make the system lazy instead of synchronous

[02:46:02.0000] <abarth>
in the implementation, you'd keep some sort of hashmap

[02:46:03.0000] <abarth>
to find them

[02:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this morning, I was thinking of arguing for the definite WONTFIXing of the request to support XML external entities in Gecko on the grounds that the combination of the expat API and off-the-main-thread parsing would make it suck even more from impl. POV

[02:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but then I thought there was no point in poking that bug when it's quiet

[02:48:02.0000] <abarth>
jgraham: Facebook will always roll their own whatever

[02:49:00.0000] <abarth>
jgraham: we should be targeting the mid-level authors

[02:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(I intend to put non-chrome XML parsing off the main thread in Gecko when schedule permits)

[02:49:02.0000] <abarth>
we should try that with webkit

[02:49:03.0000] <abarth>
(html parsing that is)

[02:50:00.0000] <abarth>
i worry the context switches are expensive

[02:50:01.0000] <abarth>
but preload scanning definitely should not be on teh main thread :)

[02:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so the proper way to declare the encoding for a UTF-16 text/html document is just by use of the BOM?

[02:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yes

[02:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[02:55:00.0000] <myakura>
"i think we want some kind of templating system" here comes XInclude!

[02:55:01.0000] <myakura>
/me hides

[02:56:00.0000] <abarth>
XInclude?  /me googles

[02:57:00.0000] <abarth>
myakura: yeah, i considered a similar design

[02:57:01.0000] <abarth>
that one seems to make a network request for each variable in the template though

[02:57:02.0000] <abarth>
it seems more suited for processing on the server

[02:57:03.0000] <abarth>
where fetching the resource is fast

[02:58:00.0000] <abarth>
of course, you can fix that by putting all the values in a single resource and then using an element to go get them

[02:58:01.0000] <abarth>
but you still can't use it in attribute values

[02:58:02.0000] <abarth>
<img alt="&$name;'s Profile Picture" src="...">

[02:59:00.0000] <annevk5>
shouldn't the server languages deal with this?

[02:59:01.0000] <abarth>
they try, but they suck

[02:59:02.0000] <annevk5>
like echo_html_string(name)

[03:00:00.0000] <abarth>
the problem is that different contexts need different escaping rules

[03:00:01.0000] <abarth>
for example htmlspecialchars isn't always safe

[03:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
interesting

[03:01:01.0000] <abarth>
<img alt=<?php= htmlspecialchars($name) ?> src="...">

[03:01:02.0000] <abarth>
=> XSS

[03:01:03.0000] <abarth>
<img alt=&$name; src="...">

[03:01:04.0000] <abarth>
=> safe

[03:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I have this problem solved for the UI of validator.nu, but apparently other people aren't so interested in designing the architecture of their UI generation around this constraint

[03:02:01.0000] <annevk5>
abarth, oh like that

[03:02:02.0000] <annevk5>
yeah that's silly

[03:02:03.0000] <annevk5>
I wonder if people generating HTML like that can handle the additional level of abstraction

[03:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
because if they can't this won't help them

[03:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
abarth: is http://trac.webkit.org/export/LATEST/trunk/LayoutTests/fast/tokenizer/write-on-load.html the only test case on the onload topic?

[03:03:02.0000] <abarth>
hsivonen: that's the main one.  i think there might be some other variations

[03:03:03.0000] <abarth>
annevk5: yeah, it needs to be very easy to use

[03:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me notices the XPointer-in-Webkit bug is still alive - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17491 - comment added today

[03:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I'll need to edit that one to make doubleWrite generate "external" scripts instead of inline scripts in order to form my opinion

[03:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: do you guys get requests for XPointer support in Opera?

[03:04:03.0000] <annevk5>
abarth, having the data be in a separate file seems like too much complexity to me

[03:04:04.0000] <abarth>
annevk5: you could imagine a PHP function that registered all the keys in some collection

[03:04:05.0000] <abarth>
and then you could just use the names in that collection without having to jump back into php

[03:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, dunno

[03:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: you were referring to the PageEmitter stuff in the v.nu code?

[03:06:01.0000] <abarth>
annevk5: yeah, having some way of registering the template values inline seems like it would be valuable

[03:06:02.0000] <abarth>
maybe require them to be base64 encoded?

[03:07:00.0000] <abarth>
document.registerEntities("dksflasjdfoifoenaoenae+asvesvesv=")

[03:07:01.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, doesn't seem like it

[03:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yeah

[03:07:03.0000] <abarth>
where's that's that base64 of a JSON blob

[03:10:00.0000] <annevk5>
it seems like too complex for authors to use

[03:10:01.0000] <annevk5>
they would just echo the string instead

[03:10:02.0000] <annevk5>
that's also better supported

[03:10:03.0000] <annevk5>
and if they did think about XSS, they would likely fix their bugs (e.g. add quotes) rather than make it complicated

[03:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/write-on-load.html doesn't look so nice...

[03:11:01.0000] <abarth>
annevk5: yeah, providing a nice fallback in non-supporting browsers is important

[03:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/write-on-load.html shows different results in old Gecko and in Safari

[03:12:01.0000] <abarth>
base64_encode(json_encode($TemplateValues))

[03:12:02.0000] <abarth>
isn't that hard

[03:12:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
anybody have recommendations for an XMPP server (that is, server daemon to run for providing XMPP services)

[03:13:00.0000] <abarth>
where $TemplateValues is a PHP associative array of the template values

[03:13:01.0000] <annevk5>
abarth, but usually it's something like echo htmlspecialchars($_POST["name"])

[03:14:00.0000] <abarth>
right, so that becomes$TemplateValues["name"] = $_POST["name"]

[03:15:00.0000] <abarth>
echo "&$name;"

[03:15:01.0000] <abarth>
...

[03:15:02.0000] <annevk5>
i.e. no need for script to register entities, no need for a fallback script

[03:15:03.0000] <abarth>
yep

[03:15:04.0000] <annevk5>
$TemplateValues is something magic?

[03:15:05.0000] <abarth>
nope, but you can just collect up all the values and register them at some point

[03:17:00.0000] <abarth>
there's another design point

[03:17:01.0000] <abarth>
in which you don't register the templates at all

[03:17:02.0000] <abarth>
but you have a syntax for a self-decoding entity

[03:17:03.0000] <abarth>
&%domicm30j30w0hfw0fh;

[03:17:04.0000] <abarth>
where that just base64 decodes itself

[03:17:05.0000] <annevk5>
that seems far more reasonable

[03:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
tbh

[03:18:01.0000] <annevk5>
s/tbh//

[03:18:02.0000] <annevk5>
/me was honest before too :)

[03:19:00.0000] <abarth>
i appreciate honesty

[03:19:01.0000] <abarth>
both positive and negative feedback is helpful

[03:19:02.0000] <annevk5>
switching from base64_encode() to htmlspecialchars() is something I can see authors doing

[03:20:00.0000] <abarth>
the fallback story isn't great

[03:20:01.0000] <abarth>
unless you do something like UA sniff

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
you can go through the DOM and fix test nodes that contain &%

[03:21:01.0000] <abarth>
that's true

[03:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
would be a rather trivial library

[03:22:01.0000] <abarth>
this proposal is also trivial to implement in a UA

[03:22:02.0000] <annevk5>
&% you mean?

[03:22:03.0000] <abarth>
yeah

[03:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
it seems like the simplest thing that could work addressing the stated problem

[03:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
abarth: is it a goal to make the same syntax work in XHTML5?

[03:23:02.0000] <abarth>
i don't care about XHTML

[03:23:03.0000] <abarth>
if it's easy, then i'd be up for it

[03:23:04.0000] <annevk5>
if you are using XML you cannot use string concat anyway

[03:23:05.0000] <annevk5>
as an author that is

[03:23:06.0000] <annevk5>
so the XSS issues are not the same

[03:24:00.0000] <abarth>
plus, XML has XSLT

[03:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk5: for some definition of "cannot"

[03:24:02.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, simplifying, yes

[03:25:00.0000] <annevk5>
I realize Sam Ruby can, though Philip` found a bug there too :)

[03:27:00.0000] <abarth>
ok, thanks for all your help

[03:27:01.0000] <abarth>
i think it's time for me to sleep on it

Opera 10.50 alpha after self-updating but not to 10.60.something beachballs on http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/write-on-load.html

[03:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
kinda sad that the first-run page in Opera 10.61 shows a youtube video *in Flash*

[03:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(as opposed to WebM)

[03:51:01.0000] <hasather>
hsivonen: it's not really supposed to, I think there was some issue with the Mac version (if you're using that)

[03:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hasather: Mac, yes

[03:53:00.0000] <hasather>
hsivonen: is the issue with  http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/write-on-load.html filed, or should I do it?

[03:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hasather: not filed, so it's ok to file

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hasather: except it doesn't beachball in 10.61 anymore

[03:55:00.0000] <hasather>
hsivonen: ah

https://twitter.com/glazou/status/21942648163 seriously?

[05:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone happen to have correct data about which browsers support <meta http-equiv="pragma" value="no-cache">?

[05:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
hsivonen: Yes.  Seriously.

[05:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
It was after some drinks, but still.

[05:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins_: :-(

[05:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins_: what will we be using instead?

[05:10:00.0000] <annevk5>
nothing to get upset about really

Bert Bos just has a different world view

[05:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222 is blank. I wonder what the latest securit update is about

[05:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I hope it's about making the macports boost build faster

[05:14:00.0000] <Rik`>
hsivonen: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4312

[05:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik`: thanks

[05:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
because I am trying to installed boost now and it's taking forever

[05:15:00.0000] <Rik`>
it seems there is the same PDF fix as iOS

[05:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if OS X 10.4.x has the same hole...

[05:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
hsivonen: Yeah, bert just lives in a different world.

[05:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Sounds like you don't want to be using a system where all development library packages have to be compiled from source

[05:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: You should try Windows, or Ubuntu

[05:16:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm just curious what people use instead of browsers in that world

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. my OS X session has gone crazy in such a way that it no longer reads new hi-res icons

[05:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I like this system well enough, it just need to response better when I press the "Compile faster" button a bunch of times

[05:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
all newly launched apps have fuzzy icons in cmd-tab

[05:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: a mystery of that world is revealed in http://twitter.com/glazou/status/21942696879

[05:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
dunno how you missed that one

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: by working instead of reading every tweet. thanks.

[05:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[05:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's the problem with working

[05:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>

[05:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe the "Compile faster" button on my keyboard is broken or something

[05:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dear lazy irc: I have a directory full of files checked into SVN. I would like to produce a diff containing all the contents of all the files that are actually in SVN i.e. what you might have thought that svn diff -r revision_before_directory_was_created:HEAD would produce

[05:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
Needless to say this does not actually work because svn is lame

[05:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Is there any way to do this that will not cause me to want to stab my own eyes out

[05:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
(hint: having to write a script to do this will cause me to want to stab my own eyes out)

[05:24:02.0000] <jcranmer>
generate a list of all files, exclude those not found in the svn repository, and then concatenate those?

[05:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
jcranmer: That sounds plausible, if I can make diff get the base path right for files in subdirectories

[05:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
It also sounds like I need to write a script

[05:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which I was trying to avoid

[05:27:02.0000] <jcranmer>
if you want a diff of the new files

[05:27:03.0000] <jcranmer>
well

[05:27:04.0000] <jcranmer>
why not clone the svn into a new directory, say /tmp/svnsucks

[05:27:05.0000] <jcranmer>
and then make the diff from that ?

[05:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
You mean checkout into a new directory?

[05:29:01.0000] <jcranmer>
yes

[05:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
mkdir /tmp/empty; diff -rN /tmp/empty .

[05:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
perhaps?

[05:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
after doing an svn export to get a clean copy of the files without .svn directories

[05:33:03.0000] <Rik`>
jgraham: you're diff will only have + lines, no ?

[05:35:00.0000] <annevk5>
hmm

[05:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Rik`: Yes

[05:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Something like that seems like it is mostly good enough

[05:39:01.0000] <Rik`>
can't you use the standard diff between your directory and an empty one ?

[05:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Rik`: That seems to be the approach that I am taking (see e.g. what Philip` wrote above)

[05:40:01.0000] <Rik`>
oh yeah, sorry :)

[06:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
WebKit's HTMLElement::deprecatedCreateContextualFragment is interesting

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
doesn't HTML5 allow innerHTML to be set on any HTML element?

[06:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is the HTML5 parser supposed to be in the Chrome dev channel?

[06:34:00.0000] <Peter`>
The tokenizer is/was, tree builder seems to be in nightlies

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nightlies != dev channel?

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone happen to know if Outlook Web Access works in WebKit-based browsers?

[06:37:00.0000] <Peter`>
No, dev channel are weekly, human-tested builds

[06:37:01.0000] <Peter`>
Google Canary is more like nighlies, updates several times a week but won't be tested by humans

[06:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Peter`: oh. how do I get a real nigthly update channel?

[06:37:03.0000] <Peter`>
though is branded as well. Real nightlies are Chromium, there's no auto-updater for that

[06:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that's inconvenient

[06:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so WebKit nightlies seem to have the HTML5 tree builder for document.open/write

[06:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but do WebKit nightlies use it for createContextualFragment or innerHTML, yet?

[06:40:00.0000] <Peter`>
abarth and eseidel are progressively removing the old parser

[06:40:01.0000] <Peter`>
for the tree builder I think it's likely, but am not sure

[06:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
abarth|zZz: when createContextualFragment is called in WebKit with html as the context node, does WebKit behave as if the context node had been body accidentally or intentionally?

[06:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can anyone from Opera disclose whether Opera considers it a bug that createContextualFragment with html as the context doesn't behave as if the context had been body instead?

[06:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders how up to date the ubuntu PPA for chromium is

[06:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, in Opera, the body element (but not head!) is implicitly created

[06:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm pretty sure that the original Gecko behavior was an accident

[06:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(behaving as if the context had been body when it is html)

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but now I can't tell if WebKit had the same accident or carefully cloned that quirk on purpose

[06:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and whether Opera is aware of imprecise cloning and whether that's considered a bug or not

[06:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'm trying to figure out if the quirk should go away in Gecko or if it should become a permanent part of "correct" createContextualFragment behavior)

[06:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Does Outlook Web Access work in Opera?

[06:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like IE9 PP doesn't have DOM Ranges

[07:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: No idea

[07:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: ok

[07:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=5296&to=5297 is stable

[07:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or if this stuff is gonna change tomorrow again

[07:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
What's the rev that fixed http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8966?

[07:30:00.0000] <jorlow>
any webIDL experts here?

[07:31:00.0000] <jorlow>
I have an interface that has methods that I want to be accessible from the interface object

[07:31:01.0000] <jorlow>
but I can't figure out how to spec such a thing

[07:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
jorlow: Like MyInterfaceObject.foo()

[07:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
?

[07:36:02.0000] <jorlow>
yes

[07:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm

[07:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
I can look of course

[07:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
But I don't know

[07:37:03.0000] <jorlow>
do you know where to look?

[07:37:04.0000] <jorlow>
i've spent some time trying to understand what the WebIDL spec has to say on the matter

[07:37:05.0000] <jorlow>
but have gotten no where

[07:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Not really, I find WebIDL pretty impeneterable

[07:40:00.0000] <cheeser>
what is webidl for?  i can't get corba out of my head when i see that

[07:40:01.0000] <jorlow>
glad i'm not the only one  :-)

[07:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
cheeser: it's supposed to be a nice shorthand for saying which ones of the many JS API behavior patterns are required for a given API

[07:44:00.0000] <cheeser>
oh...  ugh.

[07:45:00.0000] <cheeser>
so basically it allows an api to define which js spec version it supports?

[07:45:01.0000] <cheeser>
or do you mean it can speciy things like jquery or prototype?

[07:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
cheeser: No, it is just a convenient way of saying how host objects map to js

[07:45:03.0000] <cheeser>
oh, i see.

[07:45:04.0000] <cheeser>
like the idl of old  :)

[07:45:05.0000] <jgraham>
Just like that

[07:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
But more "web"

[07:46:01.0000] <cheeser>
i just died a little inside  ;)

[07:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
cheeser: it's for saying stuff like whether a given argument behaves as "", "null" or null if you pass something that's null-ish

[07:46:03.0000] <cheeser>
/me nods.

[07:46:04.0000] <jgraham>
Where "web" in this case is a shorthand for "having a bunch of confusing special cases that no sane person would ever design"

[07:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
jorlow: I don't see any way to do what you are trying to do

[07:47:01.0000] <jorlow>
jgraham: thanks for looking

[07:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
Nor can I think of any precedent in DOM

[07:47:03.0000] <jorlow>
me neither

[07:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
So maybe you should want to do something different :)

[07:48:01.0000] <jorlow>
agreed

[07:48:02.0000] <jorlow>
in case you're wondering, the reason I'm asking is this: http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#idl-def-IDBKeyRange

[07:49:00.0000] <jorlow>
as specced, the methods at the end can't be used

[07:51:00.0000] <kkaefer>
is this a place to ask canvas questions?

[07:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
kkaefer: Possibly

[07:53:01.0000] <kkaefer>
heh, okay :)

[07:53:02.0000] <kkaefer>
has anyone figured out a way to inverse the clip() mask?

[07:53:03.0000] <kkaefer>
i.e. so that the contents /outside/ of the mask are drawn but not the one within the clip() path?

[07:55:00.0000] <kkaefer>
I know that drawing it on a separate canvas, then using destination-out and copying over the result is an option too

[07:55:01.0000] <kkaefer>
but I don't want to create separate canvases all the time

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
kkaefer: You could try to invert the area contained within the path

[07:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
like have a clockwise shape then add a large anticlockwise square around it, so that the region between the two shapes is the inside

[07:59:00.0000] <kkaefer>
ah, interesting idea

[07:59:01.0000] <kkaefer>
let me try that

[08:00:00.0000] <kkaefer>
yeah, that seems to work

[08:01:00.0000] <kkaefer>
so I only have to have the dimensions of the anticlockwise shape outside of the canvas

[08:01:01.0000] <kkaefer>
so that when I stroke, the stroke doesn't appear inside the canvas

[08:01:02.0000] <kkaefer>
Philip`: thanks

[08:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hrm. twitter's widget JS supports transitions only with the -webkit- prefix. :-(

[08:36:00.0000] <Rik`>
hsivonen: hopefully, it's hosted on their servers, so fixable

[08:38:00.0000] <Rik`>
hsivonen: hmm, what widget JS do you mean ?

[08:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://widgets.twimg.com/j/2/widget.js

[08:40:00.0000] <Rik`>
where is it used?

[08:40:01.0000] <kkaefer>
Philip`: hm, while the anticlockwise shape is interesting, it doesn't work in all cases; e.g. when using drop shadows, the drop shadows are inverted to

[08:40:02.0000] <kkaefer>
my goal is to draw "knockout" dropshadows

[08:41:00.0000] <kkaefer>
e.g. when you have a transparent shape, you don't want to have the shadow behind the shape, just around it

[08:41:01.0000] <kkaefer>
so I'm trying to just draw the shadow, minus the shape

[08:43:00.0000] <kkaefer>
http://i.kkaefer.com/canvas-20100825-174900.png

[08:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik`: seen at http://uglyducklinghouse.blogspot.com/

[08:46:01.0000] <kkaefer>
problem is when I set the fill color to transparent, it doesn't draw a dropshadow either

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
kkaefer: Can you draw the anticlockwise+shape path, call clip(), then beginPath() and draw the original path and fill() with shadows?

[08:54:00.0000] <kkaefer>
Philip`: whoa, that did the trick

[08:54:01.0000] <kkaefer>
thanks

[09:06:00.0000] <kkaefer>
however, it doesn't seem to properly reset when calling beginPath() after that

[09:06:01.0000] <kkaefer>
.save()/.restore() helps, though

[09:11:00.0000] <kkaefer>
dang, it draws the shadow twice :/

[12:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: http://www.w3.org/mid/20100825200142793866.be0be8e7⊙xn is another report on the ease of use of the rel registry, effectively

[12:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I get an error message.

[12:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i finally got a reply from microsoft

[12:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
they intend to completely violate HTTP and just completely ignore the MIME type for <video>

[12:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i guess we know where they stand on standards compliance

[12:08:00.0000] <theMadness>
I'm only 27, I shouldn't be so jaded, but i kinda expected it.

[12:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Isn't that what everyone does for images already, for example?

[12:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[12:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
but microsoft were on a "honour mime types" kick recently

[12:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
so there was still hope

[12:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
now the question is can i hold the other browsers back, or should i just give up and make <video> sniff for everything

[12:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
and if the latter, can i get something specced that says how to recognise the video types

[12:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I thought we concluded that honoring MIME types for video was only useful for theoretical purity anyway.

[12:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
and can we get WebM changed to lost its leading ASCII nonsense (matroska would be a lost cause presumably)

[12:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
to lose, rather

[12:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it's useful for avoiding tons of network wastage

[12:10:01.0000] <micheil>
btw, Hixie, not sure if I mentioned it, but I got TLS/SSL websockets working

[12:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
since you don't have to download the bytes if you know the type is one you don't support

[12:10:03.0000] <micheil>
so, wss://

[12:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
micheil: cool

[12:10:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Everyone is still honoring <source type="">, no?

[12:10:06.0000] <Hixie>
haven't checked that

[12:10:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Once you can read the MIME type from the network, you can already read the first handful of bytes anyway.

[12:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless you send a separate HEAD, which is a waste of a round trip.

[12:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No?

[12:12:00.0000] <theMadness>
Some UA do that tho.

[12:12:01.0000] <theMadness>
Iinm proxies too.

[12:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone wants to test whether browsers (and IE9 in particular) honour <Source type>, that wouldn't be a bad thing to test

[12:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i might test it when i get back

[12:14:00.0000] <Hixie>

"As you all know, MathML is a part of HTML5"

[12:21:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me didn't

One might joke that is anything exists, it's part of HTML5 :P

http://ismathml.partofhtml5.com/

[12:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://ishtml5.partofhtml5.com/ - how rude :-(

[12:31:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me wasn't surprised by Philip` trying that

[12:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://istheblinktag.partofhtml5.com/ seems buggy in Opera - the blink speed is irregular, and sometimes it mispaints the text shadow

[12:34:00.0000] <matjas>
Philip` Opera designed it to resemble the rhythm of your ♥

[12:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ms2ger, it should be extremely unsurprising, since he probably went to partofhtml5.com directly and then followed all the links, as I did.  :)

[12:36:01.0000] <miketaylr>
oh dear, i swear i didn't make that first link :/

[12:36:02.0000] <miketaylr>
/me blames Alex

[12:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Actually I went to ishtml5 first by guessing the URL :-)

[12:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Good job, then.

[12:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
and only saw the list after that

[12:41:00.0000] <chronossc>
html5 have some kind of stuff to auto numerate as chapters nested lists, ex, li = 2, nested li = 2.1, etc

[12:41:01.0000] <chronossc>
?

[12:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's CSS.

[12:41:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
CSS defines such things, I think, but I don't know if they work yet.

[12:42:00.0000] <chronossc>
hm

[12:42:01.0000] <chronossc>
k

[12:42:02.0000] <hdhoang>
there are no list-style like that, but css generated content should work

[12:43:00.0000] <chronossc>
I think that I found some example here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2729927/number-nested-ordered-lists-in-html

[12:45:00.0000] <chronossc>
ouch, works perfectly

[12:45:01.0000] <chronossc>
thx people

118.132.82.38 has spent days requesting files from hixie.ch with an IE9 previous build

[13:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
presumably microsoft's chinese testing subsidiary

[13:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
7 of my apache instances have been running for days and have so far sent over 180,000 files from this directory: http://hiixe.ch/tests/evil/page-loading/alternative-content/investigation/

[13:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
makes you wonder about the competence of their testing

[13:08:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
/me bets it wasn't from hiixe.ch

[13:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
er yeah, typo

[13:09:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
That would be particularly incompetent

[14:53:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, since pushState doesn't cause a history traversal, there's no language saying that the UA should save the scroll position of the previous history entry.

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: is this a problem?

[14:55:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, well...inasmuch as the UA can do whatever it wants with the scroll position, it's not a problem.  But maybe it should be there, since it merits being mentioned in the history traversal algorithm.

[14:56:00.0000] <jlebar>
At least, I forgot to do it when I implemented pushState.  :)

[14:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, should the state be saved?

[14:56:02.0000] <jlebar>
Oh, I think so.

[14:56:03.0000] <jlebar>
Say you scroll down, pushState, scroll around, and then go back.  Shouldn't you get the old scroll position back?

[14:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno

[14:57:01.0000] <jlebar>
Well, it's still broken even if you don't think so:

[14:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
most apps i can imagine using pushState() would either not have any scroll position or would change the page so much on popstate that it'd be academic

[14:58:00.0000] <jlebar>
Suppose you scroll down, pushState, then go visit some other page entirely.  Then you go back to the first history entry.  We should restore your scroll position, but we never saved it!

[14:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, good point

[14:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
can you file a bug or send mail?

[14:59:01.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, sure thing.

[14:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
ta

[15:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, createContextualFragment is something we copied from Gecko

[15:14:01.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, we did not want to have it

[15:14:02.0000] <annevk5>
hsivonen, so if Gecko changes it we can change it too

[15:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
ah, finally someone registered ispartofhtml5.com

[15:18:00.0000] <hober>

[15:20:02.0000] <annevk5>
I wish it was not there :)

[15:20:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: Isn't Base64 limited to ASCII?

[15:20:04.0000] <annevk5>
abarth, I kind of like this new entity thing now, btw

[15:21:00.0000] <abarth>
annevk5: cool

[15:21:01.0000] <abarth>
GPHemsley: the output is binary.  we're going to need to translate it to characters

[15:21:02.0000] <abarth>
GPHemsley: probably as UTF8

[15:21:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
I meant input

[15:22:00.0000] <abarth>
the input language is A-Za-Z0-0

[15:22:01.0000] <abarth>
plus a few random characters

[15:22:02.0000] <abarth>
                if (!isBase64Character(cc))

[15:22:03.0000] <abarth>
                    break;

[15:22:04.0000] <abarth>
                char codeLetter = static_cast<char>(cc);

[15:22:05.0000] <abarth>
where cc is UTF16

[15:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
GPHemsley, per the PHP manual it should work fine for arbitrary octets

[15:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
in fact "This encoding is designed to make binary data survive transport through transport layers that are not 8-bit clean, such as mail bodies."

[15:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
base64 encoding is binary -> text, decoding is text -> binary

[15:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
so it can carry anything

[15:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
we just have to define the encoding

[15:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
(presumably utf-8)

[15:25:02.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, utf-8, anything else is not really acceptable

[15:25:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
oh

[15:26:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
so you can encode anything with base64?

[15:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah

[15:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[15:27:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
I don't know where my head was at

[15:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
probably left it with your sense of logic, by the door!

[15:27:05.0000] <GPHemsley>
(somewhere where base64 is also smaller than its source)

[15:27:06.0000] <Hixie>
:-D

Only boring people need to break the rules to have fun

[15:31:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me likes Workshiva

[15:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I just break the rules to escape the norm and make people feel uneasy

[15:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Being like everyone else is boring.

[15:32:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
the rules were made for a reason

[15:32:02.0000] <annevk5>
this is too ;p

[15:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
GPHemsley: To be broken. ;P

[15:33:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
meh

/me tries to think of a rule gsnedders has broken

[15:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me fails

[15:35:02.0000] <jgraham>
Wait

[15:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Because I'm so perfect?

[15:35:04.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe "don't lie" is a rule

[15:35:05.0000] <jgraham>
But he is lying aout breaking rules

[15:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
He is a paradoxical rule breaker!

[15:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I thought I'd at least broken your rules. E.g., no metal.

[15:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(as in the music genre)

[15:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
No that is just violting the boundaries of good taste

Hixie: should a media element delay the load event when it is not in a document?

[15:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: btw re http://people.mozilla.org/~jlebar/respkg/ you can use "the document's address", pushState() doesn't change that (it changes "the document's current address")

[15:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: per spec, yes

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: i think this makes sense; in particular, images do the same thing iirc

[15:48:01.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, I'll fix that.  Thanks.

jlebar: any news on that btw? i'm just looking at it now, would love to hear any experience you've had with it.

[15:50:00.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, well, I'm waiting on someone here to do the incremental zip extraction part.  I've been hearing it's coming Real Soon Now for a bit longer than I'd like.

[15:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i know the feeling

[15:50:02.0000] <jlebar>
Hixie, :)  My rough, unscientific tests gave pretty positive results.  But what I'm really interested is seeing whether people can get a speedup on their real pages.

[15:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[15:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i love the detailed spec

[15:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
makes a refreshing change to see someone be as detailed! :-)

[15:52:00.0000] <jlebar>
Thanks!

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
jlebar: heh, you used the html5 "library" :-)

[15:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
dbaron posted substantive feedback to public-html.  Will you catch that, Hixie, or do we need to tell people not to use public-html for that?

[15:53:01.0000] <jlebar>
lol, I guess so!

[15:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: i'll see it

[15:53:03.0000] <AryehGregor>

[18:51:00.0000] <mihaip>
Hixie: what happens to the pending state object if I call replaceState or pushState before onload fires?

[19:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
mihaip: is the spec ambiguous?

[19:44:00.0000] <mihaip>
Hixie: the spec doesn't say anything about the interaction of replaceState with the pending state object

[19:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems like it would have no effect then

[19:44:02.0000] <mihaip>
Hixie: so a strict reading would be that pending state object is unaffected by replaceState

[19:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
a strict reading is the only valid reading :-)

[19:45:00.0000] <mihaip>
Hixie: so if you call replaceState("foo") before onload, you would still get a popstate event with null state right after onload

[19:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
per the spec, seems that way

[19:45:02.0000] <mihaip>
Hixie: but then if you call pushState("bar") and then history.back() you would get a popstate event with with "foo"?

[19:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand the order of operations in your scenario

[19:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
replaceState('foo'), then onload, then popstate, then pushState('bar') then history.back()?

[19:46:02.0000] <mihaip>
yes

[19:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess so

[19:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd have to look at the spec to tell you for sure

[21:56:00.0000] <roc>
"Extending the border-collapse property to all elements"    NOOOOO RUN RUN RUN DIE

[23:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
can someone with IE (ideally 9 but any version will do) tell me if <body bgcolor=" red"> is a black page or a red page?

[23:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
(or a lime green page)

[23:45:00.0000] <paul_irish>
Hixie: ie6, ie8, ie9pp4: lime green.

[23:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
paul_irish: thanks

[23:46:01.0000] <paul_irish>
Hixie: how'd you know it'd be lime?

[23:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's the result of running the crazy color algorithm on "xxed"

[23:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
does it at least go red for bgcolor=red?

[23:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
no need to test more than one

[23:48:00.0000] <paul_irish>
yes.

[23:48:01.0000] <paul_irish>
red

[23:49:00.0000] <Hixie>

[01:03:00.0000] <annevk>
http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-writer.html seems more up to date

[01:04:00.0000] <annevk>
http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-dir-sys.html likewise

[01:04:01.0000] <annevk>
also confusing some of this is developed at DAP and some at WebApps

This makes me sad: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/group/track/issues/67 (that it still isn't considered over)

[01:34:00.0000] <annevk>
the TAG should get someone with web developer experience

[01:34:01.0000] <annevk>
and maybe someone with browser QA experience

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
too bad the settlers believed in namespaces. all this confusion about Cambridge now...

[05:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's fine when they used an explicit prefix, like "New"

[05:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's just the default namespace that's a pain

[05:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>

H264 will remain free for internet video for the rest of the codec's lifetime

[06:44:01.0000] <Workshiva>
This will be interesting

[06:45:00.0000] <Peter`>
I concur, wondering what Mozilla's stance on it will be

[06:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
free for the server operator to serve the bits over HTTP, that is

[06:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
not free for browsers or for encoders

[06:45:03.0000] <hsivonen>
not free for sites that have video behind paid login

[06:47:00.0000] <annevk>
are they afraid of something?

[06:47:01.0000] <annevk>
I wonder why they announced that

[06:47:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Maybe because they want h264 to become the most popular codec?

[06:49:00.0000] <Rik`>
Workshiva: will that achieve anything?

[06:49:01.0000] <daedb>
Isn't it already the most popular?

[06:49:02.0000] <Workshiva>
Rik`: It will prevent other codecs from becoming popular, which makes them a lesser threat against h264's other areas of use

[06:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik`: they could extract money from encoder and decoder vendors while the people who make it popular think it's Not Their Problem

[06:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>

ooh. more test cases in html5lib

[07:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tests21.dat is in a bogus format...

[07:23:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I think jgraham introduced something new

[07:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: the file lacks "| " at the start of the tree data lines

[07:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'll add what's missing

[07:27:00.0000] <annevk>
who added that?

[07:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
since it's not cool to make a trivial change to the test format when the trivial change would require revising a non-trivial number of test harnesses

[07:27:02.0000] <annevk>
uhuh

[07:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: it seems to me that jgraham added it

[09:08:00.0000] <kkaefer>
does anyone have an idea how to find out whether a path is clockwise or counterclockwise?

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
kkaefer: What kind of input do you have?

[09:10:01.0000] <kkaefer>
the path is the active path on the canvas

[09:10:02.0000] <kkaefer>
s/active/current/

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you had a list of line segments that made a simple polygon then you can do lots of things like summing the turn angles at each vertex

[09:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
In general a path might not be either clockwise or anticlockwise (e.g. it could be both)

[09:14:00.0000] <kkaefer>
true

[09:14:01.0000] <kkaefer>
hm

[09:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Also it could clockwise but wind around twice)

[09:14:03.0000] <kkaefer>
what I'm trying to do is to draw an inset shadow

[09:15:00.0000] <kkaefer>
so what I'm doing is to draw the path, add a large rectangle around it, to invert the shape

[09:15:01.0000] <kkaefer>
clip() and fill()

[09:15:02.0000] <kkaefer>
which works just fine for simple shapes like circles and rectangles

[09:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yeah, if you want arbitrarily complex paths then that's not going to work

[09:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you have two circles, one clockwise (winding number +1) and one anticlockwise (winding number -1), you can never add a constant amount to the winding number (by drawing a rectangle around the shapes) to make them both 0 (hence not-filled)

[09:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be more feasible if we had even/odd fill rules instead of just non-zero-winding-number

[09:21:00.0000] <kkaefer>
yep

[09:44:00.0000] <kkaefer>

H.264 news is interesting

but aren't a lot of the patents going to start expiring after 2015 anyway?

[10:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, wondering if anybody has a 10-20 on Maciej

Philip`, are people really still replying to him?

[10:09:00.0000] <annevk>
he is

[10:19:00.0000] <User>
So as I understand, it is possible specify a font file in CSS, but it can't be use with Canvas.strokeText and Canvas.font

[10:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
That should be possible

[10:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Using it with canvas, I mean)

[10:21:00.0000] <User>
I saw scripts that convert the glyphs into JS files and then redraw them in Canvas, and something like ctx.font="url(myfontfile.otf)" triggers an error

[10:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
ctx.font has to be a font face name, not a URL

[10:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
so you have to use @font-face to load the URL first

[10:23:01.0000] <User>
and canvas would use it ?

[10:23:02.0000] <annevk>
XHR test suite is public at last

[10:23:03.0000] <annevk>
http://tc.labs.opera.com/apis/XMLHttpRequest/

[10:24:00.0000] <User>
ah ok, I think I got it

[10:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
User: It should work like http://philip.html5.org/tests/canvas/suite/tests/2d.text.draw.fontface.html

[10:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
using @font-face and then ctx.font = "TheFamilyNameYouDefined"

[10:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though you need to be careful to make sure the browser has finished loading the font first)

[10:31:00.0000] <User>
I understand how it should work now... but no luck yet. Always the same error when the script runs. And the font file is on local directory, so loading time shouldn't be a problem now.

[10:35:00.0000] <User>
The font works appears well in a paragraph with the font-family attribute, but not on the canvas with ctx.font

[10:42:00.0000] <User>
It works with font-family set on canvas, so I consider it a bug. There should be an attribute ctx.fontFamily to set the font family at the level of the context

[10:43:00.0000] <User>
actually it works only if the size is specified

[10:43:01.0000] <User>
so it works now... sort of

[11:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This looks very interesting: http://tcpcrypt.org/tcpcrypt.pdf

[11:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
can anybody suggest a Node framework that you've tried out and can recommend?

[11:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean, e.g., express or geddy or .../

[11:36:02.0000] <micheil>
umm..

[11:37:00.0000] <micheil>
I've looked at each, Express is nice, Connect is more config, geddy was okay, Fab looks nice, but it confused me a be

[11:37:01.0000] <micheil>
*bit

[11:37:02.0000] <micheil>
I'd probably go for Express.

[11:37:03.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: you should really ask in #node.js

[11:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
micheil: OK

[11:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[11:38:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
fwiw, I have been trying out express a bit

[11:38:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
already

[11:38:04.0000] <micheil>
TJ has a few screencasts up too

[11:38:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
TJ?

[11:39:01.0000] <micheil>
the maintainer

[11:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm trying figure out how closely express is bound to haml

[11:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., can I just use HTML source instead

[11:44:00.0000] <micheil>
express isn't bound to HAML, iirc.

[11:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[11:45:00.0000] <micheil>
http://expressjs.com/guide.html#View-Rendering

[11:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me reads

[11:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah good

[11:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I see mention of Jade there, and now I'm just looking at Jade for the first time

[11:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I see this: http://jade-lang.com/

[11:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and my reaction is, why/

[11:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
*why?

[11:49:00.0000] <micheil>
because it's better then haml?

[11:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[11:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, that's pretty easy to do

[11:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I meant, why not just write it HTML to begin with?

[11:50:01.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: good luck with writing a tool like jade then :P

[11:50:02.0000] <micheil>
because you don't want to close tags and whatever else

[11:50:03.0000] <micheil>
and you want to have access to JS functions in your html

[11:50:04.0000] <micheil>
like, for loops, etc

[11:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think EJS looks more like what I'd personally prefer

[11:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I do understand why people prefer haml and the haml-like approach, though

[11:53:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't belittle it

[11:53:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't mean to belittle it

[11:54:00.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: personally I'm use Jade in a client project, as they were already using haml, but haml had heaps of errors in the browser

[11:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[11:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
it does seem like a more error-prone approach

[11:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
more processing just to produce the actual HTML, more possible points of failure

[11:55:01.0000] <micheil>
true, but it's simpler for some reason

[12:04:00.0000] <jgornick>
MikeSmith: I agree with you

[12:04:01.0000] <jgornick>
Give me a compelling reason why I need to use something like that to produce the same markup I can already easily write.

[12:05:00.0000] <jgornick>
"something" is like Haml, Jade, Sass, etc...

[12:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgornick: Because you want to make it much harder to debug, by breaking the direct mapping between source code and output

[12:07:01.0000] <micheil>
jgornick: it's just quicker

[12:07:02.0000] <micheil>
harder to debug, yes

[12:07:03.0000] <micheil>
but it's still quicker to write

[12:08:00.0000] <jgornick>
micheil: If you are a pro at writing HTML and CSS, then it should be no quicker.

[12:08:01.0000] <micheil>
it actually is

[12:08:02.0000] <jgornick>
micheil: If you aren't a pro, then you should continue to learn/use HTML and CSS.

[12:08:03.0000] <micheil>
especially for something like SASS

[12:08:04.0000] <micheil>
which is for CSS

[12:08:05.0000] <micheil>
no {} or ;

[12:09:00.0000] <micheil>
nested selectors, meaning you don't repeat the nesting

[12:09:01.0000] <jgornick>
micheil: So, now I have to learn new syntaxes for something that is already easy?

[12:09:02.0000] <micheil>
jgornick: you don't have to, it's purely optional, some just find it easier to use new syntaxes

[12:10:00.0000] <jgornick>
micheil: Here's the thing, if everyone in your group/project is using it, then great.  If not, no go.

[12:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://github.com/cramforce/node-asyncEJS#readme is interesting

[12:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g.,     <h1><%? setTimeout(function () { res.print("Async Header"); res.finish(); }, 2000)  %></h1>

[12:10:03.0000] <micheil>
jgornick: exactly.

[12:11:00.0000] <micheil>
in said project of mine, we were already using haml-js, but it had a heap of errors, and the author suggested we move to jade, so we did

[12:12:00.0000] <jgornick>
micheil: For me, in terms of SASS, CSS is not meant to be compiled, it's not a scripting language and once Eric Meyer (the real Eric Meyer) starts presenting it and using it, I'll maybe consider using it.

[12:12:01.0000] <micheil>
jgornick: I couldn't care who's using it, if it makes my job a tiny bit easier, I'm all for it.

[12:12:02.0000] <micheil>
which, overall, it does.

[12:14:00.0000] <micheil>
jgornick: just sorta for my background on it: http://brandedcode.com/journal/2009/05/20/why-not-just-compile-your-css.html

[12:15:00.0000] <micheil>
anyway, I'm off.

h.264 is now permanently royalty free for internet streaming sites. http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2010/08/mpeg-la-counters-google-webm-with-permanent-royalty-moratorium.ars

[12:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But browsers would still have to pay royalties?

[12:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[12:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then that doesn't really change anything, does it?

[12:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
(At least that's what hsivonen said)

[12:46:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, it's only for web sites

[12:46:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Most websites weren't really expecting to pay anything anyway.

[12:46:05.0000] <crash\>
AryehGregor: only eyewashing

[12:46:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
What?

[12:46:07.0000] <cheeser>
software patents--

[12:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
previously, they had announced that it would be royalty free until 2015, at which point they would review the issue again.

[12:47:01.0000] <cheeser>
only a fool would take them up on that offer.

[12:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Um.

[12:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyone who did take them up on that offer was just proven completely correct, weren't they?

[12:48:01.0000] <cheeser>
"use it for free until you're absolutely dependent on it, then we'll put you over a barrel."

[12:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hard to call them foolish.

[12:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like the only real difference is that people can no longer use the argument "you can use H.264 on your site for free now, but there's a bit of uncertainty five years from now, and you can avoid that uncertainty by using [some other codec]"

[12:48:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
so this timely news story is about something that will not make any difference at all to anybody until after 2015

[12:48:05.0000] <Lachy>
so it would mean that sites like vimeo and dailymotion who stream h.264 content, and who AFAIK, have no reason to pay the royalties themselves, won't have to pay up in the future.

[12:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think it's probably more correct to say that people who were worried about the 2015 thing turned out to be paranoid, rather than the unworried people being foolish.

[12:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
By 2015 it should be pretty easy to switch to WebM, anyway.  I mean, Flash is supporting it, so even if you can't use HTML5 for all users, you can use WebM in Flash rather than H.264 in Flash.

[12:50:00.0000] <cheeser>
unless you're on an apple device

[12:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So the threat of the 2015 royalties became kind of empty with the WebM launch.  Which I guess is why they dropped it.

[12:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
well, it means that the previous arguments I've read about not supporting h.264 using codecs available on the platform based on the future threat of royalties for websites are now defeated.

[12:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess.

[12:51:01.0000] <cheeser>
/me cancels his questions and goes to rtfa

[12:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's pretty brief.

[12:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
We said everything substantive in it already.

[12:51:04.0000] <cheeser>
right.  "free to view" but not "free to produce"

[12:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
but it was inevitable that this would be the result because such royalties were not in the MPEGLA's best interest anyway

[12:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
They would be if it had no credible competition.

[12:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, it would only impose them on sites that could pay.

[12:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
cheeser, yeah, content producers are still technically subject to the licence issue whereby owning the software that produces h.264 doesn't give you the right to produce it for commercial purposes.

[12:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Now we just need Microsoft to fully jump on the WebM bandwagon.  I can't see Apple remaining sole holdout for long.

[12:53:02.0000] <cheeser>
one shouldn't have to pay to use standards like that.

[12:53:03.0000] <cheeser>
and they certainly shouldn't be codified into open standards such as html

[12:54:00.0000] <cheeser>
but then i think all software patents should be stripped.

[12:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
we had that discussion with some Microsoft and Apple reps who were in Norway for the CSS WG meeting, and it still seems as though they're not going to do it.

[12:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
No one was suggesting that H.264 be required by HTML5.  That would contradict the W3C's position on RF patents, for one thing.

[12:54:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Blargh.

[12:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
but that was just informal discussions at the pub, so nothing they said was official in any way

[12:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But you don't really know what they're going to do, because their lawyers will say nothing until the last second.

[12:55:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, you were talking to developers, right?  They aren't the ones making the decision.

[12:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders why Google can't work out some type of indemnification agreement with MS and Apple . . . surely that doesn't increase their risk much given how much WebM they ship anyway?

[12:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me also wonders why the patent license doesn't cover reimplementations or modified versions.  Whatever happened to being against field-of-use restrictions?

[12:56:02.0000] <Rik`>
Lachy: we also need hardware decoding

[13:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
Rik`, yes, but hopefully that will come soon enough, given that there are many hardware vendors in the list of webm supporters

[13:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
but do you reckon having webm decoding in hardware will increase the chance of Microsoft or Apple supporting it?

[13:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't see why, for the desktop.

[13:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can see why it would encourage support for mobile devices.

[13:41:00.0000] <Rik`>
Lachy: Safari and IE have hardware decoding for H264, there's no chance they gonna switch to webm without it

[13:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's not a matter of switching, it's a matter of supporting.

[13:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Authors can decide which format to use based on availability of hardware encoding, among other factors.

[13:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Decoding.

[13:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Whatever.

[13:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
On typical desktops, WebM should decode fast enough in software for most uses, at least for now.

[13:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, unfortunately, software decoding of 720p and 1080p webm is not very performant

[13:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yet?  :)

[13:54:01.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: that's not how Apple sees it. Either it's good enough to ship or they don't ship

[13:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.  Clearly it will take a few years.

[13:54:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, so would they refuse to render GIFs because PNG provides superior compression?

[13:54:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Kind of stupid example, because obviously you have to support GIF.

[13:54:05.0000] <Rik`>
compression is not a matter of end user

[13:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I'm really quite sure this is largely a legal issue, not a technical issue.

[13:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, Steve Jobs Himself has pretty much said so.

[13:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
Rik`, it seems likely that hardware with WebM decoding could start appearing in computers since AMD and nVidia are in the supporter list. So Apple could potentially include the necessary hardware in future Macs, as could PC vendors

[13:58:00.0000] <Rik`>
Lachy: yeah and I hope so

[13:58:01.0000] <Rik`>
but until there's something concrete, they won't

[13:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I really don't think hardware support is a blocker for Safari WebM support.

[13:58:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I have heard that WebM's design is not friendly to hardware decoding

[13:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Shall we try to badger a statement beyond "No comment" from some friendly Safari dev?  :)

[13:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, speak of the devil!

[13:59:02.0000] <Lachy>
after that, it's really just the legal risk of proceeding with it. But I'm reasonably confident that the WebM supporters would have a wide range of defensive patents to fend off any challenges from the MPEGLA.

[13:59:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that being said, I'm sure QuickTime ships with some codecs that decode purely in software

[13:59:04.0000] <Lachy>
so the real risk is just patent trolls

[13:59:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, if you can comment, do you think that Safari for the desktop would support WebM out of the box if there were any legal issues?

[13:59:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, if there were no legal issues?

[14:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I guess the question is really about QuickTime.)

[14:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think our other big issue would be that if something is going to become the de facto standard for Web video, we need it to be viable on mobile devices

[14:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But you could support it without endorsing it as the de facto standard for web video.  I mean, QuickTime supports tons of random formats, right?

[14:08:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Safari on the desktop supports it now if you have the WebM QuickTime components installed.

[14:12:00.0000] <Rik`>
eric_carlson: is there any webm quicktime component?

[14:13:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Rik`: yes, in TOT Perian

[14:14:00.0000] <Rik`>
oh great! we just need to wait for a release

[14:16:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: I don't think iOS supports any non hardware decoded codec

[14:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably not.

[14:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me realizes that there's no point in compiling Firefox from source if he just wants to test if something works in a nightly, hmm

[16:08:00.0000] <annevk>
http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/08/26/h264 -- euh gruber fail :/

[16:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
isn't what he says accurate?

[16:09:01.0000] <annevk>
it's still bait and switch

[16:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
there are presumably other issues with the AVC license, but it seems the worry that they will start charging for free internet video is not one of them

[16:09:03.0000] <annevk>
for the majority of stuff you still have to pay

[16:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
that was the concern that people labeled "bait & switch" if I recall correctly

[16:09:05.0000] <Workshiva>
There's no switch, though

[16:10:00.0000] <Workshiva>
You get exactly what they offer from day one

[16:11:00.0000] <annevk>
if enough people get lured by the bigger bait, the switch is everyone being trapped by MPEG LA

[16:11:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, not pointing out the other issues at all is just bad

[16:12:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, he makes it seem as if H264 is problem free

[16:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
my interpretation was, "this one potential problem with h.264 has now been addressed", rather than "h.264 has no problems", but I am more knowledgable about the issue than the average reader

[16:14:00.0000] <annevk>
I didn't really see this as a problem at all

[16:14:01.0000] <annevk>
it's dwarfed by the other problems imo

[16:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
some people did cite it as a problem

[16:19:00.0000] <annevk>
sure, I'm not saying it was not a problem; it's just not the main issue by a long shot

[16:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for example roc cited it as a major issue here: http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2010/01/video_freedom_a.html

[16:24:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, with http://tc.labs.opera.com/apis/EventSource/ maybe we can move server-sent events to PR soonish

[16:25:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, though .url/.URL still seems an issue with WebKit

[16:25:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, and Opera has not quite released something public yet (though should happen soonish)

[16:26:00.0000] <roc>
I think it was a major issue that has now gone away

[16:26:01.0000] <roc>
there are other major issues

[16:26:02.0000] <roc>
it is not important for us to agree on this

[16:28:00.0000] <roc>
it is important for us to agree that Gruber is a weasel


2010-08-27
[17:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
IPv6 not working reliably for you?  :)

[18:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: what would <script>alert('&%dGVzdA==;')</script> alert, if anything?

[18:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, I don't know, it's not my proposal.

[18:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
(and how about <script>alert(&%Jyk7YWxlcnQoZG9jdW1lbnQuY29va2llICsgJw;)</script>)

[18:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, anne answered my question

[18:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that some pages write <a href="foo%20&%20;bar.html">

[18:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
so it's not entirely clear the proposed syntax is safe

[18:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
well the character can be changed, certainly

[18:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't have to be *%

[18:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
&% even

[18:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
(i was wondering about that myself)

[18:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It could be a multicharacter string, like "xn--".  :)

[18:13:01.0000] <jcranmer>
just make it My

[18:14:00.0000] <jcranmer>
who'd use that? ;-)

[18:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems a bit strange to me to design something based on the assumption that people are too uninformed to follow a few simple rules (like always quote attributes and use some particular escape function based on current syntax), but will be able to use a new syntax and escaping function without getting horridly confused

[18:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
particularly since for the next five years people will write articles saying not to use this syntax yet, since it's not backward-compatible with IE6

[18:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
and after that people will continue reading those articles

[18:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The only possible utility I see is easy escaping in <script>, and I'm far from sure that that justifies it.

[18:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Also everybody will get the character encoding wrong, and it's terrible for 'view source')

[18:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"View source" can translate it, in principle.

[18:17:03.0000] <Philip`>
Then it wouldn't be 'view source'

[18:17:04.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be 'view something that's a bit like the source but not quite'

[18:17:05.0000] <Philip`>
and anyway my text editor won't translate it when opening an .html file

[18:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Isn't that what "view source" already is, at least in Firefox?

[18:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
No

[18:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
as far as I'm aware

[18:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
unless you mean 'view selection source'

[18:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
which seems fancier

[18:19:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think it mangles the source.  Maybe I'm wrong.

[18:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Wouldn't this new syntax break blacklist-based XSS filters because you could write <span style="&%XhwcmVzc2lvbjphbGVydCgnb2ggbm8nKQo=;"> etc and sneak in forbidden properties?

[18:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably.

[18:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Uh, I got that syntax all wrong)

[18:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
blacklist-based XSS filters are already broken

[18:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
People seem to design them to be sufficiently complex and conservative to successfully work in practice

[18:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thought MediaWiki had something like that

[18:31:00.0000] <wirepair>
really?

[18:32:00.0000] <wirepair>
every site i've ever tested has failed

[18:32:01.0000] <wirepair>
;)

[18:33:00.0000] <wirepair>
especially when developers are taking user input and assigning it inside of <script> </script> blocks

[18:33:01.0000] <wirepair>
it's impossible to create a blacklist for that

[18:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/includes/Sanitizer.php?view=markup#l744 - that kind of thing

[18:35:00.0000] <wirepair>
input validation/filtering is different than black listing

[18:35:01.0000] <wirepair>
when i think of blacklisting i'm thinking like lookign for <script> tags

[18:35:02.0000] <wirepair>
or whatever

[18:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
preg_match( '! expression | filter\s*: | accelerator\s*: | url\s*\( !ix', $value )

[18:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's the blacklisting

[18:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
and first it does some filtering to remove escaping and spaces and comments and other potentially dangerous things

[18:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
but it looks like it probably will accept &%...; input unchanged

[18:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
which lets the input circumvent the blacklist

[18:38:00.0000] <wirepair>
yeah

[18:38:01.0000] <wirepair>
where is this new proposal anwyays

[18:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
WHATWG list

[18:39:00.0000] <wirepair>
got it

[18:50:00.0000] <wirepair>
hu, i mean i think it makes sense and protects elements in some cases

[18:56:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
othermaciej: yt?

[18:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
mpilgrim: good day sir

[18:56:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
i'm having reports that http://diveintohtml5.org/detect.html crashes the iPad browser

[18:57:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
do you have access to an iPad to verify that?

[18:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sure I can test

[18:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
cannot reproduce

[18:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it loaded fine for me

[18:58:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
well shit

[18:59:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
source of the bug report claims it happens for others too: http://twitter.com/al3xandru/status/22220332275

[18:59:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
the only recent change i made was the font-face declaration, it now includes an SVG font (generated by fontsquirrel's awesome font-face generator)

[19:00:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i'm waiting on reports about whether http://diveintohtml5.org/test.html (which is the same page, but without the SVG font-face declaration) also crashes

[19:00:01.0000] <paul_irish>
i can repro the crash on iPad

[19:00:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
aha

[19:01:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
when does it happen? on load?

[19:01:01.0000] <paul_irish>
test.html does not crash.

[19:01:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
hooray!

[19:01:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
er,

[19:01:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
you know what i mean

[19:01:05.0000] <paul_irish>
(yeah on load)

[19:01:06.0000] <mpilgrim>
ok

[19:01:07.0000] <mpilgrim>
it's definitely the SVG fonts then

[19:01:08.0000] <paul_irish>
the only difference is the url('f/essays1743-italic-webfont.svg#webfontmRs1TiYo') format('svg')  and such?

[19:01:09.0000] <mpilgrim>
yes

[19:02:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
5 or 6 instances -- two fonts with different styles/variants

[19:02:01.0000] <paul_irish>
Yeah sounds like ripe territory for a bug.

[19:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I tried a few more times and still no crash

[19:03:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
well, crashing is definitely a bug -- dunno if it's exploitable, but still

[19:03:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
i'd hate to be responsible for the next major jailbreak exploit :-D

[19:03:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm running iOS 3.2.2

[19:03:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(7B500)

[19:03:05.0000] <paul_irish>
3.2 (7B367)

[19:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
would love to hear if it still happens for you after updating

[19:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think odds are good that this is a fixed bug, as I recall hearing about a bug with svg fonts

[19:05:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i wonder if google's font API team knows about this

[19:05:01.0000] <paul_irish>
i'll ping them about it.

[19:06:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
not sure how we would detect it

[19:06:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
UA sniffing, i guess :(

[19:06:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
hard to detect a browser crash ahead of time

[19:06:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
what with the halting problem and all that

[19:06:04.0000] <paul_irish>
yup. would have to.

people tend to update iOS pretty quickly, though maybe a bit less for for minor updates

[19:07:03.0000] <paul_irish>
dont have a cable handy at the moment, but as soon as we do, certainly will.

[19:08:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
ok

[19:08:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
i'll leave those SVG fonts up at their current locations, but i'm going to update my HTML to stop referring to them

[19:09:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
in lieu of doing minor-version UA sniffing, which is the kind of extreme optimization that my employer might be willing to do, but I personally am not

[19:21:00.0000] <variable>
Hixie, around ?

[20:08:00.0000] <wirepair>
Hixie do you have any license for your live DOM Viewer? I'd like to include it in my browser testing kit

[20:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: what license is your browser testing kit?

[20:41:00.0000] <wirepair>
haven't decided yet ;)

[20:41:01.0000] <wirepair>
whatever license says you can use it / modify it, but can't just sell it without giving back source

[20:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you use MIT, BSD, GPL 2 or 3, or Apache 2, feel free to just use it under the same license

[20:47:00.0000] <wirepair>
thanks, is there any server side code? or what you see is what you get at http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/

[20:54:00.0000] <variable>
wirepair, just use the BSD licence - simple. easy. free. ;)

[20:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's some server-side code for the saving/loading, iirc

[20:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
but should be trivial enough to reimplement

[20:54:03.0000] <variable>
Hixie, about the type="username" proposal. If I understand correctly the issue was lack of any UA difference?

[20:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
variable: the main issue was that we already have solutions in place that people aren't using, so there's no reason to believe anyone will use new features

[20:56:01.0000] <Boogyman>
html5 discussion? 

[20:56:02.0000] <variable>
Hixie, you don't think that browser vendors have more of a focus on HTML5 over other standards?

[20:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
like which?

[20:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
by "people" i meant authors, not browser vendors

[20:58:00.0000] <variable>
Hixie, or document authors. I'm fairly knolegeable of various web standards - but I've never heard of RFC3106

[20:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
well, you've heard of it now :-)

[20:59:00.0000] <variable>
Hixie, only cause I followed that specific proposal before it made it to HTML5. For the document authors that care about semantics and use the HTML5 spec - but don't follow the development of the spec - they won't ever hear of it

[21:00:00.0000] <variable>
and IMHO a document author should not be expected to follow the WHATWG mailing list

[21:00:01.0000] <variable>
in order to find out how to mark up things properaly

[21:00:02.0000] <variable>
*properly

[21:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
variable: i think plenty of other specifications have managed to get plenty of exposure without being in the technology of the day (be that html5 or whatever)

[21:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
variable: if peoplereally  want a solution, they'll use the one that exists

brianleroux++

[22:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for lots of reasons

[22:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but at the moment, for http://github.com/brianleroux/wtfjs

[01:05:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, charset registration is also failing it seems

[01:05:01.0000] <annevk>
3 months without answer

[01:05:02.0000] <annevk>
actually 4

[01:06:00.0000] <annevk>
geez

[02:07:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Neat; http://joshduck.com/periodic-table.html

[02:08:00.0000] <annevk>
added responseBlob to XMLHttpRequest Level 2

[02:09:00.0000] <annevk>
somewhat tempted to also add followRedirects

[02:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: unconditionally follow them, or with limitations?

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk>
xhr.followRedirects would be a boolean

[02:12:01.0000] <annevk>
true by default (as it is now)

[02:12:02.0000] <annevk>
when set to false you simply get the response

[02:12:03.0000] <annevk>
e.g. 302 BLAHDIEBLAH\n\nLocation: somewhereelse

[02:13:00.0000] <annevk>
euh \r\n but you get the idea

[02:13:01.0000] <annevk>
it's low-level but allows people to implement everything they want

[02:15:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: are there any security implications?

[02:15:01.0000] <annevk>
not as far as I know

[02:17:00.0000] <virtuelv>
off-site redirects and CORS?

[02:17:01.0000] <annevk>
virtuelv, off-site redirects are required to carry CORS headers

[02:17:02.0000] <annevk>
already

[02:18:00.0000] <virtuelv>
so no additional implications. good

[02:18:01.0000] <annevk>
i.e. cross-origin redirect responses without CORS headers result in a network error today

[03:38:00.0000] <annevk>
must be some fatal misunderstanding

[03:38:01.0000] <annevk>
also sad why they make all kinds of assumptions instead of simply sending an email with the question

[03:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, WTF

[03:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Um, okay.

[03:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>

keep getting surprised

[03:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Why does WebKit trt to clone IE where IE disallows innerHTML setter? 

[03:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>

hi micheil

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, do they still do that with the new HTML parser?

[04:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: looks like it but I'm not sure

[06:47:00.0000] <annevk>
xhr.followRedirects defined

[06:47:01.0000] <annevk>
including support in CORS

[12:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
should i just s/float/double/ ?

[12:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
people keep asking for changes along those lines?

[12:40:00.0000] <micheil>
float as in 1.5567633

[12:40:01.0000] <micheil>
yeah?

[12:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[12:44:00.0000] <micheil>
makes sense I guess

[12:44:01.0000] <micheil>
doesn't bother me either way

[12:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
What's the value in using float?

[12:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[12:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
to be honest

[12:47:03.0000] <Philip`>
I assume the harm is that it doesn't match JS Numbers so you need rounding

[12:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
What APIs using floating point values?

[12:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/using/use/

[12:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
anything that uses floating point numbers except valueAsNumber

[12:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
except the latter is currently buggy because of http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9886

[12:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess we'll change to double and see who complains

[12:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
all the canvas stuff is float

[12:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
micheil: have you had a chance to try http://github.com/aredridel/html5 at all yet?

[12:53:01.0000] <micheil>
umm.. no

[12:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: would there be a compat problem if i changed canvas s/float/double/?

[12:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, there's some thing some Opera people mentioned

[12:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries to find it

[12:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
CORE-32111

[12:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me infers Opera probably uses JIRA

[12:59:00.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: I'll follow up in a min, just talking to someone about some audio stuff..

[12:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
micheil: no problem

[12:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100818#l-737

[13:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
micheil: was just asking out of curiosity

[13:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: (If you don't round to float then the value is too large and it throws)

[13:01:00.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: yeah, listening to a podcast about audio mixing, and then I managed to get talking to a rep from a company I'm looking at getting some gear from, which was pretty cool

[13:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
great

[13:01:02.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: as for the html5 parser..

[13:01:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: (It could be made safe by not making drawImage throw exceptions (and treat things as transparent black) but I don't know whether that kind of behaviour change has other problems)

[13:02:00.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: if it uses JSDom, then it's probably going to be pretty good

[13:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yeah whether to fire an exception or not based on what you're dividing seems suboptimal

[13:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
micheil: cool, thanks… I'm just starting to take a look at some of this stuff today

[13:03:01.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: sure thing, doing node knockout?

[13:03:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
nope

[13:03:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I lack the chops

[13:03:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
at this point

[13:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
looking forward to seeing the results though

[13:04:01.0000] <hober>
A bug in jsdom has been driving me crazy for weeks

[13:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
spectator sports

[13:04:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hober: what kind of bug?

[13:05:00.0000] <hober>
setAttribute doesn't seem to work

[13:05:01.0000] <hober>
http://gist.github.com/551578

[13:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: maybe i should say to round to whole pixels

[13:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
no that wouldn't work for svg inputs or something

[13:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
like that

[13:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[13:08:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: That would seem a bit weird since the canvas API currently never cares about pixels (except the (get|put)PixelData aberrations)

[13:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[13:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll just make it transparent black outside and see if people complain

[13:09:01.0000] <hober>
MikeSmith: it's entirely likely that I'm just doing something stupid, but I haven't been able to figure out what that might be

[13:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does anyone know how to get e-mail notification from the IE feedback thing?  I haven't figured out if there's any way.

[13:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do they really expect me to check manually all the time?

[13:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks through hobercode to see if he can find anything that looks funny

[13:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: I remember getting emails from them automatically

[13:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
(on bugs that I filed)

[13:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[13:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe they got filed as spam.

[13:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or maybe something choked on the address I provided.

[13:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting, this site's security certificate is revoked.  I wonder how that happened: https://profile.microsoft.com/RegSysProfileCenter/Error.aspx

[13:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, the same is true for all of https://profile.microsoft.com/.  Nice.

[13:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I like how Chrome refuses to give me *any* option *whatsoever* to continue.

[13:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
This kind of security theater is asinine, no real attacker with half a brain would use a bad certificate and pop up a scary warning.

[13:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Firefox doesn't pop up any warning at all . . .

[13:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe Google decided to revoke all of Microsoft's certificates for a laugh

[13:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, editing my profile is completely and totally broken on Minefield/Linux.

[13:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It has required drop-down fields that it gives me no options for.

[13:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I used to think that Microsoft was actually competent at programming and just got lazy due to lack of competition, but sometimes I have doubts.

[13:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: no real attacker with half a brain would use a bad certificate and pop up a scary warning, but if no scary warning popped up, they could just use any arbitrary certificate

[13:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like every time I use IE8, it prompts me about some inane thing I don't care about (not sure what), and the only "go away" option it gives is "Ask me later".  Which it does.  Forever.

[13:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: so in this particular case, it's not security theatre

[13:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, no, but you could just pop up a scary warning and allow easy clickthrough.  Attackers still would be very unlikely to trigger that, so it's fine to allow reasonably easy clickthrough.

[13:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chrome in this case allowed no clickthrough *at all*.

[13:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's just stupid.

[13:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
people click through things without reading them

[13:22:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure.

[13:22:05.0000] <Hixie>
so it wouldn't work

[13:22:06.0000] <Hixie>
didn't work

[13:22:07.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, lunch time, bbiab

[13:22:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, it would work fine.  Because attackers are unlikely to ever trigger the error, since they can typically avoid it just as easily.

[13:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So many users will just click through without reading, but that's okay, because it's almost certainly not an attack.

[13:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The authors of this paper were unable to find a single case, ever, anywhere, where attackers used an invalid certificate: research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cormac/papers/2009/SoLongAndNoThanks.pdf

[13:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, looks like Chrome auto-http://-adding is buggy.

[13:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me registers and verifies his address, maybe didn't verify it before

[13:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, the point is, certificates are obnoxiously complicated and an innocuous error is overwhelmingly more likely than an actual attack.  Even if there were a tiny number of attacks, the inconvenience it causes is surely not even close to worth it.

[13:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The concern should become basically obsolete with STS, anyway, when all e-commerce and other important sites switch to using that.

[13:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Since that mandates hard failure, and actually closes up the gaping hole of HTTP redirecting to HTTPS.

[13:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, once DNSSEC is deployed, it will be very simple: use the cert from DNS no matter what, and if there's an error authenticating it, you can't even resolve the domain name, so people will fix it pretty quickly.  :)

[13:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
SRP would be even better, though.  That's insanely hard to get wrong, if you have a basic implementation.  No certificates to juggle.  And best of all, it completely kills phishing, which certificates can never do.

[13:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But something like Account Manager is a prerequisite for that.  Go Firefox!

[13:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me checks channel stats to see if they have a stat for "talks to himself", and if anyone else is even in the running for that one

[13:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie and MikeSmith beat me.

[13:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
:(

[13:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, I tried arguing with the Chromium security mafia before, and they didn't listen to me, so I won't bother again.

[13:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I should say, the person who responded did respond in some detail to all of my points, but didn't back down even though the behavior in that case was clearly broken.)

[13:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hober: fwiw, I get same result as you for your test file

[13:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in my environment

[13:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is, no attributes

[13:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
at all

[13:43:00.0000] <hober>
hmm

[13:44:00.0000] <hober>
well, kindly upvote http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues#issue/9 and hopefully tmpvar will fix it. :)

[13:44:01.0000] <hober>
I keep meaning to carve out some time to debug what jsdom is doing myself, but never manage to

[13:44:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hober: maybe worth asking on #Node.js to see if anybody else has insight

[13:45:00.0000] <hober>
yeah, I've asked, and have been warnocked

[13:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Did you intentionally change the drawImage behaviour without mentioning it in the commit message?

[13:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Seems like people might miss it)

[13:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Although, I suppose I should just update my test cases and they'll notice when they look into their failures)

[14:03:00.0000] <hober>
MikeSmith: my impl of the html->atom algorithm fails pretty spectacularly when it can't create attributes, as I'm sure you can imagine

[14:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[14:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yeah

[14:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
silly that github doesn't support display of HTML-formatted readme files

[14:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would have to sanitize them.

[14:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
As the people in this room should know, sanitizing arbitrary HTML is quite nontrivial.

[15:07:00.0000] <hober>
Why am I even having this conversation? (Re: Bug 10455) It's like talking to a brick wall.

[15:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Talking to brick walls is much less stressful, since they don't talk back.

[15:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Possibly more productive, too.

[15:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I heartily recommend it, although walls made out of wood or sheetrock work fine too.

[15:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I don't suppose you have the overwhelming desire to comment in the opera bug that Philip` mentioned earlier, so you?

[15:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/so/do/

[15:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
So that we don't fix to the old behaviour

[15:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me can do it of course

[15:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
uri?

[15:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do ex-employees keep access to Opera's bug tracker?

[15:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
some non-employees have access

[15:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
to some parts of the bug tracker

[15:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
not a direct correlation to previous employee status

[15:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
CORE-32111

[15:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
So er https://bugs.opera.com/browse/CORE-32111

[15:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: See e.g. http://operawiki.info/TheElektrans

[15:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: (URL above btw)

[15:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: yes, i commented as soon as you pasted it :-)

[15:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Ah, wasn't sure if you had seen it :)

[15:52:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: with regards to .value. Is IE the only browser that changes the content attribute when .value changes?

[15:52:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: i've always liked the IE model and would love to switch to it, but it might not be safe to do so if only IE is doing that :(

[15:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This alerts null in Minefield, Chrome dev, Opera 10.60, and "foo" in IE6 (ies4linux).  <!doctype html><script>var el = document.createElement("input");el.value = "foo";alert(el.getAttribute("value"));</script>

[15:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(if that's what you meant)

[16:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[16:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
.defaultValue assigns to @value, I believe

[16:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: the IE model has all kinds of problems

[16:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: e.g. it makes browser autocomplete mutate the DOM

[16:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: and it just moves the default value to an IDL attribute instead of the current value

[16:43:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: the latter sounds like a much smaller problem than the general confusion of having .value != getAttribute("value")

[16:43:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: the former i don't quite understand, please elaborate

[16:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
.value is the current value of the control, right?

[16:43:03.0000] <sicking>
yup

[16:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
if changing .value changes the DOM, then when the UA loads the page and autofills a control, the DOM has to change

[16:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
so you're making the browser mutate the DOM on page load

[16:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
this has all kinds of issues

[16:44:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: why is that a problem?

[16:44:04.0000] <sicking>
such as?

[16:44:05.0000] <Hixie>
well it kills round-tripping, for one

[16:45:00.0000] <sicking>
when does autocomplete happen during important round tripping?

[16:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[16:45:02.0000] <sicking>
the parsing algorithm also kills round tripping, no?

[16:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems really bad to me to have the DOM not reflect the markup after load

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
but in any case this is all highly academic, there's no way we can change all this now

[16:46:02.0000] <sicking>
well, autocomplete is basically the UA helping the author type

[16:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
user

[16:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
but yues

[16:46:05.0000] <sicking>
sorry, yes

[16:46:06.0000] <sicking>
and having the DOM change as a result of the user typing doesn't seem bad to me

[16:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[16:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
tell brendan about 15 years ago

[16:47:02.0000] <sicking>
yeah, probably academic if all other UAs do it the other way

[16:47:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie: actually, this wasn't a problem until DOM L1

[16:47:04.0000] <sicking>
no getAttribute before that

[16:48:00.0000] <sicking>
and it wasn't really a problem until much later when gecko gained marketshare

[16:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok, tell vidur about 12 years ago

[16:48:02.0000] <sicking>
i think it's tell me+jst+a few other about 7 years ago

[16:48:03.0000] <sicking>
or possibly even tell you about 3 years ago when you wrote this

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
by the time i specced it i was just speccing current practice

[16:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
and really put very little thought into the logic of it

[16:50:00.0000] <sicking>
well, you probably at that point could have chosen either IE behavior or gecko behavior

[16:51:00.0000] <sicking>
but possibly too late now i agree

[16:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
the IE behaviour really wasn't anywhere near as logical as you're making out

[16:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. it threw exceptions when you set .type

[16:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
which i hope we are in agreement is a non-starter

[00:38:00.0000] <hober>
MikeSmith: I figured out that jsdom issue

[00:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh?

[00:38:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool

[00:38:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
what was the problem?

[00:39:00.0000] <hober>
If you require('jsdom/level1/core') instead of require('jsdom/level2/core'), it works

[00:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me tries it

[00:39:02.0000] <hober>
var DOM = browser.browserAugmentation(require('jsdom/level1/core').dom.level1.core)

[00:39:03.0000] <hober>
(is the replacement for the relevant line)

[00:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
seet

[00:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
sweet

[00:40:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess the level2 stuff is pre-alpha

[00:40:03.0000] <hober>
yeah

[00:40:04.0000] <hober>
html->atom is much nicer with things like createElementNS

[00:40:05.0000] <hober>
but I guess I can fake it for now

[00:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[00:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so after that change is htmlparser working now for you? (for what you were using it for)

[00:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and should I post a follow-up comment to the bug you pointed me to before?

[00:43:00.0000] <hober>
Oh. I haven't been using node-htmlparser at all; I've been using aredridel/html5

[00:43:01.0000] <hober>
which is essentially html5lib in js

[00:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hober: yeah, that's the one I meant

[00:44:01.0000] <hober>
aredridel/html5 has been working for me. at least, last I remember screwing with this stuff it seemed to work.

[00:45:00.0000] <hober>
but creating new documents from whole cloth was failing, and now I know it's due to my premature desire to use level 2 DOM methods.

[00:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
among other things, I'm wondering how its performance is relative to html5lib (python) or to whatever non-HTML5 parsers you might have tried (e.g., the HTML parser in libxml2)

[00:45:02.0000] <hober>
for my current purposes (offline, static site generation), I'm not terribly concerned about performance

[00:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[00:50:00.0000] <hober>
(that said, I imagine I'm the outlier, Node.js-wise, insofar as performance concerns go.)

[00:51:00.0000] <hober>
I'm working on a publication workflow in which the "pretty this HTML up for publication" logic can happen browser-side, during composition, and server-side, when the publish button is pressed

[00:51:01.0000] <hober>
(the prettyifying code being exactly the same)

[00:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, that's a really nice advantage to have

[00:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
(being able to use the same code server side and client both)

[00:56:00.0000] <hober>
The longer-term idea I'm working on, in a somewhat cryptic tweet: http://twitter.com/hober/status/15739328281

[01:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hober: interesting

[02:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Listening to Rasputina again, I again conclude they're not my sort of music.

[03:29:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, <details> changes the DOM based on user interaction

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
I wish I had paid closer attention to DOM Events

[04:35:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
annevk: you mean because you think it has problems that should have been fixed before now?

[04:40:00.0000] <annevk>
I think it might have and I think it would have helped to point them out at early stages

[04:41:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I see

[04:41:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I guess that's true in general of any spec

[04:41:02.0000] <annevk>
Yep

[04:42:00.0000] <annevk>
See e.g. all the RDF nonsense to describe something as simple as WAI-ARIA

[04:42:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
but some are more important than others and it doesn't harm as much to have ignored them

[04:42:02.0000] <annevk>
makes it completely unreadable, but it's not going to change for this edition

[04:42:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
oh

[04:43:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I can see that's a problem

[04:43:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
but not quite as serious as I thought you might have meant

[04:44:00.0000] <annevk>
well, real serious ends up getting ignored at the implementation stage

[04:44:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
yeah

[04:44:02.0000] <annevk>
e.g. various things that were once in SVG 1.2

[04:44:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, i know

[04:44:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as browsers go at least

[04:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which is what's really important of course

[04:45:01.0000] <annevk>
semi-serious things -- like how the CSS syntax is insanely complicated if you look at the details while it did not have to be at all -- need to be tackled sooner rather than later

[04:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
um, what's exactly the RDF part you're referring to?

[04:46:01.0000] <annevk>
there's no reason that the character sequence "@namespace" can be written in near-infinite ways

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles is full of it

[04:47:01.0000] <annevk>
"superclassing" "subclassing" etc.

[04:48:00.0000] <annevk>
all kinds of complexity that a) authors are not interested in and b) implementations are not either

[05:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
on the face of it, that seems like the same kind of overengineering that's a misfeature of a lot of specs

[05:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but maybe it could be useful in some complex apps 

[05:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean, I don't myself know all what's involved in adding ARIA to a complex app like Gmail or whatever

[05:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, I think browsing with Disable Caches set in Webkit/Safari seems to possibly be a great way to cause the fan on your laptop to run at high speeds continuously

[05:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think it might be causing "Safari Webpage Preview Fetcher" to keep launching and re-launching to fetch previews of pages that then don't get cached anywhere, and so it fetches them again and again

[05:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe

[05:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"defaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSnapshotsUpdatePolicy -int 2" seems to possibly be the way to stop it

[05:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sitepoint.com pop-ups are really cheesy

[05:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I thought the people behind Sitepoint were better than that

[05:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the inconsistency of the format support table at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video annoys me again. It's even more bogus thatn before.

[05:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I vented on the talk page, since the page itself is guarded by a user with an intimidatingly long user page

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
people with *huge* user pages always have the time to out-revert you, so why even bother

[09:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So there's no window in workers, only self?

[09:41:00.0000] <annevk>
yup

[10:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: dunno how much time if any you've had lately to think about migrating the v.nu sources to a git or mercurial hosting service, but I wanted to say I'd be willing to do the work to make it happen

[10:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is, dealing with actually getting them migrated over, as well as updating the build script and whatever else would be needed 

[10:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
github seems like it might best place to consider moving to

[10:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for among other reasons the network effects of the fact that there are so many very active developers there

[11:01:00.0000] <hober>
github supports svn, btw

[11:02:00.0000] <hober>
(see http://github.com/blog/644-subversion-write-support for more)

[11:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hober: part of the motivation is to get away from svn, actually

[11:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least on my part

[11:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I've never been a big subversion fan

[11:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I really that github makes it dead simple to fork repos

[11:06:02.0000] <hober>
github's svn support is actually git-backed. it lets people who aren't yet comfortable with git use something familiar while the other collaborators forge on ahead with git

[11:06:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, I see

[11:06:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
well that's good then

[11:07:00.0000] <hober>
e.g. svn checkout http://svn.github.com/sideshowbarker/jsblog.git

[11:08:00.0000] <hober>
(use https for a read/write checkout)

[11:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool

[11:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there more I use github, the more I like it

[11:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it ain't perfect but it was clearly designed by people with clue

[11:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and in general it just seems to work the way a system like that ought to

[11:13:01.0000] <hober>
yeah, those guys are rad

[11:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the ease of forking and the culture really encourage experimentation

[11:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think getting the validator.nu sources available there might help a lot toward getting some code contributions for yet-to-be-implemented features and bugs too

[11:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it'd raise more awareness about it and hopeflly get some more good devs involved

[11:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[11:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.xtranormal.com/watch/6995033/ is pretty good

[11:39:00.0000] <micheil>
MikeSmith: still working on your KO?

[11:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I'm just working on a personal KO

[11:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't want to embarrass myself by bringing much attention to it yet

[11:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but so far I've messed around a bit with express, Connect, and the ext.js stuff

[11:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and it's all really quite nice

[11:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and of course the fork I made of brianleroux's wtfs stuff

[11:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gotta love that dude

[11:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
his comments in the "templating" part of that About page for that site are great

[11:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Nothing is perfect. And sometimes shit is just plain wack. The ExpressJS framework is seriously awesome but it has a hardon for HAML which solves problems I do not have. I opted, out of lazyness, for EJS which is not beautiful; tho it is functional.

do you wish to have a team?

[12:27:01.0000] <micheil>
that would make you officially part of KO

[12:27:02.0000] <MikeSmith>

[13:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
It was "raised for Shelley Powers" whose "purpose in wanting to file change proposals isn't that I expected any of them to succeed", so presumably the point is just to waste time and/or to make a point

[13:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>

[20:05:00.0000] <aho>
*scratches head*... :first-child is css level 2 and :last-child is css level 3? how the f- did that happen?

[20:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
aho: because CSS spec development is kind of like particle physics

[20:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
none of it's intuitive

[20:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
normal physical laws break down around the "singularity" of CSS standards process

[20:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you need some special math to understand it all

[20:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's actually what they created MathML for

[20:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
to have a way to mark up the bizarre mathematics underlying the CSS work

[20:25:00.0000] <nessy>
lol

[20:36:00.0000] <aho>
ye, i guess that's the most logical explanation

[21:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
aho: :first-child is a lot easier to implement

[21:10:01.0000] <aho>
how so?

[21:11:00.0000] <aho>
there is some element... and all its children... the dom api provides a pointer to the first and the last one

[21:12:00.0000] <jcranmer>
:first-child doesn't mess up incremental rendering

[21:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
because as you're parsing a document, the first child is set once

[21:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
the last child changes continuously

[21:12:03.0000] <aho>
well, dom manipulations have the same effect

[21:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[21:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
and early implementations didn't handle those at all well :-)

browsers will ignore dom manipulations if they are two hard :-)

[21:13:02.0000] <aho>
ye, :first-child is static in ie7

[21:14:00.0000] <aho>
and all :first-child, :last-child, :nth-child etc stuff was broken in firefox for ages :>

[21:15:00.0000] <aho>
#73586 has been fixed on 2008-02-18

[21:15:01.0000] <aho>
almost took 7 years :>

[21:16:00.0000] <aho>
well, i'm just tired of sticking first and last classes everywhere

[21:21:00.0000] <aho>
(they are just a bit of a nuisance for that odd stuff i'm trying to figure out right now... it's some sort of by-contract stuff for the html and css parts of oocss modules.)

[02:28:00.0000] <cardona507_>
did the geolocation implementation in firefox change?

[02:29:00.0000] <cardona507_>
for some reason my browser is asking me if a page can get my location but then it isn't actually happening

[02:29:01.0000] <cardona507_>
happening to anyone else?

[02:29:02.0000] <cardona507_>
example: http://nko-trisomic-propus.heroku.com/

[02:29:03.0000] <cardona507_>
works in chrome - not if FF

[02:30:00.0000] <cardona507_>
also works in safari

[02:31:00.0000] <cardona507_>
works on my Android EVO - 

[02:33:00.0000] <annevk>
wfm in Minefield

[02:33:01.0000] <cardona507_>
hmmm - I didn't check minefield yet

[02:34:00.0000] <cardona507_>
oddly enough it isn't working on my ipod touch - it isn't even asking if it can get my location

[02:35:00.0000] <cardona507_>
wow! minefield is on acid!

[02:35:01.0000] <cardona507_>
yeah it worked in minefield

[02:35:02.0000] <cardona507_>
that is a good sign

[03:59:00.0000] <cardona507_>
I am creating a small geolocation app for the nodejs knockout - http://nko-trisomic-propus.heroku.com/ -when I run this function http://gist.github.com/556165 it stores the epoch as the key and the object as the value—but when I try to retrieve the object I am getting [object Object]. Firefox is acting wacky so I can't test it right now—so this might just be a webkit thing. Is it not cool to have nested key/values in localSt

[04:00:00.0000] <cardona507_>
the code is live on the first link if you want to check it out - just look at the local storage in the webkit developer toolkit thing

[04:01:00.0000] <cardona507_>
each time you refresh the page it will store a new object with your lat and long in the localStorage

/me discovers that there's no way in DNS to say "aryeh.name's A record should be the same as twcenter.net's, like a CNAME, but the MX record should be different"

[12:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess this is why people use www.

[12:11:00.0000] <Workshiva>
Or just write the same IP twice

[12:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, but then I have to change it in two places when it changes.

[12:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.

[12:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is waiting four hours for the change to propagate before he can set up mail for his domain

[12:14:00.0000] <hdhoang0>
my DNS hoster automatically updates A with the same address if I update one of them

[12:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I actually have the two domains on different name servers, so that's not going to work for me.

[12:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll just suffer.

[12:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oops, I sent a message to www-style from the wrong address.  Sigh.

[12:22:00.0000] <cardona507_>
is there a method for getting all of the key/values in localStorage or do I need to somehow loop through?

[12:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Seems like you have to loop.

[12:26:01.0000] <cardona507_>
loopty loop

How to use a cache manifest file to make sure the index page is cached? All the examples I can find suggest adding index.html or index.php to the manifest file, but I don't want UAs to request those files, just the root URL /. Is this possible at all?

[14:08:01.0000] <matjas>
Can I just add a line saying '/'?

[14:43:00.0000] <espadrine>
matjas: The single character (/) will match any page on your site, not just the home page.

[14:44:00.0000] <matjas>
espadrine: Good to know, thanks. So is it possible to match only the index page (without using index.(php|html)

[15:34:00.0000] <annevk>
matjas, you want /

[15:34:01.0000] <annevk>
matjas, if that is the URL you are using

[15:35:00.0000] <matjas>
annevk: it is. so what espadrine said ^ is not true?

[15:35:01.0000] <annevk>
right

[15:35:02.0000] <annevk>
what he said is true for the FALLBACK section

[15:35:03.0000] <annevk>
but that is something different

[15:36:00.0000] <annevk>
see also: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/offline.html

"But the problem is that it is very difficult to measure the VERY NARROW

(but widely applicable to polymath, e.g. economics, philosophy, etc) area

[15:46:02.0000] <annevk>
of IQ where I may be off the charts, because my verbal and visual cortex

[15:46:03.0000] <annevk>
is only about 115 - 120 IQ. I am not genius at visual pattern matching. In

[15:46:04.0000] <annevk>
the area of visualizing mathematical relationships, the answers just come

[15:46:05.0000] <annevk>
"But the other problem is measuring this capability

[15:46:06.0000] <annevk>
is that I am not genius in loading the data points nor communicating the

[15:46:07.0000] <annevk>
result. Once I get the data points loaded, then the solution is instant.

[15:46:08.0000] <annevk>
So it is extremely difficult to both measure my IQ and for me to

[15:46:09.0000] <annevk>
communicate something once I visualize it. I get easily frustrated with

o_O

[15:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Where's that from?  Please tell me it's not from a standards list.

it continues

"I don't know when I started to read, but I do know that I could build

things with my hands and entertain adults in conversation as an infant. At

[15:48:03.0000] <annevk>
age of 5, I observed my very high IQ father (big time attorney for oil

[15:48:04.0000] <annevk>
companies) and his buddies trying to build a wood platform in the back of

[15:48:05.0000] <annevk>
VW bus. Apparently they were struggling with the design. I gave them the

huge bunk bed for us, simply by walking up to a pile of wood and start

sawing and hammering away at full speed without pause. Within a couple of

[15:49:03.0000] <annevk>
hours we were finished. I didn't even have to think about how to design

[15:49:04.0000] <annevk>
it. He reminded me in email the other day after I hadn't heard from him

[15:50:00.0000] <annevk>
it's from hybi, by the illustrious Shelby Moore

[15:52:00.0000] <matjas>
Thanks for your answer, annevk!

[15:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wow.

[15:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And no one's banned him yet?

[15:53:02.0000] <espadrine>
matjas: Just saw my mistake, sorry about that!

[15:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: You didn't recognise the distinctive style?

[15:55:01.0000] <annevk>
i should really post a few of the good quotes on my blog

[15:55:02.0000] <matjas>
espadrine: No problem :) IMHO the spec is not very clear about this particular case

[15:55:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, I thankfully have not had to read hybi.

[15:55:04.0000] <annevk>
matjas, or maybe you're just confused as to how URLs work?

[15:55:05.0000] <annevk>
;)

[15:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, thankfully regarding this guy in particular.

[15:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I have ignored everything he has written

[15:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
But it is the same style as the Axiomatic Proof

[15:56:03.0000] <matjas>
annevk: / is the first thing I tried. Just found it weird I couldn’t find it in the spec. And then someone said / matches all documents on the server

[15:56:04.0000] <annevk>
I have enjoyed what most of what I read of him

[15:56:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me recognised the distinctive style before even reading any of the words

[15:57:00.0000] <annevk>
matjas, could not find what in the specification?

[15:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
It's like a whole new class of troll

[15:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Surely he's just dysfunctional, not a troll.

[15:57:03.0000] <matjas>
annevk: How to specify the index page in a cache manifest file, without explicitly using `index.ext`

[15:57:04.0000] <jgraham>
I guess he is not obviously malicious

[15:58:00.0000] <matjas>
annevk: All the examples I could find were just using file names

[15:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
But it has all the same effects as a troll so...

[15:58:02.0000] <matjas>
annevk: So using /foo.ext instead of foo.ext inside a cache manifest should work as well?

[15:59:00.0000] <matjas>
annevk: Can you put any URI in there?

[15:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's why I don't like the word "troll".  It implies malice, which is hard to gauge.

[15:59:02.0000] <annevk>
matjas, / is just a URL

[15:59:03.0000] <annevk>
matjas, that it maps to /index.html in some server implementations is not something the specification should be concerned with

[15:59:04.0000] <annevk>
matjas, and yes, it takes any URL

[16:00:00.0000] <annevk>
he's a troll afaict: http://tantek.pbworks.com/TrollTaxonomy

[16:00:01.0000] <matjas>
[00:05:06] <annevk> matjas, that it maps to /index.html in some server implementations is not something the specification should be concerned with

[16:00:02.0000] <matjas>
→ agreed, but all the examples in the spec are using it. Just wanted to make. Thanks!

[16:01:00.0000] <annevk>
matjas, you could file a bug asking for an example with URLs with leading slashes

[16:02:00.0000] <annevk>
cannot deduce from examples -> cannot find in spec is quite the leap though :)

[16:03:00.0000] <annevk>
if we had to put everything in examples the spec would be huge

[16:04:00.0000] <matjas>
annevk: Done: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10499

[16:04:01.0000] <annevk>
anyway, bedtime

Why the heck has Gmail not migrated yet from Gears to HTML5?  At least basic localStorage use or something?

good morning

[19:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: morning indeed

[19:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
why you up so early?

[19:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
jetlagged

[19:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
came back from las vegas yesterday

[19:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://mathildaochsimon.se/brollopsresa

[20:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: dude

[20:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
congratulations

[20:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
didn't know

[20:08:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: thanks

[20:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sharp suit

[20:09:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
the picture on that page was from before the wedding

[20:12:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
see my facebook avatar for the wedding suit

[20:17:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
so what's happened the past five weeks?

[20:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: Webkit has an HTML5 parser now

[20:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think that happened within the last 5 weeks

[20:36:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
cool

[20:36:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
with foreign land support?

[20:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[20:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and entities

[20:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
abarth|pie: and Eric Seidel did that work

[20:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: so you guys need to get one implemented too

[20:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think the Webkit guys produced a number of new test cases as part of their work

[20:38:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
including  for document.write

[20:40:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
what else happened? i noticed websocket framing changed

[20:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[20:40:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
um

[20:40:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
there are going to be some further changes there

[20:40:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ian Fette is now editing the protocol spec

[20:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
is the latest protocol spec still part of complete.html?

[20:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and it seems it could end up becoming a bit more complicated

[20:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[20:42:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
the latest that Hixie produced

[20:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but the hybi wg is going to be publishing it separately somewhere

[20:44:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
so when fette makes changes, complete.html will be obsolete?

[20:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
foreign land parsing changed too, right?

[20:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
oh it just reverted my bad suggestion

[20:49:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
or it seems it's different than before

[20:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
when ian published his draft i'll take the protocol stuff out of complete.html

[20:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
publishes

[20:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[01:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: why did you remove support for '/' in targetOrigin?

[01:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh zcorpan_ is back

[01:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
yay!

[01:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: The hybi list has become more insane with the appearance of Shelby "Axiomatic Proof" Moore

[01:17:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
jgraham: awesome

[01:17:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
haven't read the hybi email yet

[01:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: probably not worth the time to read

[01:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: and congratulations

[01:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: thanks

[01:35:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm, what if a vendor called "data" uses vendor--feature=""

[01:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I guess we should blacklist vendors called data.

[01:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(or better yet, revert to _vendor-feature)

[01:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe Hixie did that already

[01:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
awesome. My hotmail account that I've only used for debugging Hotmail is already getting spam

[01:39:00.0000] <asmodai>
mmm, that's odd

[01:39:01.0000] <asmodai>
why would Minefield have problems with Cleartype and bold font styling

[01:39:02.0000] <asmodai>
the showing of the red/green parts on the sides of fonts is annoying :S

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does any browser have a debugger that allows breaking on the next click, mousedown or mouseup event handler?

[01:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
i.e. breaking without no clue about where the event handler code lives

[01:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
dragonfly has 'stop at new script', dunno if that does what you want

[01:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
let's see

[01:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: it seems to break where I want

[01:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: thanks!

[01:50:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
np

[01:50:03.0000] <asmodai>
mmm http://www.in-nomine.org/~asmodai/fonts-1.png

[01:50:04.0000] <hsivonen>
now if Dragonfly had a way to pretty-print minified JS for debugging...

[01:51:00.0000] <asmodai>
The difference is bizarre

[01:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: which platform?

[01:51:02.0000] <asmodai>
Windows 7

[01:51:03.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: have you enabled D2D in Minefield?

[01:52:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: if it is not enabled by default, no

[01:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: Minefield has undergone all sorts of changes in terms of which rasterizer it uses for what fonts and what the defaults are

[01:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: I haven't paid close enough attention to say what the current set of rasterizers and defaults is

[01:53:00.0000] <asmodai>
I don't hope this will be the default though ;)

[01:53:01.0000] <asmodai>
err

[01:53:02.0000] <asmodai>
I hope this won't

[01:53:03.0000] <asmodai>
*sigh*

[01:53:04.0000] <hsivonen>
whatever the default becomes, someone won't like it :-)

[01:53:05.0000] <hsivonen>
:-( rather

[01:53:06.0000] <hsivonen>
I mean some people actually prefer ClearType over Quartz!

[01:54:00.0000] <asmodai>
Well, this just hurts your eyes after a little while -- and this is the default Windows 7 display way

[01:54:01.0000] <asmodai>
Heh, both are hacks to accomplish their little goal

[01:55:00.0000] <asmodai>
also wonder where the little icons (image arrows) went to btw XD

[01:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: good question. URL?

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: do you see this font rendering difference on all pages on just this one_

[01:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[01:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
could it be that Minefield has just made everything bold?

[02:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
debugging Hotmail's JS seems hopeless due to minification and debuggers stepping by line

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
kudos to the Dragonfly team for revealing that a node has a given event handler

[02:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
unfortunately, it doesn't show a disassembly of the JS function object

[02:07:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: all pages

[02:08:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: can give you another example in a sec

[02:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ooh. I get the disassembly in DOM Inspector in Minefield

[02:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
too bad the disassembly is rather cryptic

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: send mail on the thread about vendor-- saying that data-* clashes. About '/', I'll be putting that back, I was over-eager in my reverts.

[02:12:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: http://www.in-nomine.org/~asmodai/fonts-2.png

[02:13:00.0000] <asmodai>
also curious that the fonts are suddenly 1.2-1.3 times larger

[02:14:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: ok, sent

[02:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: ta

[02:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: I suggest checking your gfx.font_rendering.* prefs in about:config and resetting them to defaults in Minefield if they aren't at the defaults

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how Opera deals with racy document.writes

[02:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0"></iframe> - yay two invalid attributes

[02:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: we should make frameborder=0 conforming, IMO

[02:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: file a bug :P

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Chromium nightlies have the HTML5 parser but not the newly-announced MathML support

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
abarth|fileapi: Do Chromium nightlies have some kind of hack that allows random scripts document.write() content magically before EOF in a spec-incompliant way?

[02:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders why http://uglyducklinghouse.blogspot.com/ doesn't break in Chromium but breaks in Minefield

[02:45:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: gfx.* is all default -- just checked

[02:46:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: So didn't have to reset anything.

[02:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: OK. I don't have an explanation.

[02:47:01.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Guess I should log a bug for it.

[02:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah

[03:11:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=591887

[03:11:01.0000] <asmodai>
done

[03:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: thanks

[03:57:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: If I need to add anything, please let me know what's missing

[04:24:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: interesting, I should try that with Aero off as well

[06:34:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: thanks

[07:29:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm so scrollX/scrollY are the same as pageXOffset/pageYOffset

[07:29:01.0000] <annevk>
how did we end up with two?!

[07:32:00.0000] <Rik`>
annevk: isn't there a difference on iframe ?

[07:38:00.0000] <annevk>
they're on Window

[08:36:00.0000] <adactio>
gsnedders: do you have time to answer a quick question about your outliner tool?

[08:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
adactio: I guess.

[08:37:00.0000] <adactio>
Thanks. I'm running this page through the outliner: http://huffduffer.com/popular and getting this outline: http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhuffduffer.com%2Fpopular

[08:37:01.0000] <adactio>
Now, I'm expecting to see an Untitled Section for the nav element at the top of the page, but I'm surprised by the placement of the Untitled Section in the outline.

[08:38:00.0000] <adactio>
Is the Untitled Section in the outline that nav element even though it comes *before* the first heading in the source order?

[08:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, interesting

[08:39:00.0000] <annevk>
your h1 is for the whole document

[08:39:01.0000] <adactio>
annevk: yes

[08:39:02.0000] <annevk>
well, actually, let me stay out of this, I'm not fully up to speed

[08:39:03.0000] <jgraham>
adactio: Yes

[08:39:04.0000] <jgraham>
It makes sense

[08:41:00.0000] <adactio>
jgraham: yes, it does make sense. I was just surprised by the cleverness of it ...that having an Untitled Section *before* the first heading of the page still appears *under* that heading.

[08:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm not fully up to speed either

[08:41:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I just wrote the code

[08:41:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(And a long time ago)

[08:41:04.0000] <adactio>
gsnedders: and very useful it is, too.

[08:41:05.0000] <jgraham>
adactio: It doesn't care about source order, only logical order (which depends on source order somewhat)

[08:42:00.0000] <adactio>
jgraham: Cool. The outline algorithm is smarter than I thought.

[08:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's smart enough that it confuses me when I try and implement it

[08:42:02.0000] <adactio>
gsnedders: :-)

[08:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So really, Hixie is the person to ask about how it works. I only care if my code is b0rked. :P

[08:44:00.0000] <adactio>
So, I *think* if I had a document like: <body><aside><h1>Bar</h1></aside><h1>Foo</h1></body>, the outline would be Foo -> Bar.

[08:44:01.0000] <adactio>
gsnedders: I fear your code may be b0rked for the file upload part (works fine by URL though).

[08:44:02.0000] <annevk>
why is there no textarea option for the outliner?

[08:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Because I'm lazy.

[08:45:00.0000] <annevk>
typical

[08:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I'm a teenager, remember? :P

[08:47:00.0000] <adactio>
Yup, that's one clever algorithm: http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http%3A%2F%2Fadactio.com%2Ftest.html from http://adactio.com/test.html

[08:48:00.0000] <Rik`>
adactio: maybe https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document can help

[08:52:00.0000] <adactio>
This *does* make sense to me: I just have to keep reminding myself that the body element is sectioning content. If I mentally replace body with section, it becomes clearer to me: <section><aside><h1>Bar</h1></aside><h1>Foo</h1></section> = Foo -> Bar

[08:53:00.0000] <annevk>
that foo is higher level makes sense to me

[08:53:01.0000] <annevk>
but that it comes before bar...

[08:53:02.0000] <annevk>
meh

[08:54:00.0000] <Rik`>
annevk: there should be an untitled section maybe

[08:55:00.0000] <Rik`>
1. Untitled section 1.1 Bar 2. Foo

[08:55:01.0000] <adactio>
annevk: It makes sense (though it's not exactly intuitive): you could have a bunch of sectioning content things (navs, asides, etc.) *before* you introduce the heading of your content.

[08:56:00.0000] <adactio>
Rik`: that's what I initially expected but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense that it's 1. Foo 1.1 Bar

[08:57:00.0000] <adactio>
It isn't exactly easy to explain, though. But maybe I'll give it a shot with a blog post.

[08:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
It feels very intuitive to me... If it didn't work like this it would be broken for common cases like adactio's original example

[08:59:00.0000] <Rik`>
yeah, I guess so

[08:59:01.0000] <adactio>
jgraham: for me, it's initially unintuitive but then becomes sensible ...if that makes sense.

[09:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
adactio: Yeah :)

[09:05:00.0000] <annevk>
so scrollIntoView() and #target use the same algorithm

[09:45:00.0000] <annevk>
can someone help me out with a definition for scrollIntoView?

[09:46:00.0000] <annevk>
basically, you need to go through all ancestor scrolling containers (in order), queue tasks to dispatch events and abort the moment you hit a scroll container which is not same-origin with the current one

[09:47:00.0000] <annevk>
scrolling containers can be either element or viewport

[10:12:00.0000] <annevk>
i have something now...

[10:12:01.0000] <annevk>
  For each ancestor element or viewport that establishes a scrolling box starting with the innermost scrolling box, in order:

[10:12:02.0000] <annevk>
    if the Document associated with the element or viewport is not same origin with the Document associated with the element on which the method was invoked terminate these steps.

[10:12:03.0000] <annevk>
    if the align to top flag is set align the top of border box of the element with the top of the scrolling box

[10:12:04.0000] <annevk>
    otherwise, align the bottom of the border box of the element with the bottom of the scrolling box

[10:12:05.0000] <annevk>
    left/right?

[10:12:06.0000] <annevk>
    queue a task ...

[10:13:00.0000] <annevk>
not very good but better than what is in HTML5

[10:15:00.0000] <nimbupani>
"If the document associated with the element on which scrolltoView was called is not same origin as document associated with the viewport or parent element, do not continue"

[11:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Gah, my Xbox 360 after being unused for five months has decided to start crashing on me… in a I'm going to die way.

[11:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
In my day, there was no such thing as a console "crashing".

[11:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Crazy people, putting operating systems on gaming consoles.  You get what you deserve.

AryehGregor: You're in your mid-20s.  Today is "back in [your] day".

[11:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Early 20s, not mid-20s.

[11:06:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm 22.

[11:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, you're a year younger than I thought.

[11:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
My day vis-a-vis gaming consoles was circa 1998.

[11:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I had a Super NES, and some Gameboys.

[11:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is about 22.6276 years old, in fact.

/me wonders why Hixie's bug-response script posts the diff in a separate comment from the response

[11:36:01.0000] <ojan>
AryehGregor: thx

[11:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: You want a Wii

[11:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: completely unrelated scripts

[11:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
my response is a bookmarklet

[11:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
the diff is my commit script

[11:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why aren't they the same script?

[11:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't commit if i reject

[11:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, makes sense.

[11:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
they also run in different computers in different cities

[11:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
my response is done in my web browser on my laptop

[11:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
the commit is done on a computer I ssh to

[11:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That part isn't an a priori reason why they should be separate, though.

[11:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://thewildernessdowntown.com/ is kinda awesome 

[11:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
Need to work out why it isn't working in Opera

[11:45:02.0000] <ojan>
Is there any chance of getting a change to DOM3 Core?

[11:45:03.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: ^^^

[11:46:00.0000] <ojan>
WebKit is planning on changing to match Gecko https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19524

[11:46:01.0000] <ojan>
which violates the DOM3 Core spec

[11:46:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why does it open a billion windows in different places?

[11:46:03.0000] <jgraham>
ojan: Web DOM Core FTW

[11:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: well somewhere i have to have a browser so i can see the bug in the first place, and i'd rather not to that part over ssh

[11:46:05.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: and the commit can't be done anywhere by the machine where i edit

[11:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: so... the simplest solution is what i have :-)

[11:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: That is part of the experience

[11:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: yes, you just have to find an editor first

[11:47:03.0000] <hober>
I noticed the other day that Emacs' html-mode has some special highlighting for a <rev> element.

[11:47:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
They got opened in random hard-to-see places, though.

[11:47:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Thanks, metacity.

[11:47:06.0000] <jgraham>
It seems like they could have not used OS windows though

[11:47:07.0000] <hober>
Any idea what bizarre side-road of HTML history had such an element?

[11:47:08.0000] <jgraham>
Just <div>s 

[11:48:00.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: that sounds...complicated

[11:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
hober: Maybe it's got element names and attribute names in the same list?

[11:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
emacs' html-mode is quite dreadful

[11:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me remembers that he's supposed to mark bugs he filed as CLOSED if he likes the resolution

[11:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me forgets that he should do that.

[11:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me too

[11:50:01.0000] <hober>
jgraham: indeed. I've looked into updating its lists of elements & attributes to match HTML5, which is when I encountered this weird <rev> thing.

[11:50:02.0000] <hober>
Philip`: that's what I first thought, but the special highlighting happens for <rev>foo</rev> and not <a rev=foo href=bar>baz</a>

[11:51:00.0000] <hober>
I couldn't find such an element in HTML 3.0 or HTML+, which seemed like the best bets in terms of elements-that-never-were

[11:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
You already tried the common source of insane elements :)

[11:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe it's just a bug?

[11:53:00.0000] <hober>
Yeah, it's probably a vestige of some other format the sgml-mode.el's author commonly edited at the time

[12:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Enums are a mess.

[12:31:00.0000] <abarth>
hsivonen: i think our document.write blow-away-the-document behavior should match the spec

[12:31:01.0000] <abarth>
hsivonen: maybe we should look at a reduction?

[12:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me finds a spec bug in WebKit reflection code that's only reproducible if you set particular attributes in a particular *order*.  Sigh.

[12:57:00.0000] <cheeser>
fun

[13:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me finds it interesting that his test suite has so far found more WebKit bugs than Gecko bugs, even though he's not done filing WebKit bugs yet.

[13:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me isn't sure if this is because Gecko follows the specs, or because the specs follow Gecko.

[13:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(both are low, though, compared to IE or Opera)

[13:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Could be both, to be honest.

[13:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(especially compared to IE)

[13:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what are the specs in question/

[13:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
?

[13:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is on my reflection tests, http://aryeh.name/tests/reflection.html

[13:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://aryeh.name/tests/bugs_filed.txt

[13:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've filed basically every bug I found in Gecko, but only some of the WebKit bugs so far.

[13:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(ignoring things that have pending spec bugs open)

[13:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
most of why I see reported in Safari is dir on various elements

[13:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, put "dir" (with quotes) in the box to hide that.

[13:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I haven't reported most of the enum stuff yet, since browsers disagree a lot and some of it's changed very recently or might change soon.

[13:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was told that a bunch of the enum stuff changed recently, Firefox nightlies have it but not betas yet.

[13:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, I'm filing bugs on all of it, at least for Gecko and WebKit.

[15:58:00.0000] <annevk>
ojan, Hixie, I plan to update DOM 3 Core

[15:58:01.0000] <annevk>
rename it Web DOM Core or something

[15:58:02.0000] <annevk>
but CSSOM CSS Values is first

[16:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, so, why is Google recommending people use SPF softfail?  Peculiar.  http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=178723

[16:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[16:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gmail.com, yahoo.com, hotmail.com, aol.com, microsoft.com all use either softfail or not even that.

[16:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is hard fail unsafe or something?

[16:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Aha, Facebook uses hard fail.

[16:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So do Blogger, Twitter, and YouTube.

[16:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Can't be totally unsafe.

[16:31:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, of course, they must set it to softfail because it breaks forwarding.

[16:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Makes sense.

[16:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I'll use hard fail for my domain.

[18:39:00.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: for the record, i'm a big fan of the everything in one page-ness of HTML5

[18:39:01.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: makes searching for things so much easier.

[18:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: hear hear

[18:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: i'm vaguely hoping we can import things like XHR into the complete.html file at some point

[18:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
ojan: and maybe the File API specs, DOM Core, CSSOM, etc

[18:43:02.0000] <ojan>
holy crap. i'm reading the DOM3 core spec for the first time in a while. 

[18:43:03.0000] <ojan>
so many exceptions for things noone would care about.

[18:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's a really poorly written spec

[18:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
there's like no MUSTs anywhere

[18:43:06.0000] <Hixie>
for example

[18:43:07.0000] <ojan>
hah. totally

[18:44:00.0000] <ojan>
and there's ambiguous cases

[18:44:01.0000] <ojan>
of which exception you should fire

[18:45:00.0000] <ojan>
at first glance it seems like a classic case of overgeneralizing instead of focusing on the needs of web pages

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes, they were considering Java servers at least as much

[18:48:00.0000] <boogyman>
<Hixie> ojan: i'm vaguely hoping we can import things like XHR into the complete.html file at some point <---- boo

[18:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
boo?  Why?

[18:49:01.0000] <boogyman>
abstraction isn't evil :P

[18:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I am unsure of how whether or not XHR shows up in complete.html has any bearing on something's abstraction level.

[18:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't even know what *could* be affected.

[18:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: abstraction what?

[18:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: how does it affect abstraction?

[18:53:00.0000] <boogyman>
hm, maybe I am misinterpreting your statement. can you explain more about importing the XHR 

[18:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You probably understood it correctly.  He just means taking the current XHR spec, and making it a section of the HTML5 spec.

[18:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The question is, what does this make more or less abstract, and how?

[18:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
i just mean have the XHR spec be in complete.html, just like all of HTML and WebStorage and so on is complete.html

[18:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
s/is/are in/

[18:55:00.0000] <boogyman>
ah, i was thinking you were talking about the implementation. merging the front-end and backend

[18:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Now *I* don't understand what you mean.

[18:56:00.0000] <ojan>
Hixie: i'm a big fan. too many disparate places too look.

[18:56:01.0000] <boogyman>
just forget it. evidently I was having a brain fart

[18:56:02.0000] <boogyman>
I agree it should be included int he HTML spec

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>

it feels weird to not come here for ws protocol discussion, now that the IETF has taken it over completely

[00:36:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/ defines scrollIntoView now

[00:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: the spec bans <select required><option value selected disabled>Choose one...

[00:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if some Web compat requirements are violated by allowing a script-inserted external script use a script that was loaded as the result of speculative parsing seeing the same URL in the document source

[00:47:00.0000] <annevk>
if it's just GET it should be fine

[00:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: if sites don't violate HTTP...

[00:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but yeah

[00:48:00.0000] <annevk>
it would be pretty weird if it was different a few seconds later

[00:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. our code is suspicious

[00:48:02.0000] <annevk>
afaict the only metric the server has here is a timestamp

[00:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sicking isn't on IRC :-(

[00:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: also cookies

[00:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but cookies are racy anyway

[00:50:00.0000] <annevk>
oops, forgot about cookies

[01:21:00.0000] <kennyluck>
Any reason why "lyrics" is not a kind of <track> now?

[01:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
kennyluck: what would it do?

[01:32:00.0000] <Peter`>
It could be a use-case for <track> together with <audio>, although it'd be hard to decide rendering for it

[01:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
<audio> is <video> with no rendering

[01:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you want rendering, use <video>

[01:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
(even if your data is audio data)

[01:33:03.0000] <kennyluck>
Hixie: When you want to learn to sing a song.

[01:33:04.0000] <kennyluck>
Hixie: Okay.

[01:57:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: that means <video> is supposed to accept content of type audio/* in src?

[01:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
virtuelv: yes and it does

[01:59:01.0000] <virtuelv>
it's not really apparent from, at least, the w3c document

[01:59:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
virtuelv: what's more, audio/* can contain a video track

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: the only differences between <video> and <audio> are that <video> has a rendering area (audio does not) and audio has a convenient constructor (video does not)

[02:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if some security mechanism vetoes an external script, should multi-level document.write()s still behave as if the script blocked the parser?

[02:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
abarth: I figured out why the uglyducklinghouse blog didn't break in Chromium. (WebKit and Gecko run script-inserted scripts differently)

[02:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Gecko isn't conforming

[02:02:02.0000] <abarth>
ic

[02:02:03.0000] <abarth>
btw, i really like syncing tests via html5lib

[02:03:00.0000] <abarth>
that's working really well for us

[02:03:01.0000] <abarth>
sorry we haven't added any test cases in a while

[02:03:02.0000] <virtuelv>
multiple audio tracks for a video stream, is that handled any way yet?

[02:03:03.0000] <abarth>
i wish there was some way to expand that to more aspects of the platform

[02:03:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I have started importing the tests, but this script execution thing is more urgent

[02:04:00.0000] <abarth>
hsivonen: yeah, the extra tests are good for when you've resolved all the issues you know about and you're looking to polish more

[02:04:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
virtuelv: not really, it's not exposed in any way in the api although the browser could have ui for selecting an audio track

[02:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the test happily have test cases for problems I know about, too, so I don't need to write tests for those

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Are Content Security Policies being implemented in non-Gecko engines?

[02:06:01.0000] <annevk>
we thought about it

[02:07:00.0000] <annevk>
but currently it's rather complex

[02:07:01.0000] <annevk>
there's some WG starting up about it

[02:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
my immediate concern is document.write() semantics when CSP vetoes a document.written external script

[02:07:03.0000] <abarth>
i'd be interesting in implementing the parts that help with XSS

[02:08:00.0000] <abarth>
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/CSP/AllowedScripts

[02:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I'm going to preserve existing behavior on that point for now

[02:08:02.0000] <abarth>
the rest seems mostly uncessary

[02:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
even though I'm not sure I like the existing behavior

[02:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fwiw, the existing behavior is that vetoed existing scripts behave like empty inline scripts for document.write() purposes

[02:11:01.0000] <annevk>
oh god

[02:11:02.0000] <annevk>
yet another origin-like syntax?!

[02:11:03.0000] <annevk>
boo

[02:11:04.0000] <abarth>
oh, i don't care about the syntax

[02:11:05.0000] <abarth>
i just copied whatever CSP was using at the time

[02:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
s/existing/external/

[02:12:01.0000] <annevk>
we should just use plain ASCII serialized origins rather than all the wildcard complexity

[02:13:00.0000] <abarth>
wildcards are a common request for postMessage's targetOrigin

[02:14:00.0000] <abarth>
personally, i'd rather skip wildcards

[02:14:01.0000] <annevk>
I had a few for CORS, but nothing strong

[02:14:02.0000] <abarth>
since folks shouldn't be using that many host names

[02:14:03.0000] <abarth>
(so slowwwww)

[02:14:04.0000] <annevk>
CORS used to have complex origin syntax; quite glad we got rid of that at least

[02:15:00.0000] <abarth>
none / self / * seem to make sense

[02:16:00.0000] <abarth>
so maybe keep those and origin literals

[02:16:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, and use "/" for self just like postMessage() (once Hixie fixed the spec again)

[02:16:02.0000] <annevk>
or have postMessage use self

[02:18:00.0000] <abarth>
"/" makes more sense for postmessage

[02:18:01.0000] <abarth>
since its like a relative URL

[02:23:00.0000] <abarth>
annevk: ok, done

[02:24:00.0000] <abarth>
(once the page saves...)

[02:24:01.0000] <abarth>
there

[02:24:02.0000] <annevk>
yay

[03:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the lack of mutual understanding of what the spec says over at http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9843 bothers me

[03:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
because it might mean that my reading comprehension sucks badly

[03:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm unhappy about the ability to move nodes between documents so that the parser inserts stuff into a document that isn't the document the parser is associated with

[03:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I expect there to be bugs in that area

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
especially in script execution

[03:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and style sheets blocking scripts

[03:13:02.0000] <annevk>
wait, how does that happen?

[03:14:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh, hmm

[03:14:01.0000] <annevk>
can that really happen? ouch

[03:14:02.0000] <jgraham>
Moving a script that document.writes?

[03:18:00.0000] <annevk>
charset registry bah

[03:18:01.0000] <annevk>
i wish i had some more time

[03:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: <div><script>// move the div to another doc</script><!-- stuff goes into the other doc -->

[03:23:00.0000] <annevk>
that is some insane trickery

[03:23:01.0000] <tantek>
yeah that's pretty nuts

[03:24:00.0000] <tantek>
hsivonen - minor validator.nu bugfix (I hope) when you've got a moment - allowing ins/del datetime to take only a date (not just a datetime) - http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=763

[03:24:01.0000] <annevk>
fixed scrollIntoView() some more

[03:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: thanks.

[04:06:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, Firefox has <input type=url> support

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk>
no icons, but a red outline when invalid

[04:07:01.0000] <annevk>
also email

[04:07:02.0000] <Rik`>
annevk: url, email, search, tel, <output>

[04:08:00.0000] <annevk>
search has no UI at all?

[04:08:01.0000] <Rik`>
nope

[04:08:02.0000] <annevk>
neither has tel

[04:08:03.0000] <annevk>
seems kind of wrongish

[04:09:00.0000] <lonimurar>
http://www.google.de/search?q=internet%20explorer%20%22nicht%20implementiert%22

[04:09:01.0000] <lonimurar>
please look at the first and second results

[04:09:02.0000] <lonimurar>
how do I get something like http://mypa.ge > foo > bar

[04:09:03.0000] <lonimurar>
with foo and bar being actual links

[04:10:00.0000] <lonimurar>
wait this is the wrong channel, sorry

[04:10:01.0000] <Rik`>
annevk: well, people always complain about unstylable search in Safari so :)

[04:10:02.0000] <annevk>
you cannot set -webkit-appearance to none?

[04:10:03.0000] <annevk>
(horrible property name by the way; always wonder whether I spell it correctly)

[04:11:00.0000] <tantek>
/me is curious to hear what kind of default special UI folks expect from the new input types

[04:12:00.0000] <annevk>
on a Mac I would expect <input type=search> to look like it does in Safari

[04:12:01.0000] <annevk>
including the little erase icon

[04:12:02.0000] <Rik`>
annevk: but I think the coolest stuff implemented is support for @form, @formAction and all

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
form="" does not seem to work for me in latest trunk

[04:14:00.0000] <annevk>
at least not dynamically

[04:18:00.0000] <Rik`>
oh yes, haven't tested that before

[04:18:01.0000] <Rik`>
tantek: btw, I sent you a mail about :-moz-placeholder-visible

[04:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a list of all W3C Editor's Drafts somewhere?

[04:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
including Member-confidential ones

[04:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: OTOH, people think the Opera field icons are ugly, so for the adoption of these features, there must be no ugly icons

[04:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
alternatively, does the W3C site have a search engine that searches the Member-confidential stuff?

[04:36:00.0000] <tantek>
Rik` - heh, irc ping about an email about a bug comment. lol.

[04:36:01.0000] <tantek>
hsivonen - I agree about the no ugly icons

[04:36:02.0000] <tantek>
and the problem is - any icon might/could look ugly within the context of a particular visual page design

[04:37:00.0000] <tantek>
Rik` - there's nothing that the extra -visible adds - so shorter is better really

[04:37:01.0000] <tantek>
the control is in the state of having/being a placeholder

[04:40:00.0000] <Rik`>
ok thanks, at least I know someone checked my proposition :)

[04:40:01.0000] <tantek>
np - sorry - email tends to be quite lossy for me.

[05:18:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: maybe you could check out the dev.w3.org and www.w3.org repositories

[05:19:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, yeah, not sure our solution is that great

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I guess that's what I would have to do. I just gave up instead.

[05:20:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: email a feature request to the webmaster

[05:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: ok. I emailed site-comments@

[07:19:00.0000] <annevk>
why did Hixie change the meaning of <dt>?

[07:19:01.0000] <annevk>
oh, I'm reading it wrong

[08:08:00.0000] <miketaylr>
w3c bugzilla is toast

[08:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
<style type=""></style> -> what is supposed to happen here? Should the contents be treated as CSS or not?

[08:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me can't find the relevant UA conformance requirements

[08:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
OK so spec probably doesn't consider it a supported style langauge

[08:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
Opera and IE agree with the spec, Gecko and WebKit agree with each other

[08:12:02.0000] <jgraham>
would be interesting to get data on this

[08:14:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: i dislike the :target styling

[08:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
+1

[08:14:02.0000] <jgraham>
:)

[08:17:00.0000] <cheeser>
bugzilla--

[08:32:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, having getClientRects() differ between CSS and SVG is not good

[08:33:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, as I said, we can use another term than border box which is sometimes border box and sometimes bounding box

[08:51:00.0000] <ReadPlease>
Is this an html5 chan?

[08:52:00.0000] <hober>
sure

[08:58:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[08:58:01.0000] <annevk>
nothing to work on

[08:58:02.0000] <annevk>
unless I'm missing something

[08:58:03.0000] <annevk>
so either test suites or Web Dom Core

[08:59:00.0000] <annevk>
or legacy encodings but I really rather wait with that a little longer

[09:00:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, you around?

[09:00:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
yep

[09:00:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, http://simon.html5.org/specs/ has the latest version right?

[09:00:03.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: You could fix the bug you found in testharness.js

[09:00:04.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, I read through it a few times, seems like a sensible start

[09:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: gsnedders did some more work on Web DOM Core

[09:01:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: no, it's on gsnedders' site somewhere

[09:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
http://hg.gsnedders.com/web-dom-core/

[09:01:03.0000] <annevk>
interesting

[09:02:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, not gonna work on test suites :)

[09:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: It is a trivial fix

[09:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
I would do it but I am not short of things to do

[09:03:02.0000] <jgraham>
:)

[09:04:00.0000] <annevk>
i'll fix it once there's some movement on that test suite

[09:04:01.0000] <annevk>
i've been wondering about pestering vendors about bugs

[09:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: the styling is nice, IMO

[09:13:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: it's distracting me from reading when i click around in the spec

[09:19:00.0000] <ReadPlease>
uh...

[09:19:01.0000] <ReadPlease>
alright, cool.

[09:20:00.0000] <ReadPlease>
I got this thing in google chrome, where if i ctrl-tab right after I click play on a video, then ctrl-shift-tab back, the video is all white.

[09:20:01.0000] <ReadPlease>
I can hear it playing, but I can't see anything, unless I can highlight the video.

[09:20:02.0000] <ReadPlease>
If I can highlight the video, I highlight it and then stuff starts showing up, again.

[09:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
ReadPlease: Sounds like a painting bug in Webkit.  File a bug with them.

[09:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Sweets next to computer = badness.

[09:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
*badass

[09:36:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk, I've done a few  things at http://bitbucket.org/ms2ger/web-dom-core

[09:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ms2ger: Based on my copy of the spec or Simon's?

[09:37:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
gsnedders, yours

[09:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hah

[09:38:00.0000] <annevk>
oh sweet

[09:38:01.0000] <annevk>
do you want to be the editor instead?

[09:39:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
All yours ;)

[09:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
Web DOM Core is going to get a reputation for being the slut of spec land; everyone's had a go on it but no one wants commitment

[09:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Well, the ho has already touched it.

[09:43:00.0000] <annevk>
how do you hg clone something into an existing repository?

[09:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: You don't 

[09:45:00.0000] <annevk>
so should I do something else?

[09:45:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
hg pull <repo>?

[09:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Ms2ger: will that work?

[09:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: What are you trying to do?

[09:47:00.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger, nope

[09:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Why not just clone the repo and edit the default push destination to be something else if that's what you want?

[09:48:00.0000] <annevk>
i guess the problem is that i'm still working with directories

[09:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
You want one repo per atomic peice of content

[09:53:00.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger, I have to go soonish, but could you help me out with the commandline foo needed for Makefile? :)

[09:54:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
1. Get my anolis fork

[09:54:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
2. `make`

[09:54:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
3. ???

[09:54:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
4. Obligatory profit!

[09:55:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
4. Profit^H^H^H^H^H^H You get to be editor of WDC

[09:55:01.0000] <annevk>
ah

[09:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Ms2ger: You've forked Anolis?

[09:55:03.0000] <annevk>
it complaints about anolis

[09:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe annevk will take WDC to ISO and make browser members pay thounsands of dollars a copy?

[09:58:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
http://bitbucket.org/ms2ger/anolis

[10:00:00.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger, heh, planning on taking over the spec world? :)

[10:00:01.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger, quite a nice set of tools

[10:00:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk, too much time on my hands :)

[10:01:00.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger, I have a bitbucket account, maybe you can add me to the project

[10:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ms2ger: I guess I should push Anolis2 somewhere…

[10:01:02.0000] <Ms2ger>
Sure

[10:01:03.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger, might as well fix the spec there

[10:04:00.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk, done

[10:04:01.0000] <annevk>
cool

[11:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: are you around?

[11:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: yes

[11:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: you're the one responsible for the script that adds issue markers to the spec, right?

[11:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah

[11:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
can you get it to not say "Last call for comments" for every marker, at least in the W3C version?

[11:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(since in the W3C context that is not accurate, and having that on every single issue marker doesn't add much)

[11:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
as an added bonus, if this is done, we can close HTML WG ISSUE-116

[11:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: I guess all things are possible

[11:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
It is a while since I looked at the code though

[11:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I figure it's probably still easier for you than for someone new to learn how it works

[11:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: What do you want, exactly?

[11:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
No status annotations on the W3C version?

[11:55:02.0000] <jgraham>
just ISSUE markers?

[11:55:03.0000] <othermaciej>
yes please

[11:55:04.0000] <jgraham>
OK I guess that will not be so hard

[12:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: D2D is now on by default in Minefield, so you could be seeing a D2D vs no D2D difference.

[12:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: did you see it the first time?

[13:04:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: ok

[13:04:01.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: will check a nightly tomorrow

[13:19:00.0000] <dandaman>
hi

[13:21:00.0000] <dandaman>
I have a site where the height of one of my divs is 100% as to fill the whole screen(for a mobile site). it works fine, problem is, i have a form on it that when you enter an invalid input a little box gets displayed and pushes some stuff down which spills out of the height. Is there a way to make the height reset once the box is displayed so that it will cover everything?

[13:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I missed it the first time as my train was late

[13:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: So this will be my first time (and probably last time, seeming it closes in London in October)

[14:15:00.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger, not sure what timezone you are in, but I'll look at it tomorrow

[14:16:00.0000] <annevk>
Ms2ger, I briefly looked at your stuff before dinner though and it seems like you made quite some progress; so great

[14:16:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
annevk, and I probably introduced quite some bugs too :)

[14:20:00.0000] <annevk>
heh

[14:21:00.0000] <annevk>
we'll sort them out in due course

[14:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me loves having tests checked in with the spec

[14:29:00.0000] <annevk>
well really tests should be written by someone else than the spec writer

[14:30:00.0000] <annevk>
but you can't have it all

[14:30:01.0000] <Ms2ger>
If someone else volunteers to write tests, I'm all for it

[14:32:00.0000] <annevk>
btw, it's really quite awesome that you just took the spec and wrote bits

[14:33:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess we should make specs more accessible so it's easier for people to fix things

[14:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, now I filed all Gecko and WebKit bugs I found.

[14:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I filed as many spec bugs as Gecko plus WebKit combined.

[14:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(in my reflections test suite)

[14:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe I'll try filing all the bugs in IE9, just to be fair.

[14:38:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although the Windows 7 machine is in another room.  :(

[15:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
dandaman: No.  You need flexbox to make things fill all available space.  For now, you need script.

[15:59:00.0000] <llrcombs>
who wants to read some BS?

[16:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hahahaha.

[16:01:01.0000] <llrcombs>
some of the funniest shit ever

[16:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sigh at marketing departments.

[16:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think the only accurate thing on the second link is "Manageability".

[16:03:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, that's the most important thing to corporate IT departments . . .

[16:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The "Privacy" entry doesn't even make any sense for Firefox.  That also separates the URL and search bars.

[16:07:00.0000] <llrcombs>
they market IE as if people not using it didn't know they could

[16:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What's IE?

[16:09:01.0000] <llrcombs>
internet exploder

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
"By default, Internet Explorer 8 separates the address bar and search bar functions to help ensure that what you type in your address bar stays private and isnât shared with anyone"

[16:13:01.0000] <nessy>
point is: they've lost market share to firefox and chrome and it hurts!

[16:13:02.0000] <nessy>
yeah, I laughed about that one, too :)

[16:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
i hope someone points out how IE9 is LESS PRIVACY CONSCIOUS when it comes out

[16:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
"MICROSOFT SAYS IE9 REGRESSES PRIVACY"

[16:15:00.0000] <espadrine>
Well then, I'll drop Chrome: it isn't compatible, it doesn't have tab isolation, developer tools are absent, and it certainly isn't easy to use! Let alone security, which isn't made a feature!

[16:16:00.0000] <llrcombs>
lol

[16:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's wrong with what Hixie quoted?  It's considerably less false than most of the rest.

[16:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, the list is just something for ignorant IE defenders to present to anyone who suggests they switch.

[16:23:02.0000] <hdhoang>
AIUI, IE9 merges them

[16:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's not meant to convince anyone.

[16:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just to provide plausible deniability.

[16:24:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Hixie typed it and then followed it up with the fact that IE9 uses the single bar like everyone else.

[16:24:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I thought no IE9 UI details were announced?

[16:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
you're not up to date with yet leaks mah boy :-)

[16:24:05.0000] <Hixie>
er, "yer leaks"

[16:24:06.0000] <Hixie>
i can't even fake accents when typing

[16:24:07.0000] <Hixie>
i suck

[16:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I saw mention of a leak, but I thought it wasn't really credible.

[16:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
what, you think microsoft faked their own screenshot that they then pulled down? :-)

[16:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Possibly.

[16:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The analysis I looked at observed that the contents of the browser window seemed incongruous as to what date it was taken at, so they suggested maybe it was a mockup.

[16:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
why pull it down then?

[16:27:02.0000] <llrcombs>
is JScript getting more similar to JavaScript?

[16:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know.

[16:28:01.0000] <llrcombs>
maybe in IE13, you'll be able to write JS to-spec that works in WK+Gecko and it'll work in IE too!

[16:28:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The beta's out in like two weeks, we'll see.

[16:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
llrcombs, you didn't see their lengthy blog posts about how they're ES5 conformant and have removed lots of IE-only features?

[16:28:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE9 is going to be a *huge* step forward in web compat.

[16:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although that's not saying much, for IE.

[16:29:01.0000] <llrcombs>
so I've heard

[16:29:02.0000] <llrcombs>
but I'd expect that they've still managed to screw up somehow

[16:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
IE6, 7, and 8 were all huge steps forward too

[16:29:04.0000] <llrcombs>
wait, it didn't support CSS backgrounds or borders before?

[16:29:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, true.

[16:29:06.0000] <Rik`>
so far, the only screw up people noticed is dropping XP support

[16:29:07.0000] <llrcombs>
@ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_9

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
they release browsers so rarely that they have to make huge steps forward just to keep up

[16:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not CSS3 backgrounds and borders.

[16:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE8 was fully CSS2.1-compliant.  For real AFAICT, not just as a marketing bullet.

[16:30:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, true.

[16:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
"fully CSS2.1-compliant" is meaningless

[16:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
i guarantee i could find a CSS2.1 bug in IE8.

[16:30:06.0000] <llrcombs>
/me wishes Apple released minor Safari versions a bit more often

[16:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I believe I read a Slashdot comment by bzbarsky saying that he thought IE8 had a CSS2.1 implementation at least as conformant as anyone's.

[16:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, nothing is *perfect*.  But it's as good as the other browsers if not better.

[16:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
IE8's 2.1 impl is, as far as I know, equal or better than everyone else's.

[16:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's possible

[16:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
but that's nothing like "fully" :-)

[16:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
IE6's CSS1 impl was equal or better than everyone else's too

[16:32:00.0000] <aho>
back then

[16:32:01.0000] <aho>
9 years ago

[16:32:02.0000] <aho>
:>

[16:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[16:32:04.0000] <Rik`>
http://jhop.me/ie8-bugs

[16:32:05.0000] <aho>
i still have to support that pos btw :_

[16:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, but IE7's CSS was terrible compared to the competition.

[16:34:01.0000] <llrcombs>
I mean, WebKit has something new every day (at least), be it a bugfix or a new feature

[16:34:02.0000] <Rik`>
IE8 was a huge step forward but it was more like building a foundation for improvements

[16:34:03.0000] <llrcombs>
Safari's updated less than monthly

[16:35:00.0000] <llrcombs>
so most people don't get WebKit's new stuff for a while

[16:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: well yeah, they worked on it for 6 months when everyone else had spent 6 years on it

[16:35:02.0000] <Rik`>
llrcombs: same for every engine

[16:35:03.0000] <llrcombs>
Google's fairly nice about pushing out Chrome updates

[16:35:04.0000] <Rik`>
I'm not sure I'd call it "nice"

[16:35:05.0000] <aho>
i really like those 2 minutes of awkward silence my comment has caused :>~

[16:35:06.0000] <llrcombs>
well, updates go out more often than most

[16:36:00.0000] <Rik`>
yes and mistakes too

[16:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chrome is great.

[16:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Are there many glitches that get through to Chrome stable?

[16:36:03.0000] <aho>
ff4 looks pretty nice too

[16:36:04.0000] <aho>
(+the new firebug... it's fast!)

[16:36:05.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: the state of form validation was

[16:36:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
They release a new version every six weeks now, but any given feature is likely to spend more than that being tested in beta and dev, as I understand it.

[16:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, that was a Safari bug too.

[16:37:01.0000] <Rik`>
yes

[16:37:02.0000] <llrcombs>
Rik`: that was a WebKit issue

[16:37:03.0000] <Rik`>
but a pretty big one…

[16:37:04.0000] <llrcombs>
they pulled it

[16:37:05.0000] <llrcombs>
the WK team

[16:37:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it's fixed in Chrome, right?

[16:37:07.0000] <llrcombs>
no

[16:37:08.0000] <llrcombs>
pulled altogether

[16:37:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's what I meant.

[16:37:10.0000] <llrcombs>
the feature's gone from WK

[16:37:11.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was the one who reported that bug, you know.  :P

[16:37:12.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, it's just disabled.

[16:37:13.0000] <llrcombs>
I hope they re-add it with a workable implementation

[16:37:14.0000] <llrcombs>
well, pulled from usability

[16:38:00.0000] <llrcombs>
you get the picture

[16:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
They will.  It's still there, just disabled until there's UI.

[16:38:02.0000] <llrcombs>
ahh, nice!

[16:38:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was banging on them about that bug for weeks before they pulled it.

[16:38:04.0000] <llrcombs>
I was the one that filed the bug to add a volume control in <video>

[16:38:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45804

[16:39:00.0000] <llrcombs>
what'd you file it with Chromium for?

[16:39:01.0000] <llrcombs>
that's a pet peeve of mine

[16:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40747

[16:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I filed it with Chromium first because I didn't have Safari handy to test in.

[16:39:04.0000] <llrcombs>
people who either a. file bugs with Chromium that should be in WebKit

[16:39:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
So couldn't initially confirm where it was.

[16:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Fixed: July 27.  My first bug filed: June 3.

[16:40:01.0000] <llrcombs>
and b. post in blogs about how WK (or other software) needs such-and-such new feature or bugfix, but never file a bug

[16:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
As it turned out, the one doing the work was Tamura Kent, who's with Chromium anyway, so he saw it.

[16:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
My WebKit bug was filed less than two weeks later anyway.

[16:40:04.0000] <llrcombs>
there were several blog posts which, at some point, asked for a volume control in WebKit <video>

[16:40:05.0000] <llrcombs>
dating back months

[16:41:00.0000] <llrcombs>
I filed a bug, it was fixed in.. how long was it?

[16:41:01.0000] <llrcombs>
lemme check

[16:41:02.0000] <aho>
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22500 <- filed that boring one... no one cared :_

[16:43:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: this bug was kind of big

[16:44:00.0000] <Rik`>
I mean, while you implement it, you'll see it

[16:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The interactive validation thing?

[16:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, it was completely ridiculous.

[16:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
tkent thought it was acceptable for some reason.

[16:44:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I still have no idea why.

[16:44:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Every other WebKit person I asked seemed to think it was a bad idea, but not enough to actually ensure that it got fixed.

[16:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least not until it made it into major releases.

[16:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's going to destroy the utility of HTML5 form validation stuff.

[16:45:02.0000] <Rik`>
I don't even understand how Apple let it pass through QA

[16:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I had to completely disable all of it for MediaWiki.

[16:45:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because practically no sites use the attributes.

[16:45:05.0000] <Rik`>
well, mediawiki is kind of used

[16:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It was only in trunk versions.

[16:46:01.0000] <Rik`>
Facebook uses required too

[16:46:02.0000] <Rik`>
(don't know when they added it)

[16:46:03.0000] <Rik`>
anyway, I mean it's freaking obvious you're gonna break sites

[16:47:00.0000] <Rik`>
so yeah, Chrome is "cool"

[16:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But in this case, the fast release cycle works to everyone's advantage.  Since the fix will be pushed out quickly.

[16:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Safari 5 got the breakage too.

[16:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But won't get the fix so quickly.

[16:49:00.0000] <Rik`>
isn't it already fixed ?

[16:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, I expect Chrome probably already has the fix.

[16:49:02.0000] <Rik`>
in a minor version ?

[16:49:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is it?

[16:49:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know.

[16:49:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, slow release cycles don't help you if your QA isn't more rigorous.

[16:49:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
QA is really orthogonal to release speed.

[16:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chrome makes it really easy to use experimental versions, that's one thing I like about it.

[16:51:00.0000] <llrcombs>
power's out!

[16:51:01.0000] <Rik`>
no, Safari is not fixed yet…

[16:51:02.0000] <Rik`>
great for moving forward…
