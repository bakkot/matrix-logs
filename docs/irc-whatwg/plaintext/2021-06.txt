Oh, a lot has changed since I last checked here. I see that GlobBot is shutting down soon, and that we are moving to Matrix.

hello - I wondered if anyone was about who could answer a question on the Streams spec? I'm documenting it for MDN.

rachelandrew: happy to help.

it was about how TransformStreamDefaultController is constructed, it doesn't have a constructor, and there doesn't seem to be anything that returns it. So it seems a bit unusual in that regard and I'm trying to be clear to developers as to how it works.

rachelandrew: The only way to get access to a TransformStreamDefaultController is through a transformer's callbacks

[12:26:00.0000] <rachelandrew>
thanks, that was my understanding, but the other editor seemed convinced there ought to be a property of another object. I'm thinking for developers, this is better explained in the constructor docs for TransformStream.

[12:28:23.0000] <Domenic>
rachelandrew: +1 to explaining in the constructor docs (and probably also in the docs page for TransformStreamDefaultController). You can compare with https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#transformer-api especially the last sentence.

[13:05:05.0000] <rachelandrew>
cool :) thank you!

I saw you can customize the <select> "root" element, but the dropdown is still not customizable right?

Reminder that the Matrix channel is now established and the majority of activity is now there. https://whatwg.org/chat has instructions.
