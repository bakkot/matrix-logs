[16:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[20:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if this troll is the same one we have: http://www.amazon.com/review/R26708FG38OUJA/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?%5Fencoding=UTF8&cdMsgNo=6&cdPage=1&cdSort=oldest&cdMsgID=MxJUKSB9JZMAUQ#MxJUKSB9JZMAUQ

[20:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: no clue, but poking around there, it's interesting to see that Amazon is asserting a trademark on the term "Real Name"

[22:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: not being allowed to use width/height on img for dimentionless svg is not nice

[22:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: consider <img alt=":)" src="http://simon.html5.org/sandbox/svg/smileys/smile" width="15" height="15">

[22:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe i could make my smileys have dimentions but dimensionless svg is nice in general, imho

[23:02:00.0000] <heycam>
is it known that some links from attributes (in the green boxes) to their definitions are broken in the multipage version of the spec?

[23:03:00.0000] <heycam>
e.g. i notice that clicking on 'width' from http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content-0.html#the-img-element takes me to something unrelated

[23:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
heycam: how is it unrelated?

[23:05:00.0000] <heycam>
oh, i see it isn't unrelated

[23:05:01.0000] <heycam>
sorry for the noise

[23:05:02.0000] <heycam>
i just got confused that it didn't go to the closest mentions of width/height from that point

[23:06:00.0000] <heycam>
and noticed it jumped to the-canvas-element.html

[23:06:01.0000] <heycam>
(but i guess it is known that those filenames aren't the best)

[23:07:00.0000] <heycam>
zcorpan, where is the text that would disallow your width/height on dimensionless svg?

[23:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: img { height: 1em; }

[23:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: height=15 is wrong.

[23:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
heycam: http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=2473&to=2474

[23:09:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: it would look weird when stylesheets are disabled

[23:09:02.0000] <heycam>
ok

[23:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: but i digress

[23:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: and height=15 would look weird when i zoomed the text in, so what?

[23:10:02.0000] <heycam>
what's the purpose of "The two attributes must be omitted if the resource in question does not have both an intrinsic width and an intrinsic height"?

[23:10:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: browsers have full zoom these days :)

[23:11:00.0000] <heycam>
why not word it in terms of an intrinsic aspect ratio instead?

[23:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i guess we could, send feedback

[23:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me goes to add width="15" height="15" to his smileys

[23:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: that's the wrong solution. it won't work when you change the font size.

[23:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i mean in the svg

[23:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
right, me too

[23:14:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: so what's the right solution?

[23:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
having a viewBox="" coordinate space defined, and giving the dimensions in css

[23:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
(in the svg and the html respectively)

[23:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
that was not my most eloquent answer ever

[23:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
you could still specify dimensions in css, i just want a reasonable default

[23:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know that there's a solution to that. what does '1em' mean in the <svg height=""> attribute? i guess the font-size doesn't inherit through the <img>, huh

[23:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
not sure

[23:17:01.0000] <heycam>
i think it *should* result in the same as height:1em in the html

[23:18:00.0000] <heycam>
since width/height on <svg> are hints to the container on how it wants to be sized

[23:18:01.0000] <heycam>
(not that it's defined properly, but that's the intent i believe)

[23:18:02.0000] <zcorpan>
in opera it doesn't inherit

[23:19:00.0000] <roc>
there's no way it inherits

[23:19:01.0000] <zcorpan>
1em means 16px

[00:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: "For each token, both algorithms scan the document (via getElementById) for the first element with matching id." -- html5 doesn't scan the document, it scans the table

[00:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the code in Gecko seems to associate legends with forms, but I have no idea if the association is used for anything

[00:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
exposing to AT maybe?

[00:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: generally i recommend black-box testing your assertions, as apparently the code is quite misleading :-)

[00:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I didn't mean to assert that legend behaves as like HTML5 form-associated elements. I meant to assert that it is associated with a form. Wondering about the consequences was about not knowing why.

[00:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I suppose I should ask in a Mozilla newsgroup

[00:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: it might be that it gets exposed to AT that way

[00:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: ah

[00:40:00.0000] <gavin>
the legend doesn't appear in form.elements, but you can get legend.form

[00:41:00.0000] <gavin>
because that's how it was defined at http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/idl-definitions.html , apparently

[00:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that explains it. thanks

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
huh

[01:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i guess we can form-associate them easily enough

[01:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
now I've got a Minefield build with a leaky HTML5 parser, but there are issues with getting the layout started, so it's no good for demo yet

[01:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Apache 1.3 and 2.0 are still supported, since links to documentation are shown prominently on http://httpd.apache.org/

[02:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees http://code.google.com/p/flot/http://code.google.com/p/flot/ - <canvas> seems quite popular for drawing graphs

[02:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[02:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://code.google.com/p/flot/

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on a related note: do the dojo graphics part use canvas or SVG in Safari?

[02:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/do/does/

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me learns that the W3C has 50 WGs http://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/

[02:43:01.0000] <roc>
Philip`: that is pretty cool

[02:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought we established it was 70

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
or was that members of staff

[02:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: are there still WGs that don't operate under the Patent Policy?

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[02:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: or does 70 include Incubators and Interest Groups?

[02:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe

[02:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
http-wg isn't in that list, but i guess it's covered by ietf patent policy?

[02:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how many groups are focusing on things pertaining to "the Web"

[02:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
50, apparently

[02:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thinks "humanity connected" is too vague to be a useful definition for "the Web"

[02:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
The postal system already connects humanity

[03:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
so does e-mail

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
and that's not the Web either

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
(though it is The Internet)

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, the name Semantic Web implicitly concedes that it's a different web (a semantic one)

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me signs up to lecture about HTML5 for 1.5 hours in the spring

[03:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
how do you define what exactly is part of the web and what isn't?

[03:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
and I thought the Semantic Web was supposed to be a subset of the whole web, not a completely different web

[03:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I think "the Web" is the system what people access using a Web browser

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: so the Semantic Web could technically become a part of it more easily than e.g. Web Services

[03:19:01.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: or "whichever services are accessed over http(s) using any software"

[03:19:02.0000] <virtuelv>
which makes both the «browser web» and the «semantic web» a subset of the web

[03:19:03.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: I don't think any HTTP service is part of "the Web"

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: also, I think files served by FTP can be part of the Web

[03:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
The web is anything with "www." at the start of its domain name

[03:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't believe that from a user perspective, "the Web" has expanded to be more than the browsable Web it was in the beginning

[03:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
by that definition, does web based email become part of the web, or do you draw a line between the web interface and the email system?

[03:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I thought the user perspective was that "web" and "internet" meant the same thing, so the more useful perspective is that of developers who are providing useful services to users

[03:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I think email and Usenet aren't part of the Web, but you can build Web UIs for both

[03:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: would you consider an SVN repo whose authentication method precludes browsing to be part of "the Web" if it's on HTTP?

[03:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: is Google Earth part of "the Web" if it requires a special client but downloads stuff over HTTP?

[03:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Is the Flickr API part of the Web even though you need an API-specific client?

[03:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
note that I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with not being part of "the Web". I'm just suggesting that it's not very useful to have an all-encompassing definition that doesn't match perception outside the W3C.

[03:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I don't have a sufficiently well-developed perspective to have any confident answers to those questions :-)

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think it's much easier to draw the line between Google Earth and the Web than to draw the line between an intranet and the Web or to draw the line between an operator-specific "mobile web" and the Web

[03:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i disagree that ftp is part of the web

[03:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
similarly, nor is my local filesystem

[03:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders if hsivonen has seen microsoft's virtual earth

[03:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I haven't

[03:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's an activex implementation of something like google earth

[03:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
where's your line now? :-)

[03:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so if I follow a link from the unicode.org HTTP site to the definition files on ftp.unicode.org, and your browser Just Works, did you browse off the Web?

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[03:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
imho

[03:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm inclined to draw the line at browser built-in feature set plus Flash

[03:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
so my local file system and my mail client are part of the web?

[03:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
as is my text editor?

[03:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
and my shell?

[03:35:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: no, your local mail client isn't

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
"browser" is highly ill-defined

[03:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: coming up for a reason why your local file system isn't but Gmail is is harder

[03:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
if i load seamonkey and open mozilla mail in a tab, it sure looks like mail in my browser

[03:36:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Intuitively, your file system isn't but Gmail is

[03:36:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's not a browsing context

[03:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, someone's local file system generally isn't available over the internet, so there seems to be a clear line there

[03:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
it has a Window object :-)

[03:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so how do *you* define the Web?

[03:37:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: ok, so should some version of IP be involved?

[03:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
i engineer my life around not having to answer that question

[03:37:05.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. by not making mistakes like putting the word "web" into my mission statements

[03:37:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but you ofter say that something isn't part of the Web

[03:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
s/ofter/often/

[03:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
if pressed, i would define the web as anything accessible via HTTP over TCP/IP from the majority of nodes on the internet

[03:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
and would define the internet as the largest collection of publicly accessible tcp/ip nodes

[03:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: even if you need a service-specific client like Google Earth?

[03:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[03:39:03.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting

[03:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
but my definition isn't intended to be useful

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's possible that you might be able to exclude google earth from my definition by defining "accessible via HTTP" as meaning accessible in a manner that doesn't involve any proprietary extensions

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
though if google earth doesn't use any, then yeah, it's definitely part of the web

[03:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm interested in a definition for the reason why I tried to define the Web somewhat unsuccessfully on a panel at TPAC

[03:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
which is?

[03:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
there are various things that purport to be quasi-normative about efforts that pertain to "the Web" but that clearly are talking about something else

[03:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
e.g. AWWW doesn't read like it's describing "the Web"

[03:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
can you give an example?

[03:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are things in AWWW that i think are wrong, but i wouldn't have said it was clearly inapplicable to the web

[03:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#xml-qnames

[03:44:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it has a whole section on XML issues

[03:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
so? xml is used on the web

[03:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
quite a lot, though nothing resembling the amount that, say, ms word is used on the web

[03:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. Atom is on the Web

[03:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's used on the Web, but a document that has such a focus on XML and is mostly silent about HTML, JS and CSS doesn't look like a document whose focus is on what I understand the Web to be

[03:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it's more like a document on W3C activities at the time of writing

[03:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
well don't forget that at the time of writing, html had been declared dead for 6 years

[03:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the people who were involved in its creation are not well-versed in JS or CSS issues

[03:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is Word used "on the Web" because it can load stuff over HTTP?

[03:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think you are mistaking a natural bias caused by the environment in which it was written and the knowledge space and opinions of its authors, for an error in the intended scope of the document

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is your local drive on the Web if you access it over WebDAV on localhost but no one else is allowed to do that?

[03:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
Word is used on the Web because people can upload files and download files to and from the web

[03:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
i would define the web as anything accessible via HTTP over TCP/IP from the majority of nodes on the internet. so no.

[03:49:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Word files can even contain HTTP hyperlinks

[03:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
correct

[03:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i would probably clarify my definition of "HTTP" to exclude all extensions to HTTP, not just proprietary ones.)

[03:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
(thus excluding uPnP, WebDAV, and the like)

[03:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: should the W3C work on getting a public RF spec for .doc in /TR/ ?

[03:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
based on what principle?

[03:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so are intranets on the Web if they are reachable from anywhere on the Internet but require login?

[03:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
is the member-only space of the W3C on the Web?

[03:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you can get to an intranet from a random internet node using nothing but HTTP, then it's an extranet, not an internet.

[03:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if Word docs are part of the Web and we need the Web to be openly specified so that client can be implemented

[03:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
extranet, not intranet, rather

[03:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
and if it's an extranet, i don't know how to distinguish it from a private section of what is definitely on the web

[03:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
so i'd say yes

[03:53:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I thought an extranet is open to one's business partners but an intranet to empoyees

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
clients can already implement all they need to do to handle Word documents, that's just downloading a file

[03:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I think Gmail isn't very different from an extranet

[03:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and the difference between an extranet and an intranet is who has logic credentials

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, yes, seems my definition of extranet was wrong

[03:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. i think the whole discussion is a rathole

[03:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
just rephrase whatever it is that makes you need a definition for "web" to avoid the concept altogether.

[03:55:03.0000] <hsivonen>
btw, I think the biggest bug in my definition at TPAC pertained to excluding intranets

[03:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
clearly, it's a rathole, but not knowing what the Web is seems to cause a whole bunch of ratholes

[03:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how does one know if a particular activity is leading the Web to its full potential without a definition for the Web?

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm still not convinced that HTTP reachability from the largest set of IP nodes is a sufficient criterion, because intuitively, SOAP systems aren't on the Web

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is not the lack of definition of the web. the problem is with the mission "leading the Web to its full potential".

[04:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
can anything that isn't resource-oriented be *on* the Web?

[04:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
HTTP only works with resources, so, by my definition, no

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so what's the Open Web? :-)

[04:02:01.0000] <krijn>
Leading the Rathole to Its Full Potential

[04:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if you could be the Decider, how would you bound the scope of the W3C activities?

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
if i was the decider, i'd close the w3c altogether and spin off smaller groups like the whatwg for each core technology, covered by a patent policy from an umbrella group like the open web foundation

[04:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
the idea of a standards organisation having paid staff and a budget is ridiculous, imho, since it leads to the organisation focusing on what makes money to perpetuate the organisation and keep the people employed, rather than on making the technology better

[04:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I still think that navigability with a browser is a key characteristic of the Web even though saying so leaves the boundaries fuzzy

[04:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think that saying so is flat out wrong

[04:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
RSS/Atom are a key part of the web

[04:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
and it just leads to an even bigger problem, namely, defining "browser"

[04:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
indeed, defining a browser in general is harder, but the browsers actually define what can be authored are few and well-known

[04:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
not really

[04:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. googlers were using chrome for months before anyone outside google new about it

[04:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
at that time, Chrome clearly wasn't setting bounds of possibility to Web authoring

[04:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
it was for people at google :-)

[04:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps browsers need to be reachable from a large set of nodes, too :-)

[04:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
then you need to define browser again

[04:11:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Walled garden browser :)

[04:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
so you can determine what the market you're going to be comparing to is

[04:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I guess browsers could be defined like SCOTUS defines porn :-)

[04:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
well then you might as well just define the Web that way

[04:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
true

[04:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
however, I still think people are in more agreement of recognizing a browser when they see one than in recognizing a part of the Web when they see one

[04:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(The bad thing with going on a panel with short notice is not having time for this kind of review in advance...)

[04:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/with/on/

[04:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(the latter with)

[04:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
the panel was a waste of time -- the premise of the panel was flawed

[04:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
(namely, that there was clear disagreement on whether AWWW should exist, and that that disagreement was on philosophical lines rather than strictly technical liens)

[04:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
but then, i said that before the panel, that's why i refused to go on it :-)

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm not philosophically opposed to a document that describes the architecture of the Web if it read like a description of the architecture of the Web

[04:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
right, so your feedback is just "awww is fine, but could you focus more on [list of topics]"

[04:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
which isn't something you can have a useful panel about

[04:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's the kind of thing that belongs in simple e-mail

[04:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
where someone can then just go ahead and do what you ask for

[04:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: If your use case is that you want to argue against things that talk about the web but ignore HTML/JS/CSS, then you don't need a complete definition of the web, you just need a sufficient fragment of definition that says it includes HTML/JS/CSS and doesn't say anything about what is excluded

[04:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: well, practically, I'm not convinced that allocating resources to writing a document that describes the architecture is a priority

[04:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I also feel I should exclude e.g. my cactus pot which isn't on the Web

[04:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: since everyone working on it is a volunteer, that doesn't seem like a problem.

[04:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: although I agree that in order to make a point, my cactus pot's being on the Web can be undefined

[04:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me suddenly sees a whole new meaning in the phrase "awww isn't that cute", just like that thing with the faces/candlestick

[04:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm, happy mailman mailing list memberships reminder day everyone

[04:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How many did you get?

[04:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
three so far

[04:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
and it's only 4:40am here!

[04:34:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I've only got two

[04:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gotta remember to browse to different URIs for W3C list archives, too

[04:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
just use /latest

[04:35:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, it would be far too easy if the "next message" link actually went to the next month

[04:35:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: that's not what my browsers pick up and remember automatically

[04:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i hate how they don't support linking threads cross-month

[04:35:05.0000] <Hixie>
that loses me so much time

[04:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
especially since i'm always replying years later

[04:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: damomow.com/portal :-)

[04:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
according to my script, whatwg-bounces⊙lwo is the second-most prolific author on the whatwg list. that seems wrong.

[04:36:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tests if domowmow is mobile ok

[04:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder why i'm getting that.

[04:36:05.0000] <Hixie>
works on my ipod

[04:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
my phone OS doesn't have any recent browser releases available :-(

[04:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
except Mini

[04:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
damowmow portal works better on my phone than in IE8 :-)

[04:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's not hard

[04:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me recently totally redesigned the portal's look

[04:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
i like the new look

[04:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
especially in safari

[04:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
a couple of days ago, Opera.com gave me false hope by telling me that Opera 9.62 for Symbian is available

[04:39:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I think the opera.com update announcer script is broken

[04:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
i wish opera would just autoupdate

[04:39:05.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

What? http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=5822#c16

[04:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Spam - see #html-wg ten hours ago

[04:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And still there...

[04:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does Bugzilla make it possible to delete comments?

[04:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I looked for a way that I could delete it myself, but couldn't find any

[04:58:01.0000] <zcorpan>
let's hope bugzilla doesn't get the same amount of spam as the forums...

[04:58:02.0000] <zcorpan>
back when it was spammed i.e.

[04:58:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I've got some level of admin perms on it, but apparently not enough to do things like delete users or comments

[04:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://trac.edgewall.org/prefs/pygments - the HTML5 doctype seems to be growing in popularity

[05:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: If you're reading logs: s/thier/their/ in your comparison document

[05:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
I thought the smart headers algorithm interpreted <td><b>...</b></td> and <td><strong>...</strong></td> as being equivalent to <th>

[05:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
at least, that's the impression I got from jgraham's table inspector UI

[05:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, testing it shows that it doesn't. Only the Experimental option uses that logic. jgraham why is that?

[05:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: That was jsut bad UI

[05:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
but why doesn't smart headers use that logic anyway?

[05:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
Because it doesn't work very well in practice

[05:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, ok. I thought it was relatively common for people to fake headers using <td><b>

[05:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
are there more false positives though?

[05:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
The false positives are an issue (according to Ben)

[05:52:02.0000] <jgraham>
s/an/a serious/

[05:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i've seen a number of tables that use <th> as if it were a caption for the table and then <td> for table headers

[06:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if I should revise my doctype advice to suggest the HTML5 doctype as sooner than I've previously indicated

[06:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I will be out of gloom scenarios regarding the doctype once IE8 has shipped

[06:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, I'd be more inclined to hit the brakes with stuff like <dialog> than with the doctype

[06:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if <dialog> is already beyond the point where it could change to mean an app dialog box

[06:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, it depends of there's any content out there using it

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that's the thing. HTML5 <dialog> has already been hyped

[06:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
and I suspect there's very little of it, except possibly on sites of early adopters like Sam Ruby

[06:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if it's too late to fix the XML 1.1, xml:id and Namespaces usage of DFXP

[06:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: maybe v.nu should give warnings on features authors shouldn't use yet

[06:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: warning about stuff that hasn't shipped could be good, yes

[06:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, do you mean this? http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/

[06:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'd never heard of that before but it was the first result for DFXP

[06:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: yes

[06:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
so I guess you mean "usage in" instead of "usage of"

[06:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: yes

[06:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Doesn't look like the "valid html5" badge has taken hold

[06:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, that's a good thing

[06:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
but what are you basing your assertion on?

[06:37:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Google image search for "valid html5"

[06:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
the reason is probably that v.nu doesn't issue such badges of honour, like the w3c validator does

[06:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and maybe that the badge that exists has a disclaimer next to it saying you shouldn't use it

[06:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Which badge is that?

[06:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
where is that badge located?

[06:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
ah, on simon.html5.org

[06:41:02.0000] <Dashiva>
zcorpan: The majority of places don't include the disclaimer :)

[06:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: where are the other places?

[06:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://datadriven.com.au/2007/03/08/the-new-html-working-group/ and http://dashiva.net/

[06:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
well if there are only 3 pages to find it then it's not so bad

[07:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
The W3C validator doesn't give badges for HTML5 pages - is that an intentional following of the philosophy that badges are bad, or is it just because they haven't got around to building a badge image yet?

[07:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's probably because they haven't made a badge for it yet, or because the spec isn't finalised and the validator is still unstable

[07:17:01.0000] <annevk3>
it does issue a warning when you validate HTML5, that it's still experimental

[07:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
It says "Passed, 1 warning(s)" but the list of potential issues has an "Info" and not a warning

[07:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: get what you want working?

[07:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, no, I can't figure out what type of object is returned by the outliner.

[07:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: section(list)

[07:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
wtf?

[07:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes he is now in a good mood and may be kind enough to write what Lachy wants

[07:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: a subclass of the builtin list object called section

[07:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
this is what I have, mostly copied from toc.py:

[07:36:02.0000] <Lachy>
class adjustheadings:

[07:36:03.0000] <Lachy>
    """Change the heading elements to use the backwards compatible, numbered headings"""

[07:36:04.0000] <Lachy>
    def __init__(self, ElementTree, **kwargs):

[07:36:05.0000] <Lachy>
        # Build the outline of the document

[07:36:06.0000] <Lachy>
        outline_creator = outliner.Outliner(ElementTree, **kwargs)

[07:36:07.0000] <Lachy>
        outline = outline_creator.build(**kwargs)

[07:36:08.0000] <Lachy>
        # Get a list of all the top level sections, and their depth (0)

[07:36:09.0000] <Lachy>
        sections = [(section, 0) for section in reversed(outline)]

[07:36:10.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: pastebin!

[07:36:11.0000] <Lachy>
        section, depth = sections.pop()

[07:36:12.0000] <Lachy>
too much effort

[07:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand what this syntax means: [(section, 0) for section in reversed(outline)]

[07:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: it creates a list of items (section, 0) for each section in outline, backwards

[07:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It's like "r = []; for section in reversed(outline): r.append( (section, 0) ); return r"

[07:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, that makes more sense. why wasn't it just written like that?

[07:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[07:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
too verbose

[07:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
Because that's three lines, which is horribly verbose when you can write it in one

[07:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I think I may have spotted a bug in your code too, from line 66 in toc.py:

[07:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
                    while i <= 6:

[07:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
                        header_text = section.header.find(u"h" + unicode(i))

[07:41:03.0000] <Lachy>
                        if header_text is not None:

[07:41:04.0000] <Lachy>
                            break

[07:41:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: where's the bug?

[07:41:06.0000] <Lachy>
that seems to be an infinite loop, since i isn't incremented anywhere?

[07:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
and it should be .//h

[07:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
what's ".//h" mean?

[07:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Also, what you want in complicated by the header element

[07:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
also, what do I do with headers within blockquote and tds?

[07:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(i.e., in other sectioning roots)

[07:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think in <blockquote>, the heading would have to be left unchanged

[07:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
not sure what the problem is with TDs

[07:46:02.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#sectioning-root

[07:46:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blames Hixie 

[07:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
at least for the first version, you could leave them unchanged in <td> too, since for what it's being designed for, headings in <td> is unlikely to occur anyway

[07:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
<header> is a bit of a problem too, especially if there are subheadings

[07:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
for now, I think the important features to handle for the initial version are <section>, <article> and <aside>

[07:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that's easy

[07:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok. How long do you expect it to take you to write that much?

[07:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I just did in around a minute :P

[07:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, ok. that's a lot quicker than it would have taken me, since I find python to be ab extremely confusing language

[07:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/ab/an/

[07:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
can you send me the code for that then, so I can test it?

[07:55:01.0000] <annevk3>
http://forums.whatwg.org/viewtopic.php?p=465#465 is spam

[07:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finishes tweeking it

[07:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: (it was more than just a minute)

[07:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: http://pastebin.ca/1272410

[07:56:03.0000] <gsnedders>
The only real problem is it runs the outliner both for that and for the TOC, and the outliner is slow

[07:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what Lachy is trying to achieve

[07:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: "Replace numeric headings with the correct numeric headings for their

[07:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
       depth regardless of sectioning content elements."

[07:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
I don't understand. I would understand if you said "accounting for sectioning content elements"

[08:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
like <section><h1></h1><section><h1></h1></section></section>

[08:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
becomes:

[08:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
<section><h1></h1><section><h2></h2></section></section>

[08:01:03.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, it doesn't seem to work

[08:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: That's to be expected. I wrote it quickly.

[08:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: OK, that makes sense. I don't see how that is irrespective of sectioning content elements though :)

[08:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: it ignores them when numbering them

[08:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
I put in in a file called replaceHeadings.py, added it to that python directory, and ran: anolis --enable=replaceHeadings test.src.html test.html

[08:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
But it uses them to deduce the numbering

[08:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: yeah, sure

[08:03:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[08:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, test.src.html looks like this: http://pastebin.ca/1272420

[08:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm, yeah

[08:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: oh, == and not =

[08:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
on which line?

[08:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: http://pastebin.ca/1272422

[08:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: But http://pastebin.ca/1272424 is cleaner code

[08:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(no unicode(depth + 1), just unicode(depth))

[08:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
What's a DifferentParentException?

[08:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
oh gawd

[08:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
copy/paste error

[08:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/DifferentParentException/TooDeepException/

[08:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
final version (hopefully): http://pastebin.ca/1272427

[08:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
Also I guess section.header.tag[1].isdigit() should be section.header.tag in ("h1", "h2" [...]) but using a set for better performance

[08:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
So that it works when Hixie introduces the new h1b element

[08:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
frozenset ideally

[08:13:04.0000] <jgraham>
yes, frozenset

[08:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is on;y guessing that a set will perform better for n=6

[08:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, will you be including this in the releases as an optional feature, or will I need to keep my own separate copy?

[08:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I'll include it with 1.1

[08:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[08:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I don't want to include it with 1.0, with that so close to shipping

[08:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
that'll give me time to learn more python and try and fix bugs in it

[08:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: for Lachy's test doc it's too small to make any diff :P

[08:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: 0.000s for both

[08:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: no diff for HTML 5 either

[08:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, is there any way to avoid running the outliner twice?

[08:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: not really

[08:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
could you somehow cache the outline and return that for subsequent calls?

[08:21:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Yeah, I'll do that for 1.1

[08:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[08:21:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: That's part of the reason why I don't want to ship this in 1.0

[08:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
it's the third most expensive method on HTML 5 of all of Anolis

[08:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: The frozenset version is about 1x10^-7 seconds faster

[08:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
(per loop)

[08:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: with what uncertainty?

[08:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
Dunno

[08:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me expects the uncertainty is so big that the result is more or less irrelevant

[08:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, for 1.1, can you make it possible for anolis to read directly from standard input rather than requiring an input file, so that I can maintain a collection of source files and run: cat section1.html section2.html ... | anolis output.html

[08:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
otherwise, I need to write to a temporary file first

[08:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Dunno. It seemed to be about 5x10^-8 but I only ran it twice

[08:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: That's still 50% uncertainty, which isn't very certain at all

[08:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: But still quicker all the time, interestingly

[08:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[08:27:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Yeah, I've been thinking about that too

[08:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: The question is how I tell apart the first argument

[08:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, what are you using to measure the execution time down to a milliionth of a second?

[08:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, use a command line parameter that means read from standard input

[08:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: yeah, that's probably simplest

[08:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me motions towards http://bugs.gsnedders.com/projects/show/anolis

[08:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
and also add one to allow it to be output directly to standard output too

[08:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me will flood that with feature requests later

[08:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds Google SearchWiki to be actually useful for once

[08:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
since it lets me delete the really annoying search results on faqs.org for RFCs, since it's HTML and an ugly font and I just want the IETF text versions

[09:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Fixed the infinite loop

[12:55:00.0000] <yecril71>
Images are similar to embedded media only if they are also embedded.

[12:55:01.0000] <yecril71>
Images from IMG tags are not logically similar to embedded media.

[12:56:00.0000] <yecril71>
Their behaviour with respect to aspect ratio can be different.

[12:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
is there any way to turn off section numbering for all sections in a document in LaTeX?

[12:58:00.0000] <yecril71>
Sure, you just have to redefine a hidden macro with 5 @�s in the name :-)

[12:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, \setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}

[12:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[13:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Edit menu, Find "\section", Replace "\section*", I think

[13:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That doesn't work for me.

[13:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[13:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: The section occurs in a file \input{}'d into two documents, and only one of them doesn't want numbering

[13:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Write a Makefile that duplicates the file and calls sed on one copy

[13:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No.

[13:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[13:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{0} works fine

[13:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me gives dmitry a link to http://www.google.com/sponsoredlinks?q=programmers

[13:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
He could hire one of those teams that offered to build an application solving the halting problem

[14:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why would you bother responding to Dmitry at all?

[14:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
politness

[14:02:02.0000] <roc>
SOMEONE ON THE INTERNET IS WRONG

[14:04:00.0000] <yecril71>
That shows one result: EEPROM / Flash Programmer.

[14:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, there's a lot of results herein the US

[14:06:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I get lots in Norway too

[14:06:02.0000] <yecril71>
Not stretching is not a use case for IMG, right.

[14:08:00.0000] <yecril71>
That is why IMG-loaded images are stretched.

[14:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, all my results seem to be US sites. Does google redirect you to google.no?

[14:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me hates when Google does that

[14:08:03.0000] <Dashiva>
No, I've set it to not redirect

[14:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But you can go to .no and it'll give lots of .no answers :)

[14:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
and its especially annoying since my google cookie seems to expire frequently and I keep getting redirected back to google.no

[14:09:02.0000] <Dashiva>
That's a feature

[14:09:03.0000] <Lachy>
I only got one result from the google.no

[14:09:04.0000] <Dashiva>
There was lots of anger when google had cookies that lasted to 2038 :)

[14:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://www.google.no/sponsoredlinks?q=programmerere&btnG=S%C3%B8k+i+sponsede+koblinger

[14:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, yeah, the expiring cookie is ok for that reason. But the fact that google redirects is a bug

[14:10:02.0000] <yecril71>
I think the keyword should be in Norse.

[14:10:03.0000] <Dashiva>
We stopped speaking Norse a few centuries ago, alas

[14:10:04.0000] <Lachy>
Google should provide a way to respect Accept-Language headers.

[14:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if it would work if I set Accept-Language: en-au,en,no;q=0

[14:11:01.0000] <svl>
Lachy: google _does_ respect accept-language. For all languages except for en-* :(

[14:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
aargh!

[14:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's so damn annoying!

[14:12:02.0000] <svl>
Yeah. I hate, hate, hate it.

[14:12:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm already sending en,nb-NO;q=0.9,nb;q=0.8,no-NO;q=0.7,no;q=0.6

[14:12:04.0000] <Lachy>
then we need a way to tell google that i really mean I only speak english

[14:12:05.0000] <Lachy>
what's nb-NO?

[14:12:06.0000] <svl>
Frequently tried to contact them to at least honor en-au, en-nz, en-ca e.a. which won't be set by default anywhere. but no.... :(

[14:12:07.0000] <Dashiva>
bokmål

[14:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How's your Norwegian coming along, Lachy?

[14:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
jeg forstår ikke norsk, men jeg snakker bare litt

[14:17:00.0000] <jcranmer>
translation for those of us not acquainted with Nordic languages?

[14:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
I can read a few words, and understand spoken words like polse and kvittering

[14:17:02.0000] <Dashiva>
"I don't understand norwegian, but I only speak a little" (bad wording included)

[14:17:03.0000] <Lachy>
*pølse

[14:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, what's the correct way to phrase that in norwegian?

[14:18:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I guess Nordic languages aren't big on capitalizing proper nouns/adjectives, are they?

[14:18:02.0000] <Dashiva>
What exactly did you want to say?

[14:18:03.0000] <Dashiva>
jcranmer: proper nouns, yes

[14:18:04.0000] <Lachy>
that I don't understand it, but I can say a few words

[14:18:05.0000] <Dashiva>
"men jeg kan litt/kan noen ord"

[14:19:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I'd love to learn a Nordic language someday, but I suppose I should work on other languages in my list

[14:19:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Although "forstår ikke" is a fairly strong way of not understanding

[14:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
is there another way?

[14:19:03.0000] <Dashiva>
"snakker ikke" might fit better

[14:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Jeg snakker ikke norsk, men jeg forstår en del ord og uttrykk" perhaps

[14:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, that sort of works

[14:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
it's weird that google translate translates "norsk" into "English" though

[14:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That is weird

[14:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
is "Jeg kanne har cheezburger" the correct translation for "I can has cheezburger"?

[14:23:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I'll use the only foreign lang I know: "Je ne comprends pas <insert language here>, mais je peux <insert correct direct object pronoun here> parler un peu."

[14:23:02.0000] <Dashiva>
"kan har"

[14:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
jcranmer, is that French?

[14:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(kanne isn't a valid conjugation in any case)

[14:25:00.0000] <jcranmer>
yep

[14:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, I could make that text less specific. How about: "Search for a header cell with matching id in that table." (re: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081201#l-162)

[14:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Although the have duality own/receive isn't present in Norwegian 'ha'

[14:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: I always think comprendre is spelt wrong :\

[14:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, or rather "For each token, search for a header cell with matching <code>id</code> in that table."

[14:27:01.0000] <jcranmer>
surprendre looks wrong to me until I look at the past participle... surpris

[14:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, 4 instances of "their" changed to "thier". (re: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081201#l-422)

[14:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(uploading)

[14:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, I hope you meant "thier" changed to "their" :-)

[14:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, re the table header sniffing <td><b> discussion earlier, were there really a lot of cases where that resulted in false positives?

[14:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
and would there be no way to distinguish them. e.g. by only detecting them in the first row or column?

[14:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, I just got to that point in the logs. It wasn't so much the quantity of problems, it's that fact that totally reasonable use cases (such as using <strong> to mark a data cell's content as being particularly important) screw up the rest of the table. :(

[14:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, and <td><b> was used about as often for that as <td><strong>, IIRC.

[14:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, I can put a note in the "Ben's Advice" section of the comparison document about that if you like?

[14:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
but in those cases, wouldn't those cells be more likely to occur in the middle of the table, rather than the first row or first column, and if the entire first row/column used <td><b> or <td><strong>, wouldn't that be a reasonable indication that their meant to be headers?

[14:59:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, that's an interesting idea.

[15:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, it becomes a question of how much heuristics Hixie would let us get away with. :)

[15:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't want any heuristics, i want the algorithm to reflect the actual semantics of the language

[15:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
in particular, i really don't want anything magic like <td><b>

[15:01:01.0000] <BenMillard>
yeah, those things often have unexpected "gotchas!" when it comes to real tables anyway

[15:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok, fine

[15:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, for example, I've seen tables where row headers use <td><b> but it had an entire row is made of <td><b> to highlight the data in it. There are also cases where <td><b> is used to create "section headers" midway through the table. So you could add an extra layer of heuristics to disambiguate those cases...but then there's another layer you could add, and another...ad infinitum. :)

[15:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I'll add a "No Heuristics" bit to the advice section, to make clear that my experience with studying data tables supports Hixie's design choice on this. (Basically, they open a can of worms which is difficult to close.)

[15:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, ESPN (and a few other places) uses <td class> to apply the boldness to header cells rather than <td><b>. So...how much heuristics do you want? :P

[15:17:01.0000] <BenMillard>
at least the tables using bold header cells can be retrofitted to <th> with only the text alignment making a visible difference

[15:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
or they could use <td class scope> with no visible difference (if HTML5 supports that)

[15:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
or use <th class> and add text-align:foo in the relevant bit of CSS

[15:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, don't use the slippery slope fallacy. I only suggested <td><b> because it seemed like a common, easily detectable method that people use for headers

[15:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, ok. Check the list under "Using <td> with any attributes and a <b> or a <strong> as the only child": http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/

[15:24:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, it's not that common.

[15:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
what rfc defines the ftp: scheme?

[15:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.html seems to give the answer

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[15:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, what part of my reasoning was a slippery slope fallacy? Was it comparing <td><b> to <td class>?

[15:58:00.0000] <|tbb|>
hello all, im searching for a simple tutorial how to use <event-source> tag, what i want is to read the content of the srcfile into variables

[15:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if there's a name for the fallacy of falsely calling an argument fallacious


2008-12-02
[16:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard: "... So you could add an extra layer of heuristics to disambiguate those cases...but then there's another layer you could add, and another...ad infinitum" "ESPN uses <td class> ... how much heuristics do you want?"

[16:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, maybe that's the continuum fallacy, not slippery slope http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_fallacy

[16:03:00.0000] <|tbb|>
anyone familar with this event-source thing?

[16:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[16:03:02.0000] <|tbb|>
what im trying to do is create an offline app, that loads serval stuff when it becomes online

[16:04:00.0000] <|tbb|>
ive found out that thing with the manifest file where you can define whats from cache and whats from network

[16:05:00.0000] <|tbb|>
but i dont know how to read that stuff, or better i dont know how the sourcefile should look like

[16:05:01.0000] <|tbb|>
for example <event-source src="onlinesource.php">

[16:06:00.0000] <|tbb|>
how can i read and output that file

[16:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand, you seem to be confusing offline webapps with event-source, which are 2 different things

[16:09:00.0000] <|tbb|>
maybe point 3 descripes it better -> http://www.browseking.com/cgi-bin/nph-bk1.pl/010110A/http/www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-offline-webapps-20080530/

[16:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
what is browseking.com and why are you proxying the spec through that server?

[16:11:00.0000] <|tbb|>
found this url through google while searching for a solution, sorry

[16:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
this is a more up to date version http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html#offline

[16:11:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, so it was the jump from <td><b> to <td class>, then?

[16:11:03.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[16:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ok, that makes sense

[16:12:01.0000] <|tbb|>
ive pasted the content -> http://pastebin.ca/1272831

[16:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, that's just an example showing what the different sections of the manifest file do

[16:16:00.0000] <|tbb|>
that manifest file works for me, but i dont know how to integrate an network(online) file into my cached site

[16:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
the eventsource element (previously known as "event-source") allows you to send events to the client from the server. See http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-eventsource-element

[16:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
basically, the client creates a persistent connection with the server and the server can send events to the client through that connection. Then the scripts in the page can listen for those events as they're fired on the eventsource element

[16:19:00.0000] <|tbb|>
oh, like a webservice

[16:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
this section describes the format for the events http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#server-sent-events

[16:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, the "can of worms" criticism of "add extra heuristics until <td><b> works" is valid before jumping to <td class>, though?

[16:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me is learning logic today.

[16:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think your argument would have been valid by pointing out that there are so many other cases that would give false positives and false negatives, that the simple solution I proposed wouldn't be very effective.

[16:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, yeah that's what I was trying to say. :)

[16:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, fair enough

[16:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, is characterising that as "it opens a can of worms which is difficult to close" valid?

[16:27:00.0000] <|tbb|>
lachy, the ticker.php which is descriped in that server-sent example, how does this file look like

[16:27:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(that section will include a link to these logs, I'm just figuring out a short way to describe it)

[16:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, I don't know. possibly.

[16:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
|tbb|, http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#parsing-an-event-stream

[16:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
ticker.php would need to have logic in it that makes the server maintain a persistent connection, and then each event the server sends would need to be in that format

[16:31:00.0000] <|tbb|>
how can i set the mime type of the ticker, is that correct-> header("Content-Type: text/event-stream");

[16:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
for PHP, yes

[16:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know how to make PHP maintain a persistent connection though

[16:33:00.0000] <|tbb|>
for me it where enough, to send the content of the ticker.php once

[16:33:01.0000] <|tbb|>
maybe im thinking completly wrong

[16:33:02.0000] <|tbb|>
for what i want to do

[16:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure what you're trying to do though. Why are you using server sent events for?

[16:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/Why are/What are/

[16:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
If you just want to download the immediate output of that script, and aren't doing any kind of streaming, it sounds like you could just use XMLHttpRequest instead

[16:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
|tbb|, read http://labs.opera.com/news/2006/09/01/

[16:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's based on an older version of the spec, which has since changed, but it will give you a better understanding of what it does and how it works

[17:04:00.0000] <|tbb|>
Lachy: ive found an php example which should sent the server-time each 3 secs, http://my.opera.com/WebApplications/blog/index.dml/tag/server-sent%20events

[17:06:00.0000] <|tbb|>
ive changed the sented data to  -> data: YHOO data: -2 data: 10 to use it with the example in whatwg example but nothing happends, any idea? oh btw, ive changed the header also to text/event-stream

[17:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
which browser are you using?

[17:07:01.0000] <|tbb|>
safari (iphone) 

[17:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
that doesn't implement it yet

[17:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
if you want to experiment with it, use Opera, but you have to use the old MIME type because that's what has been implemented

[17:11:00.0000] <|tbb|>
lachy, sorry because ive asked again, are you sure that the latest safari iphone os fw.2.2 doesnt support it?

[17:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, I'm sure

[17:12:01.0000] <olliej>
Lachy: what are we talking about?

[17:12:02.0000] <Lachy>
server sent events

[17:12:03.0000] <olliej>
ah

[17:12:04.0000] <olliej>
/me isn't sure if those are supported in webkit trunk

[17:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.google.com/search?q=Server-sent+events+webkit returns some discussions about reviewing patches to implement it

[17:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
first result: https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-reviews/2007-September/019931.html

[17:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
so it looks like there was an implementation at least started

/me mumbles something about <script> being annoying

[17:20:04.0000] <ajnewbold>
cool, <x>

[17:20:05.0000] <ajnewbold>
is that a real element?

[17:21:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
/me has been out of touch with web stuff for too long now :(

[17:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
ajnewbold, no

[17:21:02.0000] <ajnewbold>
darn

[17:21:03.0000] <ajnewbold>
<x> would make for a pretty cool element, I think

[17:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
it used to be. But it was renamed, several times and finally dropped

[17:22:01.0000] <ajnewbold>
<x>spot</x>

[17:22:02.0000] <ajnewbold>
oh.

[17:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
I can't remember what it was for though

[17:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
i hate browsers

[17:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
heh

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok no really, wtf is IE8 doing with http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E...%3Cscript%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cx%3E%3Cb%3Ea%3C%2Fb%3E%3C%2Fx%3E%3Ctable%3E%3Cscript%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cx%3E%3Cb%3Ea%3C%2Fb%3E%3C%2Fx%3E

[17:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose keeping <script> in place, instead of moving it, is necessary to deal with document.write() weirdness

[17:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. <table><script>document.write("<tr>...")</script>...</table>

[17:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
why is there no second /X element in http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E...%3Cx%3E%3Cb%3Ea%3C%2Fb%3E%3C%2Fx%3E%3Cselect%3E%3Cx%3E%3Cb%3Ea%3C%2Fb%3E%3C%2Fx%3E%3C%2Fselect%3E in IE8??

[17:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
aargh! WTF! "Internet Explorer has modified this page to prevent a potential cross-site scripting attack."

[17:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
how the hell do I disable that annoying "feature"

[17:32:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me uploads to the clipboard from a real browser first

[17:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
You tell the author of the site you're using to add a special header to disable the XSS protection :-)

[17:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't ever get that message

[17:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
did i do something wrong?

[17:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
I do get it

[17:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do i get it to come up?

[17:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, copy and paste that URL above into IE8

[17:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
it seems to detect the <script> in the URL and thinks it's a XSS attack

[17:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
By visiting a URL with <script> in the query string, and <script> in the body, which makes IE8 think it's possibly XSS and so it destroys all the <script> tags in the page

[17:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, what's the special header to use?

[17:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
I'll need to add that to html5.lachy.id.au too

[17:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/07/02/ie8-security-part-iv-the-xss-filter.aspx

[17:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/07/02/ie8-security-part-iv-the-xss-filter.aspx says X-XSS-Protection: 0

[17:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow it just does s/<script>/<sc#ipt>/, that's so insane

[17:39:01.0000] <ajnewbold>
heh

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't get it if i go to http://ln.hixie.ch/?<script>

[17:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[17:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
the X-XSS-Protection: 0 header seems to work

[17:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
but apparently using Apache's Header directive in .htaccess doesn't affect PHP scripts :-(

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
r2500!

[18:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i need to start sticking  ?<script>  at the end of all my URLs

[18:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me attempts to downgrade to iTunes 7.7.1, backup the keys, and then upgrade to 8.0.2 again to see if that works

[18:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
with requiem

[18:23:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
I found it interesting how html4 bitched if I had <a> right after <hr>, telling me that I had to put it in something else first

[18:23:01.0000] <ajnewbold>
but html5 is totally cool with it

[18:23:02.0000] <ajnewbold>
well, the validator is anyway

[18:24:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
plus, the doctype is shorter

[18:24:01.0000] <ajnewbold>
html5 wins every which way

[18:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah in html5 you can put blocks in <a>s

[18:25:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
awesome.

[18:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: doesn't the latest requiem support the latest itunes?

[18:26:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
Hixie: earlier today I was reading about acid3 on wikipedia

[18:26:01.0000] <ajnewbold>
the article mentions you quite a bit

[18:26:02.0000] <ajnewbold>
kind of neat to see you here

[18:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
makes sense, i wrote it :-P

[18:26:04.0000] <ajnewbold>
oh, hehe

[18:26:05.0000] <ajnewbold>
:)

[18:26:06.0000] <Hixie>
acid3, that is, not the article :-)

[18:26:07.0000] <ajnewbold>
ah, heh

[18:26:08.0000] <ajnewbold>
acid3 is pretty frigging insane

[18:26:09.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[18:27:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
I suspect acid4 will perform a lapdance or something

[18:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
acid4 will be more like acid2

[18:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
it'll have some sort of picture

[18:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
probably a cat

[18:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
and will test primarily non-scripting things

[18:27:05.0000] <ajnewbold>
yay

[18:27:06.0000] <Hixie>
probably svg 1.1 stuff

[18:27:07.0000] <Hixie>
but i'll have to learn svg to do that

[18:27:08.0000] <Hixie>
so we'll see

[18:27:09.0000] <ajnewbold>
it'll be fun

[18:27:10.0000] <Hixie>
won't be for some time

[18:28:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
I know virtually nothing about svg

[18:28:01.0000] <ajnewbold>
except that it's amazing

[18:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's one word for it

[18:28:03.0000] <ajnewbold>
oh, wait, I've got it!

[18:28:04.0000] <ajnewbold>
acid4 could consist of this:  <cat>

[18:28:05.0000] <ajnewbold>
first browser to correctly render that wins.

[18:29:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
:D

[18:29:01.0000] <ajnewbold>
sorry, <cat/>

[18:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
acid tests are based on "old" standards

[18:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
so we'd have to get cracking on making a Cat standard

[18:29:04.0000] <ajnewbold>
oh.

[18:29:05.0000] <ajnewbold>
good point

[18:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I want to get the 7.7.1 keys and see if using that with 1.7.4 works for me, just like it seems to continue working for you

[18:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
aah

[18:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
is 1.8 causing problems then?

[18:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders why we preserve case for doctype names

[18:31:04.0000] <ajnewbold>
I wonder if I'll live to see an intelligent content display agent

[18:31:05.0000] <Lachy>
1.8 using 8.0.1 keys doesn't decrypt content bought with 8.0.2

[18:32:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
something that can take raw content, pure text or whatever, and display it accordingly

[18:32:01.0000] <ajnewbold>
it could generate its own navigation based purely on analysis of what links to what, not through any kind of specific declaration

[18:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: ah, interesting

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm going to shoot the first person who asks for what i just did to be uppercase instead of lowercase (and who didn't read this line)

[18:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, can you make what you just did uppercase instead of lowercase?

[18:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
:-)

[18:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me prefers lowercase for the DOCTYPE name anyway

[18:47:00.0000] <blooberry>
does anyone here have any experience with rss/atom syntax?

[18:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me grumbles as he re-opens IE to examine its behavior around <form></form>

[18:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
crap, i used the wrong annotation for the last checkin

[20:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, downgrading to iTunes 7.7.1 and having it generate a new set of keys now allows me to decrypt everything bought with 8.0.2 :-)

[21:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: cool

[23:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see a note at http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MicrosyntaxDescriptions#datetime-tz that says:

[23:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
"(This format deviates from the spec draft.)"

[23:12:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
anybody know why it deviates?

[23:31:00.0000] <roc>
MikeSmith: what's the point of "Typical default display properties" for <audio> and <video> in http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/ ?

[23:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
what spec defines that + means %20 in an HTTP URI's query component?

[23:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: no point except that the webkit default UA stylesheet provides CSS for them, so the build just picks that up

[23:42:00.0000] <roc>
So you have a script that replaces "webkit" with "vendor"?

[23:42:01.0000] <roc>
I think it's highly likely to confuse people

[23:44:00.0000] <roc>
same for form controls

[23:44:01.0000] <roc>
all those rules are highly UA-specific

[23:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I realize that

[23:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
we need someone to actually edit a spec that defines all this stuff

[23:45:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and, yeah, the script replaces "webkit" with "vendor"

[23:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
otherwise i'm gonna have to end up doing it and i don't wanna :-P

[23:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if the CSS WG could produce a real-world reference default UA stylesheet, I much rather use that

[23:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I could just have the script ignore anything that's got a vendor-specific prefix in it

[23:47:01.0000] <roc>
the rendering of media and form controls are far from fully described by the UA stylesheet

[00:39:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, I thought there was a reasong for not munging the DOCTYPE case, ask hsivonen

[00:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
he's the one who asked to munge it

[00:41:00.0000] <annevk3>
well then :)

[00:48:00.0000] <annevk3>
oh, way over 2500 revisions already

[01:18:00.0000] <aaronlev>
hi hsivonen 

[01:54:00.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, the spec also has document.innerHTML for which it seems logical, even necessary, to create a Document object a

[01:55:00.0000] <annevk3>
(XMLHttpRequest currently uses the serialization algorithm of that)

[02:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: couldn't you put the document object on the stack?

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought innerHTML was the very case hsivonen was arguing that we shouldn't use a separate doc for

[02:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: document.innerHTML (as opposed to elm.innerHTML)

[02:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
really?

[02:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
i missed the distinction.

[02:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
interesting.

[02:26:00.0000] <annevk3>
whoa

[02:26:01.0000] <annevk3>
http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/

[02:27:00.0000] <annevk3>
guess that means we can start dropping XML 1.1 support in Opera...

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: sorry, forgot the 'c' annotation on r2524

[03:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: why ban the empty string in placeholder?

[03:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: what would it be if not an authoring mistake?

[03:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
placeholder should probably be limited to have a length <= @size

[03:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Why?

[03:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Because, in theory if the control has a size attribute set you will only be able to see that many characters

[03:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
Having a placeholder that is wider than the number of visible characters seems odd

[03:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
It doesn't seem to make much sense to allow <input placeholder=wwww size=4> but not <input placeholder=iiiii size=4>, if the concern is how many characters get visibly rendered

[03:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, proportional fonts suck ;)

[03:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
But it seems like an authouring error to put a long string in @placeholder which may not be visible in all UAs 

[03:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: a placeholder :)

[03:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough

[03:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
will change

[03:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, will change what?

[03:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
allow placeholder="" to be empty

[03:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
why? zcorpan's argument seemed pretty weak

[03:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
we allow title="" to be blank

[03:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
class="" to be blank

[03:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[03:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
etc

[03:28:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: FWIW the definition of the size attribute seems like it is inaccurate; presumably the UA can allow the user to see more or less characters depending on CSS

[03:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/less/fewer/

[03:32:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, there's a bug in the update notification script on the multipage version. It still says "This specification has been updated. You are reading r2526 but the latest revision is r2527..." even after reloading 

[03:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: the definition has no UA normative criteria

[03:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it takes time for the multipage version to update

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: you probably _are_ reading r2526

[03:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Well it is still misleading even if it is not normative

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess

[03:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
what dos it define then?

[03:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway send feedback, i'm going to bed soon

[03:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[03:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess it defines the default width, in characters (dunno what that means, exactly) of the control when presented in a visual UA

[03:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's a "default width"?

[03:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, I assume all undefined terms will be dealt with in the rendering section ;)

[03:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
mmhm :-)

[03:49:00.0000] <|tbb|>
hi all, anyone has experience with creating offline apps?

[03:50:00.0000] <|tbb|>
http://www.w3.org/TR/offline-webapps 

[04:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, the last update to the placeholder attribute section appears in the multipage version, but the notice still appears on the page with the TOC.

[04:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
odd

[04:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
well if you can work out what the problem is, let me know and i'll fix it

[04:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm going to bed now

|tbb|: probably best to just ask a question

[04:04:00.0000] <|tbb|>
lachy and others, hours ago, and im still looking for a solution for my needings. maybe you can give me the special hint to get my prob solved. im trying to build and offline-webapp, so if i stay online,  the browser  should read particluary data from the online ressource anyway. 

[04:07:00.0000] <|tbb|>
what i figure out is that -> var online = navigator.onLine; will tell me if im online or not but when i trying to change style of an element in case of the online or not online state it wont work, it always shows me the html source which i have stored for offline viewing

[04:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand what you mean

[04:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
it might help if you could show us a minimised sample page illustrating what you are trying to do

[04:11:00.0000] <|tbb|>
im doing it right now

[04:16:00.0000] <annevk3>
navigator.onLine should work quite well nowadays, onoffline and ononline might not

[04:28:00.0000] <|tbb|>

what i really like to do is, that a particluary file always load if the user is online, so i can provide updates or something

[04:35:00.0000] <|tbb|>
it doesnt matter if i put the myofflineapp.php in network section or not it always loads the cached one

[04:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
AIUI, the browser should check for an update on the server

[04:37:01.0000] <annevk3>
standardssuck.org is now upgraded

[04:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
which browsers are you testing with?

[04:38:00.0000] <|tbb|>
safari on iphone

[04:38:01.0000] <|tbb|>
fw 2.2

[04:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk3, there were plugins that needed upgrading too. I did that for you

[04:39:01.0000] <annevk3>
k

[04:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
are you sure that version of Safari implements offline webapps, as defined in HTML5?

[04:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
this page says only Chrome implements that feature via a plugin. http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Implementations_in_Web_browsers

[04:41:01.0000] <|tbb|>
aaaahrrrrggggg, (online=true) should mean (online==true) now it works, damnd sorry

[04:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
of course, that page could be out of date

[04:41:03.0000] <Lachy>
oh, right. I didn't notice that ;-)

[04:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I did also hear that safari on iphone supports the offline-webapps stuff

[04:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think the "Save to Home Screen" feature makes use of it

[04:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
(if the app actually has a manifest specified)

[04:42:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
as of iphone OS 2.1 at least

[04:43:00.0000] <|tbb|>
MikeSmith: thats what im talking about

[04:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, then someone should update the wiki

[04:48:00.0000] <|tbb|>
one more problem, like open the browser look at the page (allready online) it shows me the state online. if im deactivating wlan then, and reopen the site it says he is online, but if im reloading the page again it shows me the correct onlinestat

[05:00:00.0000] <|tbb|>
lachy, i wonder if the event-source thing will work also (may enabled but not announced) but im doing something wrong because i dont know much about it?

[05:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
|tbb|, the WebKit bug for eventsource is still marked as NEW, not FIXED, so it seems unlikely that a release version of Safari would have it

[05:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
btw, it's <eventsource> now, not <event-source>

[05:05:00.0000] <|tbb|>
ah, k. how can i write the content from anyotherfile.php into a div on my current page from javascript is that possible ?

[05:05:01.0000] <annevk3>
zcorpan, Hixie stated in some other e-mail that all events would get a global event handler attribute

[05:05:02.0000] <annevk3>
zcorpan, and do we really want to group events? readystatechange sucks balls

[05:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: not sure but i'd like to see use cases for some events

[05:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
what's wrong with readystatechange?

[05:21:00.0000] <annevk3>
that you need to check all kinds of other things to know what's going on rather than being able to directly trigger something based on the event name

[05:22:00.0000] <annevk3>
you basically need some conditional logic inside the event; it's much nicer if that's handled by different event names instead

[05:22:01.0000] <annevk3>
(e.g. the difference between a successful load and an aborted one)

[05:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[07:35:00.0000] <annevk3>
http://my.opera.com/haavard/blog/2008/12/02/google-closes-the-web-in-korea :/

[08:42:00.0000] <annevk3>
is there an easy .htaccess line to kill the connection if someone uses a certain browser?

[08:44:00.0000] <annevk3>
or a more friendly heuristic, if the URI contains "&amp;"

[08:54:00.0000] <annevk3>
SetEnvIf Request_URI "&amp;" evil

[08:54:01.0000] <annevk3>
Deny from evil

[08:54:02.0000] <annevk3>
?

[08:56:00.0000] <annevk3>
Deny from env=evil

[09:00:00.0000] <annevk3>
hmm, that doesn't work

[09:02:00.0000] <svl>
SetEnvIf Request_URI "&amp;" evil=1

[09:03:00.0000] <svl>
?

[09:03:01.0000] <annevk3>
nope

[09:03:02.0000] <annevk3>
the documentation is crap

[09:04:00.0000] <svl>
oh yeah, looks like that's redundant. You have <FilesMatch "(.*)"> \n Order Allow,Deny \n Allow from all \n Deny from env=evil \n </FilesMatch>

[09:05:00.0000] <svl>
(specifically the order bit?)

[09:05:01.0000] <annevk3>
currently no

[09:05:02.0000] <annevk3>
can they appear inside <FilesMatch?

[09:06:00.0000] <svl>
that's the way I have it - which works for me. :)

[09:07:00.0000] <svl>
(but the problem with .htaccess is that there's so many other things setting up things inside it that there's a high chance of conflicts...)

[09:07:01.0000] <svl>
well, _a_ problem.

[09:07:02.0000] <annevk3>
no, doesn't work

[09:07:03.0000] <annevk3>
there's almost nothing configured here

[09:08:00.0000] <svl>
pastebin the entire .htaccess file?

[09:08:01.0000] <svl>
wfm: http://juima.org/stuff/test&amp;test

[09:09:00.0000] <annevk3>
http://html5.org/x.htaccess

[09:11:00.0000] <svl>
iirc the latter option overrides the former, hence allow,deny instead of deny,allow (blaklisting versus whitelisting)

[09:12:00.0000] <annevk3>
i tried that too

[09:12:01.0000] <annevk3>
will try again

[09:12:02.0000] <svl>
what I have is http://pastebin.com/d7a7644ea

[09:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe mod_rewrite would be easier

[09:13:01.0000] <svl>
"Deny,Allow: First, all Deny directives are evaluated; if any match, the request is denied unless it also matches an Allow directive."

[09:14:00.0000] <svl>
that's the problem with the current version

[09:14:01.0000] <annevk3>
it seems that for query strings it does not work?

[09:14:02.0000] <annevk3>
can that be true?

[09:14:03.0000] <svl>
yes

[09:14:04.0000] <annevk3>
see e.g. http://juima.org/stuff/?test&amp;test

[09:14:05.0000] <svl>
querystring isn't part of request_uri

[09:14:06.0000] <annevk3>
geez

[09:14:07.0000] <svl>
meh, should've remembered that immediately.

[09:14:08.0000] <svl>
yeah, that sucks

[09:14:09.0000] <annevk3>
do you know the variable?

[09:14:10.0000] <svl>
/me remembers being frustrated by it not two months ago

[09:15:00.0000] <svl>
iirc there isn't one, and I indeed moved to mod_rewrite as Philip` suggested. Back then it was:

[09:15:01.0000] <svl>
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} DECLARE

[09:15:02.0000] <svl>
RewriteRule ^(.*) - [F]

[09:16:00.0000] <annevk3>
"See the RewriteCond directive of mod_rewrite for extra information on how to match your query string." sigh

[09:16:01.0000] <svl>
so s/DECLARE/&amp;/ and put a RewriteEngine On above it.

[09:17:00.0000] <annevk3>
nice

[09:17:01.0000] <annevk3>
there is this bot hitting web-apps-tracker for a couple of months now and eating 15 gigabytes a month or so

[09:18:00.0000] <svl>
youch

[09:18:01.0000] <annevk3>
it apparently fetches &amp; URIs

[09:23:00.0000] <annevk3>
seems to work

[09:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
I wish there was a nicer way to write RewriteRule when you don't actually care about the URIs

[09:23:02.0000] <annevk3>
/me serving lots of 403

[09:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose "RewriteRule . - [F]" is the most concise thing you can do

[09:24:01.0000] <svl>
The bot doesn't come from a single ip? In extreme cases I just toss them in iptables so I don't even have the apache hit.

[09:27:00.0000] <annevk3>
nope, lots of different IPs

[09:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Whose IPs are they?

[09:29:00.0000] <annevk3>
/me opens access.log again

[09:36:00.0000] <svl>
I've seen 62.171.194.43 legitimately browsing on my site

[09:39:01.0000] <annevk3>
maybe they're all proxies in some way?

[09:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it's a botnet trying to DDOS the spec tracker

[09:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
:-( making content-language non-conforming without changing the processing reqs seems impractical

[09:43:00.0000] <annevk3>
Philip`, haha, nice try Mr. Last Week!

[10:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: the date microformat deviation from spec was probably related to something that Hixie dealt with in http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-November/017421.html

[10:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk3: why would you create a new Document object for document.innerHTML instead of using the one bound to document?

[10:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: r2524 noted. thanks

krijn, I've only tested those demos in Firefox 2, but I can do cross-browser testing if you like

[16:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, the "day" demo is not finished...I plan to make status messages more consistent with normal message and identify them using class to avoid lots of string checking in the JS

hsivonen: thanks for pointer regarding date/time microsyntaxes

[18:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: if you have questions re mutation events that you can't determine an answer to, let me know and i'll give you an answer for now -- but in general i'm blocked on mutation events and svg getting their specs fixed to be more clearly defined

this html5, it's lucious

[19:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i am not familiar with that word

[19:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
unless you're referring to the stargate character

[19:06:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
hmm, well, it helps if you spell it correctly

[19:06:01.0000] <billyjackass>
ludicrous?

glad you think so :-)

I'm not providing any attributes on <body>, so either I'm overlooking something simple or the validator's having a bad day

/me finds himself wishing he had the equivalent of a JS minifier for dealing with messages from certain recent posters to the whatg list

[00:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me sets up his network so that the neighbour's machine that keeps trying to do bittorrents has all HTTP traffic redirected to a simple page that tells the guy that his torrenting is bottlenecking the connection

[00:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i am also running a program that kills any non-port-80 tcp/ip traffic from that host)

[00:33:00.0000] <jwalden>
why not just set up wpa?

[00:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
i want an open network

[00:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
i use open networks all over the place

[00:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
i feel i should give back

[00:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
wpa also makes it a pain to connect the devices to the network (like the wii, the ipod, the ps3) and makes it harder for guests to connect

[00:40:00.0000] <jwalden>
suit yourself :-)

[01:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ajnewbold: http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fneatnik.net%2F gives no errors so it has to be something they screwed up in the integration

annevk3: http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/12/03/HTML5-in-Gecko?#c1228319123

[07:42:00.0000] <annevk3>
rubys, since we do not implement SVG or MathML inside text/html there is no such thing as a "foreign element" for Opera

[07:43:00.0000] <annevk3>
rubys, just like in <div><foo><bar/></foo></div> <bar/> is not actually self-closed per HTML5

[07:49:00.0000] <annevk3>
rubys, also, yeah, WebKit does it incorrectly afaict

[07:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: </foo> should close the bar, though, shouldn't it?

[07:51:00.0000] <annevk3>
yeah

[07:51:01.0000] <annevk3>
not the best example

[07:51:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: how is it not a good example? sam has <svg><circle></svg>

[07:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
we put everything after </svg> in the circle element

[07:52:01.0000] <annevk3>
oh really?

[07:52:02.0000] <zcorpan>
afaict

[07:52:03.0000] <annevk3>
mea culpa

[07:58:00.0000] <rubys>
it is a pity that HTML5 doesn't treat non-recognized HTML elements as foreign.

[08:00:00.0000] <rubys>
actually, isn't the spec ambiguous?  <p> is an allowed HTML element.  <math> is an element from the MathML namespace.  What does this make <svg>?

[08:00:01.0000] <annevk3>
it's a pity we're stuck with HTML :)

[08:00:02.0000] <annevk3>
<svg> is currently not allowed

[08:01:00.0000] <rubys>
ok, so it is not normal, and not foreign, and not RCDATA, and not CDATA, and not Void.  Is it a sixth kind of element?

[08:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: i guess the secion you're reading only deals with elements that are allowed in html5

[08:02:01.0000] <annevk3>
the syntax and language are intertwined

[08:02:02.0000] <zcorpan>
section

[08:03:00.0000] <rubys>
so, what does the spec say about how to handle <foo/>?

[08:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: in the parsing section it would go under "Any other start-tag token" or what it says

[08:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
aha... PFWG's approach to get past CR is to remove 'must's from the spec

[08:49:01.0000] <zcorpan>
that's interesting

[08:49:02.0000] <zcorpan>
(actually a whole conformance class)

[08:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
I didn't think they had any MUSTs to begin with...

[08:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
they had some

[08:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh well

[09:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess eventually they will have none at all any any behaviour will be considered both conforming and therefore accesible

[11:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ECMA has no semantic index of standards

[11:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Nor does the ISO

[11:36:00.0000] <jcranmer>
IETF?

[11:36:01.0000] <jcranmer>
ANSI?

[11:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: IETF does of RFCs, dunno about other docs

[11:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/docs/series/

[11:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
And ANSI I don't really care about :)

[11:38:03.0000] <jcranmer>
IANA?

[11:38:04.0000] <jcranmer>
ICANN?

[11:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
how often do people want to reference them? :)

[11:39:01.0000] <jcranmer>
IANA protocol registries are actually fairly useful

[11:39:02.0000] <jcranmer>
for example, MIME content types

[11:39:03.0000] <jcranmer>
official extensions for protocols with extensioning mechanisms

[11:39:04.0000] <jcranmer>
default TCP ports

[11:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
To my knowledge not really

[11:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(have an index)

[11:41:01.0000] <jcranmer>
IANA has a master list, alphabetacized by protocol name that I usually just Ctrl-F

[11:41:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: That isn't very semantic though

[11:41:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: And can't be easily scrapped

[11:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(well, it can be easily scrapped, but not in a generic way)

[11:42:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I know it has a master list, I was wondering if it had a semantic one

[11:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It doesn't

[11:42:03.0000] <jcranmer>
:-(

[11:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
RFCs and W3C TRs are all that do of major tech. publications as far as I can see

[11:43:00.0000] <jcranmer>
you know what sucks... just how much one has to search to get around documentation

[11:43:01.0000] <jcranmer>
trying to navigate to the DOM or CSS specs from www.w3.org is a bit frustrating

[11:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Just guess that it is w3.org/TR/CSS/ :P

[11:44:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I normally stick with CSS21

[11:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I just guess shortname

[11:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*the shortname

[11:44:03.0000] <jcranmer>
some of the DOM specs are annoying

[11:44:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, they are.

[11:44:05.0000] <jcranmer>
even worse is trying to get to the Windows SDK reference from msdn.microsoft.com

[11:45:00.0000] <jcranmer>
you pretty much have to either search or be psychic

A valid URL with a valid fragment identifier constitutes a broken link only if the resource referenced cannot be found.

[14:00:00.0000] <yecril71>
Referring to a fragment identifier that is not defined in the resource does not make it broken.

[14:01:00.0000] <yecril71>
href="#foo bar" does not match id="foo%20bar" but you can have it vice versa.

[14:02:00.0000] <yecril71>
That is because an identifier is not an URL and it is not subject to decoding.

[14:04:00.0000] <yecril71>
An identifier containing spaces makes the document invalid, and the document 

[14:04:01.0000] <yecril71>
validator should behave accordingly.

[14:05:00.0000] <yecril71>
A disconnected subtree need not be a whole document.

[14:06:00.0000] <yecril71>
I do not believe DOM Core should ever reinvent what a subtree is.

[14:09:00.0000] <yecril71>
Since the identifier is guaranteed to be the same in the document and in a disconnected subtree, there is really no room for any ambiguity.

[14:11:00.0000] <yecril71>
The DOM mechanisms and the CSS mechanisms, if the latter are ever defined for scripting, have different purposes.

[14:11:01.0000] <yecril71>
I do not think a full consistency is required here; otherwise one of them seems to be redundant.

[14:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I don't have any especially good ideas on novel locations

[14:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Should we say the same as before, then?

[14:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I suppose that would be reasonable

[14:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I hope you'll be on IRC on Monday to remind me :-)


2008-12-04
[16:27:00.0000] <ajnewbold>
gsnedders: ahoy

[22:29:00.0000] <jwalden>
"We think that developers will have an easier time building interoperable sites on top of IE8’s strong platform work (like [...] cross-domain requests (XDR) [...])."

[22:29:01.0000] <jwalden>
the sheer audacity

[22:47:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jwalden, you're talking about the IE blog here? http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/12/03/compatibility-view-improvements-to-come-in-ie8.aspx

[22:48:00.0000] <jwalden>
yeah

[22:48:01.0000] <jwalden>
I added a comment to about that effect, too, except less exasperatedly-worded

[22:48:02.0000] <jwalden>
/me neologizes a bit, and a bit more

[22:51:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"When users install Windows 7 Beta or the next IE8 update, they get a choice about opting-in to a list of sites that should be displayed in Compatibility View."

[22:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Users who choose to get the list receive it via Windows Update packages, just like IE security updates."

[22:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"[...] the presence of a <META> tag / HTTP header “wins” [...]"

[22:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"In some cases, for a new browser, developers have to spend time to add a tag or header to make their sites compatible."

[22:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it's good that Microsoft are discussing this in detail in advance

[22:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, it names some sites: "[...] high-volume sites like facebook.com, myspace.com, bbc.co.uk, and cnn.com with pages that weren’t working for end-users with IE’s new standards compliant default."

[23:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"The most important thing we can do now is deliver better interoperability for a better web [...]"

[23:15:00.0000] <jwalden>
it's mostly just this-is-how-far-we'll-bend-over-backwards-for-sites-that-relied-on-our-bugs plus a little see-we're-trying-to-do-things-that-look-monopolistic

[23:15:01.0000] <jwalden>
which is all well and good, as far as that goes

[23:15:02.0000] <jwalden>
er

[23:16:00.0000] <jwalden>
look-not-monopolistic

[23:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what the sites using XDR will be interoperable with

[23:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the opt-in list will be fun for QA

[23:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(both at Microsoft and at the sites affected)

[23:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess it means authors will have to make sure it works in both IE8 standards mode and IE8 compat mode even if they only want to target standards mode

[23:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, perhaps such sites are expected to provide "a <META> tag / HTTP header"?

[23:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: does it override the user's opt-in list?

[23:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, apparently "[...] the presence of a <META> tag / HTTP header “wins” [...]"

[23:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, you can read the whole thing: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/12/03/compatibility-view-improvements-to-come-in-ie8.aspx

[23:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, could simple mentions of domain names like example.com and subdomain.example.com get linkified in the logs?

[00:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: very cool to see your HTML5 Parsing in Gecko news

[01:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I will be, provided I'm on a NXEC train (and not some temp. hired one without wifi)

[01:48:00.0000] <krijn>
BenMillard: probably, yes :)

[01:48:01.0000] <krijn>
Got a nice regex for that?

[01:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, I don't

[01:49:01.0000] <krijn>
Me neither

[01:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, TLDs are standardised, and they are preceeded by a dot when used in a simple domain

[01:50:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so if you have a list of valid TLDs, maybe you can use that as the start of a RegEx?

[01:51:00.0000] <BenMillard>
supporting ccTLDs could be a real chore, but .com and .org and simple ones like that would still help

[01:51:01.0000] <krijn>
Imho it's easier to select the foo.com, right click, Go to web address

[01:51:02.0000] <krijn>
But that's just me :)

[01:51:03.0000] <krijn>
Auto linking example.com doesn't make sense

[01:52:00.0000] <krijn>
And that's probably the most used one

[01:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, it's your choice, of course

[01:53:01.0000] <krijn>
Trying to convince you a bit, since I'm lazy

[01:53:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i think it'd result in a fair amount of mislinking

[01:53:03.0000] <krijn>
Yeah

[01:53:04.0000] <jwalden>
you could make a regex from http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/dns/src/effective_tld_names.dat?raw=1

[01:54:00.0000] <krijn>
I don't think it's worth it

[01:54:01.0000] <jwalden>
which would be as accurate as it gets these days

[01:54:02.0000] <jwalden>
I agree

[01:54:03.0000] <jwalden>
:-)

[01:54:04.0000] <BenMillard>
fair enough, was just an idea :)

[01:54:05.0000] <krijn>
Great idea btw! ;)

[01:54:06.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, did you see I made demos for some other IRC log pages?: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/irc-logs/

[01:55:00.0000] <krijn>
Yeah, very colorish :)

[01:55:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, as before, take as much/little as you want from them

[01:55:02.0000] <BenMillard>
having a consistent header and footer across all IRC log pages, and better navigation between pages, seemed like an improvement

[01:56:00.0000] <krijn>
I agree

[01:56:01.0000] <krijn>
This would certainly double the readers :)

[01:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
lol, wow that'd be 8!! :P

[01:59:00.0000] <krijn>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/stats/usage_200812.html#TOPURLS

[01:59:01.0000] <krijn>
It's one of my top urls though

[02:00:00.0000] <krijn>
(Could mean the rest is even more shitty, but I'll try not to think about that case)

[02:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, wow it looks like individual pages of logs are more popular than any other page on your site!

[02:01:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, so the /irc-logs/ area must dominate your traffic?

[02:01:02.0000] <krijn>
Yeah, it does

[02:02:00.0000] <krijn>
But I think that has to do with forwarding /irc-logs/htmlwg/ to the most recent day

[02:02:01.0000] <krijn>
And that /irc-logs/htmlwg/ is linked from w3.org

[02:02:02.0000] <krijn>
html-wg even

[02:02:03.0000] <krijn>
From http://www.w3.org/html/wg/ I mean

[02:02:04.0000] <BenMillard>
nice! I hadn't realised that linked to your logs.

[02:03:00.0000] <krijn>
Yay for my PR :p

[02:03:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I added navigation between pages after seeing Dan Connolly say what I'd been thinking for some time: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/microformats/20081125#l-122

[02:03:02.0000] <BenMillard>
s/say/said/

[02:03:03.0000] <krijn>
Yeah, prev/next day links would be handy

[02:04:00.0000] <annevk3>
should be quite easy to make too...

[02:04:01.0000] <krijn>
Not for me ;)

[02:07:00.0000] <krijn>
Could do some loops, currentday - 1, see if that logfile exists.. If yes, make a link, if not, check currentday - 2, etc

[02:07:01.0000] <krijn>
Same for nextday

[02:07:02.0000] <krijn>
With a max of 10 loops or something

[02:11:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, sounds like that would handle changes in the month, too

[02:11:01.0000] <krijn>
Yeah, that's what it is for, mostly

[02:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
neato

[02:12:01.0000] <krijn>
Or I could list all logfiles, sort them, pick the current one - 1, and the current one + 1

[02:12:02.0000] <krijn>
(Which is what I do on the homepage)

[02:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
I would rather recommend a DOM transformation to convert a set of check boxes to a drop-down list.

[02:18:01.0000] <yecril71>
That, of course, relies on innerHTML to work.

[02:19:00.0000] <yecril71>
Structured approaches work better with structured languages than regular expressions.

[02:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
yecril71, where is that being done?

[02:20:01.0000] <yecril71>
Regular expressions are for simple validation, and for languages that have no public DOM.

[02:21:00.0000] <yecril71>

Subject: Re: [whatwg] [WF2] action="mailto:" - encoding spaces

[02:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, an e-mail on a list, not what krijn and I were talking about. ok :)

[02:22:01.0000] <krijn>
Not really, no :)

[02:22:02.0000] <krijn>
A mailing list is so outdated!

[02:23:00.0000] <krijn>
(And hard to keep up with, as well)

[02:23:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, I'm off for dinner now, then I'll resume neatening up my idea for the "day" log. Kudos for being so open to suggestions.

[02:23:02.0000] <krijn>
Np, sorry I'm not using everything immediately :)

[02:24:00.0000] <yecril71>
Absolutely, it is an antique way of getting things done, and extremely inefficient.

[02:26:00.0000] <yecril71>
I would still keep replying on the list but my remarks have been criticised as unintelligible and unconstructive.

[02:26:01.0000] <yecril71>
So Hixie told me I should rather interrupt your discussions on IRC.

[02:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
IRC: where being unintelligible and unconstructive is considered normal

[02:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that listing "The body element" under "obsolete elements" is a bit confusing

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk3>
/me notes that it has been noted already

[02:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that he expected it had already been noted but thought it was worth noting again just in case

[02:47:00.0000] <krijn>
/me scratches his notes

[02:49:00.0000] <annevk3>
/me notes he would have noted that he expected jgraham would have noted it already, but wanted to spare people on the amount of notes

[02:49:01.0000] <krijn>
Duly noted

[02:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
thanks for the kind comments on the Gecko build

[02:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm am I misreading the spec... it looks as if </br> should create a <br> start tag

[02:52:01.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: that's correct

[02:53:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: context?

[02:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/html5-gecko-build/

[02:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Did that change recently?

[02:53:03.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: no

[02:53:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me wishes for a way to find out when a section of the spec last changed

[02:54:00.0000] <roc>
cool

[02:54:01.0000] <roc>
ooh, you're supporting Hixie's SVG and MathML inclusion?

[02:54:02.0000] <roc>
that'll put the cat among the pigeons

[02:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: thanks. yes, SVG and MathML are supported

[02:55:01.0000] <doublec>
amazon S3 came up as an example during the 'video element and cross domain' debate as a service that doesn't support access controls

[02:55:02.0000] <doublec>
it turns out it does provide the functionality to add custom headers

[02:55:03.0000] <doublec>
so as long as the headers don't need dynamic data, you could use it to host cross domain files

[02:56:00.0000] <roc>
intriguing

[02:56:01.0000] <annevk3>
Access-Control might need dynamic data if the video is personalized based on a cookie

[02:56:02.0000] <doublec>
yes, true

[02:56:03.0000] <annevk3>
but if it's simple storage Access-Control-Allow-Origin:* would suffice

[02:57:00.0000] <annevk3>
/me doesn't really know what S3 allows for

[02:57:01.0000] <doublec>
only setting a header and string value when uploading the file, which gets served as an http header when a client downloads it

[02:58:00.0000] <annevk3>
so you can't really have personalized video hosting there anyway

[02:58:01.0000] <doublec>
correct

[03:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me tests hsivonen's gecko build

[03:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
seems to work :)

[03:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: http://simon.html5.org/articles/mobile-results is rendered in quirks mode

[03:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or is document.compatMode lying?

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: oops. it always renders in the quirks mode.

[03:07:01.0000] <zcorpan>
heh

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: blog post fixed. thanks

[03:17:00.0000] <yecril71>
MSDN says: The value of a form control is encoded so that spaces and special characters are converted to their ASCII equivalents.

[03:17:01.0000] <zcorpan>
pages seem to render surprisingly well in quirks mode

[03:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
Guess what the ASCII equivalent for a space should be, given that a space is a valid ASCII character :-)

[03:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: some pages suffer from the FOUC

[03:19:01.0000] <zcorpan>
e.g. csszengarden

[03:20:00.0000] <yecril71>
The example is oPhrase=My%20favorite%20color%20is%20plaid so that must be %20.

[03:20:01.0000] <yecril71>
In particular, converting a space to + is not mentioned at all.

[03:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, in the HTML5 gecko build, there's a strange bug with the handling of numeric character references

[03:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, see the To: field on this post for an example: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Dec/0074.html

[03:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, note how it says: "HTML WG <&#0119;&#0051;&#0046;&#0111;&#0114;..." whereas the other email addresses, which are also in the source as char refs, display proplerly

[03:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: if i paste the source into the live dom viewer then it doesn't happen

[03:42:00.0000] <yecril71>
IE7, however, converts a space to + and encodes + as %2B as required.

[03:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, here's a minimified demo showing the bug http://tinyurl.com/5z6phg

[03:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, note that the behaviour seems to change depending on the length of the source code before it. i.e. if you remove one line of source code, it's likely to display a different set of character references wrongly

[03:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: at least 1 web developer thinks <iframe seamless> is a good thing :) http://friendlybit.com/html/html-includes/

[04:17:00.0000] <yecril71>
I wonder if it is appropriate for the user agent to display a HTML document upon navigating to a mailto: URI.

[04:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
I think Lynx does that.

[04:20:00.0000] <roc>
Firefox can do that

[04:20:01.0000] <yecril71>
I also thing inappropriate appearance directives for FORM controls should be ignored.

[04:20:02.0000] <roc>
a Web app can register a page as the mailto: protocol handler

[04:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yecril71: my Lynx launches some curses-based interactive app for actually sending mail

[04:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe it's built into Lynx

[04:26:00.0000] <annevk3>
http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2008/12/srt-subtitles-with-html5-video.html

[04:26:01.0000] <annevk3>
fail

[04:27:00.0000] <annevk3>
(not the post)

[04:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk3: the jquery.srt  doesn't work as expected?

[04:28:01.0000] <annevk3>
MikeSmith, the approach to subtitles was supposed to be subtitles embedded in the video stream, rather than some ECMAScript hack

[04:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[04:29:01.0000] <annevk3>
hopefully it will work long term, but I'm sceptic

[04:33:00.0000] <krijn>
Subtitles/captioning embedded in videos doesn't work, people want them to be indexable right now as well..

[04:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk3: I had a glass half-empty feeling, too :-/

[04:35:00.0000] <krijn>
http://www.minvws.nl/en/video/ also uses SRT afaik

[04:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for the record, I think SRT is the way to go--but as a built-in feature without JS

[04:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
when it comes to captioning, SRT vs. anything fancy is even more drastic than 80% of use cases with 20% the effort

[04:37:01.0000] <krijn>
Something like <video subs=foo.srt> you mean?

[04:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
krijn: or SRT-equivant data in the media stream

[04:38:01.0000] <krijn>
Or subs=foo (for mookid)

[04:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
SRT vs. fancy is probably closer to 99% of use cases for 1% of effort

[04:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/equivant/equivalent/

[04:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
SRT may be ok for some simple captioning/subtitling, but it does have a lot of limitiations

[04:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: right, I didn't say 100% of use cases :-)

[04:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
Joe Clark was advocating open captions on ALA recently, based on the limitations (especially fonts) of closed caption formats

[04:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
another alternative is the bitmap subtitle formats, such as those used on DVD and Blu-ray

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Joe Clark may have unusually strong sensitivities to getting particular fonts displayed

[04:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
Would plain transcripts (not temporally linked to the video at all) satisfy many of the use cases, with much reduced effort?

[04:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
he has a point about using fonts that are optimised for readability on screen

[04:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: and OSs don't ship with any screen-readable fonts?

[04:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I don't know.

[04:46:00.0000] <jmb>
Philip`: they may well do. although, there's loads of non-verbal stuff in video which should probably be conveyed somehow

[04:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: well, the TV and cinema people have assumed you need at least the SRT level of features

[04:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Does he only care about accessibility of professionally-produced videos, and not care about other people producing videos when they don't know anything about fonts and don't have any installed and decide to go with Comic Sans because it looks nice and friendly?

[04:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, I think the ultimate solution would be to use text-based subtitle format with the ability to embed custom fonts within the video container

[04:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, for amature videos, I'm sure he's aware that there isn't much chance of getting people to use anything much more complex than SRT, if they'll even use that

[04:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: The TV and cinema people have a vested interest in not producing a solution that removes the video component :-)

[04:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
for now, I'd settle for SRT rendered in white with black outline near the bottom of the frame rendered in my browser-defalt sans-serif font

[04:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, sure, but it would also need to support basic positioing, so that it can be moved to the top to avoid overlapping other on-screen text

[04:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that Joe Clark relies on the user's computer having fonts for his blog instead of sending huge Microsoft Publisher-created bitmaps

[04:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's because using bitmaps like that would be less accessible than using even poor quality fonts

[05:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I notice that the Moz and Webkit default stylesheets use -moz-padding-start: and -webkit-padding-start: instead of just padding: ... wondering why

[05:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
also -moz-margin-start and -webkit-margin-start, and -moz-border-start

[05:19:00.0000] <mstange>
MikeSmith: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/-moz-padding-start

[05:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
mstange: thanks

[05:20:00.0000] <annevk3>
yeah, those properties should just be standardized

[05:21:00.0000] <annevk3>
otoh, if all those properties end up in browsers and tools and such, authors might get confused quite a bit

[05:22:00.0000] <yecril71>
The encoding algorithm for mailto links, as specified, consists of two steps.

[05:22:01.0000] <yecril71>
The first step is encoding the control values normally, and the second step is to transform all occurrences of + to %20.

[05:23:00.0000] <yecril71>
This is equivalent to making an exception in the first algorithm.

[05:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
MikeSmith, your document could convert "-start" to "-left" and "-end" to "-right" in such properties, then remove the vendor prefix, and maybe say somewhere it assumes dir="ltr"?

[05:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
BenMillard: the default browser stylesheets don't actually use -end

[05:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
would it be wrong to just convert it to plain "padding" ?

[05:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
MikeSmith, moz-padding-start is equivalent to padding-left when dir="ltr", afaict.

[05:28:01.0000] <BenMillard>
s/moz-padding-start/-moz-padding-start/

[05:28:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[05:30:00.0000] <yecril71>
It seems "jump to step" would be more readable if the steps were both numbered (for easy location) and labeled (for remembering what they do).

[05:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
BenMillard: so I guess I'll have my script convert those to padding-left and maybe put a note somewhere explaining

[05:33:00.0000] <annevk3>
rtl people could claim you're biased

[05:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk3: hmm, so maybe I'll just keep it -vendor-padding-start , with "vendor" in ital

[05:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, yeah, that seems better

[05:36:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3 & MikeSmith, the document is written in English. :)

[05:37:00.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, what it describes should still be sort of i18n compatible

[05:37:01.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, just like we care about accessibility and such :p

[05:37:02.0000] <annevk3>
;)

[05:37:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk3: btw, what about "-appearance" ? any move to standardize that?

[05:37:04.0000] <annevk3>
that's in a standard, but the standard is not that clear

css3-ui

[05:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[05:40:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, versions which are translated into languages with other writing directions could translate the CSS samples accordingly.

[05:40:02.0000] <annevk3>
the CSS samples are UA default style sheet rules...

[05:40:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: thanks for the minimized test case

[05:41:00.0000] <annevk3>
so not really samples

[05:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. that's a cross-language bug

[05:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
fortunately

[05:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, I'm not sure that distinction is helpful when a reader sees something which look like CSS sample CSS but which uses propeties they don't know about...but it's Mike's call. :)

"The net result of the 3.0 generalizations is that Python 3.0 runs the pystone benchmark around 10% slower than Python 2.5. Most likely the biggest cause is the removal of special-casing for small integers. There’s room for improvement, but it will happen after 3.0 is released!"

[07:23:01.0000] <annevk3>
guess we better not port html5lib just yet

unicode is much better in python 3

[07:25:00.0000] <annevk3>
sure

[07:25:01.0000] <rubys>
in any case, I'd like to see hsivonen's work be used to bootstrap a C/C++ implementation with a Python binding

[07:25:02.0000] <annevk3>
/me doesn't like the new print either

[07:25:03.0000] <annevk3>
I'd love that too

[07:25:04.0000] <rubys>
yea, the new print sucks, but isn't a big deal

[07:25:05.0000] <rubys>
I mostly use print for debugging

[07:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is very happy about better unicode handling

[07:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
although html5lib has some bugs that only occur on UCS2 or UCS4 builds

[07:27:01.0000] <tthorsen>
I think the new print looks ok, but I haven't tried it. What's the problem with it?

[07:27:02.0000] <rubys>
parens are required

[07:27:03.0000] <tthorsen>
/me likes parens

[07:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
I have a hard time complaining about two extra characters

[07:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
I guess it may be a small usability loss

[07:28:02.0000] <annevk3>
I don't :) but rubys is right, it's not crucial

[07:29:00.0000] <rubys>
In ruby, p is a function that can be used without parens, and equates roughly to python's print(repr(...)).  Very handy for debugging.

[07:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: Can't most ruby functions be used without parens?

[07:29:02.0000] <rubys>
yes

[07:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me generally likes parens around functions

[07:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or at least I found it weird when I tried Haskell. Although that could be other things too

[07:31:01.0000] <rubys>
the one case where it is handy is functions that return None (or nil, or void or whatever) can be used as statements.

[07:41:00.0000] <rubys>

rubys: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=459817

[08:03:00.0000] <rubys>
oh, cool, I'm the testcase!  :-)

[08:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Python 2.x lets you say "print x," to prevent it printing a newline at the end; can you do something similar in Python 3.0 if print is using standard function call syntax instead?

[08:08:00.0000] <tthorsen>
print(x, end=""), I think

[08:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's quite horrid

[08:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me prefers it when programming languages are updated to make it easier to write things, not harder

[08:09:02.0000] <rubys>
http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-function

[08:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me should probably care about supporting Python 3 now

[08:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
does html5lib work at all?

[08:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: No

[08:13:01.0000] <tthorsen>
Philip`: I did not know about the "print x," in 2.X. That's pretty weird syntax - even if it is easy to write. I think the new syntax is easier to understand for people who are not Python wizards

[08:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
That is pretty low on my priority list though, after "stop hunderds of testcases failing"

[08:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me made a start on the ferry but has some way to go

[08:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
Like before it was over a thousand testcases

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
tthorsen: It isn't any easier for those people to write - they'll do "print('hello')" and not want a newline, then they'll see that it adds a newline, and then they'll either give up or they'll have to look in the documentation, which will then tell them "write 'print "hello",' to suppress the newline" or "write 'print("hello", end="")' to suppress the newline"

[08:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it's equally a pain both ways

[08:17:02.0000] <jgraham>
sys.stdout.write("hello") works I guess

[08:18:00.0000] <rubys>
only if you import sys :-)

[08:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
but with the new way, when you're feeling very frustrated at the lack of a decent debugger and are trying to sprinkle a load of print commands throughout your code to work out what's going on, you'll have to type more characters on every line and you will get even more frustrated :-)

[08:19:00.0000] <tthorsen>
yeah. I was thinking about reading code that others had written. If I saw "print x," somewhere I would probably not even notice the ',' and I would certainly not guess that it was for suppressing the newline

[08:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
import sys; p = sys.stdout.write

[08:20:01.0000] <tthorsen>
If I was in charge, print would not output newlines at all. I don't mind putting a \n at the end of my strings.

[08:20:02.0000] <tthorsen>
s/newlines/automatic newlines/

[08:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
The rationale at http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3105/ seems to be concerned entirely with relatively uncommon advanced requirements, and totally ignores the basic "I just want to print some text" use case

[08:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
tthorsen: Recent versions of Perl attempt to solve that problem by having 'print' which does no newlines, and 'say' which adds one automatically

[08:22:01.0000] <rubys>
That's Python for you: one size fits all.  If you want a language which cottons to use cases (at the expense of consistency), consider Perl or Ruby.

[08:23:00.0000] <annevk3>
I very much like significant whitespace though

[08:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think the main reason I use Python nowadays is ctypes, because I can't anything that works that well in Perl

[08:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
and if I'm writing a little bit of code that requires ctypes, I might as well write the rest of the program in Python because that's easier than mixing languages

[08:25:02.0000] <tthorsen>
annevk3: I'd actually prefer c-style { and }. The whitespace blocks are okay until you want to refactor a 3000 line program. Moving and reindenting big blocks of code feels dangerous when the indentation actually matters.

[08:25:03.0000] <annevk3>
I don't write 3000 line programs

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
$ wc -l html5parser.py

[08:26:01.0000] <Philip`>

It's close :-p

[08:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if PyDev supports all the eclipse refactoring goodness for Python

[10:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
When html5lib's sanitizer says things like re.match("^(\s*[-\w]+\s*:\s*[^:;]*(;|$))*$", style) isn't that, like, totally wrong, because it needs escaped backslashes or needs to be r"..."?

[10:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, maybe not - it seems Python treats "\w\s" identically to "\\w\\s"

[10:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Seems fragile to rely on that, though)

[10:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I never saw a reason not to use raw strings for regexps

[10:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
For today's exciting "you have two problems" quiz: How do you make re.match('^(\s*[-\w]+\s*:\s*[^:;]*(;|$))*$', 'x: y; ' * 20) not take a probably-exponential amount of time to run?

[10:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Bonus points if the solution is still adequately fast when the input is ('x: y; ' * 20)+'x'

[10:34:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Could you put \s inside the [^:;]?

[10:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not sure what you're matching exactly

[10:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: It's trying to sanitize style attribute values

[10:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
so it's matching "x: y; x: y" and "x: y; x: y;" (with various whitespace, and limitations on 'x' and 'y')

[10:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
and if it fails to match when it reaches the end, it apparently does a huge amount of backtracking

[10:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
This part here seems like the problem as far as I can tell: \s*[^:;]*

[10:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Otherwise there isn't much to backtrack on

[10:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Although that wouldn't stop it from trying, would it...

[10:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, that seems a good point - that's where it's going to get the exponential number of matches from

[10:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Could you just remove the \s part? Since it'd be part of the class anyway

[10:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yep, that's what I tried and it seems to make it go fast

[12:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, Python's regexp engine is dumber than Perl's

[12:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
re.match('^(a|a)*$', ('a' * 21) + 'b') takes forever, whereas (("a" x 1000)."b") =~ /^(a|aa)*$/ is instantaneous

[12:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[12:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
I meant (("a" x 1000)."b") =~ /^(a|a)*$/

rubys, if Decimal is serialized to a string, does it include the m at the end?

[12:52:01.0000] <annevk3>
/me wonders if there's some way to detect the difference between a decimal and float

[12:56:00.0000] <annevk3>
some example in http://intertwingly.net/stories/2008/09/20/estest.html suggests not

[13:04:00.0000] <rubys>
annevk3: the current thinking is to *not* serialize it with an m

[13:05:00.0000] <rubys>
annevk3: you there?

[13:05:01.0000] <annevk3>
yeah

[13:05:02.0000] <annevk3>
had some issues

[13:06:00.0000] <rubys>
just wondering why you want to tell the difference between decimal and number?

[13:06:01.0000] <annevk3>
seems it would be annoying if you ever wanted to extend e.g. JSON

[13:06:02.0000] <rubys>
JSON is very specific: 3.1m would be a syntax error

[13:06:03.0000] <annevk3>
hence "extend"

[13:06:04.0000] <rubys>
extending JSON would be very hard given that there are a number of implementations in a number of languages.

[13:07:00.0000] <annevk3>
but maybe it's ok, I haven't really thought long about it

[13:07:01.0000] <rubys>
the thinking is that perhaps someday there would be a "use decimal" and the JSON parser would produce decimal quantities when parsing JSON

[13:07:02.0000] <annevk3>
you'd think that be true for XML too, and yet they shipped XML 1.0 5ed a few days ago 

[13:07:03.0000] <Philip`>
annevk3: Just write it as a JSON string, and the consumer can decide that they want to parse it as a (decimal) number

[13:08:00.0000] <rubys>
Philip`: +1

[13:08:01.0000] <annevk3>
true

[13:08:02.0000] <rubys>
The question is: if somebody puts 1.1 in JSON, do they mean 1.100000000000000088817841970012523 (which is what you get with number) or 1.1 (which is what you get with decimal)?

[13:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: JSON has no defined error handling, so extending it would be a huge amount of work

[13:10:00.0000] <annevk3>
and yet people want it in all kinds of APIs

[13:28:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#textFieldSelection never happened "When we define HTMLTextAreaElement and HTMLInputElement we will have to add the IDL given below to both of their IDLs."

annevk3: XHR should define what happens when (a) its owner document stops being fully active (probably the events get buffered up somehow) and (b) what happens when its owner document is reset (probably all buffered events are discarded, and the i/o is silently aborted without any further events firing, but you'll have to check IE to be sure)

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
(a document is reset when document.open() is called upon it)

[16:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: also you'll have to define that a document has an implied strong reference to the XHR object, otherwise the object will get garbage collected before XHR has completed

[16:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe instead of owner document for the latter case you should talk in terms of the owner scripting context, since we're adding xhr to workers too

[16:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually (a) might be better handled by saying that you just block while the scripting context of the event listeners is frozen...

[16:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
and then we can define freezing of scripting contexts...

[16:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
hmm...

[16:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
document.open() sucks

[17:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: about the term "void element" -- you went with that because "empty element" is ambiguous? That is, it could mean both, "An element that by design must not contain any contents", and "An instance of element that can contain contents but that happens not to contain any." e.g., <script src=foo.js></script> is an empty element

[17:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
was that the reason, or part of the reason, or was it for a different reason(s) altogether?

[17:44:00.0000] <roc>
there are a lot of MS fanboys. The MS MVP program is institutionalized fanboys

[17:49:00.0000] <roc>
it's going to be a real nightmare figuring out why (or not) a site is being displayed with the IE8 layout engine

[17:56:00.0000] <roc>
"As for CSS compliance I have a question: the CSS specification says that illegal property-values should be ignored. Why does IE throw an exception when an illegal property-value is assigned through script (e.g. setting element.style.width='-10px' or something)?"

[17:56:01.0000] <roc>
urp

[17:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: what was the answer to that?

[17:58:00.0000] <roc>
there was no answer

[18:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: that was the only reason that i recall

[18:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: OK, thanks

[18:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: that was from a recent "chat with the MS team" thing?

[18:01:02.0000] <roc>
comment in the IEblog

[18:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I se

[18:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
see

[18:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: btw, I made a number of changes to the script I use for generating the "Typical default display properties" sections, to deal with problems you mentioned

[18:29:01.0000] <roc>
cool

[18:29:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
see http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/#audio-display

[18:29:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
or better:

[18:29:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/#input-display

[18:37:00.0000] <roc>
MikeSmith: I don't think 'box-align' is a standard property (yet)

[18:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: yeah, I know. but is that not also true about box-orient and box-margin?

[18:38:01.0000] <roc>
yes

[18:38:02.0000] <roc>
I didn't notice those

[18:39:00.0000] <roc>
appearance and box-sizing are too

[18:39:01.0000] <ajnewbold>
where are all of the circle-based properties?

[18:39:02.0000] <ajnewbold>
the circle doesn't get any respect :(

[18:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: yeah, and border-radius, and margin-start, and padding-start, and user-select

[18:40:01.0000] <roc>
well, those ones are in CSS3

[18:40:02.0000] <roc>
although Webkit's syntax might not match the CSS3 syntax for border-radius

[18:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[18:41:01.0000] <roc>
user-select might not be in any current CSS3 draft but it has been in the past

[18:41:02.0000] <roc>
so has box-sizing I suppose

[18:41:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, well, I guess I can switch those back to e.g., _vendor_-box-orient

[18:41:04.0000] <roc>
box-align/box-orient/box-margin are the most glaring annoyances because they've never been in any CSS spec

[18:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[18:42:01.0000] <roc>
I don't think it makes sense to include non-standard properties at all, to be honest

[18:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm

[18:42:03.0000] <roc>
most readers aren't going to know that those box properties are XUL related

[18:42:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
webkit uses them also

[18:43:00.0000] <roc>
yeah, because it implements parts of XUL layout

[18:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[18:43:02.0000] <roc>
these rules are really UA-specific ways of achieving a certain rendering for the replaced element

[18:43:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'll just have the script drop the box- properties

[18:43:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: OK, I see

[18:44:00.0000] <roc>
IMHO we don't need or really want to display "typical UA properties" for replaced elements

[18:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[18:44:02.0000] <roc>
they're implementation details

[18:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, but what about keeping the -start properties ?

[18:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I could just have it change those to -left, but that would kind of misleading also

[18:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, is your HTML markup language draft somewhere in CVS?

[18:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see it with the rest of them on dev.w3.org

[18:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: it's in www.w3.org CVS

[18:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[18:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
just out of interest, why didn't it get put with the others?

[18:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because systeam is asking me repeatedly not to put any more "documents" in dev.w3.org. claim that dev.w3.org is intended for hosting code and that we are essentially abusing it

[18:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
problem is that dev.w3.org is one puny machine, not load-balanced or mirrored like www.w3.org is

[18:50:01.0000] <roc>
IIRC the "start" and "end" variants of properties are something that is being standardized

[18:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
they have had some serious load problems with spiders crawling the HTML5 draft hosted on dev.w3.org

[18:50:03.0000] <heycam>
MikeSmith, shouldn't the solution to that problem be to allow CVS access to certain areas of www.w3.org by WG members?

[18:50:04.0000] <roc>
I'd just leave them in

[18:50:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
heycam: yeah

[18:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: OK, thanks. What do you think about keeping "appearance"?

[18:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
values of appearance are mostly obvious

[18:52:00.0000] <roc>
all your uses of 'appearance' are for replaced elements

[18:52:01.0000] <roc>
like I said, I wouldn't include any "default display properties" for replaced elements

[18:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok, so does the sys team have any intention of shifting specs to the other CVS server, or moving dev.w3.org onto the load balanced servers?

[18:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: I guess I'm not clear on on what a replaced element is. seems like 'input, input[type="password"], input[type="search"]' is not selecting a replaced element.. or is it?

[18:54:00.0000] <roc>
replaced elements are elements like form controls where (at least in principle) CSS does not define the rendering of the element

[18:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[18:54:02.0000] <roc>
CSS treats replaced elements as black boxes basically

[18:55:00.0000] <roc>
it just so happens that in Gecko and Webkit, at least, we implement replaced elements using CSS internally as well

[18:55:01.0000] <roc>
or mostly so

[18:55:02.0000] <roc>
but that is an implementation detail

[18:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see. Is that true for "user-select" also?

[18:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: we can shift specs ourselves to www.w3.org and use ACLs to control access. but it's maintenance PITA, and no good reason to do it except for the dev.w3.org load issues

[18:56:02.0000] <roc>
user-select is a CSS property, not an element

[18:57:00.0000] <roc>
you're listing it on 'input' and 'textarea', which are both replaced elements

[18:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: yeah, I know -- I mean the actual property

[18:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[18:57:03.0000] <roc>
<audio> and <video> are also replaced elements

[18:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: OK, I'll have it just drop what's there for audio

[18:58:01.0000] <roc>
listing "typical UA stylesheet rules" for non-replaced elements makes some sense; authors can use that as a guide for how their stylesheets are likely to interact with typical UAs

[18:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: right, that's what my main intent was for including it

[18:59:01.0000] <roc>
for replaced elements, for which CSS does not define how author styles work, and in practice author styling only works in limited ways, it's less useful

[18:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I'm understanding that now

[19:17:00.0000] <billyjackass>
roc: updated with all the replaced-elements stuff dropped -

[19:17:01.0000] <billyjackass>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/

[19:17:02.0000] <roc>
cool

[19:18:00.0000] <roc>
you still have <select>, which is a replaced element

[19:18:01.0000] <billyjackass>
well, not all of it

[19:18:02.0000] <billyjackass>
yeah

[19:18:03.0000] <roc>
ditto option and optgroup

[19:19:00.0000] <billyjackass>
yep yep

[19:19:01.0000] <billyjackass>
.me goes back to tweak more

[19:19:02.0000] <roc>
and input

[19:20:00.0000] <roc>
and textarea

[19:20:01.0000] <roc>
hmmmm

[19:20:02.0000] <roc>
/me checks his cache

[19:20:03.0000] <billyjackass>

[19:37:00.0000] <roc>
yeah

[19:38:03.0000] <malware>
/me is having network issues, IRC sessions getting hung open

How an URL gets decoded is defined in the RFC, there is no need to repeat it for HTML.

[00:15:00.0000] <yecril71>
(Especially Wikipedia has various funny marks in fragment identifiers, so it uses this feature extensively)

[00:16:00.0000] <yecril71>
id="foo%20bar" stands for just that, no decoding.

[00:17:00.0000] <yecril71>
You can say id="foo&#32;bar" if that does not suit your needs ;-)

[00:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
That will not validate of course.

[00:18:01.0000] <yecril71>
But neither does %20.

[00:19:00.0000] <yecril71>
The authors are expected to double check their pages, not to rely on the user agent to fix their nonsense each time.

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Sun hasn't done a great job in explaining how much JavaFX is just libraries and how much it's runtime environment features you couldn't do as libraries

[00:20:01.0000] <yecril71>
Of course, there are exceptions, but a mismatched identifier is not worth fixing IMHO.

[00:21:00.0000] <yecril71>
The reader can find the interesting fragment herself.

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
The first Java Web Start-based demo I tried is so slow it isn't even funny

[00:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so slow to start that is

[00:25:00.0000] <yecril71>
Content of a BR element cannot be loaded from text but it can be constructed from script.

[00:25:01.0000] <yecril71>
In that case, it should be ignored.

[00:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
So Sun now ships VP6 video decoder, too.

[01:11:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: where did you get that news from?

[01:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: Slashdot, On2's site and Wikipedia

[01:13:01.0000] <nessy>
thx

[01:19:00.0000] <jwalden>
hsivonen: did you see "Firefox is owned by Google, at this point." in that article?

[01:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jwalden: I did

[01:20:00.0000] <jwalden>
I suppose I shouldn't expect more from a renewed attempt to push a technology that was basically DOA, but I do

[01:20:01.0000] <maikmerten>
the JavaFX video demonstration plays rather horribly here

[01:20:02.0000] <maikmerten>
(and it won't resize... great)

[01:22:00.0000] <maikmerten>
and right, they licensed VP6 (On2 has a Java decoder for it) - not sure what their choice for audio is, but I'd assume MP3 perhaps to be compatible with the usual FLV files

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maikmerten: I think a FAQ said MP3

[01:25:00.0000] <maikmerten>
ah

[01:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
they aren't naming their files .flv, though

[01:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me already closed the window with the new filename extension

[01:25:03.0000] <maikmerten>

the first demo I tried was underwhelming

[01:25:05.0000] <maikmerten>
http://javafx.com/samples/SimpleVideoPlayer/index.html

[01:26:00.0000] <maikmerten>
yeah, it looked not exactly that nice and wasn't fluid here

[01:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It took around 10 minutes for Java Web Start to tell me that it tried to load and failed

[01:26:02.0000] <maikmerten>
oh, took only like 15 seconds here

[01:26:03.0000] <maikmerten>
their site was basically DDOSed by the JavaFX announcement

[01:28:00.0000] <maikmerten>
ooooh, *now* I see why that video wasn't fluid

[01:28:01.0000] <maikmerten>
the *encoded file* has dropped frames everywhere

[01:29:00.0000] <maikmerten>
yup, the audio track is 22050 Hz stereo at 64 kbit/s MP3

[01:30:00.0000] <maikmerten>
why would they *showcase* such a crappy encoding (not so much the audio quality, but the video)

[01:39:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, meh

[01:39:01.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, e-mail?

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk3>
oh you did

[01:42:01.0000] <annevk3>
meh

[01:55:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
now i've seen at least two people think that <section><h1>foo</h1><section>bar</section></section> is the correct way

[01:55:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
maybe the spec should call it out explicitly

[01:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan__, link?

[01:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, nevermind. that's what that guy asked about on help@whatwg

[01:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll make sure I mention that in the authoring guide

[01:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what's wrong with that markup

[01:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: 'bar' isn't intended to be a subsection

[01:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: yeah... not sure what to do about that. send me mail with advice? :-)

[01:59:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: Lachy's response on help⊙wo seemed like something that could be converted to examples in the spec

[02:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
sectioning elements make sectioning more trouble than it's worth, imho, but I haven't studied this in detail yet

[02:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, it can make things a little more verbose than just using numbered headings

[02:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i'd only use them for wrapper divs on a page, not within an article

[02:04:01.0000] <BenMillard>
replacing <div> with <section> throughout a page because it's "more semantic" is a permathread waiting to happen! :P

[02:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it would be worth telling people that they don't actually need to use <section>

[02:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
so they shouldn't try to mark up every single 'section' (in some very loose definition) of their page, because there's no point

[02:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
we need an outline tool so authors can see the result of their markup

[02:06:01.0000] <krijn>
BenMillard: and some <div>'s would become <article> because that's even more semantic!

[02:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
And spans become <section style="display:inline">!

[02:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
it would be better if its use could be optimised so you can replace sequential sections like this:

[02:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
<section><h1/><p>...</section><section><h1/><p>...</section>

[02:07:03.0000] <Lachy>
with:

[02:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
<section><h1/><p>... <h1/><p>...</section>

[02:07:05.0000] <Philip`>
With these changes, we're half way to the Semantic Web already

[02:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
actually, I think that already works

[02:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: it does. you get a new implied section after the <section> element

[02:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so it's as if it was <section><h1/><p>...</section><::implied-section><h1/><p>...</::implied-section>

[02:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
in the outline

[02:10:02.0000] <krijn>
Can't html5.validator.nu include the outline algorithm? :)

[02:11:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, you implemented the document outline algorithm IIRC?

[02:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
krijn: http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=65

[02:11:02.0000] <krijn>
Ah okay

[02:12:00.0000] <krijn>
Would be awesome :)

[02:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, the Semantic Data Extractor from W3C works well for <h1>-<h6>, plus a few other things: http://xrl.us/ozrwg

[02:28:00.0000] <krijn>
Yeah, but I want to use it for something like http://fronteers.nl/bijeenkomsten/planning.html5

[02:29:00.0000] <krijn>
(Which is a bad example, regarding <section>, but still)

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
since the point of <section> is to make the headers easier, maybe we should just require each section to have a header

[02:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yes

[02:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think the key is getting a selector

[02:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
that too

[02:30:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
<section> doesn't seem particularly useful without a header

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
my knee jerk reaction is that trying to require stuff to be present is bad, because it makes it harder for editors to maintain continuous validity and because someone always has a legitimate counter case

[02:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[02:34:01.0000] <krijn>
Would http://fronteers.nl/congres/2008/english.html5 be bad use of <section> then?

[02:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the best things that could happen with section:

[02:35:00.0000] <annevk3>
if we don't get the CSS issue sorted out <section> is sort of useless

[02:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
 1) a major browser changing its UA style sheet to style by outline depth by default

 2) a major browser exposing the outline in the UI for quick navigation

[02:35:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk3: I agree

[02:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if we don't require a heading for section, then I guess I'd question whether we want to have section at all. because the current content model for section is exactly the same as div; the differ only in semantics

[02:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
krijn: looks ok to me. <div>s in the <nav> could be sections too. and the sponsors could be <aside>. fwiw.

[02:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I think the only elements which should participate in the document outline are <h1>-<h6>. Even that much complexity is beyond a lot of authors at the moment. Also, <h1>-<h6> seem adequate for ATs when they are present and used in any sensible manner, without special sectioning elements and an outline depth selector.

[02:37:01.0000] <annevk3>
MikeSmith, <section> allows for nested headers without having to care about which <hx> element you use

[02:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: lots of elements have the same content model as <div>

[02:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway bed time

[02:37:05.0000] <BenMillard>

[02:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, moot point until browsers show some interest in actually implementing support for <section> natively

[02:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Do you have any idea whether many authors view HTML documents as a linear sequence of items, versus as a nested tree structure?

[02:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, interesting question.

[02:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'd guess the first viewpoint fits better with <h1>-<h6>, and the second with (nested) <section>s

[02:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hopefully Selectors 3 will get to PR soon enough and the CSS WG can start solving issues like sections and heading levels in Selectors 4

[02:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose as soon as you start doing any kind of non-trivial layout, either with tables or with CSS, you've got to view the document as a tree otherwise it just won't make sense

[02:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: as far as I can see, <section> is in fact the only element that has the same content model as <div> 

[02:41:02.0000] <krijn>
BenMillard: hmm, you need funding for this stuff? :)

[02:41:03.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, my experience is that typical authors don't think about semantics, so their mental model of the document is simply how it looks on screen.

[02:41:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
they're the only ones that can start with style@scoped

[02:41:05.0000] <krijn>
Agreed with BenMillard

[02:42:00.0000] <krijn>
Most authors think of a way to make a design work

[02:42:01.0000] <krijn>
Most of the times that's where you start writing HTML

[02:43:00.0000] <krijn>
Unless there's some wireframe/interaction design you start with

[02:43:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, my bank balance has this column where some values are positive some are negative. The sum of those numbers must be positive, otherwise I start getting worried. Without funding, it's hard to get enough positive values into that column whilst still doing significant amounts of HTML5 stuff. :)

[02:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, so does that mean the tree view makes sense when it has a clear relationship with the layout (e.g. deeply nested tables/divs), but not so much when it's largely independent of layout (e.g. invisible <section>s)?

[02:46:00.0000] <krijn>
The tree view is important for CSS selectors as well

[02:46:01.0000] <krijn>
But as an author, you mostly control the rough layout parts.. Inside the body of an article, most of the stuff comes from a CMS, where you can't control anything

[02:46:02.0000] <krijn>
At least, that's my experience

[02:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, hsivonen looking at the HTML5 spec, I see that it currently seems to allow style@scoped in any flow content -- not just in div and section 

[02:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but the whattf.or schema restricts style@scoped to just being in div and section

[02:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, do any UAs yet support style@scoped? (style in body content)

[02:53:00.0000] <annevk3>
no

[02:53:01.0000] <annevk3>
(style in body content they do, but that's not the same)

[02:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk3: style in body content just gets moved to the DOM head and is unscoped, right?

[02:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is, @scoped is just ignored if it's present

[02:54:02.0000] <BenMillard>
MikeSmith, yeah. I've used <style> in body content to hide content further up the page in a demo in Firefox 2 and that worked. (So the <style> was not scoped.)

[02:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[02:55:01.0000] <annevk3>
MikeSmith, it should not get moved to the head I think

[02:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>

[03:00:00.0000] <Philip`>

anyone know where (irc server/channel) i can get help for -webkit-animation questions?

[03:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
unemployed QA people are know to cause all manner of havoc

[03:03:02.0000] <annevk3>
or maybe it's the QA and spec people keeping themselves employed

[03:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm Ben has gone so I can't argue with him about HTML4 headings being understandable by authors

[03:13:00.0000] <krijn>
Are they?

[03:14:00.0000] <|tbb|>
anyone has experience with webkit-animation ?

[03:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Are you wanting to argue in favour of or against the view that they are understandable?

[03:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
|tbb|: ping dino_ on #webkit

[03:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Against, otherwise it would be a kind or boring argument where we agreed

[03:17:00.0000] <krijn>
Hmm, http://fronteers.nl/congres/2008/english.html5 and http://fronteers.nl/congres/2008/english.xhtml5 work remarkably well.. (my first HTML5 test with a real site)

[03:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: But he never claimed they were understandable - he said they were "beyond a lot of authors at the moment"

[03:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Oh well. I still disagree with the premise that that means we should not have <section> in html5

[03:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

jgraham, I'm here now. :)

[05:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: You're wrong :p

[05:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I did implement the HTML5 outline algorithm. There is a shoddy UI on james.html5.org

[05:27:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, cool

[05:28:00.0000] <annevk3>
so far over half of the requests to html5.org in December resulted in 403 (53046 requests)

[05:29:00.0000] <annevk3>
amount of requests declined enormously after I implemented that change as well

[05:29:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, I have similarly annoying stats on Project Cerbera

[05:29:02.0000] <BenMillard>
but for 404s

[05:29:03.0000] <annevk3>
first day 26000, implemented change, second day 13000 requests, third and fourth day 3000 requests each

[05:29:04.0000] <BenMillard>
like, things are requesting completely bogus URLs from my site which have never existed

[05:30:00.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, this is something else

[05:30:01.0000] <annevk3>
a bot was hitting html5.org quite hard

[05:30:02.0000] <annevk3>
using a distributed proxy network of some sorts

[05:30:03.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, do you think it was malicious or just dumb?

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk3>
no idea

[05:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, about a year ago I summarised some of the common approaches to using <h1>-<h6> amongst accessibility professionals from accessify.com: http://projectcerbera.com/web/articles/heading-numbers#interpretations

[05:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I've collected examples of how headings are done on the web here: http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2008/headings

[05:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, the biggest problem from an accessibility point of view is heading text which is not marked up using heading elements.

[05:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: When I implemented a Firefox extension for document outlines, the biggest problem apart from simply missing headings was people who didn't connect their use of headings to the logical structure of their document, even though that logical structure was often expressed in <div>s

[05:43:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, here's an HTML5 outline algorithm thingy from jgraham: http://james.html5.org/outliner.html

[05:44:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, really? Nearest I've found to a fully sectioned document are ones which use <blockquote> as if it were a section element, so they get indented sections.

[05:44:01.0000] <BenMillard>
for example: http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/glob.html

[05:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
what sort of disconnects did you find? an <h2> before the first <h1>, things like that?

[05:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Things like people using <h2> for all their subheadings and then <h4> for all the sidebar headings "because they are less important", so the sidebar ends up under the final subsection

[05:48:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, yeah I've seen things like that as well

[05:49:00.0000] <krijn>
BenMillard, jgraham: doesn't work too well, but could be me..

[05:49:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijn, yeah I entered a URL and clicked "Load" and still waiting...

[05:49:02.0000] <krijn>
:)

[05:49:03.0000] <jgraham>
Well it worked once upon a time

[05:50:00.0000] <krijn>
It also doesn't like <h1><img alt="Foo"></h1>

[05:50:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, that's basically fine for the user experience in practice, so long as it's done consistently across the website

[05:50:02.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Not for visual users displaying the headings in a tree

[05:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
At least for me it sucked

[05:50:04.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, who would do that? If you can see the document, you don't need a 

[05:50:05.0000] <BenMillard>
oops

[05:51:00.0000] <BenMillard>
if you can see the document, you don't need a document outline to show you what you can already see?

[05:51:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(yay arguments! :P)

[05:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
having heading elements at all creates a dramatic improve in accessibility since "next heading" and "previous heading" are a boon for zooming around the page non-visually

[05:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: http://gnuplot.info/docs_4.0/gnuplot.html

[05:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Also if it is useless it is pretty surprisingly common in editors/viewers for other languages e.g. word, many pdf readers

[05:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, that's a really long document with many sections...not very typical of web pages I find through random searching and browsing. :)

[05:55:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, does your Firefox extension support Firefox 2? if so I could try it out

[05:55:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: what is the plugin for?

[05:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i.e. which app?

[05:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Officially it only supports 2 because I didn't update it for 3

[05:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: looks like its for running unit tests in the context of Rails

[05:56:03.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, cool got a link for it?

[05:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, the Information > Show Document Outline feature in the Web Developer Toolbar for Firefox works on that document, just with <h1>-<h6>, although you can't click it's output to scroll the document it came from.

[05:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me notices that some people seem to like it which suggests non-disabled users have a use for this kind of feature

[05:59:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I can totally see the handiness of this for people who frequently browse massive documents, like specs and big computery manual thingies.

[05:59:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, and it works without specialist sectioning markup. ;) ;)

[06:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: It needs <h1>-<h6>

[06:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
But that design just lends itself to brokenness

[06:01:02.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, by "specialist sectioning markup" I mean things like <section>, <article>, etc

[06:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, do you think requiring more markup from authors would reduce the frequency of brokenness on the web, then?

[06:02:01.0000] <krijn>
Just <h> (or now <h1>) with good selector support would've saved so much trouble :/

[06:02:02.0000] <BenMillard>
sectioning elements + heading elements is more markup than heading elements alone

[06:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I think markup that corresponds to the structure being represented should lead to less brokenness

[06:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
Headings were badly designed in the first place, presumably because there was no easy way to style based on nesting level but different elements were easy to style differently

[06:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think it is worth trying to fix both those problems, subject to the usual constraints

[06:05:00.0000] <hendry>
can i confirm that inputmode has been dropped from HTML5?

[06:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I'm not sure we agree what "brokenness" is.

[06:06:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I consider <p><strong> for <h4> to be broken. I consider or using <h1> for big bold text to be broken.

[06:06:02.0000] <BenMillard>
s/or using/using/

[06:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
No disagreement so far

[06:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I consider <h1> for main content heading with <h2> for company name in the header to be fine

[06:07:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(so an <h2> before the first <h1>)

[06:08:00.0000] <annevk3>
hendry, yes

[06:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
I consider that particular example suboptimal but of little consequence

[06:08:02.0000] <jgraham>
(HTML5 deals with it fine)

[06:08:03.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, fair enough.

[06:08:04.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, this document has no <h1> so is that broken? http://gnuplot.info/docs_4.0/gnuplot.html

[06:09:00.0000] <hendry>
annevk3: ta

[06:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I don't really carewhich headings people use an an absolute sense, so long as they have the correct relationship to each other

[06:11:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, interesting.

[06:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Unless you can demonstrate tha it is practical to extract some information from markup I'm not that bothered by how it is used. I doubt you can extract much meaningful information from absolute header numbers that you could not get by making a tree

[06:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, do you agree that using any heading element around heading text is better than using no heading element around that text?

[06:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yes

[06:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, do you agree that heading elements are uncommon even though heading text is common?

[06:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I don't know. I suspect that is true

[06:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, find-in-page for "h1" to "h6": http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/survey/2007-07-17/analyse.cgi/index

[06:22:01.0000] <BenMillard>
and use common sense to realise that just about ever page has multiple runs of heading text :)

[06:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
s/ever/every/

[06:23:01.0000] <BenMillard>
the "Tag names (page)" bars are the best for seeing this

[06:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, am I right in saying we agree the biggest problem is getting authors to indicate heading-ness in the first place, and indicating the correct level is the second biggest problem?

[07:06:00.0000] <krijn>
The biggest problem is tools, letting authors produce something like <p><strong>Some sentence without a period</strong></p>

[07:06:01.0000] <krijnh>
Doh

[07:06:02.0000] <krijnh>
BenMillard: still discussing headings? :)

[07:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I agree with the problems. I think <section> is more likely to get the relative ordering right. I don't know what is more likely to get people using headings at all but I guess it doesn't make too much difference

[07:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, <section>+<h1> requires more elements and a special CSS selector. That dooms its prospects of becoming widespread, from the authoring practices I've seen. The bigger problem is headingness, so we shouldn't make headings in HTML more complicated by adding a doomed solution to a lesser problem.

[07:41:00.0000] <krijnh>
h2, h3 and h4 also still work, which don't require more markup, I think <section><h1 /></section> solves the <div><h4 /></div> problem

[07:41:01.0000] <krijnh>
Or am I not getting it?

[07:41:02.0000] <BenMillard>
(<section>+<h1> is a shorthand for the combination of <article>, <aside> and <section> with <h1> (or <h1>-<h6>) in HTML5)

[07:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, if they work then why introduce section elements and the ability to only use <h1> when sectioning elements are present?

[07:42:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(my point is that there's no reason to introduce these things that outweighs the complexity of adding them)

[07:44:00.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, <section>+<h1> is crucial if you have an article you want to use in several contexts, e.g. on blogs

[07:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, I'd hardly call it crucial since people get by without it fine already.

[07:45:01.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, modifying the value of x in <hx> properly when publishing an article in several contexts is just not trivial

[07:45:02.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, I avoid the use of headers in blog posts exactly because of this

[07:45:03.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Especially when syndicating from multiple sources

[07:45:04.0000] <annevk3>
yeah, for planet.intertwingly the problem is even worse

[07:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: For the kind of people who care enough to use headings at all I think the complexity of <section> et.al. is small. Certianly people have said to me in person that they want to use the new elements

[07:48:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, doing trivial string replacement to change heading levels automatically has worked fine for entries I write on my blog for over a year.

[07:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, people get seduced by novelty. I'd rather not do a new study in 20 years time just to say "See! I told you so!" :P

[07:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
OTOH the complexity of <h1>-<h6> is kind of hidden. They look simple but people always use them in odd ways

[07:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, playing fast an loose with heading levels doesn't matter if it's done consistently across a website.

[07:50:01.0000] <krijnh>
Not saving the <hx> markup anywhere in a database (only the heading level in the current context) makes it a lot easier as well

[07:51:00.0000] <BenMillard>
as for syndicating from multiple sources, I suggest that is non-trivial to start with and that there are many corrections other than heading depth which must be made to do it "properly"

[07:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What Lachy was getting me to write was a script to replace all <hx> elements with their correct depth, ignoring the fact that <section> resets the x required

[07:52:00.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, string replacement is not really acceptable for markup

[07:52:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, tell that to the web. :)  It's been faultless on my blog, and I suck at programming...

[07:52:02.0000] <krijnh>

wow, Yahoo! Slurp is still accessing URLs I created permanent redirects for about 3 years ago...

[07:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: The tools won't save us. HTTP is badly implemented.

[07:59:00.0000] <krijnh>
Slurp is slurping all my sites as well, without ever providing any visitors :/

[07:59:01.0000] <krijnh>

Yahoo! is usually my 3rd biggest traceable referrer (or 2nd if you count Google and Google Images as 1 referrer): http://projectcerbera.com/blog/2008/04/bandwidth

[08:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, yeah I've seen other people complain about permanent redirects not being treated as permanent....I expected a search engine to get that right though.

[08:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: SimplePie doesn't at all.

[08:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
Google is the only one I've seen that crawls URLs from scripts as well as from the HTML

[08:05:00.0000] <krijnh>
Google Reader, Firefox Live Bookmarks.. Also not respecting 301's..

[08:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't entirely understand why search engines all seem to have completely different lists of places from which they extract URLs to crawl, and haven't yet converged to anything consistent

[08:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/http/

[08:06:02.0000] <BenMillard>
/me wonders what proportion of requests that look like they come from search  bots actually come from spambots and other malware using common search bot UA strings...

[08:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: I suppose that would be easy to determine, by just seeing who the IP address belongs to

[08:10:01.0000] <yecril71>
getElementByIdInSubtree is not that good really.

[08:11:00.0000] <yecril71>
It solves only the part of the problem.

[08:11:01.0000] <yecril71>
a part.

[08:11:02.0000] <yecril71>
What is needed here are local identifiers.

[08:11:03.0000] <yecril71>
They need not be unique throughout a document.

[08:12:00.0000] <krijnh>
IE5.5 requesting 10 pages all in the exact same second sure does look like a bot.. And then it also fetches stylesheets and javascripts :\

[08:12:01.0000] <BenMillard>
/me just traced that a 404 was being caused by Slup trying to access a REALLY REALLY old URL, which goes through 3 layers of rewriting that ends up removing a necessary dash.

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Since "descendant" is hard to spell, maybe the term "offspring" or "progeny" would work better)

[08:13:01.0000] <yecril71>
The local identifier, when it is referred to by an attribute, should be located in the subtree of the calling element first.

[08:13:02.0000] <BenMillard>
/me resolves to refactor his legacy .htaccess rules...which won't be fun.

[08:14:00.0000] <krijnh>
BenMillard: you should get yourself better tools ;) They'll save you!

[08:14:01.0000] <yecril71>
If that fails, the parent nodes should be considered, until a subtree with a matching descendant is found.

[08:15:00.0000] <yecril71>
That would be a lifeboat for people using server-side templates.

[08:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: You should have unit tests so you can refactor your .htaccess safe in the knowledge that you won't accidentally break any links :-)

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: That would probably be incompatible with existing content, which relies on it always returning the first element (in document order) with that id

[08:17:00.0000] <krijnh>
http://projectcerbera.com/blog/2008/04/bandwidth/foo/bar/baz/hmm/i/need/a/htaccess/update/k10x :)

[08:17:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, that's a really good idea. Evidently my previous URL changes have caused little bits of breakage. Is there a guide to doing that well?

[08:17:02.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, whoa...what the hell...

[08:18:00.0000] <krijnh>
Err, yeah :)

[08:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: I'm not aware of any - it's the kind of thing that I've thought I should do, but never got around to

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://projectcerbera.com/blog///////////////////////// is fun

[08:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I'll have a look around when I bite the bullet to try and fix this once and for all

[08:21:00.0000] <krijnh>
Well Yahoo Slurp, eat your heart out :)

[08:21:01.0000] <BenMillard>
LOL...how are those even working?

[08:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, Yahoo! Slup still enters from the .html version of my URLs, so it always starts by going through the permanent redirect we designed nearly 2 years ago when I moved to extensionless URLs. :|

[08:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.詹姆斯.com/feed breaks pretty much everything

[08:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Sorry, I'm just trying out other feed readers

[08:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Suggestions?

[08:40:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Sage is an add-on for Firefox which I've used for a long time: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/77

[08:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Main issue with that: I don't use Firefox.

[08:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, not even for testing?

[08:41:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Yes, but I do little testing at the moment :)

[08:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, well Sage has served me...I don't recall seeing a broken feed in it but then I have a tiny number of quite predictable feeds.

[08:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders in what way that feed breaks

[08:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I am subscribed to a number of feeds that do horrible things just to break stuff

[08:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It's because the XHTML namespace is stored as an entity

[08:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I don't know why that breaks a lot of feed readers seeming most do at least use an XML parser

[08:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Oh - it seems to work fine in Opera at least

[08:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It completely fucks up Safari, and Google Reader doesn't take kindly to it either

[08:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, that page for Sage claims 2,184,552 total downloads, which I guess makes it a fairly popular choice (over 100,000 actual users?)

[08:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://simplepie.org/demo/?feed=www.詹姆斯.com%2Ffeed works :P

[08:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If I go to http://simplepie.org/404/ then the big search box gives an empty page when I try to use it :-(

[08:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: EPIC FAIL.

[09:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It's a disaster

[09:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I know, I'm so sad :(

[11:08:00.0000] <yecril71>
getElementByID is not called on an Element at present, so there are no backward compatibility issues involved.

[14:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me yawns

[14:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is trying to convince someone that he does actually want his CMS to output HTML

[14:10:01.0000] <krijnh>
Pick me, pick me :)

[14:11:00.0000] <krijnh>
gsnedders: a customer of yours?

[14:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
krijnh: No, I'm just looking for a CMS to use for a website, and I was asking in #drupal-support whether Drupal could output HTML

[14:12:01.0000] <smedero>
I imagine you got a lot of blank stares.

[14:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It can output broken XHTML, why would you ever want HTML?

[14:13:01.0000] <krijnh>
I picked HTML output for my CMS 3,5 years ago, and still happy with it (as are my customers)

[14:14:00.0000] <krijnh>
OTOH is outputting 'broken XHTML' means a solidus here and there, who cares

[14:14:01.0000] <krijnh>
*if

[14:17:00.0000] <krijnh>
gsnedders: take a crash course Dutch and you can use mine for free ;)

[14:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
krijnh: :)

[14:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
krijnh: I think I have too much on my plate with four AHs. I have a computing project which I need to do in the next two weeks, and an English dissertation in the next four :)

[14:18:00.0000] <krijnh>
Heh

[14:18:01.0000] <krijnh>
To get to know Drupal, 2 weeks isn't enough :)

[14:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm not planning on doing any such thing. :)

[14:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What I'm doing is a module for Anolis 1.1 disguised as being a program in itself :)

[14:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone know of a CMS that can take HTML input (and sanitize it) and that uses a serializer?

[14:44:00.0000] <aboodman>
Hixie: what are the latest thoughts around adding crypto primitives?


2008-12-06
[18:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
aboodman: no thoughts at all until now. seems like something that would be interesting as a separate web apps spec. I'd be concerned about doing any crypto anything over HTTP.

[22:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: your definition of doctype doesn't match the spec

[22:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: which part doesn't match?

[22:33:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: the spec allows whitespace before the '>'

[22:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[22:34:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: can't you copy the spec's definition whole-sale? it's less verbose now

[22:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: maybe. for now, I've just added "\s+"

[22:35:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
shouldn't it be \s*

[22:35:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
?

[22:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, \s*

[22:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: "Non-void elements have an end tag to indicate where they end." -- foreign self-closing elements don't have an end tag

[22:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: thanks -- OK, will fix that now

[22:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: "Void elements that are not from the MathML namespace" doesn't make sense since the list of void elements only includes elements from the HTML namespace

[22:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks now

[22:52:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: the example on CDATA section doesn't need a CDATA section -- it doesn't contain any < or &

[22:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: yeah, I know. but I copied that straight from the MathML spec.. that's the example they have in there. Not sure why they're using that as an example

[22:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe I can revise it to add a < or & into it?

[22:54:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
if it would make sense, otherwise perhaps come up with some other example :) also show an equivalent example that uses entities instead

[22:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: OK, I've added to my TODO list. I think I might ask the MathML WG to add those to the examples in the MathML spec itself

[22:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if they don't want to, I guess I'll just invent some

[22:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but since CDATA sections are only allowed with MathML content, and I don't know anything about MathML, I'd rather they provide the examples 

[22:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me finds an example on the web that uses <mi><![CDATA[&infinity;]]></mi> which probably isn't what was intended

[22:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: in the mean time, I did go ahead and check in your other changes

[22:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g, at http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/#the-doctype

[23:00:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: cool

[23:00:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
"cdata" is so not searchable

[23:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks, and keep them coming, when you find more

[23:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: ?

[23:01:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
searchable in what context

[23:01:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
?

[23:01:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
it means 10 things so if i want to google for usage of cdata sections i get dtd fragments

[23:01:05.0000] <zcorpan_>
or attribute definitions

[23:01:06.0000] <zcorpan_>
or cdata elements

[23:01:07.0000] <zcorpan_>
etc

[23:01:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[23:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you need some semantic web, man

[23:03:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
or google code search :)

[23:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, or MAMA!

[23:03:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
i haven't looked into how to use mama

[23:03:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would really like to have search access to mama

[23:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
blooberry: ↑

[23:04:01.0000] <blooberry>
/me looks

[23:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: you a pythonist? what's the best-practice way to remove leading/trailing whitespace from a string in python?

[23:05:01.0000] <blooberry>
mikesmith: 8-}

[23:05:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
blooberry: open data, brother. Lead by example!

[23:05:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
just giving a hard time

[23:05:04.0000] <blooberry>
mama currently mostly ignores cdata sections. *puts that on the to-do list*

[23:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
.me (re)finds .strip()

[23:07:00.0000] <blooberry>
mikesmith: I'm working on it. 8-} I need to do a current re-crawl of the URLs MAMA looked at last year first and improve the search perf. 

[23:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
blooberry: you mostly still doing the work on it yourself, or you got some assistance now?

[23:08:00.0000] <blooberry>
it's all me still. 8-/

[23:08:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
StoreRaw("<ow:math><![CDATA[" & Replace(pText, "]]>", "]]&gt;") & "]]></ow:math>") -- that surely won't do what's intended

[23:08:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
as it happens i can't find a single valid use of cdata in mathml

[23:08:03.0000] <blooberry>
I'm adding new features though to the analysis script right now. Have any other requests?

[23:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
blooberry: nothing I can think of now

[23:09:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
blooberry: is it possible to do regexp search on the source markup?

[23:10:00.0000] <blooberry>
zcorpan_: no. It stores a greatly deflated version of the page right now.

[23:11:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
that's what Philip` usually does (http://philip.html5.org/data.html) and is basically what i would like to do most often

[23:11:01.0000] <blooberry>
The "manual" version of the analysis script can do regexp searching of all content though, but you are probably looking for regexp searching on a batch of pages, yes?

[23:11:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
yeah

[23:11:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
doesn't need to be a million pages

[23:12:00.0000] <blooberry>
yeah, I've thought of doing something like that for a much smaller subset

[23:12:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
consider it a feature request :)

[23:12:02.0000] <blooberry>
philip` is covering that for some values of smaller sets though already

[23:12:03.0000] <blooberry>
8-}

[23:12:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
yeah but i hate to bother him all the time

[23:13:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and his batch of pages is out of date :P

[23:13:01.0000] <blooberry>
so is mine, at the moment. 8-}

[23:14:00.0000] <blooberry>
(how "out of date" is his set?)

[23:14:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
at least a year i think

[23:14:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
but could be wrong

[23:14:03.0000] <blooberry>
about what mine is too.

[23:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
 <replacetoken><![CDATA[<math>]]></replacetoken>

[23:15:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
 <replacevalue><![CDATA[<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">]]></replacevalue>

[23:15:02.0000] <blooberry>
I'd like to start a re-crawl by the new year, but it may not happen that soon. Should be january at the latest though.

[23:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
cool

[23:18:00.0000] <blooberry>
so, I'm contemplating having MAMA store some stats about replaced object dimensions, but I'm not sure I can come up with a solution that addresses interesting problems and is also a good storage compromise

[23:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: are those replacetoken examples good examples?

[23:20:00.0000] <blooberry>
and if I factor in resizing via CSS or (worse) Javascript, then the problem possibly becomes a silly proposition

[23:20:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: no, they're just interesting

[23:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[23:21:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: the code assumes that mathml markup thrown at it won't have the namespace declaration

[23:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[23:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: i recommend replacing the example with svg <script><![CDATA[... when svg is back in the spec

[23:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: yeah, definitely

[23:25:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: a:-webkit-any-link translates to a:link, a:visited

[23:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: ah, OK

[23:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me fixes now

[23:37:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: the <input> section would be more useful if split up to its type='' states

[23:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: yeah, I think so. I guess I'll need to have the build script do that. It's too much of a mess to read through the way it is now.

[23:40:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it looks like the schema treats them as different elements basically

[23:40:01.0000] <BenMillard>
the different states of <input> are more like different elements in the way they are used

[23:40:02.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, zcorpan_ types faster than me :P

[23:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
IMHO, they should in fact have been different elements from the beginning. it's bad language design the way it is now

[23:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the complexities of documenting it expose that

[23:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
html has lots of bad langauge design :)

[23:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
true

[23:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but <input> sticks out like sore thumb, in its particular badness

[23:43:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
for your use case yes :)

[23:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: added to TODO list

[23:44:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
if you're writing html you're probably more concerned about <img alt> not taking markup

[23:44:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
it doesn't bother me so much (when writing markup) that <input type=image> and <input type=file> aren't different elements

[23:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i wonder why map { display:inline } is in the style sheet

[23:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: moz stylsheet has:

[23:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
html, div, map, dt, isindex, form {

[23:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
  display: block;

[23:49:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
so they had it as block and then changed it to inline? or is it different in quirks mode?

[23:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: dunno, webkit has it as inline, moz has a block

[23:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as I can see

[23:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
oh. in moz it's inline in quirks

[23:52:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
in webkit it's always inline. still, i wonder why webkit has the declaration -- it's inline by default

[23:53:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: the spec has class="bad example" or some such in a different style than normal examples

[23:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: OK, will take a look

[23:54:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: should say that noscript is only allowed in HTML

[23:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: you mean as opposed to MathML or SVG?

[23:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: as opposed to XHTML

[23:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[23:57:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm, webkit's default style for <q> doesn't handle nested <q>s well

[23:57:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
in fact i think webkit doesn't support open-quote etc at all

[23:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, I've seen sites which set quotes on <q> via q:before and q:after, which might be due to that?

[23:59:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(the content property via those selectors, not the quotes property)

[00:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: I've set pre.bad to "color: red" for now

[00:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: fixed the -webkit-any-link thing too

[00:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/#a-display

[00:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: I'll try to get input split up by some time next week

[00:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for consistency, maybe it make sense to split up button and command as well

[00:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, or maybe not command, but button at least

[02:38:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: you'd still have q:before { content:open-quote }

[03:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: It isn't any bother for me to run regexp searches, but if you're looking for legitimate <![CDATA[ uses then I probably couldn't help much since I have almost no XML pages

[03:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Also, if you just want to run regexps yourself, you could probably easily download a load of pages (e.g. get the list from dmoz.org, pick a random sample, pass to curl, it's only about 25KB per page so a million fits in 25GB of disk easily), and then run grep and be very patient :-)

[03:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: I added build support for generating per-element "Additional constraints" subsections. So far, the only one is for stating the "The noscript element must not be used in a document in the XML syntax." constraint.

Anyone know of any definition of BibTeX?

[05:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"two fields must be separated by a coma" — nice to know

[05:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BibTeX is ewww

[05:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If you could design something better, and could do it 23 years ago and could get everyone to use it, that would be greatly appreciated

[05:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[05:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, what's wrong with RDF!?

[08:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, all the introduction sections should really be numbered section 0 within their depth

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
That looks like the result of excellent marketing - they're excited about HTML5 because of two features which are not actually in HTML5 and never have been

[11:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
 Philip`, the web workers stuff is understandable since the spec was also edited by Hixie and was discussed in the whatwg and/or html wg lists

[11:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I'm surprised about how anyone could possibly think geolocation is part of html5

[11:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders WTF is up with Anolis

[11:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
html5lib bug

[11:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: you around?

[13:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: web workers is in html5 according to the web workers spec

[13:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Can you not have to have .copyright on each p, but just have a div instead around them?

[14:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: why?

[14:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2008OctDec/0424.html I'm surprised the svg wg wants me to remove the authoring requirements from selectors api

[15:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: So I don't have to repeat @class='copyright'

[15:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
?

[15:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I'm lazy.

[15:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, what is it that you're doing with the copyright stuff which is made more difficult?

[15:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Nothing. I'm just lazy.

[15:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
what? Then how are you affected by it at all?

[15:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Because I'm too lazy to repeat @class='copyright' :P

[15:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I want <div class="copyright"><p>foo<p>bar</div> instead of <p class=copyright>foo<p class=copyright>bar

[15:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
is this something to do with anolis?

[15:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Nope

[15:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
you're not being clear at all.

[15:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm too lazy to repeat the class attribute. That is all.

[15:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't see how this is unclear

[15:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
because I don't know what you are doing that makes you have to repeat it? All I can tell is that this has something to do with the whatwg spec's header file

[15:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I have the MIT license which has four paragraphs.

[15:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I, like a number of other people here, use the whatwg stylesheet

[15:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, so your problem is in fact the stylesheet using p.copyright instead of just .copyright

[15:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah

[15:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, why didn't you just say so?!

[15:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thought he did

[15:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is half alseep

[15:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, you asked Hixie to change the markup in the spec, which doesn't directly address your problem, although it would have indirectly made him update the stylesheet.

[15:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Don't expect sense out of me at this time!

[15:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's ok. I'm' used to people failing to explain their problems and use cases properly :-)

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: why do you have two copyrights?

[15:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: For the same reason you do, the copyright info is more than one paragraph.

[15:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: As I said, I have the full MIT license

[15:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
four paragraphs off the top of my head

[15:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
don't include the whole license on the page :-P

[15:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
stick it in an appendix if you must

[15:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
or just refer to it

[17:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm trying to look up and book a train ticket on BritRail, for when I'll be in London over New Years. Does anyone here have any idea what the difference is between "Ticket Only", "Ticket & Reservation", and "Reservation Only"?

[17:48:00.0000] <gavin>
what are the differences in price between them?

[17:49:00.0000] <gavin>
/me predicts Ticket Only < Reservation Only < Ticket and Reservation

[17:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
it seems the reservation options let me choose which date and time I want to travel. But then I don't understand what it would mean to buy a ticket without a reservation

[17:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
they don't appear to have the time I was looking for though. My sister said she got a train on 2nd Jan deptarting 09:00/arriving 11:16, but there isn't one listed at that time.

[17:58:00.0000] <svl>
reservation is probably for a specific seat, with not all trains allowing seat reservation. (that's a guess; no idea if the UK even has trains with seat reservation)

[18:01:00.0000] <svl>
http://www.seat61.com/UKtravel.htm#Buying%20UK%20train%20tickets%20if%20youre%20from%20outside%20the%20UK might help

[18:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, that says I can most likely just buy a ticket at the station on the day. That might be a lot easier

[18:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I have an oyster card from when I was in London a few months ago. Does that work on long distance trains as well, or just the suburban trains?

[18:10:00.0000] <svl>
oyster is london only.

[18:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[18:11:01.0000] <svl>
And yeah, unless it's a special fast long distance train, buying a ticket in advance definitely won't be necessary.

[18:12:00.0000] <svl>
(Just might work out cheaper.)

[18:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think it's a special one. I'm just travelling from London to Chester

[00:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me is confused by http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Dec/0088.html

[00:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, yeah, I think Joshue is just confused

[00:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, the stuff about HTTP is what threw me. :)

[00:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
indeed

[00:36:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I consider the off-screen model as being part of step 5

[00:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the way ATs interact with web pages is, as Josh describes, something of a patchwork at the moment due to inadequate APIs, bugs in applications, dynamic content and so forth

[00:37:01.0000] <BenMillard>
but the steps from 1-4 don't seem affected by that, afaict

[00:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, does the part Josh quoted from me make sense to you?

[00:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
This one isn't as clear as it could be "The UA stores them in the relevant accessibility API properties."

[00:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
The UA stores the associations in an implementation specific way. It doesn't really matter how. The important part is that it reports those associations to the AT through the accessibility APIs

[00:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard,

[00:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
1. The UA runs through the <table> once using the algorithm to find and store all of the associations between cells.

[00:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
2. A user interacts with a cell via an AT.

[00:44:03.0000] <Lachy>
3. The AT obtains the associations for the cell by querying the UA via the accessibility APIs

[00:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, yeah that makes sense

[00:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
I cut your original step 2 and 5. Step 5 wasn't actually a step in the process, it's more of a footnote about how the AT can interact with the user

[00:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
step 4 would then be the AT reporting the relevant information to the user

[00:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, it could also work if the AT obtained access directly to the DOM and applied the algorithm itself to work out the associations

[00:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, my hope is that UAs will implement this since there are far fewer UAs than ATs, plus UAs have the resources and involvement in web standards to get it right. :)

[00:49:01.0000] <BenMillard>
but yes, ATs could do it themselves in the way you describe

[00:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, yeah, the other advantage is that its cheaper for a user to upgrade their browser than it is to upgrade their AT

[00:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, good point!

[00:50:01.0000] <BenMillard>
please send these thoughts to the thread, if you have the time :)

[00:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
I generally try to avoid contributing to accessibility related threads these days, given past experiences :-)

[00:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I suppose I could

[00:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
well, your clarification that UAs can vary in how they store the information so long as ATs can query it, and that ATs can vary in how they store what they get, should help

[00:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
and that the hope is for UAs to implement the association algorithm rather than ATs, for various reasons

[04:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You are meeting me tomorrow.

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Oh, okay

[05:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: At what time?

[05:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: T19:00:00Z/PT5m

[06:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: If technology permits, I will remind you tomorrow too.

[06:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Okay, I think I should be able to remember that now :-)

[07:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm…

[07:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Do I need to take my really thick warm anorak with me?

[07:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not overwhelmingly warm here

[07:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I imagine you're used to the cold :-p

[07:34:00.0000] <neatnik>
gsnedders: did you ever work things out with that girl?

[07:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
neatnik: The one I was tweeting about?

[07:40:01.0000] <neatnik>
gsnedders: not sure, the one we chatted about, oh, a year or so ago

[07:40:02.0000] <neatnik>
/me = ajnewbold

[07:40:03.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, that makes more sense

[07:40:04.0000] <gsnedders>
neatnik: pm?

[07:40:05.0000] <neatnik>
sure

[07:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if there are good places to get access to a Windows machine with decent RAM/CPU/disk, for compiling some software, for maybe an (unpredictably scheduled) half hour a day, for as little money as possible

[07:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't really want to get into discussions about this sort of stuff here (or in any other logged channel :P)

[07:41:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Scrounge off friends?

[07:41:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That normally works for me

[07:41:04.0000] <Philip`>
(The only thing I've heard of is Amazon EC2, which may or may not be suitable, but there ought to be better options)

[07:41:05.0000] <neatnik>
gsnedders: ah, gotcha; I never even think about logs

[07:41:06.0000] <neatnik>
surely that'll come back to haunt me someday

[07:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[07:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: All my friends run Linux ;-)

[07:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I'm not your friend!? :'(

[07:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: and I need something fairly reliable and long-term, which probably wouldn't be possible if I was borrowing spare resources off people

[07:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: ah. I don't run Windows anyway.

[07:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: s/run Linux/don't run Windows/, then :-p

[07:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: :)

[07:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
I used to just run a machine in my parent's house, but that's no so good in terms of electricity cost or noise or bandwidth

[07:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/no/not/

[11:58:00.0000] <dave_levin__>
Does the html5 spec imply that on right click a mouseup event should be sent before the contexmenu event (http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#context-menus)?

[12:34:00.0000] <yecril71>
The cost of traversing a tree is proportional to the number of nodes.

[12:36:00.0000] <yecril71>
Even if we strictly follow the prescription of ID maintenance, the cost of inserting an identifier is proportional to the depth of the inserted node.

[12:36:01.0000] <yecril71>
So it is usually much cheaper.

[12:36:02.0000] <yecril71>
The structure of the DOM tree is prescribed by the document, 

[12:37:00.0000] <yecril71>
it cannot be balanced or unbalanced at the implementor�s will.

[12:38:00.0000] <yecril71>
There are use cases for efficient scoped identifiers; 

[12:38:01.0000] <yecril71>
since the implementors must deal with them anyway, why not make the interface available for scripting?

[12:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
Inserting a node into an empty element is not so special.

[12:50:01.0000] <yecril71>
It is as bad as inserting an unsupported child node, which can happen to other elements as well.

[12:51:00.0000] <yecril71>
Why should an element with no text child nodes be illegal?

[12:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: depends on the platform (will be either after mousedown or after mouseup/click, probably)

[13:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I found this awesome search plugin to fix my problem with Google's annoying redirection :-) http://mycroft.mozdev.org/search-engines.html?name=google+(no+country+redirect)

[13:56:00.0000] <dave_levin>
hixie: So the events around the right click (which results in contextmenu) are platform dependent and basically not defined in html5.

[13:59:00.0000] <dave_levin>
I ask this because webkit on Windows sends mouseup and on OSX, it doesn't.  I'm trying to figure out if html5 helps me to make a case for which way to go (which I would then go and fix for OSX).  (It does appear that if mouseup is sent that it should be sent before the contextmenu or else some websites don't work properly.)


2008-12-08
[16:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: webkit is correct on both mac and windows

[16:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: on mac, context menus appear on mouse down, on windows they appear on mouse up.

[16:34:00.0000] <dave_levin>
Hixie: Thx.  That makes sense.

[16:35:00.0000] <dave_levin>
It also makes sense why mouseup occurs for FF on OSX after the contextmenu.

[16:35:01.0000] <dave_levin>
But a little weird with respect to consistency of events.

[16:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's one reason to have the contextmenu event, so that the authors don't have to worry about it

[16:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
though of course many unnecessarily will

[16:36:00.0000] <dave_levin>
I think Chrome had some bug on this on Windows where the mouseup occurred after the context menu and it caused some problem.

[16:36:01.0000] <dave_levin>
Anyway, that makes sense now.  Thx.

[16:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
np

[16:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
is anyone actually implementing contextmenu per spec yet?

[16:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
or does it just fire the event without actually doing anything other than showing the UA menu?

[16:43:00.0000] <dave_levin>
Hixie: Honestly, I wasn't trying to impl the context menu per spec.  I was simply trying to resolve this issue about mouseup.

[16:43:01.0000] <wilhelm>
Hixie: See CORE-16665 and CORE-16567.

[16:43:02.0000] <dave_levin>
So I was looking at the spec to see what it had to say about it.

[16:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[16:45:00.0000] <dave_levin>
Sorry, I don't understand the CORE-16665.  Is that a bug number?  Where is the bug db?  (I tried bugs.whatwg.org.)

[16:45:01.0000] <dave_levin>
Whoops, wrong conversation.  My mistake.

[16:45:02.0000] <dave_levin>
nevermind me.

[16:46:00.0000] <wilhelm>
dave_levin: Opera bugs on oncontextmenu. Our BTS is not open, unfortunately.

[16:47:00.0000] <dave_levin>
wilhelm: Thx for the explanation.

[20:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dglazkov: you around?

[20:54:00.0000] <dglazkov>
MikeSmith: partially

[20:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dglazkov: was just curious if you know if there's any up-to-date list online of who the members of the Google Chrome team

[20:56:00.0000] <dglazkov>
mmm... The only thing I can think of is TechCrunch's list, but I don't know if it's kept up to date

[20:58:00.0000] <dglazkov>
are you working on your Christmas cards? ;)

[20:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[20:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
no, just curious, as usual.. I'm a natural nosy busybody :)

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me chuckles at a roy's message to http-wg

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
finally something he and i agree on -- html4 says bogus things

[01:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
(though i don't think we should just ignore it if we disagree with it, even if html2 says more convenient things)

[02:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You are meeting me tonight at T19:00:00Z/PT5m

[02:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oddly, the wifi on the train has only just started working

[02:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It was always dodgy north of Edinburgh before, but this time it simply wasn't working at all.

[02:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I left a station this morning with semaphores!

[02:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
britain is living in the dark ages

[02:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: (per our discussion at TPAC :))

[02:20:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Now I've got to Edinburgh I've got electric signals hereon

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk42>
/me hopes Philip` has an atomic clock

[02:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk42: I did give him a time range of five minutes

[02:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: What if I'm 300.5 seconds from the designated time?

[02:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Then you are late

[02:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That makes it sound like my fault, but it may be that my clock is a second slow

[02:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I'm not entirely sure about what ISO 8601 says about precision

[02:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Giving a precise time plus a precise range around that time is not enough to avoid the problem that clocks are imprecise

[02:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I do, of course, have a copy of ISO 8601:2004 with me

[02:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Well, just have an atomic clock and you'll be fine

[02:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's the big grasshopper clock visible from King's, but apparently that's only accurate once every five minutes

[02:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But won't you be at the computer lab?

[02:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
At some point I will be

[02:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I will probably move

[02:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But when? :)

[02:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
and once I arrive, assuming we're meeting at the place I assume we're meeting at, and I find I am late, I can point to the clock as a demonstration that time is more interesting when you don't worry so much about precision

[02:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Corpus_clock_pol.jpg - it's a little bit peculiar)

[02:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: We are meeting by the post box outside King's

[02:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
i love that clock

[02:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
and especially the play on words

[02:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
where in Corpus is that?

[02:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
On a slightly different note, anyone got any protips for interviews?

[02:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's on the corner at http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&ll=52.203716,0.117607&spn=0.00021,0.00063&t=h&z=21 if I'm not mistaken

[02:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether the bandwidth here is enough for google maps

[02:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
on the corner of King's parade?

[02:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, OK

[02:34:03.0000] <gsnedders>
there

[02:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: giving or receiving?

[02:34:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: receiving, for Cambridge uni

[02:34:06.0000] <Hixie>
ah, uh, good luck

[02:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
my main advice would be to avoid that side of it!

[02:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Sadly, I'm all ready on the train on the way down for the two interviews :)

[02:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
well then my second piece of advice would be correct grammar :-P ("already")

[02:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
One tip I've heard is to not lie on your personal statement

[02:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
but it's probably too late for that now

[02:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
since if you are "all ready" then you don't need us :-P

[02:36:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has never quite learnt the distinction between all right and alright

[02:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I don't think it's really a play on words - the thing was called a grasshopper escapement because it looked a bit like a grasshopper, so the clock is just literalising the analogy

[02:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is going to have to go and have a look at it now

[02:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yeah, I probably ought to look at what the hell I put on my personal statement

[02:38:02.0000] <yecril71>
How would writing a special ID getter for tables help solve the problem of in-table identifier references?

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: still funny :-)

[02:42:00.0000] <yecril71>
I think the implementation should store a list of elements with a given ID internally.

[02:42:01.0000] <gpy>
hallo

[02:42:02.0000] <gpy>
whats up

[02:42:03.0000] <yecril71>
That would make some particularly insane pages slow, but in general it should not cause problems.

[02:42:04.0000] <gpy>
whats new

[02:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: A lot of the web is particularly insane :-)

[02:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I have been told that "There are a lot of general truths about the process you can helpful convey (e.g. that interviewers will try to see the best in candidates, not to confront them or to catch them out, that they are simply looking for constructive dialogue, etc.)" and also "you must not offer applicants any prohibited substances, alcoholic or otherwise"

[02:48:00.0000] <yecril71>
A lot of the Web is insane in an ordinary way.

[02:48:01.0000] <yecril71>
However, it cannot be particularly insane.

[02:48:02.0000] <yecril71>
"A lot" and "particularly" are mutually exclusive.

[02:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: Not necessarily - each of the many pages is insane in its own particular unique way

[02:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
But you cannot generalize this statement that way.

[02:51:00.0000] <yecril71>
"Particular" does not have such an easy plural because it is a comparative attribute.

[02:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: tip: even if you don't know the answer say what you are thinking / how you would tackle the problem

[02:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me returns from having wifi vanish

[02:53:02.0000] <annevk42>
g<space>problem

[02:53:03.0000] <yecril71>
I think, in the current wording, an OL must be inside a LI.

[02:54:00.0000] <annevk42>
yecril71, that's correct (and has been for ages)

[02:54:01.0000] <yecril71>
I fail to understand Aaron�s problem.

[02:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I think my main problem will be not seizing up with nervousness

[02:56:00.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: thanks for the response

[02:56:01.0000] <yecril71>
OL is flow content but it does not follow that it can *contain* any flow content.

[02:56:02.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: i guess i needed more coffee, it was pretty obvious in the end

[02:56:03.0000] <yecril71>
Take a good shot then :-)

[02:56:04.0000] <aaronlev>
hehe

[02:57:00.0000] <aaronlev>
"Before you hit Send, remember that Anne is reading this list"

[02:58:00.0000] <aaronlev>
Content model: flow content subset

[02:58:01.0000] <aaronlev>
but yeah, it's correct as it is

[03:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: When I tried doing that, I was thinking in completely the wrong direction and got horribly lost in irrelevant messy details :-p

[03:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I suppose that's still better than sitting there and saying "uh"

[03:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: You got in right :)

[03:02:00.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, np

[03:02:01.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: shouldn't contenteditable="true" make an element labelable?

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk42>
WYSIWYG editing seems pretty separate from form input to me

[03:04:01.0000] <annevk42>
at this point WYSIWYG editing is also mostly experimental, that is, most of the work still has to be implemented in script

[03:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Tip 2: If you have some vauge idea of what your interviewers are interested in and some knowledge about it, it doesn't hurt to try to get them talking about it

[03:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or, in general, try to sound interested)

[03:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Do you per-chance know Prof. Clarke?

[03:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
No

[03:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
(one way to sound interested is to ask them what thy work on)

[03:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me disclaims any bad outcomes from these tips

[03:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: On the other hand, that might just end up wasting interview time that would be much more usefully spent talking about the interviewee rather than about the interviewer

[03:10:01.0000] <annevk42>
/me doesn't have much experience with such interviews

[03:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
(From what I can tell, the interviewers do actually care that you're competent, and not just a nice person who they'd be happy to spend the next three years meeting twice a term, because they know that insufficiently competent people won't survive the course and it's detrimental to everybody)

[03:13:00.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: but it something is contenteditable then you might need to label it

[03:14:00.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: as far as the user is concerned it acts like a form control, and it often needs a label

[03:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Often they ask at some point if you have any questions. I'm not really suggesting going in and just asking them stuff

[03:14:02.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, really? I haven't really seen that happening in the wild, but maybe I'm missing something

[03:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
I assume they will go through whatever questions they have regardless

[03:15:01.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: i have

[03:15:02.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: for example, some vendors use a rich text field to create something like an email "To: " entry field

[03:15:03.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, we currently also do not have disabled, readonly, etc. for editable regions; as I said, it's mostly experimental

[03:15:04.0000] <aaronlev>
it will have autocomplete and use different colors or an underline to show correct/incorrect emaiol addresses

[03:16:00.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: but if it's experimental why support it?

[03:16:01.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, they should be using <input type=email multiple> there at some point :)

[03:16:02.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, to allow for innovation

[03:16:03.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: that's just one case of a general example you know that :P

[03:16:04.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, so we can see what people would do if rich text editing works

[03:16:05.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, and then we'd simplify the most common cases, such as email widgets :)

[03:16:06.0000] <aaronlev>
you can't have type="foo" for every kind of validating input someone might want

[03:17:00.0000] <annevk42>
indeed, that's why we ECMAScript and plenty of APIs

[03:17:01.0000] <aaronlev>
i don't see what you gain by not allowing contenteditable items to be disabled or have a label

[03:17:02.0000] <annevk42>
the gain is spec, QA, and implementor resources for other features

[03:17:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: She some theoretical astrophysicist. I have an interview with her tomorrow morning.

[03:17:04.0000] <annevk42>
that are more important

[03:18:00.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: and a loss to consistency from the user's poiint of view

[03:18:01.0000] <annevk42>
contenteditable mostly acts not like a typical form control at all though, so I'm not sure there's much consistency to start with

[03:19:00.0000] <aaronlev>
it acts like a form cotnrol in that you can focus it, enter data, and leave it

[03:19:01.0000] <aaronlev>
so i want to know what data i'm entering

[03:19:02.0000] <annevk42>
contenteditable is very much for editing existing data, not entering new data

[03:19:03.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: prove it :)

[03:20:00.0000] <aaronlev>
that's a shaky argument

[03:20:01.0000] <aaronlev>
i don't see any way you can back that up

[03:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me has written some code that uses <span contenteditable> as an automatically-resizing borderless <input>

[03:20:03.0000] <aaronlev>
when i compose a new email or doc i'm entering new data

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, true

[03:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Oh, Cathy Clarke

[03:21:02.0000] <jgraham>
She's really nice

[03:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: yeah, her

[03:21:04.0000] <jgraham>
Don't worry about what she works on

[03:21:05.0000] <jgraham>
obviously ;)

[03:21:06.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Challenge her to refute the Time Cube

[03:22:00.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, any case, it seems to soon to assume it will be used just like form controls

[03:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Why? Something ridiculously complex? :)

[03:22:02.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, been just a year or so that all browsers actually support it

[03:23:00.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: also, the email validation thing -- how does it know which emails are in the user's contact list?

[03:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Aren't you applying for 50% comp-sci? I suppose there is no harm in asking about it

[03:24:00.0000] <aaronlev>
let's say it's trying to restrict

[03:24:01.0000] <aaronlev>
i dunno, i guess i'll wait to come up with good examples to show you what i mean

[03:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
She works on planet formation

[03:24:03.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, <input type=email multiple list=contacts><datalist id=contacts><option>annevk⊙oc<option>...</datalist>

[03:24:04.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: ^

[03:24:05.0000] <hendry>
/me wonders how authors should embed ads in the future. sandboxed iframes?

[03:24:06.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: yikes

[03:24:07.0000] <aaronlev>
client side?

[03:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: 50% comp.sci., 25% maths and nat.sci. each — with a possible intention of switching to physical nat.sci.

[03:25:01.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, you can populate the markup through script, of course

[03:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: ah, interesting

[03:25:03.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: ok, i'll send better examples when i get them

[03:25:04.0000] <aaronlev>
that seems like a good challenge

[03:25:05.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, we had a feature <datalist data=foobar.xml></datalist> but that's been out for now

[03:25:06.0000] <annevk42>
s/been //

[03:25:07.0000] <annevk42>
(Opera still has it, though)

[03:26:00.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, I don't how it's more than a challange than implementing a complete email widget, that's much harder :)

[03:26:01.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, just do a simple fetch with XHR to some data on the server, and then insert a bunch of <option> elements, rather trivial I'd say

[03:26:02.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: email is just 1 example where you might need a label

[03:26:03.0000] <annevk42>
sure

[03:26:04.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk42: so i plan to send more cases to show there's no point in trying to stretch the spec over every use case

[03:27:00.0000] <aaronlev>
just let people insert a label, that's far easier than trying to cover everything an author wants to do

[03:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: If you say that you might switch to Physics I guess it helps to sound interested in that too :)

[03:27:02.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, we won't try to do that either

[03:27:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I already have :)

[03:27:04.0000] <annevk42>
aaronlev, people can create custom labels with their custom controls; using ARIA to associate them together

[03:28:00.0000] <aaronlev>
yes

[03:28:01.0000] <aaronlev>
but I thought the idea was that the main uses of ARIA ultimately are superceded by HTML

[03:28:02.0000] <aaronlev>
so we take what we learn from it and improve HTML

[03:31:00.0000] <aaronlev>
ok, we will see what happens

[03:40:00.0000] <annevk42>
i'm sort of guessing we'll always need something like ARIA to fill certain gaps

[03:40:01.0000] <annevk42>
it would be nice if it looked different, but we're probably past that now

[03:40:02.0000] <annevk42>
s/sort of//

[03:43:00.0000] <annevk42>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2008Dec/0019.html should I have filed a bug report somewhere or is there one already?

[03:43:01.0000] <annevk42>
/me thought about that too late

[03:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Tip 3: Try to relax and have fun. They are going to ask you some interesting questions so try to enjoy thinking about them. The absolute worst that can happen is that you end up going to Edinburgh which is really not such a bad thing

[03:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: But I've already left Edinburgh!

[03:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
The interviews are not perfect; there were plenty of bright people doing a PhD with me who got rejected as undergrads and some not-so-bright people who got in and I supervised :)

s/rejected/rejected from Cambridge/

[03:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't quite sure how interviews can actually be fun

[03:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: There is little prize for guessing what, at least in part, I'll be asking you about tonight :)

[03:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Tip 4: Try to estimnate how many piano tuners there are in Chicago. It is not impossible you will be asked some similar type of order-of-magnitude question so it helps to have thought through one before

[03:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
For the same amount of effort as attending interviews, you could stay at home and play computer games

[03:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Population of chicago is about 3 million

[03:49:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Do you have any interviews today, or are they all tomorrow?

[03:49:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: maybe around 100?

[03:49:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: all tomorrow

[03:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: 0 marks - needs to show working :-p

[03:50:01.0000] <annevk42>
/me tries upgarding to Ubuntu 8.10

[03:50:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: IIRC it is rather smaller than that but as Philip` says the point is how you got there not what your answer is

[03:50:03.0000] <annevk42>
someone else with a thinkpad had it working, hopefully I'm good

[03:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me finds an estimate that gets 150

[03:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: IRC isn't in some ways the best medium for thinking allowed

[03:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: *aloud

[03:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: You end up being a bit of a flooder :)

[03:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You could write multiple sentences on a single line, and then it wouldn't take more than a line to explain your thinking :-)

[03:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Sure. Just as long as you /had/ a logical method

[03:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Also only in Britain: I'm on a train for around 500 miles, running on diesel trains the entire way, under wires for around 450 miles :)

[03:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Meh.

[03:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, after 3 hours on this train we've finally had it announced that there is no trolley service

[03:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
aaronlev: Allowing @headers to point at the headers in a nested table seems bad

[03:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
aaronlev: Have you tried inverting the header association algorithm and found it to be difficult or are you just worried about the theoretical difficulty?

[03:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is rather sleepy

[04:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it bad being on Facebook on a train>

[04:28:00.0000] <aaronlev>
jgraham: i think every browser dev will invert it differently

[04:28:01.0000] <aaronlev>
it's not really useful in the current form, so i suggest changing it so it is

[04:28:02.0000] <aaronlev>
then we can see if that is correct

[04:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: did you see that the latest Mr. Last Week has some videos of you singing "The American Ruse" and "Looking at You"?

[04:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: Me singing it?

[04:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, man, you

[04:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least it looks like you

[04:52:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me puts in earphones and wonders if it will work

[04:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, nowhere near enough bandwidth

[04:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is listening to Decomposing Composers by Monty Python from Monty Python Sings

[04:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me yawns and puts on Christian metal

[04:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it bad this 10-or-so year old girl reminds me of a certain girl at school every time she walks past?

[04:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
That depends on whether you are imagining doing something illegal to the girl

[05:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, only something legal to the one she reminds me of

[05:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(And nothing that would be illegal to do to her)

[05:02:00.0000] <annevk42>
yay, done

[05:02:01.0000] <annevk42>
no network manager in the taskbar though

[05:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes some of the things he says would be rather odd to see as the first line

[05:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what the people in college are going to be like

[05:13:00.0000] <annevk42>
is lastweekinhtml5 ridiculing standardssuck.org? fun

[05:13:01.0000] <annevk42>
more viewers!

[05:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
damnit! I should have ridiculed standardssuck.org on standardssuck.org!

Philip`: remember! :P

/me runs off

[05:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Please nobody say anything for the next five hours, so that reminder doesn't scroll off the screen

[06:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders what Philip` needs to remember?

[06:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I'm not quite sure

[06:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I think I'm probably meant to be meeting gsnedders or something

[06:38:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: hey, are you around?

[06:40:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: I'm trying to figure out what the most recent proposal is for contextual qSA - ":context ~ div"?

[06:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, hi

[06:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
sibling selectors won't work with :context (or :scope) with the current methods, since only descendant nodes can be matched

[06:42:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: so currently there is no proposal in which it'll work?

[06:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's something that will probably need to be addressed in the next version

[06:42:02.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: ok - we're discussing it again because the JS libraries are standardizing on a unified selector engine

[06:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
IIRC, this was discussed on the mailing list once before. I think the solution will have to be something like document.someNewSelectorMethod(":context~div", contextNode);

[06:43:01.0000] <annevk42>
might have been interesting to allow it in such a way if :scope had been there from the start

[06:43:02.0000] <annevk42>
Lachy, why not have the method on contextNode?

[06:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, that may work

[06:44:01.0000] <annevk42>
seems more DOM-like

[06:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, it might make things complicated though, because if div.foo(":context+div") matches elements outside of the context node, then does div.foo("div") do so as well?

[06:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
i.e. is the scope of elements limited for the method in any way?

[06:49:01.0000] <annevk42>
nope

[06:50:00.0000] <annevk42>
though i'm not sure if it's worth it given that the only use case is :context ~ and :context +

[06:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, consider <body><div><p/></div><p/></body> What do each of these match? div.foo("p"); div.foo(":context+p"); div.foo("body");?

[06:51:00.0000] <annevk42>
p1,p2;p2;body

[06:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
that seems a little unintuitive

[06:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, at least, it's the complete opposite of how the existing methods work

[06:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
if we used the approach I suggested, then it's possible we could just extend the existing methods with an additional parameter, like document.querySelector(":context+div", contextNode);

[06:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
(though we'd need to consider compat issues before doing that)

[06:55:00.0000] <annevk42>
i suppose, anyway, are there compelling use cases?

[06:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, do you know if any JS libraries implement functionality similar to the requested Element.matchesSelector() proposal?

[06:57:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: yes

[06:57:01.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: many, if not all of them

[06:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
annevk42, I can't remember if already had use cases presented for it, or whether we needed to investigate them

[06:58:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: it's going to be in the new unified library we're working on

[06:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
really? I checked the JQuery docs and couldn't find any method that seemed to that. Which method is it?

[06:59:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: $(element).is("selector")

[06:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
where is that in the JQuery docs?

[07:00:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/is#expr

[07:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
thanks

[07:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, are your discussions with the other JS library devs public, or is there some documentation of what's going into the unified engine?

[07:08:01.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: the engine: http://github.com/jeresig/sizzle the discussion: http://groups.google.com/group/sizzlejs

[07:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
thanks

[09:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: You may have had to remember something but its hard to be sure

[09:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Hmm, I don't recall anything important

[12:13:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Ok, I think I understand the reasoning behind unicode decomposition

[12:14:00.0000] <virtuelv>
but that stuff is giving me a severe headache

[12:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
on macos, or in general?

man comig up with good-sounding formal terminology is hard

[20:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
coming even

[20:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
at least, it's hard when you're defining the fifth or sixth term that means basically the same thing as the others

[20:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
i need a term for a conceptual group that is going to contain all the scripts run in the context of a document between calls to document.open()

[20:13:00.0000] <kfish>
oh, you mean a document.open() 'twixt run-group?

[20:14:00.0000] <kfish>
/me confuses "formal" with "archaic"

[20:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
+1 to kfish's 'twixt suggestion

[20:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
we need more quaint archaisms in specs

[20:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me is reminded of Frank Zappa's "Does Humor Belong in Music?"..

[20:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Does Humor Belong in Standards?

[20:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
answer: Yes

[22:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: oh there's plenty of humour in html5 already

[22:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I know -- in the examples in particular. moreso certainly in the environment surrounding the spec..

[22:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[23:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, someone just set himself up for a beating from the img-alt people

[23:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
in www-html

[03:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, yt?

[03:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
or weinig?

[04:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/specs/XForms1.2/XFormsForHTML/index-all.html

[04:53:01.0000] <annevk5>
not published yet but will be published later or some such

[05:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: I think it may just be the existing XForms Transitional doc under a new name

[05:06:01.0000] <annevk5>
no

[05:06:02.0000] <annevk5>
it uses xmlns="" and xmlns:my="" and such

[05:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[06:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me expects the forums to be spammed during christmas

[09:29:00.0000] <blooberry>
mikesmith: yt?

[09:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
blooberry: here now

[09:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
blooberry: I think the dev.opera MAMA table report actually has what I wanted

[09:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I realize, after looking at it more

[09:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I had been wanting to know if what the frequency was for the td/th axis attribute

[09:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip` also helped me out on #html-wg with some data from his corpus, and URLs

[09:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees that his IE8 browser-freezing bug is now marked as "Won't Fix"

[10:04:00.0000] <blooberry>
mikesmith: cool. 

[10:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me needs to read the MAMA CSS report when he can make time 

[10:05:01.0000] <blooberry>
mikesmith: there's also the huge bare attribute list that is a lot harder to wade through

[10:05:02.0000] <blooberry>
the CSS aspect was not as full as I wanted it to be. I'm going to do pull out a lot more info in the next crawl

[10:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wish I knew how to use LVM, so I could give myself more disk space to store all this HTML analysis stuff

[10:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to look again for the complete attributes list

[10:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: you need some "cloud computing"

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: The problem is that that needs "money"

[10:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[10:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey, funny thing about the term "cloud computing" is that in kataka-ized Japanese, it and "crowd computing" sound exactly the same

[10:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I've had conversations here where the ambiguity of just what it's supposed to mean has made the discussion more interesting

[10:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Anyway, I've got half a terabyte of disk available, so I don't need a cloud at all

[10:12:02.0000] <blooberry>
philip`: I need to work on the data storage aspect of MAMA

[10:12:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: no, you need the Cloud. Everybody needs the Cloud. The Cloud will save Us.

[10:12:04.0000] <Philip`>
I just need to work out how to expand my 32GB partition without accidentally destroying all my data

[10:12:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
the "wisdom of the cloud"

[10:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
blooberry: I'm using the approach of just saving every file I downloaded, and then running the analysis script lots of times to extract different data into giant XML files, and it works well enough for me :-)

[10:17:00.0000] <blooberry>
philip`: Do you store any of it in a database? Or just cache the page content locally?

[10:18:00.0000] <blooberry>
(I'd guess caching the page content)

[10:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
blooberry: For each page, I store a file {first two chars of hex MD5 of URI}/{hex MD5 of URI} containing the HTTP headers and the body bytes (using Java Serializable)

[10:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
and the list of URIs is a text file

[10:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
and that's about it

[10:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
(That's a really inefficient way to store stuff, because it involves a huge amount of disk seeking and reading in order to process pages)

[10:27:00.0000] <blooberry>
but disk space and personal computing cycles are "free" compared to "line expense" of getting the content over the Internet.

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
(so I intended to write a new system that collects some number of pages into a single file, so it could read and process them all at once, and store them compressed)

[10:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but then I got bored and stopped working on it)

[10:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
blooberry: I'm not sure that's necessarily true - I think bandwidth usually costs somewhere roughly around $0.10 to $1 per GB, which is about the same as the cost of disk space

[10:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
The real limit is human (im)patience, which is why I care about the time taken to read all the data from disk and to process it :-)

[15:05:00.0000] <Lachy__>
hey, can anyone recommend a nice, reasonably priced hotel for me to stay in London?

[17:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
the more i try to fix this scripting thing the more involved the edit becomes

[17:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
this is becoming quite the diff

[17:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't even remember what the original problem was that i was fixing

[17:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's like someone saying "i'd like you to fix the off-white colour on the wall here" and finding that the off-white is caused by rot which is caused by a slow leak which is caused by faulty insulation in the attic and that the slow leak has also weaked the foundations and that you have to basically pull the whole house down and rebuild it

[17:22:00.0000] <neatnik>
Hixie: and then you discover that the house was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, and the land is tainted with thousands of restless spirits

[17:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: not looking forward to reading that diff

[17:24:00.0000] <kfish>
neatnik, hence the off-white colour on the walls

[17:25:00.0000] <neatnik>
Interestingly, you never hear about computers being haunted

[17:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
neatnik: oh we already know about the burial ground

[17:25:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: at least now that you're using Geoffrey's spec-gen thing, the IDs won't get cascade-changed throughout the whole spec

[17:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
neatnik: this is html, after all

[17:25:04.0000] <neatnik>
Hixie: lol

[17:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: yeah really

[17:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
If we awaken the spirits, maybe they'll bring some peyote with them.

[17:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that would be an upside

[17:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
dude i need my mind totally clear to write this stuff

[17:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think shooting up would help the spec :-P

[17:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
peyote will clear your mind, as well as your stomach. it will bring ideas straight from your belly and back up through your nostrils

[17:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
good medicine must always have some kind of adverse side effects

[17:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I digress

[17:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
..as usual

[17:30:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to drink some tea

[17:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: btw, I was doing a bit with dfn.js yesterday

[17:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's a sweet little piece of work

[17:35:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
every spec should use that

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[17:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
my biggest problem with it is it doesn't support "open in new tab"

[17:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
what were you doing with it?

[17:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: adding it to my document-conformance draft

[17:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah cool

[17:45:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
works particularly nicely for back-refs for the datatypes stuff

[17:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, I've never been explicitly told we can't use any scripts in W3C TR docs 

[17:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I'm not going to ask for permission..

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
let's hope the script doesn't introduce the risk of an xss

[17:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
..so I think it would be good have have dfn.js added, e.g., to some webapps specs

[17:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i'm shocked that it's possible (modulo your proposal) to parse html without depending on the dom

[17:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: are you really sure you can't cause the parser to trigger mutations that make no sense?

[17:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is there a reason why foster-parented stuff isn't dropped on the floor if the parent of the table is gone?

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
not really

[17:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: pretty sure that that's the only show-stopper problem

[17:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me is not 100% convinced, but will have to look closer at some point

[17:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
when writing AAA in particular i found crashes in safari that were due to hyatt not thinking of certain changes you could make to the dom from script

[17:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: we could make things slightly simpler if foster-parented stuff was dropped if the parent is gone

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
(so i wouldn't be surprised if such a radical change as you propose reintroduced such errors)

[17:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: send mail

[17:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't really care either way

[17:54:00.0000] <heycam>
MikeSmith, is dfn.js what makes the <dfn>s clickable in the html5 spec?

[17:54:01.0000] <heycam>
if so, then i want it :)

[17:54:02.0000] <heycam>
/me already borrowed dl.switch from the whatwg style sheet

[17:54:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
heycam: yeah

[17:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heycam: I recommend going ahead and adding it to the WebIDL spec

[17:56:01.0000] <heycam>
there aren't any copyright licensing terms in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/dfn.js

[17:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: what license do you want it under?

[17:57:01.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, anything sufficiently liberal for me to use it

[17:57:02.0000] <heycam>
i don't mind if attribution is required

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
public domain ok?

[17:58:01.0000] <heycam>
sure

[17:58:02.0000] <heycam>
that's easiest

[17:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
i hereby grant http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/dfn.js into the public domain

[17:58:04.0000] <heycam>
(though i know some people think public domain is a bad idea)

[17:58:05.0000] <heycam>
/me wonders whether that is sufficient

[17:58:06.0000] <heycam>
could you add it as comment at the top of dfn.js?

[17:58:07.0000] <Hixie>
well if you want something more, let me know

[17:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
done

[17:59:01.0000] <heycam>
thanks

[17:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
(neither me nor google will ever sue you over copying that file)

[18:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have to say, the people who are fighting so hard for their copyrights have really made my life noticeably more annoying

[18:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
because everyone is always asking me for copyright statements and so forth

[18:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wish copyright didn't eixst

[18:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
exist

[18:00:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: were there compat issues with making CDATA sections act like CDATA sections in HTML?

[18:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
my life would be far better

[18:00:06.0000] <heycam>
in australia at least explicit copyright statements don't need to be made

[18:00:07.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yes, pretty sure

[18:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i mean statements saying that copying is ok

[18:01:01.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, ah

[18:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: having to check the tree builder state is a problem for tokenizing ahead of tree building

[18:01:03.0000] <hsivonen>
as in saving the tokens of speculative script, style and img parse

[18:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: isn't that a problem for things like <script> anyway? or can you move those parts into the tokeniser effectively

[18:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: document.write is an obvious problem that cannot go away

[18:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
CDATA maybe could still made into a non-problem

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
well if you have proposals, send mail. but i highly doubt we can support "<![CDATA[" as an escaping string in regular text/html

[18:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: moving bailing out of foreign content into the tokenizer doesn't work

[18:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok

[18:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's probably dangerous enough in svg/mathml as it is

[18:03:04.0000] <Hixie>
i could be convinced to remove it altogether, but you'd have to get that past the svgwg, which will be interesting

[18:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what the status is wrt svgwg and svg-in-text/html

[18:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
is the ball in our court?

[18:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
they never replied to my e-mail

[18:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
but we had that meeting in mandelieu

[18:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
which went nowhere

[18:04:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: they didn't respond to my review either

[18:04:06.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, we recently just started discussing it again

[18:04:07.0000] <heycam>
(see public-svg-wg)

[18:04:08.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[18:04:09.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[18:04:10.0000] <heycam>
i expect we'll discuss at at the thursday telcon

[18:04:11.0000] <heycam>
*it at

[18:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[18:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have to say, for all the problems that it introduces, the whatwg model definitely does make things faster

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
svg-in-text/html was resolved in about a month once i started working on it, from start to finish (notwithstanding the svgwg's feedback, of course)

[18:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
including responding to all feedback

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
(all of which is ironic given our timetable vs the w3c's timetables, heh)

[18:11:00.0000] <kfish>
Hixie, I was wondering, what tools do you use to summarize discussions in email? or do you just cut and copy?

[18:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
pine

[18:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
it has a multi-message reply facility

[18:11:03.0000] <heycam>
do you use an external editor?  or the builtin one?

[18:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i use pine's editor generally, but if i need to do anything special i escape out to emacs

[18:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
i often fix up formatting in dozens of e-mails at once using emacs

[18:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
then do the actual replying in pine

[18:12:03.0000] <heycam>
i suppose at least the pine editor's key bindings are similar to emacs

[18:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
pine has a slightly better mail reflowing mechanism

[18:12:05.0000] <heycam>
but apart from that, /me shudders :)

[18:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[18:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd use emacs if i could work out how to configure it to reflow blocks of indented mail sanely

[18:13:02.0000] <kfish>
cool, thanks

[18:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
but my current configuration isn't good at distinguishing where the indent level changes

[18:13:04.0000] <heycam>
M-x reflow-mails-as-hixie-likes-them

[18:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
and ends up screwing everything up into one paragraph

[18:13:06.0000] <Hixie>
which is suboptimal

[18:14:00.0000] <heycam>
my workflow is to use mutt with vim as the editor, and i highlight the stuff to reflow and do :!par

[18:14:01.0000] <heycam>
i just haven't figured out how to make par put two spaces between sentences instead of one

[18:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
ctrl-j in pine just figures out what the current paragraph is, reflows it, and moves the cursor to below the paragraph

[18:15:00.0000] <heycam>
that seems nice

[18:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
so i can reflow an entire mail paragraph-by-paragraph just by hitting ctrl-j..j..j..j..j..j..j...

[18:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is awesome

[18:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
it screws up with mail from emacs gnu mail users (they indent using " >" instead of "> " which pine doesn't know what to do with)

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
and it screws up with mail from gmail (pine can't parse the html from gmail and ends up not indenting anything)

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
so for those two cases i jump to emacs, do a quick regexp search-replace, and go back

[18:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
all under screen(1) over ssh

[18:17:00.0000] <heycam>
i should use screen i suppose

[18:17:01.0000] <heycam>
i don't find it too annoying to quit mutt and restart it later though

[18:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
(my mail client configuration has basically not changed since 1996, except for adding screen about 6 years ago)

[18:18:00.0000] <heycam>
heh

[18:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
well the great thing with screen is that i can be half-way through an e-mail and i can just close my laptop, move elsewhere, reopen it, and the cursor will still be at the same point in the e-mail

[18:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is awesome

[18:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
if a cat sits on my keyboard, i can just pull out another laptop and continue and it's like nothing happened, without having to move the cat

[18:18:04.0000] <heycam>
lol

[18:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
(i did that once and the cat was like, wtf)

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
("you're supposed to pet me. nobody else has been able to ignore me when i sit on the keyboard. who are you, freak?")

[18:37:00.0000] <heycam>
nice, http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/ with clickable <dfn>s now

[18:38:00.0000] <heycam>
i like how google thinks that www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/ is written by a mr (or mrs) "C Changes" -- http://www.google.com/search?q=web+idl

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes, you should be receiving a letter any day now announcing that we've filed to have your name changed

[18:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
sorry for the delay, but we have to do it by postal mail for legal reasons so it takes a while

[18:40:02.0000] <heycam>
such is google's influence on the world

[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it's just that your parents made a mistake, we're just correcting it now

[18:41:01.0000] <heycam>
:)

[18:42:00.0000] <heycam>
google actually has crawled the web and generated an immense genealogy tree and determined that my great^5-grandfather was illegitimate and was given the wrong name

[18:43:00.0000] <heycam>
/me marvels at what computers can do these days!

[18:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[18:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looking at e.g. http://www.google.com/search?q=site:www.ietf.org+rfc it seems to be wrong about as often as it's right

[18:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
that it gets any right at all is pretty amazing

[18:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how it works

[18:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i could look

[18:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems kind of silly to display that information at all, when there's so little confidence that it's right

[18:46:01.0000] <heycam>
i wonder whether it looks at <address>

[18:46:02.0000] <heycam>
(if one exists)

[18:46:03.0000] <Philip`>
I've seen Google sometimes say how many replies there were to forum posts in its results, which is a much more useful thing since it seems to get it right and lets you ignore unanswered queries

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
well well well

[18:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
designMode = 'on' doesn't stop other frames from calling your scripts

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
woah

[18:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
designMode = 'on' doesn't stop ANY scripts!

[18:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
where did i get the idea that it did from?

[19:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me thanks heycam for tip about par(1)

[21:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: opera supports <![CDATA[ in text/html, and we haven't got many bugs about it

[22:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
CDATA sections in text/html would be great to have

[22:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
would make life easier for author/developers who want to include HTML/markup examples in their docs

[22:01:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., spec editors

[22:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: you could use <xmp>

[22:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: <xmp> supported across browsers? IE?

[22:07:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[22:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I remember hearing that now, but don't remember why it's not part of HTML5, then

[22:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>

oh right, Philip` started with an html reference document

[22:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: perhaps you can steal some stuff from it

[22:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: what're your own current thoughts on making <xmp> conforming? good idea? bad idea?

[22:22:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: URL for Philip` s reference doc?

[22:22:03.0000] <zcorpan>
http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/ref/ref.html

[22:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: i don't mind it being conforming but i don't feel strongly about it

[22:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[22:23:02.0000] <zcorpan>
it's pretty useless in xhtml though

[22:23:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[22:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: btw, splitting up input into multiple sections is still a high priority for me for the document-conformance draft.. I got sidetracked a bit messing around with the Datatypes section. among other things, borrowed Hixie's dfn.js and put it to use for backrefs for the datatypes

[22:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g, http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/#common.data.integer

[22:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: ok

[22:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: the entity table should omit entities without trailing ;

[22:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: added to my TODO list -- which is, so far, all stuff from you

[22:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/TODO

[22:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me needs to add a few more things to that...

[22:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: put it on the todo list that you have to add a few more things to it

[22:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[23:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
trying to recall what the rationale is for allowing years with more than 4 digits

[23:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, to avoid the imminent Y10k bug

[23:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[23:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
we could easily restrict it to 4 digit years now and then, if HTML is still around in 8000 years, let the future generations solve the problem by permitting 5 digit years

[23:55:00.0000] <roc>
I fear what HTML will have grown into in 8000 years

[23:55:01.0000] <jwalden>
but what if I want to talk about dates in the future in H. G. Wells's "The Time Machine"?

[23:55:02.0000] <jwalden>
(I kid, mostly)

[23:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
jwalden, you don't need the time element for that

[23:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, also wondering what the rationale is for allowing month to be 00-12, instead of just 01-12

[23:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's got to be a mistake

[23:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: I'd hope so, but I don't think it is

[23:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#months

[23:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
"Two digits, representing the month month, in the range 0 ≤ month ≤ 12"

[23:58:03.0000] <Lachy>
looks like a mistake to me

[23:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
it also says in the parsing rules "If month is not a number in the range 1 ≤ month ≤ 12, then fail."

[23:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[23:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[23:59:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[23:59:04.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, ^

[23:59:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
definitely must be a mistake, then

[00:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me breathes a sign of relief.. then takes a bong rip

[00:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
somehow the effects of the bong rip are significantly more calming than a simple sign of relief

[00:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, same error the the day in "Two digits, representing day, in the range 0 ≤ day ≤ maxday where maxday is the number of days in the month month and year year"

[00:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: send mail or file a bug (or hope i remember) :-)

[00:47:00.0000] <Lachy>

Philip`: Interesting

[01:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
maybe we should tell him html5lib is not as fast

[01:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe we should encourage takkaria to produce python bindings for hubbub and call it chtml5lib :)

[01:43:01.0000] <annevk5>
seems like a copy from some other site though

[01:48:00.0000] <roc>
I can't bear it

[02:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me cringes at the "upgrading" article.

[02:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
/me is reminded of things he used to say about 3 years ago. :(

[03:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
heyhey

[03:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hey G

[03:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
how's you?

[03:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh I'm alright

[03:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
been catching up on the logs

[03:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I think ref.html would look a bit cleaner without the grey border-bottom.

[03:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is on train going back home

[03:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me left his jacket on the train from Cambridge to Peterborough and thus is cold

[03:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, using <strong> to highlight the relevant part of samples is good. It seems correct for <html> and <base> but incorrect for both <title> examples.

[03:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: i don't think Philip`is maintaining ref.html :)

[03:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Do you know off-hand how Document.gEBID should work on XML multi-namespace documents?

[03:25:01.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: same as in html documents

[03:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Only match @id on an element in the HTML namespace, or @id on an element in any namespace?

[03:26:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, oh right. I thought it was the early days of a side project/demo type thing.

[03:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: web dom core just talks about "ID"

[03:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: A lot of Philip`'s things are early demos but with little intention of being maintained :)

[03:27:02.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: what "ID" means depends on if you support xml:id, xhtml5, svg, etc

[03:27:03.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Ergh. Yay. :\

[03:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(until someone sane comes along and defines XML ID 5)

wow!

[03:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if it'd be quicker to use the web on his phone

[03:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, what improvements would a hypothetical XML ID 5 spec include?

[03:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The wifi was quick for a minute (like 75KB/s quick), but now back to < 10

[03:48:00.0000] <annevk5>
zcorpan, it sort of makes sense if you define DOM ID and then have the respective specs define how they map to that

[03:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: it would make 'id' an ID attribute on any element and drop DTD ID and xml:id

[03:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk5: ok

[04:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: build for my draft doc now strips out semicolon-less entity names from the giganto table -

[04:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/#named

[04:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: nice

[04:38:00.0000] <annevk5>
might be nice to have a link there to skip over the table given it's so huge

[04:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: OK, added

[04:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it says Skip past table to next section (References)

[04:59:00.0000] <annevk5>
i should probably not have gotten involved in that link relationship debacle

[04:59:01.0000] <annevk5>
I don't at all see evidence for all the complexity they are adding

[05:00:00.0000] <annevk5>
evidence that justifies the complexity*

[05:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: extensibility? ...

[05:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that oftens seems to be the rationale for complexity

[05:03:02.0000] <zcorpan>
html5 link rels can be extended through the wiki

[05:04:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, where is evidence that we need URIs for extensibility?

[05:04:01.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, it's not like there are millions of relationships going around currently

[05:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: true

[05:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm not defending the rationale.. just speculating for what it might be

[05:05:02.0000] <annevk5>
they are just making a silly feature we should probably remove (Link HTTP header) even more complex and making HTML and Atom more complex in the process

[05:05:03.0000] <annevk5>
i mean, wtf

[05:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, link looks nice btw

[05:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Yeah, that grey border looks pretty weird

[05:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: For <title>, I think the point was to highlight the "contrast[...] with the top-level headers", hence highlighting the headers as well as the titles

[05:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Those examples came from the spec, I think)

[05:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Then I got bored and nobody seemed to care a lot, so I gave up with it :-)

[05:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, just for kicks: in the named-character-references table, I made all the names link to themselves

[05:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/#charref-clubsuit

[05:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
not sure how useful it is

[06:24:00.0000] <annevk5>
http://q42.nl/q42-lego-logo anyone up for doing the WHATWG logo in lego?

[06:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk5: It's circular, and circles are hard in Lego :-(

[06:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also it's green and white, which are fairly rare colours in Lego

[06:33:00.0000] <annevk5>
I guess you don't read Dutch :)

[06:34:00.0000] <annevk5>
The idea is that you design it on your computer (Sjoerd wrote some software to calculate which bricks were needed for the rounding) using some software from lego.com and then you can order the result

[06:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6296

[06:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
I emailed the online Lego store some years ago, asking for enough bricks to build a replica of the Earth

[06:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Their web-based ordering form was limited to 9,999 units, which was far too many orders of magnitude below what I needed)

[06:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/replica/life-sized replica/

[06:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
They were very nice and wrote back to me, though I can't quite remember what they said

[06:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[06:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, in the spirit of taking things to their logical extreme, I have a named-character table now with a 3rd column that shows the glyphs (or replacment char if you font doesn't have the glyph for whatever code point)

[06:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/04/toy_taliban/

[06:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/#charref-expectation

[06:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's a great name

[06:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
euitable for use in Emotion ML

[06:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
Surely that should be http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/#charref-ℰ

[06:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmph, my IRC font doesn't like that character

[06:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, for the authoring guide, I intend to use images of the glyphs instead of relying on people's fonts

[06:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: yeah, that'll be better

[06:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
although the current chart I have for that doesn't use images yet

[06:50:03.0000] <Lachy>
I need to find a set of images with an appropriate copyright licence that I can use

[06:51:00.0000] <annevk5>
better to encourage people to fix issues than include workarounds, imo :)

[06:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk5, there are other technical reasons to use images, even if people have the appropriate fonts

[06:51:02.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: s/Glyph/Character/ ?

[06:51:03.0000] <Lachy>
like ensuring that each glyph fits into the design properly, and doesn't overlap

[06:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: zvon.org has some licenseable images

[06:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
mabye

[06:52:02.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wouldn't want 2000 images to be loaded

[06:52:03.0000] <zcorpan>
how about using a web font that includes all the glyphs?

[06:52:04.0000] <Lachy>
annevk5, e.g. see fflig in http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref

[06:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, that might work

[06:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think those character refs should just be published as a separate doc

[06:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
Why would anyone want to use a character reference when their own computer can't display the character?

[06:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems better for authors to be discouraged from using such characters at all

[06:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I guess some people find them easier to input, or for use with non-Unicode encodings

[06:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, for most cases, I agree, but there are some legitimate cases where' they're useful, such as for non-breaking spaces

[06:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't think it's helpful at all to encourage authors to use named character references

[06:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but we are kind of stuck with them now

[06:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks to the MathML folks

[06:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I was meaning the characters themselves, not just the references to them

[06:57:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
giving names to every character under the sun

[06:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
(In particular, the characters which would cause problems when displayed in a character reference table because the author doesn't have glyphs for them)

[06:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, there are some specialised use cases where such characters are useful for people, but for which your average user may not have all the characters available.

[06:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. a lot of those math related characters aren't available in default installs, but mathematicians could easily install them if needed

[07:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: so what do you think about publish that table as a standalone separate doc? 

[07:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, I was intending to just make it a separate page within the authoring guide

[07:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or better yet, asking the MathML group to do it so other can just reference it

[07:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, actually, when it's finished, I'm hoping it will be more like an app that let's people search interactively

[07:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: what you mention above makes me think even more strongly that most users don't need that info

[07:12:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
mostly it's a just for math

[07:12:03.0000] <Lachy>
why? There are other sections that will get their own pages too

[07:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe hide the mathml entities behind a checkbox

[07:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: that list frankly doesn't seem to me like something worth putting a whole lot of time into.. e.g., not worth making in a searchable app thing

[07:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, there will be various filters that let people show and hide characters based on all sorts of categories

[07:13:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
we already got the searchable thing at zvon.org

[07:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://zvon.org/other/charSearch/PHP/search.php

[07:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
not sure what the benefit in reinventing that wheel would be

[07:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
It seems much more useful to have a general-purpose Unicode character searching tool, which might happen to tell you the HTML entity or maybe some other tool does a simple number->name lookup, rather than making a clever specialised tool just for HTML entities

[07:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://zvon.org/other/charSearch/PHP/search.php?request=8496&searchType=2

[07:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: what you describe seems like just what the zvon tool does already

[07:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, the more I think about it, the more it seems to me that properly the MathML WG should be the ones to produce a normative list of those things

[07:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean, the only reason we need most of those is because of the requirement to allow MathML in text/html, right?

[07:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
right

[07:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but it makes sense for the authoring guide to at least provide some information about them

[07:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: yeah, but the authoring guide could just reference whatever document the MathML WG produced

[07:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, the MathML specs are notoriously hard to find information about the charcter references in

[07:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: i guess they could solve that problem by publishing a standalone doc with the list themselves

[07:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe nobody's suggested yet that they do it

[07:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
but if they do produce a user friendly document, then I could. But until that happens, I see no reason to drop it from the guide

[07:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, I'll shut up about it.. in the mean time, I guess I'll suggest it to them and see where we get

[07:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I still don't see why you want to keep this information so separate anyway. What problem are you trying to solve by removing them from the authoring guide?

[07:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: the problem of having a giganto table in there with information that only a small percentage of users will probably have any use for

[07:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
.. or the problem of it appearing to encourage authors to use gazillions of named character references in their docs 

[07:27:01.0000] <hallvors>
Dr. MikeSmith sets out to cure featuritis :)

[07:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's the same problem that would be solved by removing the complete works of Shakespeare from the authoring guide, if the works were in there in the first place - they're a waste of space for most of the audience, and make it harder to download or read or print out or anything

[07:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hallvors: I learned about the problems of featuritis from one of my previous jobs :)

[07:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
it won't encourage them, because I intend to have a section in there that discusses the use of unicode encodings for their documents and explain why they should use the real characters instead of the references

[07:28:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: they'll skip right past your words and go to the pretty pictures

[07:28:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would, at least

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: The probability of a reader reading the giganto table (and getting the wrong impression from it) seems much higher than the chance of them reading one particular paragraph that tells them to not use the table

[07:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I know Rob Tyner of the MC5 probably would skip the words and go for the pictures also

[07:29:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me raises his Goblet of Rock to the MC5

[07:29:03.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know who Rob Tyner is

[07:29:04.0000] <Lachy>
or what MC5 is

[07:29:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: educate yourself, brother

[07:29:06.0000] <Philip`>
It's the precursor to MD5

[07:29:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[07:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: don't blaspheme

[07:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
Rob Tyner is a world-renowed cryptologist

[07:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
:-D

[07:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
*renowned

[07:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
renow is something you do when you when you forget something, then remember it. but just without the "k"

[07:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"renow" is an abbreviation for "reknow" in that way.. as "whatcha" is an abbreviation for "what are you"

[07:33:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me discovers that safari can play and pause animated gifs in <video>, and resizes the video to something when loading in the ahem ttf font

[07:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
How can you remember something unless you've already membered it?

[07:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me writes that one down

[07:34:01.0000] <zcorpan>
safari can also play a .bmp in <audio>

[07:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
"member" is a good word in a lot of ways

[07:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Can you pass a .txt into <audio> and get text-to-speech from it?

[07:35:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: no

[07:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: That's a shame

[07:36:01.0000] <hallvors>
zcorpan: we should implement that :-)

[07:36:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, you could if there were a codec available that did that

[07:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hallvors: seems better to just load the .txt in a browsing context and hit v

[07:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: That doesn't work for e.g. interactive games which want to speak to you

[07:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: true. but we have X+V for that, i think

[07:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me finds http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/byalpha.html

[07:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
fwiw authouring math without named characters would be even more nightmarish than it is with them

[07:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: very glad I don't have to do it, then

[07:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: are there not tools that allow you to select them from a menu? 

[07:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean, you can set up even Emacs to do stuff like that

[07:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
When you're writing a page full of equations, you really don't want to be selecting each character from a menu

[07:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
Also you can't even read the characters, because they all look the same when they're in a little font on the screen

[07:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
editors should just allow users to insert characters with keyboard shortcuts

[07:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: The problem is remembering the keyboard shortcut for integral is harder tahn remembering &int; or whatever

[07:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Use a postprocessor that lets you write entities and replaces them with characters?

[07:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: That counts as "even harder"

[07:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
(since in that case you could just use a preprocessor that lets you write something that looks like TeX and outputs mathml

[07:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
)

[07:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, the keyboard shortcut should be something that brings up a special input, where you start typing part of it's name, and it offers you a selection of matching characters to insert

[07:50:03.0000] <zcorpan>
wouldn't a sane author write something like TeX anyway?

[07:50:04.0000] <Lachy>
like an autocomplete system

[07:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Well I guess that might work but there are rather a lot of editors that are good at ascii input and rather few that implement the functionaility you describe

[07:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
So it suffers from being a "tools will save us" argument

[07:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's impossible to visually distinguish ∲foo from ∳foo when you're editing your document source, whereas it's easy to distinguish &cwconint;foo from &awconint;foo

[07:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Yes.

[07:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and now I come across http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/

[07:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
(but that is not always possible particularly if you care what the markup looks like in the end)

[07:53:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and now wondering why the above doc has not progressed beyond WD

[07:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-xml-entity-names-20071214/byalpha.html

[07:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
good enough for me

[07:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: doesn't contain AMP;

[07:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: so where did AMP; come from?

[07:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
something that's supported in browsers but not spec'ed?

[07:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: it's in the html5 spec

[07:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: but it's not something we want authors to actually use, right?

[07:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
just something that browsers need to support?

[07:59:02.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: it's conforming html5

[08:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: so maybe it shouldn't be

[08:00:01.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: fine by me. convince Hixie :)

[08:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far a document-conformance goes

[08:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me learns about &debug=1 in validator.w3.org

[08:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought http://svn.whatwg.org/webapps/entities-unicode.inc was generated from some XML data provided as part of xml-entity-names

[08:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which includes AMP;)

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but I may be wrong)

[08:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: would be interesting to find out

[08:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in the mean time, i'm dis-membering that table from my draft at least

[08:07:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, the XML guys included &AMP;

[08:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: it doesn't appear to the in the version above

[08:07:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
is it maybe in an editor's draft?

[08:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I seem to re-member now somebody posting a URL to one of their EDs a while back

[08:09:00.0000] <annevk5>
it's part of http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007xml/unicode.xml

[08:09:01.0000] <annevk5>
linked from http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/#source

[08:10:00.0000] <annevk5>
your version is at least 6 months old anyway

[08:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5: OK

[08:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me has now filed 1 bug and 2 enh req on validator.w3.org

[08:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i guess you may find this interesting http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6296

[08:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
at some point we should just obsolete HTML 1-4 and require them to be parsed like HTML5

[08:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk5: html5 allows validators to use legacy validation for legacy doctypes

[08:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: is the lack of AMP; QUOT; etc. the only difference you notice between the list in that MathML WG WD and the list that's in the HTML5 spec?

[08:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I notice the unicode.xml file has all of those in a "html5-uppercase" set

[08:44:01.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: it was the only thing i looked for, so yes :)

[08:44:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[09:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
fyi, David Carlisle just updated the "XML Entity definitions for Characters" draft

[09:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the MathML guys rock

[10:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I now see what you might have meant when you asked what about <script> in speculative tokenization

[10:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so yeah, speculating past <svg> or <math> is a problem

[11:01:00.0000] <yecril71>
I would like to remind that the whole problem with duplicated identifiers

[11:01:01.0000] <yecril71>
has been caused by using identifier references in table attributes.

[11:01:02.0000] <yecril71>
Replacing an identifier with a class name is not the way to go,

[11:02:00.0000] <yecril71>
unless the algorithm for resolving such references changes as well.

[11:02:01.0000] <yecril71>
But it looks like a misuse.

[11:03:00.0000] <yecril71>
Classes are not �Look, it�s there!� things.

[11:03:01.0000] <yecril71>
quot, amp and apos entities are all in the XML specification.

[11:04:00.0000] <yecril71>
There is no need for MathML to reproduce them.

[11:05:00.0000] <yecril71>
The logo WHATWG logo is a nologo.

[11:05:01.0000] <yecril71>
Instead of building it using LEGO, one should rather make a better one.

[12:15:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Quick question. 

[12:16:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Does anyone know if there is a companion to the <noscript> tag. 

[12:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why the Microsoft Connect site is so unbearably slow

[12:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
avandenhoven: Uh, like <script>?

[12:16:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
I don't mean the <script> tag per se. I mean tag that will render its TEXT contents if scripting is enabled. 

[12:17:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Often times we do all sorts of things to avoid the flash of unstyled (or wrongly styled) text that one sees if you're doing one thing when you have script and another when you dont. 

[12:18:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
often we'll write a script class name to the html or body tag and hang style off that class. 

[12:18:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
but there is that instant in which you have no script stles. 

[12:18:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
er styles. 

[12:18:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
it occured to me the other day that you can do <noscript><link rel="stylesheet"..." /></noscript> and that should work

[12:19:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
but why not also have <yesscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="myscriptedstyle.css" /></yesscript>

[12:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
What are the problems with <script>document.write('text contents')</script> or <script>document.write('<style>#foo{display:inherit !important}<\/style>')</script><div id=foo style=display:none>text contents</div> or something along those lines?

[12:20:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Does that not totally creep people out? 

[12:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
It doesn't creep me out :-)

[12:21:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
it should. 

[12:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
(You could do it with DOM manipulation if you're opposed to document.write)

[12:21:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
I realize that there are JS ways to write content. 

[12:21:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
its inherently obtrusive. 

[12:21:04.0000] <yecril71>
I would suggest hiding the content using CSS and revealing it from script.

[12:22:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Again, I realize that there are ways to do this now. I'm suggesting that an improvement would be to find a way to do it without resorting to JavaScript. 

[12:22:01.0000] <yecril71>
By clearing the class attribute.

[12:23:00.0000] <yecril71>
Why exactly would that be an improvement?

[12:23:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
Easier to read. 

[12:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
avandenhoven: <noscript>/<yesscript> seem inherently obtrusive too, since they're explicitly encoding script-related issues into the markup

[12:23:03.0000] <yecril71>
div[class="ifscript"] is easy to read.

[12:24:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
using <yesscript> (aside from its stupid name) is obtrusive but it also means that you don't need to translate the thing you want to include into JavaScript. 

[12:25:00.0000] <yecril71>
But you do not, do you?

[12:25:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
Converting HTML or CSS into JavaScript is fine if its a one off, "I'm hacking my own site" kinda thinkg

[12:25:02.0000] <yecril71>
There is no need to include it into the script code.

[12:25:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
but if you're building something with a CMS, then you have to do something different. 

[12:26:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
An arbitrary block of HTML or CSS is not guaranteed to make sense if you wrap it in a document.write('...');

[12:26:01.0000] <yecril71>
Just say DIV.ifscript { DISPLAY:NONE } and you are done.

[12:27:00.0000] <yecril71>
You should never ever document.write, yep.

[12:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
avandenhoven: I think I'd have to agree that document.write('all the content') is not the best idea if you have a lot of content

[12:28:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Another problem with relying on JavaScript to change things is timing. 

[12:28:01.0000] <yecril71>
That means?

[12:28:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
I can't type fast enough and think coherently... give me a sec

[12:28:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
:)

[12:29:00.0000] <yecril71>
Well, this may be called a problem with timing, yes :-)

[12:29:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
Except in a handcoded, static site, you are going to want to do do things together. 

[12:29:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
usually bootstrapping all your ajaxy widgets and what have you comes on DOM load. 

[12:30:00.0000] <yecril71>
Bootstrapping?

[12:30:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
Adding JS to markup to make to do pretty things. 

[12:30:02.0000] <yecril71>
This is not bootstrapping.

[12:30:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
that's what I call it. Sorry. 

[12:30:04.0000] <yecril71>
Bootstrapping is when you want to compile Scheme.

[12:31:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
I'm pretty sure I never want to compile scheme :)

[12:31:01.0000] <yecril71>
Because you usually use Scheme to compile Scheme, you are pretty much stuck :-)

[12:31:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
anyways. if you do things "all at once" you're going to want to tend to put add your "isScripted" or what ever class onDomLoad with the rest of your JavaScript. 

[12:32:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Now you've suddenly changed what the user sees mid way through. 

[12:32:01.0000] <yecril71>
I think the elements should be .ifscript at the beginning, and the script should clear that afterwards.

[12:33:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Either way, the JS people are going to see the unscripted view until dom load.

[12:33:01.0000] <yecril71>
You can say onload="show()" to get them ASAP.

[12:34:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
onLoad happens after onDomReady. 

[12:34:01.0000] <yecril71>
You mean window.onLoad or element.onLoad?

[12:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
avandenhoven: Isn't it easy enough to simply modify your script so the single line of code that sets the isScripted class will be executed immediately when the script is loaded?

[12:35:00.0000] <yecril71>
The script should clear .ifscript, not set it.

[12:35:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
clear or set, has no real difference, except in the selectors. 

[12:35:02.0000] <yecril71>
No real difference but easier to follow if everyone sees the same picture though.

[12:36:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
yes you could put a script immediately after the opening body tag. But that still doesn't elminate the need for

[12:36:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
<script type="text/javascript">document.write("<li class=\"item0\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"window.print()\" onKeyPress=\"window.print()\" />Print Map & Results</a></li>");</script>

[12:36:02.0000] <yecril71>
What whas that for?

[12:36:03.0000] <yecril71>
You cannot have "</" in a script block.

[12:36:04.0000] <avandenhoven>
it makes a link that fires the print dialog. 

[12:37:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
not necessary per se, but my clients like it. 

[12:37:01.0000] <yecril71>
Why not put it directly into HTML?

[12:37:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
why pollute the DOM with elements that are not valuable unless you have JavaScript. 

[12:38:00.0000] <yecril71>
What is in the DOM is pretty irrelevant where there is no script.

[12:38:01.0000] <yecril71>
There could be no DOM whatsoever in such an environment.

[12:39:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Hmm. 

[12:39:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
maybe I should rethink the logic of some of the code that has been handed down through the aeons. 

[12:40:00.0000] <yecril71>
And clean things up for Christmas.

[12:40:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
you have no idea what you're asking.

[12:41:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
We do an integrated online banking/corporate website platform for canadian Credit unions. 

[12:41:01.0000] <yecril71>
Augian stables?

[12:41:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
I should be so lucky. 

[12:41:03.0000] <yecril71>
Need help?

[12:42:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
try adding a slave master who doesn't want to change anything becuase its stable. 

[12:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
yecril71: But layout and (from that) rendering is done from the DOM, so it is still relevant when there is no script

[12:42:02.0000] <yecril71>
But DISPLAY:NONE has no effect on rendering.

[12:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
if CSS isn't enabled, then that's true

[12:44:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
He means that if you display none the elements you don't want to show when javascript is disabled, you can insert what ever you want. 

[12:44:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
to be really general though (the thing you need when you have complex systems like this) is a class on the body or HTML element and a class on the individual elements. lets you do:

[12:45:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
.noScript .scriptOnly {display:none;}

[12:45:01.0000] <yecril71>
If CSS is not enabled, I would just DISPLAY:NONE a warning message: no script? not for you, pal!

[12:46:00.0000] <yecril71>
This may cause minor problems to users with no CSS, yes.

[12:46:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
ick. No CSS and JavaScript?

[12:47:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
you're on your own buddy. 

[12:47:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
that is CSS disabled and JavaScript enabled.

[12:47:02.0000] <yecril71>
It seems like a very unexpected setup to me.

[12:48:00.0000] <yecril71>
Do you think it should be supported?

[12:48:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
yecril71: as it turns out, my team (we have 30+ java developers and 9 web developers, I'm with the web dev team) is looking for a web developer in the next little while. 

[12:48:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
CSS disabled and JavaScript enabled? I don't think you can do anything too reasonable. 

[12:49:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Except make sure your markup works well with out CSS and have your JS bail at the first opportunity. 

[12:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
Do you think JS-CSS is a valid target for your application?

[12:51:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
you mean using JS to write the css. I remember looking at that way back in the day and it struck me as being sub optimal. 

[12:51:01.0000] <yecril71>
I mean JS enabled, CSS disabled.

[12:52:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
oh that. 

[12:52:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
I don't think so. 

[12:52:02.0000] <yecril71>
And what about -JS-CSS?

[12:53:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Sure.

[12:53:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
We always make sure that you can use our sites with lynx. I find it makes it more likely that screen readers will not choke. 

[12:54:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
We don't worry about it too much but we do think about it. 

[12:54:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
Its not pretty but it is functional. 

[12:54:02.0000] <yecril71>
I thought Lynx should support display:none at least.

[12:54:03.0000] <yecril71>
Doesn�t it?

[12:54:04.0000] <krijnh>
It doesn't

[12:55:00.0000] <yecril71>
Ouch.

[12:55:01.0000] <yecril71>
Then it seems you have to use irrelevant instead.

[12:55:02.0000] <yecril71>
(which Lynx does not support either, but it is an HTML5 chat after all)

[12:56:00.0000] <krijnh>
avandenhoven: I totally get your problem, hard to solve :)

[12:57:00.0000] <yecril71>
Or just say "Please ignore the following message, it is not for you"

[12:57:01.0000] <krijnh>
We get thought unobtrusive scripting is the way to go, even though that creates a suboptimal experience for like 95% of your users :)

[12:59:00.0000] <yecril71>
OTOH, short of document.write, you could use a JSON representation of the node to be inserted

[12:59:01.0000] <yecril71>
and have a library function insert it for you.

[13:00:00.0000] <yecril71>
Because even if yesscript were defined, Lynx would probably not support it anyway.

[13:00:01.0000] <yecril71>
So the solution would not solve anything.

[13:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
krijnh: That's not a hard problem to solve - you just have to ignore what everyone is telling you to do :-)

[13:01:01.0000] <yecril71>
It would be easier to get Lynx to honour DISPLAY:NONE.

[13:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: That would involve Lynx getting a complete CSS implementation, which is not trivial

[13:02:01.0000] <krijnh>
Philip`: well, document.write and inline event handlers don't solve it all either :)

[13:03:00.0000] <yecril71>
A CSS implementation limited to DISPLAY:NONE is not a complete implementation

[13:03:01.0000] <yecril71>
and that is the only thing that is needed

[13:04:00.0000] <krijnh>
That would totally suck

[13:04:01.0000] <krijnh>
ul ul { display: none; } ul li:hover ul { display: block; }

[13:04:02.0000] <krijnh>
Go Lynx :)

[13:05:00.0000] <yecril71>
That sux anyway

[13:05:01.0000] <krijnh>
I knew it

[13:05:02.0000] <yecril71>
Lynx or not lynx

[13:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: It would still need all the selectors (and hence a tree model of the document) and the cascading rules, and media types and so on, even if it then ignores all but one of the properties

[13:08:00.0000] <yecril71>
Doesn�t W3C have a reference implementation for that?

[13:08:01.0000] <krijnh>
yecril71: btw, Opera makes that less sucky (and afaik the only browser that does :hover states when keyboard navigating)

[13:09:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Sorry, i had to get back to "real" work for a bit. :)

[13:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: Not that I'm aware of, and reference implementations probably aren't the kind of thing you'd want to ship in a browser anyway

[13:10:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Adding something like "yesscript" isn't going to work retroactively. That's fine. 

[13:10:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
I wonder if

[13:10:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
<script type="text/html"> would be the way to go. 

[13:10:03.0000] <krijnh>
That does work already

[13:10:04.0000] <avandenhoven>
really?

[13:11:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
you're saying that if I put <script type="text/html"><h1>You have script enabled</h1></script> I'll actually have what I think I should have?

[13:11:01.0000] <krijnh>
Didn't JohnResig write something about that?

[13:12:00.0000] <krijnh>
http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/

[13:14:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Ah that's different but very cool. 

[13:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
avandenhoven: All browsers should parse the content of that <script> as a single text node, and then (if they support scripting) do nothing with it because it's an unknown type, or else (if they don't support scripting) do nothing with it

[13:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
so you'd never see that text, unless you have some extra scripts that extract the contents and insert them as HTML somewhere else in the document

[13:15:01.0000] <krijnh>
Doh, that's different indeed :)

[13:15:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
I was thinking along the lines of: http://gist.github.com/34491

[13:16:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
I was hoping the style there would be unnecessary. 

[13:16:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
Either way, when you have JS disabled, you see both  messages. 

[13:17:00.0000] <krijnh>
document.write('<body class=js-enabled>'); works good enough for styling now

[13:17:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
I would never write out a body tag like that. 

[13:17:02.0000] <krijnh>
Why not?

[13:17:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
i'm pretty sure the source wouldn't validate. 

[13:18:00.0000] <krijnh>
Why not?

[13:18:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
because I'm pretty sure validators don't run JS before validating

[13:18:02.0000] <krijnh>
They don't need to

[13:18:03.0000] <krijnh>
The body tag isn't mandatory

[13:18:04.0000] <krijnh>
http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http://www.youngprofessionaloftheyear.nl/ (don't mind the iframe)

[13:19:00.0000] <yecril71>
The problem to solve is what to do with no CSS.

[13:21:00.0000] <yecril71>
Now that Philip` busted my attempt to enhance Lynx, I think @irrelevant is the way to go.

[13:21:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
either way, I require that a file that opens a tag also closes it (for instance if you're using SSI or a some CMS system... we literally have dozens of includes in any given generated page). 

[13:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: (I think it's called 'hidden' now, not 'irrelevant')

[13:21:03.0000] <yecril71>
Thanks, memorized.

[13:22:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
I'll look at the irrelevant/hidden attributes. 

[13:22:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
Thanks for the useful discussion. I

[13:22:02.0000] <krijnh>
avandenhoven: HTML doesn't require it though..

[13:22:03.0000] <Philip`>
<body><script>document.body.className = 'js'<script> might look nicer than optionally writing <body>

[13:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
s//\//

[13:23:01.0000] <krijnh>
So much nicer :)

[13:23:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
krijnh: No, but if I want to keep my code quality up, I do (I have 30 develoeprs who aren't HTML saavy). 

[13:23:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
Philip: yeah that's what I would have to do. 

[13:23:04.0000] <yecril71>
In spite of them, you can closeTag("body") at the end.

[13:24:00.0000] <yecril71>
So that the code markup can balance.

[13:24:01.0000] <yecril71>
But body opened and not closed is all right as well.

[13:24:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
I'm of the kindergarden school of web development. 

[13:24:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
If you open it close it. 

[13:24:04.0000] <krijnh>
Agreed, especially if you work with others

[13:25:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
I know HTML doesn't require it but I find that it avoids trouble. 

[13:25:01.0000] <yecril71>
Like </br >? :-)

[13:25:02.0000] <avandenhoven>
no <br />

[13:25:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
that's closed. 

[13:25:04.0000] <avandenhoven>
<img  />

[13:25:05.0000] <avandenhoven>
that too. 

[13:25:06.0000] <yecril71>
It is XHTML, not HTML.

[13:25:07.0000] <krijnh>
*sigh*

[13:25:08.0000] <krijnh>
It is HTML5

[13:25:09.0000] <Philip`>
It is Real World HTML

[13:25:10.0000] <yecril71>
In HTML, it is <BR >>

[13:26:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
that lack of closing for empty tags is a hold over of SGML that was, IMHO, a mistake. 

[13:26:01.0000] <yecril71>
It is a manifestation of Occam razor.

[13:27:00.0000] <avandenhoven>
Until you start making tag soup. 

[13:27:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
which is what HTML5 in current browsers really is. 

[13:27:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It's only tag soup if you want it to be

[13:28:00.0000] <yecril71>
<br /> in HTML4 is tag soup

[13:28:01.0000] <avandenhoven>
what is the model for <body> <section><p></body> if you aren't an HTML5 browser?

[13:28:02.0000] <yecril71>
<body ><section /><p /></body > in IE

[13:28:03.0000] <avandenhoven>
yecril71: exactly and its absolutely clear for a use what it is.

[14:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: The first (physicsy one) went really badly; the second went fine

[15:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Ah

[15:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Basically, all the questions I was asked in the first were the things that I'm meant to know for AH physics but don't actually know

[15:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like the new IE8 build fixes the ARIA attribute properties

[15:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I did work it out mostly, albeit slowly and only just not making bad mistakes with integration

[15:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Interviews don't really feel like the right environment for carefully solving equations

No, they really don't

[15:05:02.0000] <roc>
what new IE8 build?

[15:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: I think it's only in the Tech Beta program at the moment

[15:06:01.0000] <roc>
how often do they release new builds?

[15:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
They're basically the same as the public betas

[15:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
(This is the first change since Beta 2, as far as I'm aware)

[15:07:02.0000] <roc>
you mean this is the first build they've released that wasn't a public beta?

[15:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
They've been distributing a newer build with Win7 pre-beta apparently

[15:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's probably just the same build as that

[15:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
roc: It's the first one via the Tech Beta thing

gsnedders: It's dated to the 10th of December (at least in the readme file), so it may not be the same

(Oddly, the readme file is a PDF named Readme.exe)

[15:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
(When I said I was downloading the IE8 build, I didn't realise it was going to go at 15KB/sec, or that it would take half an hour to update Windows and uninstall IE8b2 and still not get around to installing the new build...)

[15:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Aha, there it goes

[15:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's a lot less slow at rendering the spec than before

[15:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
It still takes half a second to work out where to go when you click on a fragment link, and maybe a quarter of a second to draw the background highlight when hovering items in the table of contents, but it's quite bearable

[16:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: assuming there's no objections, i'll start looking at doing that in early january

[16:27:00.0000] <takkaria>
Hixie: have you any suggestions for interesting board games to play?

[16:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
how long? how many people? how geeky are the people?

[16:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, who's Lisa? Is she someone from the HTMLWG?

[16:27:03.0000] <takkaria>
any length of time, three to six, and really quite geeky

[16:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, megamonopoly

[16:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
lachy: Lisa Dusseault = ietf apps area director

[16:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria: i would recommend Twilight Imperium 3

[16:28:03.0000] <Lachy>
that's monopoly with 2 boards joined together

[16:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria: takes about 12 hours to play the first time, though

[16:29:00.0000] <takkaria>
christ, that looks awesome. :)  ta

[16:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
Lachy: how does that work?

[16:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
join the 2 boards diagonally together with the GOs overlapping and do a figure 8 around both

[16:32:01.0000] <takkaria>
hmm

[16:33:00.0000] <rillianbis>
Lachy: does it come with highrise towers as a hotel upgrade?

[16:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
just watch out for the extra long expensive strip since the 2 with Mayfair, etc. end up line up

[16:33:02.0000] <neatnik>
Mayfair?

[16:33:03.0000] <Lachy>
rillianbis, you're free to make up any variation

[16:33:04.0000] <rillianbis>
:)

[16:33:05.0000] <Lachy>
neatnik, that's the most expensive property on a standard monopoly board

[16:33:06.0000] <neatnik>
Lachy: oh.  I thought it was Boardwalk

[16:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
what?

[16:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
in which version?

[16:34:02.0000] <neatnik>
I've never seen a monopoly board with a Mayfair on it

[16:34:03.0000] <neatnik>
dunno, I grew up playing the standard Parker Bros version

[16:34:04.0000] <neatnik>
American version, I guess

[16:34:05.0000] <rillianbis>
neatnik: Mayfair is what the UK edition called Boardwalk

[16:34:06.0000] <neatnik>
did they change it? :(

[16:34:07.0000] <neatnik>
Oooh.

[16:34:08.0000] <neatnik>
cultural misunderstanding :D

[16:34:09.0000] <neatnik>
Mayfair sounds cooler than Boardwalk, for the record

[16:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
neatnik, in the original version based on London place names, it's Mayfair

[16:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)#Board

[16:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
I can't remember what it's called in the first Australian edition that I have at home in Aus

[16:36:01.0000] <neatnik>
oh wow

[16:36:02.0000] <neatnik>
I had no idea.

[16:36:03.0000] <neatnik>
Growing up in America, you're more or less programmed to believe that everything here is the most significant and important version of everything

[16:36:04.0000] <neatnik>
And that nothing else matters

[16:37:00.0000] <neatnik>
So it never occurred to me that there'd even be another version of Monopoly, let alone that it would be the *original* version :/

[16:37:01.0000] <rillianbis>
with effort and experience, this assumption can be overcome :)

[16:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
Growing up out of America, you're more or less programmed to believe that everything there is the least significant and unimportant version of everything :-)

[16:37:03.0000] <neatnik>
rillianbis: hmm, I've always assumed that it would require a time machine

[16:38:00.0000] <neatnik>
rillianbis: and that I'd have to go back in time and convince my parents to move to, say, Sweden when I was 1 or 2 years old

[16:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: thanks (update about meeting with Lisa Dusseault)

[16:38:02.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, apparently both the US and UK versions have Park Place in the same location 

[16:40:00.0000] <neatnik>
oh, cool

[16:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: seems to me to be a good way to go forward and I thin (hope) it will be more palatable (for lack of a better word) to some who have had issues with those parts

[16:40:02.0000] <neatnik>
My sister and I would play these insanely long Monopoly games when we were younger

[16:40:03.0000] <roc>
it's Park Lane in the UK version

[16:41:00.0000] <neatnik>
we both used similar tactics, and so it was hard to beat one another

[16:41:01.0000] <neatnik>
we'd start in the evening, play forever, and then have to give up and go to sleep before resuming the next morning

[16:41:02.0000] <neatnik>
there was always a 50% chance that a cat would ruin the board during the night :(

[16:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: cool

[16:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
roc, oh right. I was looking at the 2 different american layouts in wikipedia without realising. I thought one was the UK version

[16:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I suspect there are still going to be some who object to publishing, e.g., the content-sniffing part at all

[16:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I guess we can cross that bridge when we come to it

[16:42:03.0000] <rillianbis>
roc: did you have any more thought's about Dave's suggestion that media wrappers like SMIL need to be supported in <video>?

[16:43:00.0000] <neatnik>
heh, Old Kent Road

[16:43:01.0000] <neatnik>
that sounds like a fun place

[16:43:02.0000] <roc>
rillianbis: I think that's a reasonable enhancement, but it will add considerable complexity

[16:43:03.0000] <rillianbis>
I guess Silvia's proposal is relavant to that in that it is proposing a dom method for discovering component tracks

[16:43:04.0000] <neatnik>
oh wow, you don't have a "Just Visiting" area outside of your jail?

[16:44:00.0000] <rillianbis>
roc: I guess you said as much before

[16:45:00.0000] <rillianbis>
what about getting text data out of the video stream? do you see that in the same category?

[16:45:01.0000] <roc>
not at all

[16:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
neatnik, yes, Just Visiting is supposed to be there

[16:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
Wikipedia is just wrong

[16:46:01.0000] <neatnik>
phew, good

[16:46:02.0000] <roc>
loading multiple resources is the problem here

[16:46:03.0000] <roc>
dealing with what can happen if one resource loads but the other doesn't

[16:46:04.0000] <roc>
or they load at different rates

[16:47:00.0000] <roc>
SMIL is especially difficult because you have to load this intermediate XML file, validate it, and then go off and load more resources

[16:47:01.0000] <rillianbis>
ok, but your object applies to the <video><text></video> suggestion as well

[16:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
takkaria: Uncle Wiggily

[16:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I think the rules require that you play it while you're drunk

[16:48:01.0000] <rillianbis>
roc: your objection does, rather

[16:48:02.0000] <roc>
not so much

[16:49:00.0000] <roc>
if the text doesn't load we can just play the video

[16:49:01.0000] <roc>
if the video doesn't load, the text is useless

[16:49:02.0000] <roc>
if the text loads too slowly we can just ignore it

[16:49:03.0000] <roc>
it's ancillary

[16:50:00.0000] <nessy>
with the roe file (in contrast to smil), the roe would also be ancilliary to a video and allow basically server-side what the <text> tags do client-side

[16:50:01.0000] <nessy>
I guess that falls under the same concerns then

[16:51:00.0000] <rillianbis>
roc: ok good. that's how I originally read your email. thanks for clarifying

[16:51:01.0000] <rillianbis>
so what would the api for getting text data out of a video element's src stream look like?

[16:52:00.0000] <roc>
dunno

[16:52:01.0000] <roc>
I don't know what the data model for the text is

[16:53:00.0000] <rillianbis>
yeah, we don't either

[16:53:01.0000] <roc>
ah :-)

[16:53:02.0000] <rillianbis>
so right now that's a 'it depends'

[16:53:03.0000] <rillianbis>
if it's xml, being able to slup it is nice

[16:53:04.0000] <roc>
I imagine one option would be a set of text data objects, each with an associated time interval

[16:53:05.0000] <rillianbis>
but if it's muxed, would events be better?

[16:53:06.0000] <rillianbis>
*nod*

[16:54:00.0000] <roc>
if that's your data model, then I think a convenient API would be "fire an event whenever the current time enters the time interval for a text object"

[16:54:01.0000] <rillianbis>
my concern was that Dave implied there should be a unified method of accessing this stuff that also works with wrappers like SMIL

[16:54:02.0000] <roc>
or leaves

[16:54:03.0000] <roc>
and the event would pass in an object with the text and the interval

[16:54:04.0000] <rillianbis>
that would work for both, of course, but it's specific to text

[16:54:05.0000] <rillianbis>
(or chapter/annotation tracks)

[16:55:00.0000] <rillianbis>
and not so useful for a/v data, controlling conditionals, etc.

[16:55:01.0000] <nessy>
for srt that works nicely

[16:55:02.0000] <nessy>
other formats bear more information

[16:55:03.0000] <roc>
that API is much like cue ranges

[16:55:04.0000] <rillianbis>
roc: right, that's what I was thinking of

[16:55:05.0000] <nessy>
such as karaoke-style formatting

[16:56:00.0000] <rillianbis>
nessy: couldn't that just be more-complete data inside the text objects?

[16:56:01.0000] <roc>
some users might want to be able to grab all available text objects and their intervals

[16:56:02.0000] <roc>
like if you want to be able to display text ahead and behind the current point

[16:57:00.0000] <nessy>
rillianbis: if it's xml marked-up, it should be parsed, right?

[16:57:01.0000] <roc>
designing for extensibility is fine but we have to be careful to create something that can actually be used

[16:57:02.0000] <nessy>
/me nods

[16:58:00.0000] <rillianbis>
nessy: I don't know enough about dom and javascript to have an opinion there :)

[16:58:01.0000] <nessy>
which is why trying srt first and getting it right for that simple format is good

[16:58:02.0000] <nessy>
then we can extend for more complex formats such as dfxp

[16:58:03.0000] <roc>
it's tempting to pass back a big blob and say "this could be anything!" ... infinitely extensible but people can't use it

[16:58:04.0000] <nessy>
that's my concern, too

[16:59:00.0000] <nessy>
the dom or api should be as simple as possible

[16:59:01.0000] <rillianbis>
/me nods

[16:59:02.0000] <nessy>
yet, some things should be enabled that go beyond just text and time markers

[16:59:03.0000] <rillianbis>
roc: so I think the cue ranges make a lot of sense

[17:00:00.0000] <nessy>
for example, creating a speech bubble on a person with some text that has a hyperlink

[17:00:01.0000] <roc>
one option is that the "text object" passed to the event is a DOM node that's created (but not inserted) in the current HTML document

[17:00:02.0000] <rillianbis>
they just need another attribute we can hang text on

[17:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: for sure. but i don't see any way to satisfy that position, so...

[17:00:04.0000] <roc>
so that could be a text node, but it could be an <A> element

[17:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: right, me neither

[17:02:00.0000] <roc>
whatever semantics the browser can extract from the metadata, it can translate into HTML

[17:02:01.0000] <roc>
that translation would probably be in an auxiliary spec somewhere

[17:02:02.0000] <roc>
whatever can't be translated to sensible HTML could be returned as an XML blob

[17:03:00.0000] <nessy>
excellent, that was what I hoped would be possible

[17:03:01.0000] <nessy>
a bit like the iFrame - create a dom that is essentially html, but applied to the video

[17:03:02.0000] <roc>
the idea would be that a script could expect to just insert that HTML somewhere and something good would happen

[17:03:03.0000] <nessy>
would that work with a html excerpt or does it need a full html page ?

[17:04:00.0000] <roc>
or the browser could just display the HTML itself inside or next to the video

[17:04:01.0000] <roc>
a full HTML page is too heavyweight

[17:04:02.0000] <roc>
IMHO

[17:04:03.0000] <nessy>
good, I prefer that, to

[17:04:04.0000] <nessy>
too

[17:04:05.0000] <nessy>
since a time-aligned text excerpt tends to be something like a <div>, it would be better as an excerpt

[17:05:00.0000] <roc>
so an interesting thought experiment would be for you to look at the existing formats and try to define how they would be mapped into HTML nodes

[17:05:01.0000] <rillianbis>
should this be a separate callback just for text events?

[17:06:00.0000] <roc>
I don't know

[17:06:01.0000] <rillianbis>
or is it reasonable for all cue ranges to do something like this

[17:06:02.0000] <roc>
I forget what the current status of cue ranges is

[17:06:03.0000] <nessy>
yes, that was what I intended to do 

[17:06:04.0000] <rillianbis>
and define (formally or by convention) some magic classes?

[17:06:05.0000] <rillianbis>
roc: there's not much in the spec

[17:06:06.0000] <rillianbis>
you add them, and they call your callbacks

[17:06:07.0000] <adu>
can i has getContext('3d')?

[17:06:08.0000] <roc>
rillianbis: classes? You mean like "class" attributes?

[17:07:00.0000] <rillianbis>
yes

[17:07:01.0000] <rillianbis>
that's how cue ranges are sorted in the current spec

[17:07:02.0000] <rillianbis>
class attr for groups

[17:07:03.0000] <rillianbis>
id attr for individual ranges

[17:07:04.0000] <Philip`>
adu: Not yet :-p

[17:07:05.0000] <roc>
I have to reread the spec I guess

[17:07:06.0000] <nessy>
 subtitles are almost the same as cure ranges, except for an additional <div> tag

[17:07:07.0000] <rillianbis>
there's currently no api for getting the available classes/ranges

[17:08:00.0000] <roc>
yeah, cue ranges with data

[17:08:01.0000] <roc>
would be nice to unify them I guess, if it doesn't burden cue range users unnecessarily

[17:08:02.0000] <rillianbis>
so there's no way to get the intrinsic ranges the player might know about from the stream

[17:08:03.0000] <adu>
Philip`: ok, 2d will do then :)

[17:08:04.0000] <adu>
Philip`: are you familiar with x3d?

[17:08:05.0000] <rillianbis>
roc: we did that in CMML and I always thought it was a nice idea

[17:08:06.0000] <roc>
yeah an API to get available data would be nice

[17:09:00.0000] <rillianbis>
cue ranges, chapter markers, subtitles, outgoing hyperlinks, anchors...they're all the same kind of data functionally

[17:09:01.0000] <roc>
the API would probably take a time interval and return a list of ranges (including associated data, if any) that intersect the interval

[17:10:00.0000] <roc>
of course it would only return the ranges that are available. scripts would have to poll for updated results, maybe in a progress listener

[17:10:01.0000] <rillianbis>
yes

[17:10:02.0000] <rillianbis>
that also means they have to remember the last time they checked

[17:10:03.0000] <roc>
hmm, but that would be a problem for streams with caption data ... the browser would have to keep all captions in memory forever in case anyone asks

[17:10:04.0000] <Philip`>
adu: Somewhat - I made a very incomplete prototype X3D renderer using Mozilla's experimental 3d canvas a while ago :-)

[17:11:00.0000] <rillianbis>
roc: that's why I was thinking of magic classes

[17:11:01.0000] <adu>
Philip`: nice!

[17:11:02.0000] <roc>
so maybe a better idea would be to have an event that fires whenever range data is received from the server, and scripts can store whatever they need themselves

[17:11:03.0000] <nessy>
also, you only really want one subtitle track to display at one time - but be able to select between different languages

[17:11:04.0000] <rillianbis>
so you could add a callback for the 'subtitle_de' class, and just get called when a new one goes in/out of playback

[17:11:05.0000] <adu>
Philip`: that reminds me, have you heard of CrystalZilla?

[17:11:06.0000] <rillianbis>
but you still need some way to find out what's actually available in the stream

[17:12:00.0000] <rillianbis>
which is another getter, or polling anyway

[17:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
adu: No, but I have now

[17:12:02.0000] <adu>
Philip`: its kind of the opposite: http://interreality.org/wiki/crystalzilla

[17:12:03.0000] <nessy>
when used inside the <video> tag with <text> elements, it is easy to see the alternatives

[17:12:04.0000] <rillianbis>
hmm, but polling for available lanuages and updating the ui in the progress callback isn't as bad as general query for a range

[17:13:00.0000] <rillianbis>
nessy: so should the player create and insert text elements to represent embedded text tracks?

[17:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
adu: I've been kind of interested in using WebKit in an OpenGL game, but nobody seems to have quite made a good enough port of it yet :-(

[17:13:02.0000] <nessy>
maybe just the availability information could go into the dom

[17:13:03.0000] <adu>
Philip`: have you heard of glitz?

[17:13:04.0000] <nessy>
but we access the data through callbacks

[17:13:05.0000] <roc>
glitz is toast

[17:14:00.0000] <roc>
Chris Lord is working on a Gecko port for use with Clutter

[17:14:01.0000] <roc>
it's supposed to be working pretty well

[17:14:02.0000] <rillianbis>
nessy: does it help to split it into two use cases? (a) I want notification when there's a new subtitle, and (b) I want all the subtitles to dump in a transcript

[17:14:03.0000] <Philip`>
adu: For Cairo?

[17:15:00.0000] <adu>
Philip`: yeah, doesn't Gecko use Cairo since ff3?

[17:15:01.0000] <adu>
gecko -> cairo -> glitz -> opengl

[17:16:00.0000] <adu>
maybe I'm missing something

[17:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
adu: It seems to be much harder to make that kind of thing work in practice, sadly :-)

[17:16:02.0000] <roc>
you're just missing that glitz is unmaintained and broken

[17:16:03.0000] <adu>
Philip`: I'll do it

[17:16:04.0000] <adu>
roc: sounds like so many beautiful projects

[17:17:00.0000] <rillianbis>
rock, nessy: anyway, thanks for the brainstorm.

[17:17:01.0000] <rillianbis>
/me is off to dinner

[17:17:02.0000] <nessy>
rillianbis: not sure, really

[17:17:03.0000] <nessy>
rillianbis: enjoy :)

[17:17:04.0000] <roc>
a good quality GL backend for cairo is something everyone wants but no-one has gotten around to doing yet. Once we have one, getting Gecko working on it should be easy

[17:17:05.0000] <nessy>
yeah - I will go map existing formats to html, I think that's the first step

[17:17:06.0000] <nessy>
we will see the next :)

[17:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess there are all sorts of problems with trying to integrate input events and timers and stuff with the rest of the application when you're trying to embed it, and it should all be cross-platform and ideally add zero size to the application

[17:19:00.0000] <roc>
and popup windows

[17:19:01.0000] <roc>
and plugins

[17:19:02.0000] <roc>
there are lots of issues :-)

[17:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
http://ajeanius.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/awesomium-google-chrome-hacked/ seems like what I want, except it's Windows-only

[17:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't care about plugins :-)

[17:55:00.0000] <adu>
i like the sound of Clutter

[17:55:01.0000] <adu>
i wonder why I never heard of this before

[18:04:00.0000] <fakeolliej>
Philip`: sigh, i find blogs like that depressing -- a lot of the "kick-ass" API has always been in WebKit, but people seem to love claiming the google somehow invented all of it

[18:08:00.0000] <roc>
what I currently find unfair is the current crop of news articles comparing browser JS performance that compare Chrome to Safari 3.2

[18:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
olliej: I guess it'd be nice if people could actually use that WebKit API directly, without getting stuck by the lack of a decent open source Win32 port :-)

[18:14:00.0000] <adu>
roc: whats wrong with that comparison?

[18:15:00.0000] <roc>
Chrome is in beta (and so is FF3.1, which they also compared against), so they should have compared against a beta Safari or ToT Webkit

[18:17:00.0000] <roc>
it's especially tickly because when you compare Chrome against Safari 3.2 you're comparing new-Webkit vs old-Webkit, so to some extent you're using Apple's hard work to beat up their own browser

[18:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I reckon Adam Barth might be amenable to editing the Origin header ID, if you wanted to spread the work out a bit.

[18:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
though I do realize it's not going to be a big draft

[18:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: yeah, he said he's also willing to do the sniffing stuff

[18:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool

[18:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: as i understand it chrome is using a really old webkit, btw, so actually it probably cuts both ways :-)

[18:25:00.0000] <roc>
not that old

[18:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: who knows, maybe he'd like it enough to volunteer to edit some other spec. Though why anyone would actually like spec editing is beyond me... :)

[18:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: the girls

[18:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[18:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I forgot about that part

[18:27:00.0000] <roc>
the POWER

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's the implementors who have the power, not the spec writers :-(

[18:33:00.0000] <roc>
no, we are slaves to your will

[18:35:00.0000] <adu>
roc: well, Chrome isn't all WebKit, its also got some XPI stuff

[18:35:01.0000] <roc>
sure

[18:35:02.0000] <roc>
I inserted some appropriate weasel words

[18:35:03.0000] <adu>
roc: from what I hear its a mozilla-webkit cyber-child

[18:36:00.0000] <roc>
not really

[18:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thought it was more along the lines of being WebKit plus some anti-phishing code that Google originally contributed to Mozilla, but he has almost exactly zero real knowledge and is probably totally wrong

[18:41:00.0000] <roc>
that's close

[18:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's close to totally wrong? :-)

[18:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
spec writers are "the unacknowledged legislators of the world"..

[18:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
also, "I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!"

[18:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: btw if you have opinions on http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/obsolete-features.html#conformance-checkers-0 it would be good to hear them :-)

[18:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: I like how search engines allow me to understand literary references despite being an uneducated oaf who's never read any of those things

[18:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: the Web has really taken a lot of the fun out of things. no longer possible to stump anybody with references to literary works, even relatively obscure stuff

[18:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I remember years ago taking this quiz where the questions were all the final lines of poems

[18:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and you had to figure out what poems they were from

[18:49:03.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: You'll have to start paraphrasing, so people can't just do the obvious searches

[18:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if you didn't know, you had to figure out how to find them. in books

[18:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: yeah

[18:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
not sure how to paraphrase "I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!"

[18:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: dunno you if saw my note here earlier, but David Carlisle updated the "XML Entity definitions for Characters" draft to include the set of "html5-uppercase" names

[18:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007doc/html5-uppercase.html

[18:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i saw

[18:51:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007doc/byalpha.html

[18:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
wasn't sure whether that affected us or not

[18:51:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[18:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't change the spec, right?

[18:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: no

[18:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll find out when i next run my regen script

[18:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
since it pulls the file automatically each time :-)

[18:52:04.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: You could adapt the message to the medium, and say "/me falls upon the thorns of life, and bleeds!"

[18:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
ok. time to go eat. bbl.

[18:52:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: :)

[18:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: fwiw, I notice that http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007doc/byalpha.html links to image files for all the characters

[18:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that seems like a better way than actually including the images in the doc itself

[18:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
not if I do it the way I was intending to have the images load dynamically within the page as when needed, rather than all at once

[18:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/as when/when/

[19:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: anyway, you had mentioned need to have images available under a license that allowed you to use them. so those would seem to be

[19:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
though again, it seems to me the existence of http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007doc/byalpha.html possibly obviates the need to include the list in other specs, since that can just be referenced

[19:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but that said, I'd definitely be interested in seeing what you put together

[19:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
they seem to be quite small though

[19:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[19:09:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
true

[19:09:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
dunno why they don't make em bigger

[19:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: http://www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?search=z+with+caron has some bigger ones

[19:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it is missing many

[19:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
plus they are GIFs

[19:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, decodeunicode.org also has images available, but I'm not sure of the licences

[21:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just use the fonts

[21:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
after all if the user doesn't have an appropriate font installed, he probably won't use the character

[00:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: are there issues with referencing RFC 5322 instead of RFC 2822?

[00:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
do we reference either?

[00:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
what are they?

[00:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
e-mail something or other?

[00:09:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, e-mail

[00:09:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
RFC 5322 is intended to obsolete 2822

[00:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.2.3

[00:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
they seem to define "dot-atom" identically

[00:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#valid-e-mail-address

[00:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
you have:

[00:12:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
""A valid e-mail address is a string that matches the production dot-atom "@" dot-atom where dot-atom is defined in RFC 2822 section 3.2.4, excluding the CFWS production everywhere. [RFC2822]"

[00:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: do you recall why you didn't just spec it as needing to match the "addr-spec" production?

[00:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
..with qualifications about CWFS and FWS

[00:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's what http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MicrosyntaxDescriptions#email has

[00:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and so I'd suspect that's what validator.nu is checking at least

[00:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: production for "dtext" in RFC 5322 is more liberal than in RFC 2822

[00:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
[[

[00:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
   dtext           =   %d33-90 /          ; Printable US-ASCII

[00:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
                       %d94-126 /         ;  characters not including

[00:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
                       obs-dtext          ;  "[", "]", or "\"

[00:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
]]

[00:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
addr-spec doesn't match user expectations

[00:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[00:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. iirc something like this matches addr-spec:    "foo" (bar) @ foo.com

[00:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
meaning foo⊙fc

[00:21:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[00:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
and then you can start introducing escapes and all kinds of stuff

[00:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[00:22:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
would be good to find out from hsivonen what precisely validator.nu checks for

[00:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems like it might need to be more strict, if it's to match the spec

[00:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
the spec recently changed relative to wf2

[00:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
so he might not have updated to that

[00:23:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[00:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I think he's not updated a number of things that changed since the WF2 integration

[00:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: anyway, fwiw, I think if you're just directly referencing dot-atom only there, I think you could safely reference RFC 5322 instead if you cared to

[00:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
k, send mail or file a bug or something

[00:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't plan to update references until CR

[00:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
or at least LC

[00:28:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[00:28:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
will just raise it in bugzilla for now

[02:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Is there a document of some kind that mandates American spelling in international standards? Or is it just understood? 

[02:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me hopes no such document exists

[02:20:01.0000] <hallvors>
(won't new standards be en-GB-hixie from now? :-p)

[02:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, for Internet standards at least -- RFCs and W3C Recs -- the observed practice is to use American spellings

[02:22:01.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, HTML5 is en-US-x-Hixie

[02:22:02.0000] <annevk5>
mostly because the W3C style guide or some such requires it

[02:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[02:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
guess I should actually read that

[02:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wonder if the IETF has a style guide

[02:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#Spelling

[02:35:00.0000] <annevk5>
zcorpan, free tonight?

[02:35:01.0000] <annevk5>
/me will be in Linköping around 10:30PM or so

[02:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk5: maybe

[02:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk5, zcorpan : I think David Storey may be there. If he run into him, tell him I said hi

[02:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I know he's in Sweden, anyway

[02:49:00.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, he's there already? interesting

[02:49:01.0000] <annevk5>
MikeSmith, I know I've a meeting with him tomorrow :)

[02:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that he is also in Linköping :p

[02:59:00.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, it's not like you have time, right? :p

[03:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, http://simon.html5.org/html5-elements shows up blank in ie8 unless in compat view

[03:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder why

[03:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
double-colon syntax for pseudo-elements still doesn't work in ie8

[03:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"From the 43 selectors 22 have passed, 1 are buggy and 20 are unsupported (Passed 349 out of 578 tests)"

[03:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, your phone number is not on the intranet

[03:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
most of the html5 spec is blank in compat view

[03:18:00.0000] <roc>
in compat view? really?

[03:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[03:19:01.0000] <roc>
that doesn't sound very compat

[03:19:02.0000] <annevk5>
http://twitter.com/diveintomark/status/1049747857 :)

[03:19:03.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: 

[03:19:04.0000] <jgraham>
Je n'ai pas de téléphone

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
you realize you're learning the wrong language for Sweden right? :)

[03:21:01.0000] <zcorpan>
oops, acid3 made ie8 crash

[03:22:00.0000] <annevk5>
jgraham, I'm pretty sure that at some point (midnight prolly) we go to the pub close to the office

[03:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk5: That sounds pretty late. 

[03:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me likes sleeping

[03:22:03.0000] <annevk5>
guess we'll see you tomorrow then :)

[03:22:04.0000] <zcorpan>
depending on whether i click "yes" or "no" on all the various promts that i get on acid3, i get somewhere between 12/100, a crash, or 21/100

[03:22:05.0000] <annevk5>
/me will sleep on the train

[03:23:00.0000] <annevk5>
we arrive at 10:30PM and need to get some food at that point... so it would be relatively early

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: html5-elements seems to work perfectly well for me in IE8

[03:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
oh actually, i just either get a crash or 21/100

[03:24:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: in compat view?

[03:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me has to go grapple with the Swedish banking system now :(

[03:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: No, in normal view

[03:25:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: i get that too. try compat view

[03:25:02.0000] <zcorpan>
oh wait

[03:25:03.0000] <zcorpan>
that's weird

[03:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
well it's blank for me in normal view

[03:26:01.0000] <zcorpan>
after the script has run

[03:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
Actually, it doesn't quite work - clicking the fragment links in the frame on the left doesn't scroll the frame on the right

[03:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, but clicking the fragment links in the frame on the right doesn't work either

[03:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: do you have the "automatically recover from page layout errors with compat view" setting checked?

[03:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: It looks like I do

[03:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
(so that must be the default)

[03:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
apparently it renders html5-elements in compat view if that setting is checked

[03:31:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder how it works

[03:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notices that 'border:thin solid' is 1px in normal view but 2px in compat view

[03:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
typing javascript:'asdf' in the address field brings up ie6 with a dialog "Internet Explorer cannot download. Unidentified error. [ OK ]"

[03:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
live dom viewer works again

[03:38:00.0000] <Lachy_>
zcorpan, Chris Wilson told me when I asked him about the double-colon pseudo-elements at TPAC that it was too late for support to be added to IE8

[03:38:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i filed a bug about it during ie7b2 iirc

[03:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Oh, that compat view thing sounds not confusing at all

[03:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: ?

[03:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I mean the automatically recovering from page layout errors with compat view thing)

[03:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
(And by "not confusing at all", I mean the exact opposite)

[03:41:02.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[03:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
if their goal was to make pages render in random ways depending on a bazillion factors (including user settings), they've succeeded

[03:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Then they can simplify it all by just rendering every page in compat view

[03:44:01.0000] <zcorpan>
even when ie7 isn't used anymore, authors will have to test their pages against both normal view and compat view

[04:18:00.0000] <hallvors>
anyone here knows Gecko's ecma engine well? It seems to include elided properties when enumerating an array with for..in, I wonder if that is a known bug?

[04:28:00.0000] <hallvors>
I've looked stuff up in the spec, it seems to be a clear bug and IE/Opera/Safari all disagree with Firefox and do what the spec says. (by my reading of it anyway). Can't find it in bugzilla though.

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk5>
you might have better luck with this question at 10PM or so

[04:29:01.0000] <annevk5>
or on irc.mozilla.org :)

[04:32:00.0000] <hallvors>
good point about the time <:-)

[04:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me is on a bug hunt for validator.w3.org's html5 integration

[04:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6301

[08:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries the performance tests from http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/03/30/python-html-parser-performance/ and gets very similar results except that modern html5lib is maybe 15-20% faster now

[08:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Amazon S3 seems to have a peculiar approach to the namespacing of storage buckets

[08:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
in that it doesn't do any namespacing at all - you just have to try to pick a name that nobody else has used yet

[08:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/etc/passwd taken?

[08:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: No - it's limited to [a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{2,254}

[08:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Actually it's apparently more like (?!\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{2,254} but that detail doesn't seem to be explicitly specified)

[09:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
one nice thing about SRT is that it's super-simple to map to a calback API, since the data maps to unstructured JS strings

[09:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders, Hixie: http://pimpmyspec.net/

[09:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Bug reports and feature requests about the web ui shouldn't be!

[09:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yes they should :)

[09:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
:-p

[09:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: But I can't fix them!

[09:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
You can decide if they are important enough to bother me with :)

[09:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I changed it since I guess that was a bug report :-p

[09:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Just give my email there

[09:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
that means looking for your email address

[09:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>

[09:49:00.0000] <jgraham>

Yes

Maybe it doesn't support redirects

[10:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has no idea of the cause of the bug

[10:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It works here, so bug is with jgraham and HTTP fetching

Do blackberries come with a RIM-developed browser?

[11:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is a bit surprised to learn about the -rim- CSS prefix

[11:12:00.0000] <gavin>
I think they do have their own browser, yeah

[11:12:01.0000] <gavin>
I've heard it's quite crappy

http://na.blackberry.com/eng/support/docs/subcategories/?userType=21&category=BlackBerry+Browser

[11:19:00.0000] <smedero>
judging from the Opera Mobile numbers they release every month, a lot of BlackBerry users are installing Opera Mini.

[12:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
no wai.

[12:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's with the low amount of mail these days

[12:48:00.0000] <takkaria>
you complaining?

[12:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes!

[12:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
where are the entertaining flames?

[12:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
where are the e-mails of people saying things i disagree with that spur me into replying?

[12:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
whenever i go more than 5 minutes without e-mail, i assume my mail delivery is broken

[12:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: what do you think about my thoughts on handling foreign content?

[12:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
which thoughts were yours again?

[12:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
(i briefly scanned the various e-mails on that thread and saved them for later)

[12:53:03.0000] <zcorpan>
making svg <script> a cdata element

[12:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Dec/0134.html

[12:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[12:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
like i told mike? hsivonen? i don't recall. but either way. like i said earlier: we can do many things that make svg-in-text/html simpler

[12:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is getting it past the svgwg

[12:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
their goals aren't compatible with making things simpler than they are now

[12:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
(assuming i've understood their goals correctly)

[12:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
(and ignoring the goals they say they have but that they haven't met in their own proposals)

[12:56:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess i should go back to ignore the issue and see how it folds

[12:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's my plan

[12:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
at least until i hear back from svg

[13:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i will invent a new exception code for calling a script in a frozen script execution environment or a script freed after document.open()

[14:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Should I try sending an email asking for the XML serialization to be removed?

[14:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I'm sure that would get some traffic on the list.

that you're in a hole

[14:21:02.0000] <jcranmer>
that you dug it

[14:21:03.0000] <jcranmer>
or that you didn't notice?

[14:21:04.0000] <jcranmer>
er, s/(?<!?)$/,/g

[14:22:00.0000] <jcranmer>
pretend that ? was a \?... :-(

[14:22:01.0000] <takkaria>
which one? :)

[14:22:02.0000] <jcranmer>
in the regex

[14:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
that i was digging it

[14:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was happily building some scaffolding

[14:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
when i discovered it had in fact been a mine's support structure

[14:58:00.0000] <Dorward>
Hi. I seem to recall that Google did a survey of webpages to see what constructs were commonly used as part of their HTML5 work. I can't find it though, can anyone give me a pointer? Thanks.

[15:00:00.0000] <hasather>
Dorward: http://code.google.com/webstats/index.html

[15:01:00.0000] <Dorward>
hsivonen: Fantastic. Thanks very much.

[15:02:00.0000] <hasather>
Dorward: there's also Opera's MAMA for similar stuff: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama/

[15:03:00.0000] <Dorward>
hasather: I've already checked that out - didn't have the data I was looking for :(

[15:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dorward: http://philip.html5.org/data.html has various bits of data but maybe nothing relevant

[15:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
woohoo!

[15:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me elevates his aforementioned mine support structure

[15:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dorward: what data are you looking for?

[15:08:00.0000] <Dorward>
Hixie: Proportion of documents with an XHTML Doctype that are valid/invalid and served as each of the acceptable mime types for XHTML. 

[15:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think i published those numbers

[15:09:00.0000] <Dorward>
Hixie: It doesn't look like you did :)

[15:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
but iirc in one study i did application/xhtml was 0.0044%, xhtml as text/xml or application/xml wasn't visible at all, and xhtml was about 15% of all text/html

[15:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me only looked at a hundred thousand pages so he doesn't have enough non-text/html content to get any useful numbers

[15:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
(from memory, so those numbers are likely wrong, but they're in the right ballpark)

[15:09:04.0000] <Dorward>
Hixie: Thanks

[15:10:00.0000] <Dorward>
Hixie: May I quote you (with your proviso)?

[15:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i used the namespace as the trigger though, not the doctype, iirc

[15:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
for detecting xhtml in text/html, i mean

[15:10:03.0000] <Dorward>
Yup

[15:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
sure, quote away

[15:10:05.0000] <Dorward>
Thanks

[15:10:06.0000] <Hixie>
but like i said, these numbers are likely somewhat bogus

[15:10:07.0000] <Hixie>
and it was a year or more ago now

[15:10:08.0000] <Dorward>
Indeed

[15:10:09.0000] <Dorward>
I doubt things will have changed a great deal since then

[15:10:10.0000] <Hixie>
so application/xhtml+xml is probably at least 0.0045% now!

[15:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
(might even be 0.2%, which i think i saw in another study i did, now that i think about it)

[15:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
(though i don't recall what that study was biased towards, so i'm not sure what that number was)

[15:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
either way application/xhtml+xml is far less common than, say, word documents

[15:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
at least in the google index

[15:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
of course it might be that the google index is biased against xhtml in some way

[15:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
though i'm not aware of such a bias

[15:12:02.0000] <Dorward>
Off the top of your head, do you know what Accept header GoogleBot outputs?

[15:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
(e.g. maybe sites that do content negotiation serve text/html to google, not application/xhtml+xml)

[15:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
not sure

[15:12:05.0000] <Hixie>
probably */* though

[15:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dorward: trying to win some argument somewhere? :-)

[15:13:01.0000] <Dorward>
That would fail to trip all those content negotiation systems that trigger on an explicit application/xhtml+xml

[15:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dorward: http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www3.wind.ne.jp/hassii/env.cgi - looks like */*

[15:14:01.0000] <Dorward>
Hixie: Someone using one of the content negotiation systems with missing q support has exploded over www-validator. I'm just trying to address his points. At the moment is he demanding a system for content negotiation that is (a) easy (b) pure Apache conf (c) doesn't involve symlinks and (d) doesn't involve multiple files for each document

[15:14:02.0000] <Dorward>
Philip`: heh. Thanks.

[15:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
content negotiation was such a mistake

[15:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
content negotiation and the content-type header both in fact where imho design mistakes of http

[15:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
we should have had a 1:1 mapping of resources to representations, and we should have used well-defined magic sequences to recognise types, so there could be no content sniffing or content-type mislabelling

[15:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
but oh well

[15:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
too late for that i guess

[15:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
s/where/were/

[15:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: How would the use of magic sequences interact with legacy file formats that don't have any unique distinguishing sequences?

[15:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
like what?

[15:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
plain text?

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
plain text would be the default fallback format

[15:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So every time a new format appears, you get binary soup in your face while each web server is updated?

[15:34:01.0000] <Dashiva>
*web browser

[15:34:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Or maybe either would do

[15:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
web servers wouldn't ever have to change to support new types under this model

[15:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
web browsers could detect binary data and treat them as we treat unknown binary data now

[15:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
(using a well-defined mechanism for detecting binary data -- it would be the fallback detection step before falling back to plain text)

[15:36:00.0000] <takkaria>
instead of hooking in to support mime types, I guess plugins would hook in for certain binary sequences?

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[15:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
similar to what file(1) does on unix, but with a normative specification and a defined detection order


2008-12-12
[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok the problem i dug myself into is now definitely tractable

[16:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i might be able to check this in soon even

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
only 8 known remaining issues with the patch

[16:30:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Where did you find all the dirt needed to fill in the hole?

[16:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i found that my aforementioned mine support structure could be used to build an above-group structure as well

[16:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: About magic sequences: What if I have e.g. a perfectly sensible plain text file (which should be opened in a text editor or displayed directly in the browser) and a perfectly sensible CSV file (which should be opened in a spreadsheet program), and they contain identical bytes?

[16:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
or what if I have a zip file containing some arbitrary data that should be downloaded and saved to disk, and an ODF file (which is structurally just a zip file) that should be opened in a word processor?

[16:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: yt?

[16:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: will DOM3 Events have Event.returnValue ?

[16:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: ODF came after the web, so it could have been designed with this structure in mind

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i agree that csv files are a minor problem

[16:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it's not like what we have now is without problems either

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
imho the problems of magic sequences are far less serious that today's problems

[16:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
and would mostly have gone away through common practice (e.g. a CSV2 format that has a blank line at the top that says "CSV") by now

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
(and text/csv wasn't registered til 2005)

[16:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to work out how to deal with the differences between DOM3 Events and what is needed for 'beforeunload'

[17:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me gets a headache trying to work out how to spec all the legacy cruft in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/src/events/nsJSEventListener.cpp (specifically ::HandleEvent)

[17:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmmmmmm

[17:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: nevermind, looks like I can get away with just having returnValue on a custom Event object

[17:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmmm... yes.... yes...

[17:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
have a custom Event object with a mustable returnValue

[17:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
and onbeforeunload would set it if it hadn't been set already

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me checks in a multi-1000 line patch to the spec 

[01:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm totally addicted to http://tetrisapp.appspot.com/

[01:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
this is getting ridiculous

[01:42:00.0000] <macnetic>
hi

[01:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
hi

[01:42:02.0000] <macnetic>
I have a question about cache-control meta tags...

[01:42:03.0000] <macnetic>
the way I read http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.1 , only one of these tags should be used

[01:43:00.0000] <macnetic>
and if private is used, you're basically telling the browser it's okay to cache, right?

[01:44:00.0000] <macnetic>
so if you first use no-cache, and then private, it wouldn't be surprising if the browser caches the page?

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
well

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
no-cache doesn't mean it shouldn't be cached

[01:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
it means it shouldn't be used without checking with the server first

[01:47:00.0000] <ap>
note that the browser can still put the page into b/f cache, which is not affected by HTTP headers

[01:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
that too

[01:50:00.0000] <macnetic>
b/f cache?

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
back-forward

[01:51:01.0000] <macnetic>
ic

[01:51:02.0000] <macnetic>
d'oh 

[01:52:00.0000] <macnetic>
but am I right that private will override other tags that's supposed to avoid caching?

[01:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can't see anything in http that specifies that

[01:53:01.0000] <macnetic>
hmm

[01:53:02.0000] <macnetic>
ok

[01:53:03.0000] <macnetic>
thanks

[01:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
http is notoriously vague about edge cases

[01:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
not as bad as html4, but still

[01:53:06.0000] <macnetic>
heh

[01:54:00.0000] <macnetic>
so implementations may vary, then?

[01:54:01.0000] <macnetic>
it just seems odd to tell the browser it can cache the page when you're trying to avoid caching...

[01:55:00.0000] <macnetic>
the scheduling software we use generates time table web pages

[01:55:01.0000] <macnetic>
when it was upgraded the browser we use starting caching the pages

[01:56:00.0000] <macnetic>
I thought maybe the addition of a private tag to the already existing no-cache tag could be the explanation...

[01:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
implementations do vary, yeah

[01:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you want to avoid caching just set Cache-Control: no-cache

[01:56:03.0000] <macnetic>
I would

[01:57:00.0000] <macnetic>
but this is shrinkwrap software :(

[01:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah well

[01:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
file a bug with your upstream provider :-)

[02:13:00.0000] <macnetic>
that's what I'm trying to do, but when I quoted the standard and gave my interpretation of no-cache/private/public, they just replied that they'd checked our server and found the clock was 20 minutes off, and when they corrected that the web pages seemed to update properly...

[02:14:00.0000] <macnetic>
even though we'd previously said that it showed info for _yesterday_

[02:14:01.0000] <macnetic>
how they made the connection between 20 minutes and yesterday I don't quite get, but... :-\

[02:14:02.0000] <macnetic>
thanks anyway!   :)

[02:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
sorry couldn't help more!

that's one thing I really like about Denmakr

[05:02:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
you don't have to buy your own cigarettes

[05:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you can just go to any restaurant and enjoy everybody else's cigarette smoke

[05:05:00.0000] <gpy>
annevk5: ah okay

[05:05:01.0000] <gpy>
MikeSmith: im not danish, im swedish, i just work here, wich is good, salarys are higher + a 40% profit in currency ;D

[05:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gpy: excellent. I bet cigarettes are cheaper there too.

[05:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in Norway you can buy half a cigarette

[05:07:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and it will only cost you 20 kroner

hsivonen: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/ needs the section on XML 1.0 updated now that 5th ed. is a REC

[10:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: yeah, it should instruct people to always target 4th ed.

[12:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
you should all play tetrisapp.appspot.com

[12:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: no

[12:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: only IE does

[12:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: other browsers allow you to tall into scripts that are "frozen" in the spec

[12:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: any other differences?

[12:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
the way onbeforeunload fires around document.open() wasn't very interoperable

[12:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
and in general this whole area is not very interoperable in the edge cases

[12:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
finding the differences should be fun...

[12:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
hahahahahahaha

[12:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
lastweekinhtml5 is funny

[12:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
given that the whatwg has more non-american involvement than american involvement

[12:39:00.0000] <jwalden>

gsnedders: i don't suppose there's any chance of getting anolis 1.2 any time soon? :-)

[02:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: It would appear not

[02:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I have a computing project to do in the next week, and an English dissertation to do in the next three

[04:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: You around?

[06:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BibTeX doesn't map to ISO 690 nicely

[06:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
BibTeX is older than ISO 690, so blame ISO :-)

[06:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Peh. :P

[06:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BibTeX is also pretty near impossible to parse

[06:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's just a load of key/value pairs - how hard can it be?

[06:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
@Preamble, the availability of LaTeX commands, the fact that complete parse errors just restart parsing at the next @…

[06:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Also @String adds some complexity

[13:30:00.0000] <ByRon21>
Hi All

[13:30:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
heycam: ByRon21

[13:30:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
oops

[13:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ByRon21: hey

[13:31:01.0000] <ByRon21>
:)

[13:31:02.0000] <ByRon21>
no problem

[13:31:03.0000] <ByRon21>
can we ask any question here

[13:31:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
sure

[13:31:05.0000] <ByRon21>
i am learning Something

[13:31:06.0000] <ByRon21>
And then i found myself here

[13:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
what was the Something?

[13:32:01.0000] <ByRon21>
Clickjacking

[13:32:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
ah

[13:32:03.0000] <ByRon21>
or Camjacking

[13:32:04.0000] <ByRon21>
Did u watch Jeremiah's Video?

[13:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
no

[13:33:01.0000] <ByRon21>
ok

[13:35:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
so what was your question?

[13:35:01.0000] <ByRon21>
For Example

[13:36:00.0000] <ByRon21>
i have One Swf

[13:36:01.0000] <ByRon21>
Mic.swf

[13:36:02.0000] <ByRon21>
it is asking To Enable Mic or not

[13:38:00.0000] <ByRon21>
if He click Enable How can it possible to record Sound?

[13:38:01.0000] <ByRon21>
is it possible

[14:24:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: is it intentional to not mark up the whole of "must not" and "should not"? why are "required", "recommended" and "optional" not marked up?

[14:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me disables font-variant in his user style sheet

[14:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was just experimenting with the style

[14:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not keeping it

[14:33:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[14:34:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe the sentence regarding rfc2119 should comment out more keywords that are used in the spec but intended to be non-normative

[14:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
are any of them not used?

[14:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
other than shall?

[14:37:01.0000] <jcranmer>
zcorpan_: the reader MAY construe the following words to have unspecified meanings

[14:37:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
they are used, but don't seem to be intended as normative

[14:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
if they are used in inappropriate ways, please let me know

[14:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
they are intended to all be used per 2119

[14:38:02.0000] <jcranmer>
RFC 2119 must be the most-cited RFC

[14:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
i should probably fix the use of optional a bit

[14:39:00.0000] <jcranmer>
sorry, RFC 2119 MUST be the most-cited RFC :-)

[14:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
but even optional seems correct to me

[14:40:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: do you consider it a mistake if a keyword is used in a comment?

[14:40:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
er

[14:40:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
note

[14:42:00.0000] <annevk5>
it's a mistake

[14:42:01.0000] <annevk5>
notes are non-normative

[14:44:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: i find it easier to follow requirements if only the keywords must, must not, should, should not and may are used, and the other keywords carry no normative weight... but maybe it's just me

[15:36:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: added exception 23

[15:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: yeah i should probably only use must/should/may. and yeah, in notes would be an error.

Hixie, there's an example in the spec for the <mark> element using a <style> element that needs a scoped attribute. http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-mark-element

[12:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
well on the plus side if this OpenService idea takes off, it seems easy to implement in other browsers

[12:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what's the OpenService idea?

[12:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
ie8's accelerator thingies 

[12:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I haven't heard about those yet

[12:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
really? they've been pimping them out for months now

[12:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
I haven't paid much attention to IE

[12:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
makes using IE8 a pain; every time you select somethin, a block comes up overlapping some of the text

[12:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, that's that crappy feature I disable as much as I can

[01:27:00.0000] <yecril71>
I think making confirm() throw on interrupt would be both user-friendly and implementation-friendly.

[01:27:01.0000] <yecril71>
It would not address all cases of abuse but it would be good enough for the average case.

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
if the idea is to stop abuse, then the average case is automatically whatever isn't addressed

annevk5: thx!

[06:44:00.0000] <takkaria>
zcorpan: I thought that his funding for doing W3 work had dried up, or something along those lines

[06:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
takkaria: ok

[06:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
DanC's still putting time into the group

[06:51:00.0000] <rubys>
I'm sure that I will lean a lot on DanC and Mike and Chris too for help.  In particular, I don't know a lot about W3C processes.

[06:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me flinches involuntarily at mention of the word "processes"

[06:54:01.0000] <smedero>
MikeSmith: There was talk (@TPAC) of making some of the internal W3C documents on processes and such available to the public... how's that moving along? (or, are you even in the loop on such things)

[06:57:00.0000] <smedero>
I thought it might be good to have material like that available for educational purposes to non-members... as the html-wg spends a lot of cycles churning through perceived process issues (when I suspect it is much-to-do-about-nothing.)

[07:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
smedero: So, to paraphrase "the html-wg ... it is a much-to-do-about-nothing" ;)

[07:00:01.0000] <smedero>
yeah. :-/

[07:01:00.0000] <smedero>
in the past i've had occasional blips of free cycles (hard to make as a working parent of a two year old) and then you open up the public-html firehose and it sucks the life out of you.

[07:02:00.0000] <smedero>
that said

[07:02:01.0000] <smedero>
i've pretty much learned to turn my attention to things like http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-commits/

[07:02:02.0000] <smedero>
or twitter.com/whatwg 

[07:02:03.0000] <smedero>
or this channel

[07:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me 's IRC logs for this channel are 22MB, which indicates quite a lot of time spent reading :-/

[07:20:00.0000] <rubys>
How many bytes are left after you remove all of the "xyzzy entered the room" type messages?

[07:20:01.0000] <billyjackass>
smedero: sorry, my network connection gone into vapor lock

[07:20:02.0000] <billyjackass>
I typed this before I realized I was talking to myself:

[07:20:03.0000] <billyjackass>
<MikeSmith> smedero: I don't remember discussion about making that non-member, but I have to say that looking over it, I can't see much there that seems like it really needs to be member-only

[07:20:04.0000] <billyjackass>
<MikeSmith> I do see a few things that aren't so up-to-date... e.g., a link to "W3C XML Specification DTD (XMLspec), well-supported by Norman Walsh."

[07:20:05.0000] <billyjackass>
<MikeSmith> I don't think Norm would want it being advertised that he's the support resource for XMLspec

[07:20:06.0000] <billyjackass>
<MikeSmith> I'm not sure he's even using XMLspec any longer himself

[07:20:07.0000] <billyjackass>
<MikeSmith> anyway, perhaps part of the reason for not flipping the switch on making it public is that somebody'd need to go in there and review stuff like that and bring it up to date

[07:20:08.0000] <billyjackass>
<MikeSmith> definitely "somebody" in the sense of "not me"

[07:21:00.0000] <smedero>
hehehehe

[07:22:00.0000] <billyjackass>
hmm, http://www.w3.org/2008/10/GuideBook.html says, "This page is Member-only".. but it's a liar

[07:27:00.0000] <rubys>
Lachy: I've scrolled back in the archives and caught up... you have concerns?  Care to discuss?

[07:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: 14MB if I strip all that out, so it's still quite a bit

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and 12MB if I remove timestamps and usernames)

[07:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and 4.5MB if I then gzip it, so I guess we're not repeating ourselves too much)

[07:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: UTF-8?

[07:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Of course

[07:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, I assume it is)

[07:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and nobody talks in Unicode enough to make a real difference)

[07:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It would make a difference if it was UTF-32

[07:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
(particularly since I've already got a margin of error of about 1024*1024/1000*1000 when I'm reporting these MB values)

[07:34:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: True

[07:34:04.0000] <Philip`>
but irssi is not totally insane :-)

[07:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, my general concern is that you could abuse your power as chair to overrule the editor to get your own way, especially on controversial issues, rather than remaining objective and basing decisions on evidence.

[07:41:00.0000] <smedero>
Lachy: From my POV at least, Sam's actions in other standards bodies and open source software projects don't suggest that such behavior is typical for him.

[07:44:00.0000] <smedero>
(that is, abusing power)

[07:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
Cloud computing people really need to work out a better way of advertising their CPU offerings - it's quite hard to compare "1 EC2 Compute Unit" ("equivalent CPU capacity of a 1.0-1.2 GHz 2007 Opteron or 2007 Xeon processor"), a quarter of "1 Xeon core (equivalent to a P4 2.0 chip)", and "1 CPU"

[07:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
The first of those is sufficiently detailed, but then it kind of goes downhill

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me decides instead to compare the offerings based inversely on the number of stock photos of smiling women and reflections on their web site, and EC2 wins

[08:02:00.0000] <rubys>
Lachy: I'm back (sorry -- had to take a call).  I'm pleased with smedero's comments.

[08:02:01.0000] <rubys>
I don't believe that leaders that abuse their power work last very long

[08:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, right.

[08:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
let's see how long you last then :-)

[08:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
rubys, have you published a list of what specific aspects you consider to be "overlap" between XHTML2WG and HTMLWG?

[08:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
if not, doing so might alleviate some of the FUD :)

[08:07:00.0000] <yecril71>
Why are data-attributes better than scripts? 

[08:08:00.0000] <yecril71>
Do they make it through the sanitizer or what?

[08:08:01.0000] <rubys>
my main concern is the "core vocabulary"

[08:10:00.0000] <takkaria>
yecril71: they're attributes for use in scripts, so I don't quite understand what you mean

[08:10:01.0000] <yecril71>
Instead of saying data=attribute="sometext"

[08:10:02.0000] <yecril71>
I would rather say <SCRIPT TYPE="text/plain" >sometext</SCRIPT >

[08:10:03.0000] <takkaria>
well, they don't achieve the same thing

[08:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: How would you associate that script with an element?

[08:11:01.0000] <yecril71>
firstChild

[08:12:00.0000] <yecril71>
(or, for empty elements, nextSibling)

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: data-* would be associated with an element like <h1 data-reflection-colour="#ff00ff" data-reflection-height="20">My Page</h1> - how would you write something like that with <script>?

[08:15:00.0000] <yecril71>
reflection=colour=#FF00FF&reflection-height=20

[08:15:01.0000] <yecril71>
reflection-colour=#FF00FF&reflection-height=20

[08:15:02.0000] <takkaria>
as in <h1><script type="text/plain">reflection-color=#FF00FF&reflection-height=20</script>My Page</h1>?

[08:16:00.0000] <yecril71>
That is my idea, although I would rather use text/xml.

[08:16:01.0000] <takkaria>
because doing it that way makes it harder to use, since everyone has to write their own parser and serialiser to write to the <script> tag

[08:17:00.0000] <takkaria>
also, for elements which start off with no data- attributes and get some during script execution, scripts would have to create an element and insert it rather than just setting an attribute

[08:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
They would rather change an existing SCRIPT element, that would be provided specifically for the purpose.

[08:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
And you'd have to do something different for empty elements like <hr>, or for elements which can only contain text like <script> or <style> or <textarea>

[08:19:00.0000] <yecril71>
hr: nextSibling

[08:19:01.0000] <yecril71>
Script content is usually expressive enough; there is no need to hook additional data into the element.

[08:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
That sounds like an awful lot of effort and special-casing for no added value compared to just using attributes

[08:20:00.0000] <yecril71>
<textarea > can be served by input[type="hidden"]

[08:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and using <script> for storing data rather than script code seems like a hack)

[08:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
((though it's a hack that HTML5 explicitly allows))

[08:20:03.0000] <yecril71>
Except that noone is really going to do that for all the elements at the same time.

[08:20:04.0000] <takkaria>
but if you want to set attributes on elements, it seems much more sensible to set attributes on elements rather than create/maniplate the text value of various different hidden elements differently depending on the element you're manipulating

[08:21:00.0000] <yecril71>
But these attributes are only relevant to a script, arent�t they?

[08:22:00.0000] <yecril71>
So it seems natural to use SCRIPT for script data.

[08:23:00.0000] <yecril71>
Most programming languages allow both code and data to be specified, with Pascal as a notable exception.

[08:23:01.0000] <takkaria>
that's one argument, but if you look at what a pain in the arse doing it that way is compared to setting attributes on elements, perhaps you'll see why the latter is codified in the spec

[08:24:00.0000] <yecril71>
So is the former, I only asked about the advantages of it.

[08:24:01.0000] <takkaria>
not to mention that if you tell people to use an overcomplicated system when they could just set attributes, they'll just set attributes anyway, since it will be more efficient

[08:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looking at some of the blog comments from when data-* was added to the spec, it seems quite a lot of people were already using custom attributes to store element-specific data

[08:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and I'd done that on two separate HTML application things too)

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
so it's nice to pave that cowpath :-)

[08:26:01.0000] <yecril71>
It was my first idea when I encountered this problem but then I realized I can do it more consistently.

[08:27:00.0000] <yecril71>
I am not questioning them being supported; they are just not better from my POV.

[08:28:00.0000] <yecril71>
So I was interested if anybody here actually considers them better and why.

[08:29:00.0000] <yecril71>
And parsing a query string should really be on the DOM, IMHO.

[08:29:01.0000] <yecril71>
Something like record = document.parseQuery(query).

[08:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
decodeURIComponent?

[08:30:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm maybe not

[08:30:02.0000] <yecril71>
That does not return an arbitrary record.

[08:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
but parsing/serialising will be very slow compared to setting attributes

[08:33:00.0000] <yecril71>
It depends what the script really wants to do with the data.

[08:34:00.0000] <yecril71>
It can actually be quicker than going through a module boundary.

[08:34:01.0000] <yecril71>
(which is required to access a DOM property from script)

[10:22:00.0000] <MathiasBynens>
Oi

[10:26:00.0000] <MathiasBynens>
I was wondering if it's possible to use horizontal scrollbars to scroll through a list of images. Similar to http://monsieurlagent.com/works.php (after clicking one of the navigation links on the left), but using CSS instead of an IFRAME. Any ideas?

[10:27:00.0000] <MathiasBynens>
The only solution I see at the moment, is giving the parent element of the images a fixed width of x pixels, but that's not very flexible.

[10:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How would it trigger scrolling if it didn't have a set width?

[10:33:00.0000] <Dorward>
MathiasBynens: white-space: nowrap; perhaps?

[10:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
MathiasBynens: Using something like <div style="overflow: auto">?

[10:37:00.0000] <MathiasBynens>
Thanks Dorward! Exactly what I was looking for. :$

[10:39:00.0000] <MathiasBynens>
Philip: Yeah, you're right as well. The combination of overflow: auto and white-space: nowrap applied on the element containing the list of images did the job.

[10:39:01.0000] <MathiasBynens>
Thanks everyone!

[14:23:00.0000] <heycam>
oh i only just noticed the pretty stars in the margin

[14:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
they're temporary

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
just a proof of concept really

[14:24:01.0000] <heycam>
in the end you won't typographically distinguish rfc2119 stuff?

[14:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt it

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not convinced it helps

[14:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's what i was trying to test with the current changes

[14:25:02.0000] <heycam>
it probably doesn't, if you don't reuse those rfc2119 keywords in the regular sense

[14:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[14:25:04.0000] <heycam>
but the stars do look pretty against the whatwg green :)

[14:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh it looks cool, certainly

[14:25:06.0000] <Hixie>
christmassy and everything

[14:25:07.0000] <heycam>
haha

[14:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've had people criticise the spec for being "as colourful as a christmas tree" before -- i thought this would be a fitting response

[14:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me isn't a christmas fan, but sees nothing wrong with making the spec colourful

[14:26:02.0000] <heycam>
judicious use of colour is a good thing

[15:02:00.0000] <jacobolus>
what would this mean, practically? "each of us personally would like to see the XHTML2 and HTML groups brought together or at least the overlaps removed."

[15:02:01.0000] <jacobolus>
in http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/12/15/Co-Chair-HTML-WG

[15:03:00.0000] <jacobolus>
is that just xhtml2 guys being sad at being irrelevant, and wanting to do something useful?

[15:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno, ask rubys :-)

[15:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh that reminds me

[15:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: i just added the following to that status document:

[15:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
 - the xhtml2 wg has an outstanding action item to suggest some text

[15:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
   for our "relationship with xhtml" section

[15:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh also, the w3c team (specifically plh) has an action to get the spec's license changed to something more open to reuse and derivations (e.g. creative commons)

[15:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
updated the whatwg.org/status-2008-12 document

[15:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: (i think rubys said he had a meeting or something, so he might not be around to respond)

[15:17:00.0000] <jacobolus>
no worries


2008-12-16
[17:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: about workers changes just checked -- are they based on an particular feedback, or just refinements?

[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
they're knock-on effects of all the work on scripts i did last week

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me ponders how to define the structured-data-over-postMessage() stuff

[17:34:00.0000] <rubys>
jacobolus: I can't honestly speculate as to the reasons... to be clear: I initiated the conversation, this was not something that they initiated.

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders if that conversation is archived anywhere

[17:45:00.0000] <rubys>
nope, that was email from me to the two individuals I mentioned, and I'm sharing the response.

[17:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[17:58:00.0000] <sicking_>
Hixie, fwiw, what we implemented is slightly different from what my mail says

[17:58:01.0000] <sicking_>
Hixie, due to weirdness in the JSON format

[17:58:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, what we do is this:

[17:59:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, create a JS object with the following value:    { para: X }  (where X was the value passed to postMessage)

[17:59:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, serialize using JSON.stringify

[17:59:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, send to destination

[18:00:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, create Y = JSON.parse(str)

[18:00:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, set event.data to Y.para

[18:00:02.0000] <jcranmer>
sicking: Hixie is not a robot!

[18:00:03.0000] <sicking>
jcranmer, or so you think

[18:01:00.0000] <jcranmer>
sicking: it's obvious... Hixie has no big red button saying "Self Destruct DO NOT PUSH"

[18:02:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, or to put it short:   event.data = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({para: X})).para;

[18:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: what i'm planning on speccing doesn't mention JSON at all, it'll just check to see if the message is safe, then clone it and pass that into the event.data

[18:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: which should be equivalent

[18:03:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, no, such a thing can include cycles, no?

[18:03:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, there is also the issue of infinite and NaN values

[18:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
i will throw an exception if a cycle is detected

[18:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
i plan to support JS types natively

[18:03:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders about the effects on property ordering

[18:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
booleans, Numbers, etc

[18:04:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, ugh, that means that we can't use the JSON serializer to send cross processes :(

[18:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: well i can always do something else

[18:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: what should i do with Infinity and NaN?

[18:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
JSON sucks

[18:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's worse than XML :-)

[18:04:05.0000] <sicking>
indeed

[18:04:06.0000] <sicking>
well..

[18:05:00.0000] <sicking>
it errs in the wrong direction

[18:05:01.0000] <sicking>
it sucks less than XML, but it sucks nontheless

[18:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
it would suck less than XML if it defined comment syntax and defined error handling syntax

[18:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
er, error handling rules

[18:06:00.0000] <sicking>
ah

[18:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[18:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
the syntax doesn't matter here

[18:06:03.0000] <sicking>
true

[18:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
what should i do for NaN an company?

[18:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
and for property ordering, as Philip` mentions?

[18:07:00.0000] <sicking>
so i don't care super much, but if you want JSON parity you want this:

[18:07:01.0000] <sicking>
1. non-finite numbers are turned into null

[18:07:02.0000] <sicking>
2. properties with the value 'undefined' are removed

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
is that the value |undefined| or the value |"undefined"|?

[18:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how to do this in a language-agnostic manner

[18:09:00.0000] <sicking>
|undefined|

[18:09:01.0000] <jcranmer>
Hixie: series of octets with undefined contents?

[18:09:02.0000] <jcranmer>
s/undefined/unspecified/

[18:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
I hope I'll be able to use VBScript to post structured data objects to a JavaScript worker

[18:10:00.0000] <jcranmer>
pth, use Malebolge to post to a Brainfuck worker :-)

[18:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: I don't think they have the concept of structured data :-p

[18:12:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i don't feel strongly regarding if NaN/Inf/Undefined should survive across postMessage though, but i'd imagine the JS people might have more of an opinion

[18:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders what happens when you call .stringify() on some of our more esoteric native objects

[18:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/on/with/

[18:13:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, good question. I *think* that it tries to enumerate all properties and stringify those, but i haven't tried. And for most DOM objects you end up with cyclic graphs

[18:13:01.0000] <roc>
it would be surprising if non-finite numbers were nuked going through postMessage

[18:14:00.0000] <sicking>
roc, agree. i was surprised they were nuked going through JSON

[18:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: it seems to call [[Get]], but it strikes me that we might well have [[Get]]ers somewhere that do pretty crazy things

[18:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me is thinking he'll just do this for JS for now and screw JSON and screw VB

[18:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
and then we'll see what feedback is like

[18:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
if implementors want JSON, then I can always change it back -- but since both of you so far have said it's surprising, i'm reluctant to do it

[18:15:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, don't quote me as having an opinion either way. I'm really undecided at this point

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i wasn't really basing it on your opinion so much as your experience (that you were surprised, as i was for that matter, when learning of JSON's quirks)

[18:17:00.0000] <sicking>
cool

[18:17:01.0000] <dave_levin>
hixie: If someone implemented this who supported VB, would it even be possible to create a VB worker?

[18:17:02.0000] <sicking>
the funny thing is that with our definition (pass {para: X} through JSON) is that |undefined| comes out correctly on the other end

[18:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: right now, no, but postMessage() isn't just for workers

[18:18:00.0000] <dave_levin>
The spec says that it is always Javascript.

[18:18:01.0000] <dave_levin>
oh ok

[18:18:02.0000] <sicking>
however { foo: undefined } comes out as {}

[18:18:03.0000] <dave_levin>
right, thx.

[18:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: heh

[18:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: also i expect we'll change that eventually. i'm just not sure how to do it (arguments to new Worker(), MIME types, something else).

[18:20:00.0000] <dave_levin>
hixie: That would be nice eventually....

[18:21:00.0000] <dave_levin>
hixie: but no desire for it anytime soon from me at least :).

[18:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well if the js group go along their current path we might be stuck with this problem sooner than either you or i like

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
because apparently they want future versions of js to not be the same language as current js

[18:26:00.0000] <blooberry>
hixie: I thought the internal factions made all nice and have backed off the major ecma facelift/overhaul plans. Or is that something else?

[18:27:00.0000] <sicking>
define "not be the same language" and "major facelife/overhaul" :)

[18:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i know the plan, long term, and possibly short term though i really have lost track of their exact plans short term, is still to invent a new language that happens to look a lot like the current language but needs out-of-band signaling to be enabled.

[18:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
much like VB vs JS in IE today, except more similar in syntax

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
much like E4X did, for that matter.

[18:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
(which was a disaster btw)

[18:28:02.0000] <sicking>
there are new keywords introduced yes, which would require some sort of signaling

[18:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
such a bad idea

[18:28:04.0000] <sicking>
not sure it's a big deal

[18:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
requiring out-of-band signaling for the web's scripting language is a losing proposition, imho.

[18:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
if it's in-band, then that's fine

[18:30:00.0000] <sicking>
note that i didn't say out-of-band or in-band

[18:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
as i understand it, the js group wants it out-of-band

[18:30:02.0000] <sicking>
did maciej propose the |use| syntax?

[18:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't followed recent developments

[18:31:01.0000] <sicking>
ok

[18:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
are arrays in JS ever sparse?

[18:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
or are they always [0..n] ?

[18:32:00.0000] <sicking>
mrbkap says yes

[18:32:01.0000] <sicking>
they are sparse

[18:33:00.0000] <sicking>
they basically work just like any other object

[18:33:01.0000] <sicking>
if you set "1" and "10" then those are the properties that exist

[18:33:02.0000] <sicking>
the exception is a magical "length" property

[18:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how JSON.stringify() handles that

[18:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks

[18:34:00.0000] <sicking>
['foo', null, null, null...., "bar"]

[18:34:01.0000] <sicking>
did I mention that JSON rocks?

[18:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i can tell that is incorrect

[18:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
it seems it returns ['foo', 'bar'] and the indicies change

[18:35:02.0000] <sicking>
i don't think that was the intent, unless things recently changed

[18:38:00.0000] <sicking>
the moz implementation inserts null

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
it says "For each index in value"

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't say anything about inventing new indicies or looking at the length as far as i can tell

[18:40:01.0000] <sicking>
looking at http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=es3.1:json_support

[18:40:02.0000] <sicking>
it first creates a |partial| array that contains all indexes

[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
you're looking at JA() right?

[18:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
JA(value)?

[18:42:01.0000] <sicking>
uh?

[18:47:00.0000] <sicking>
ah

[18:48:00.0000] <sicking>
yeah that doc looks different

[18:48:01.0000] <sicking>
not sure where i got the reference to looking at http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=es3.1:json_support

[18:48:02.0000] <sicking>
err s/looking at//

[18:48:03.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: sicking: I think sparse array syntax is [a,,,,,,b]

[18:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's not what i meant by sparse

[18:49:01.0000] <sicking>
olliej, that's not what we currently output

[18:49:02.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: what's an example of what you meant?

[18:49:03.0000] <sicking>
olliej, we == firefox3.1

[18:49:04.0000] <olliej>
sicking: oh well, js can parse that ;D

[18:49:05.0000] <olliej>
sicking: yup

[18:50:00.0000] <sicking>
olliej, apparently JSON is supposed to not be JS specific

[18:50:01.0000] <olliej>
sicking: incidentally i have drawImage(video,..) implemented in my local build of webkit :D

[18:50:02.0000] <olliej>
on canvas

[18:50:03.0000] <sicking>
olliej, hey, cool

[18:50:04.0000] <olliej>
sicking: just have some tidying to do

[18:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: can an Array object have properties '0' and '8' and nothing else?

[18:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
(well, other than 'length')

[18:50:07.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: yes

[18:52:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, ["foo",,,,,"bar"] creates such an array

[18:52:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, (in FF, dunno about specs)

[18:52:02.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: 2 in ['zero',,,,,,,,'eight']

[18:53:00.0000] <olliej>
is false, but the length is 9

[18:53:01.0000] <olliej>
sicking: that's what i was saying earlier

[18:53:02.0000] <sicking>
olliej, you have to forgive us JS noobs

[18:53:03.0000] <olliej>
sicking: [1,,3] the double , results in an empty slot

[18:53:04.0000] <olliej>
sicking: hehe

[18:54:00.0000] <olliej>
sicking: i just know this because i did the code gen for arrays in squirrelfish :D

[18:54:01.0000] <olliej>
array initialisers i mean

[18:54:02.0000] <olliej>
sicking: it gets better

[18:54:03.0000] <olliej>
sicking: [1,,3] results in an extra slot

[18:54:04.0000] <olliej>
sicking: but [1,2,,] does not

[18:54:05.0000] <sicking>
nice

[18:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: oh, interesting

[18:55:01.0000] <sicking>
that actually makes sense though

[18:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: i misunderstood

[18:55:03.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: np

[18:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
how about 'a', can that be in an array?

[18:55:05.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: ? as a property?

[18:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[18:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
'a' in foo

[18:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
where foo is an Array

[18:56:03.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: yup

[18:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
so the json serialiser just drops that one on the floor?

[18:56:05.0000] <sicking>
olliej, JSON.stringify([1,,2]) returns "[1, null, 2]" though, in firefox 3.1

[18:56:06.0000] <olliej>
sicking: i suspect that's actually wrong

[18:57:00.0000] <sicking>
olliej, what do you think it should be?

[18:57:01.0000] <olliej>
sicking: inasmuch as such a thing can be wrong

[18:57:02.0000] <olliej>
sicking: ooh

[18:57:03.0000] <olliej>
sicking: does json have undefined?

[18:57:04.0000] <sicking>
no

[18:57:05.0000] <olliej>
yeah

[18:57:06.0000] <olliej>
/me just remembered undefined is actually just a global objedct property

[18:57:07.0000] <sicking>
that's a problem too

[18:58:00.0000] <olliej>
sicking: my guess is that the problem is

[18:58:01.0000] <olliej>
sicking: say JSON did produce [1,2,undefined,3]

[18:58:02.0000] <olliej>
or whatever

[18:59:00.0000] <olliej>
a person could do undefined="foo!"

[18:59:01.0000] <sicking>
for the record, i've stopped guessing on this stuff. Because i tend to guess on what I think makes sense. And JSON rarely agrees with me

[19:00:00.0000] <olliej>
maybe a malicious person could take advantage of that

[19:00:01.0000] <olliej>
sicking: heheh

[19:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
in firefox

[19:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
var a = new Array(); a.b = 2; a[9] = 3; JSON.stringify(a);

[19:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
returns [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,3]

[19:00:05.0000] <sicking>
olliej, only in a poor implementation

[19:00:06.0000] <olliej>
sicking: yes

[19:01:00.0000] <olliej>
sicking: i know, i'm just saying maybe that's why json doesn't produce undefined

[19:01:01.0000] <sicking>
olliej, a decent JSON implementation (even one written in JS) would not be affected by what global.undefined is set to

[19:01:02.0000] <olliej>
ah right

[19:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
well anyway

[19:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
if any of you are JS guys

[19:01:05.0000] <olliej>
because it could just do

[19:01:06.0000] <Hixie>
step 8 of JA() is underdefined

[19:01:07.0000] <Hixie>
because i've no idea what it means:

[19:01:08.0000] <Hixie>
8. For each index in value.

[19:01:09.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i'm not

[19:01:10.0000] <olliej>
var myLocalUndefined; if (token == "undefined") return myLocalUndefined; or some such

[19:02:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: url?

[19:02:01.0000] <olliej>
sicking: weee! i'm currently doing edge detection on the startrek trailer in js :D

[19:02:02.0000] <sicking>

[19:03:01.0000] <sicking>
olliej, frame rate?

[19:03:02.0000] <olliej>
<20 would be my guess

[19:03:03.0000] <olliej>
/me annotates code

bbl food

[19:09:00.0000] <olliej>
sicking: aieeee, at 640x272 == 7-8fps on my mbp

[19:09:01.0000] <sicking>
olliej, cool

[19:10:00.0000] <olliej>
sicking: thankfully there are some real performance issues with SFX in  this case

[19:10:01.0000] <sicking>
olliej, so do you need to first paint it to the canvas, then export from canvas as a dataImage (or whatever its called)

[19:10:02.0000] <olliej>
sicking: yup

[19:10:03.0000] <sicking>
ugh

[19:10:04.0000] <olliej>
then do a 3x3 sobel filter

[19:10:05.0000] <olliej>
then into a separate buffer

[19:11:00.0000] <sicking>
would be nice if you didn't have to do that extra roundtrip

[19:11:01.0000] <olliej>
then copy it back

[19:11:02.0000] <olliej>
weeee

[19:12:00.0000] <sicking>
/me heads to dinner

[19:14:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: ping me when you return

[19:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: returned

[19:42:01.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: i realised a problem with imagedata + createimagedata, etc

[19:42:02.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: to make something that works safely with high dpi

[19:43:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: i want to do all my work in terms of the width/height of the image data object

[19:44:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: but many filters require a buffer (convolution, etc)

[19:44:01.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: so i might be tempted (in fact i realised this after noticing i already had) to create a buffer with context.createImageData(inData.width, inData.height)

[19:45:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: but those are device pixels, which will now be treated as css pixels

[19:45:01.0000] <olliej>
leading to badness

[19:46:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: so i think we need something akin to cloneImageData or some such

[19:46:01.0000] <olliej>
although i'm not entirely sure

[19:46:02.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: because that rules out subregions

[19:46:03.0000] <olliej>
etc

[19:52:00.0000] <roc>
I think I predicted that would be confusing :-)

[19:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: yeah, maybe. send mail.

[19:58:01.0000] <olliej>
roc: heh

[19:59:00.0000] <olliej>
/me has just realised he can vectorise his edge detection code

[19:59:01.0000] <olliej>

[19:59:02.0000] <olliej>

[19:59:03.0000] <olliej>
it will be *awesome*

[22:16:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: ping?

[22:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey

[22:21:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: what should currentSrc return when src is a url that redirects to another file?

[22:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
per spec, it should return the resolved url from the attribute, before hitting the network

[22:23:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: OK, that's what I though but wanted to make sure

[22:23:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
thanks!

A Javascript plugin is user-specified code that is executed by the browser for each page that the user visits.

[04:13:01.0000] <yecril71>
It is an equivalent of client-side stylesheet.

[04:13:02.0000] <yecril71>
Internet Explorer does not provide for this by default, but perhaps other browsers do.

[05:23:00.0000] <yecril71>
I would object to using attr(data-*) for CSS.

[05:26:00.0000] <yecril71>
Seems like a backdoor for presentational attributes.

[05:26:01.0000] <takkaria>
it's really unlikely anyone woud do that, though, given that there are classes and ids for that sort of thing

[05:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<span data-color="red"> span { color:attr(data-color, color) }

[05:27:01.0000] <yecril71>
I hope so; Giovanni�s idea got me horrified.

[05:27:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It's more work than using @style

[05:28:00.0000] <yecril71>
Evidently.

[05:28:01.0000] <yecril71>
Except that style is insensitive to media.

[05:29:00.0000] <yecril71>
(and to conditional processing)

[05:31:00.0000] <yecril71>
And now Giovanni active promotes that quirk.

[05:31:01.0000] <yecril71>
actively

[05:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
@media print { [style='color: red;'] { color: blue } }

[05:32:01.0000] <zcorpan>
with !important probably

[05:33:00.0000] <yecril71>
That would not hit style='color: red; background: green'.

[05:34:00.0000] <yecril71>
style is a parsed attribute and the parse rules cannot be reinterpreted by CSS selectors.

[05:34:01.0000] <takkaria>
you could do a substring match with CSS selectors, but I can't remember the syntax

[05:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
[style*="..."]

[05:35:01.0000] <yecril71>
That would not hit style='color: #FF0000'

[05:35:02.0000] <zcorpan>
right

[05:36:00.0000] <yecril71>
but it would hit style='background-color: red'

[05:38:00.0000] <yecril71>
Giovanni says metadata are not displayed and immediately thereafter

[05:38:01.0000] <yecril71>
he wants to display it with CSS content attribute.

[05:39:00.0000] <yecril71>
What a mess.

"It might be more accurate to say that HTML5 is a significantly extended subset of HTML4." - that seems almost an information-free thing to say, since any set can be seen as an extension of a subset of any other set, particularly if you take the zero-sized subset and then extend it to contain everything in the first set

[06:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
where's that from?

/me is probably being too pedantic :-)

[06:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: yeah, "significantly extended subset" is a phrase I plan to appropriate for my own use later

[06:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
very handy

[06:22:02.0000] <takkaria>
ta

[06:22:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I did wonder what he meant

[06:22:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
plus, its abbreviation is SES

[06:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since an "extended subset" at best means "a non-disjoint set"

[06:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or make that, <acronym>

[06:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Why would it mean non-disjoint?

[06:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Because presumably "extended subset" implies that they have some elements in common

[06:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
Unless the null set is considered a subset of all sets

[06:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the subset can be the empty set

[06:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Oh. Well that is just silly :)

[06:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
at least, humorous usage of "extended subset" is based on the possibility of the empty set being the subset

[06:28:00.0000] <takkaria>
Atom is thus a significantly extended subset of HTML4 too, I like it

[06:28:01.0000] <rubys>
me two

[06:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me is an extended subset of html4

[06:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd define subsets as being something like S ⊆ T ⇔ (x ∊ S ⇒ x ∊ T) and so clearly S = ∅ is a subset of anything

[06:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Can you rewite that in english for people ho can't be bothered to look up formal logic symbols?

[06:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
S is a subset T if and only if (if x is a member of S, then x is a member of T)

[06:35:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: you need quantifiers

[06:35:01.0000] <jcranmer>
if and only if (for all x, ...)

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: I'm, uh, leaving it implicitly quantified on purpose

[06:37:00.0000] <rubys>
jcranmer: I don't think so, a better translation would be:  "S is a subset of T" is equivalent to saying "x is a member of S implies x is a member of T"

[06:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Okay, so maybe I should have said something more like S ⊆ T ⇔ (∀ x ∊ S. x ∊ T)

[06:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
(It's hard writing this when my IRC font displays all these symbols as squares)

[06:40:00.0000] <yecril71>
That was cute, Mirc got it right :-)

[06:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: That's a bit too imprecise, because I could take S={1,2} and T={1,3} and x=1 and say that ""{1,2} is a subset of {1,3}" is equivalent to saying "1 is a member of {1,2}"" (and could repeat that for all values of x), which is not right

[06:41:01.0000] <yecril71>
Browsers do not assume that the author knows the language the document is written in.

[06:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oops, I forgot the "implies ..." bit, but that doesn't make a difference

[06:42:01.0000] <yecril71>
Just the opposite, they assume she does not.

[06:42:02.0000] <jcranmer>
my tt font has all these nice symbols

[06:43:00.0000] <yecril71>
Was that a sexist comment?  Perhaps I should use "he" with pejorative statements?

[06:43:01.0000] <jcranmer>
it even has Japanese hiragana and katakana, although it's missing a fair amouint of kanji

[06:43:02.0000] <jcranmer>
yecril71: just dehumanize them with "it"

[06:44:00.0000] <yecril71>
That would be too ambiguous.

[06:46:00.0000] <rubys>
Philip` I think the word "implies" means more than you give it credit.

[06:46:01.0000] <rubys>
saying  "x is a member of S implies x is a member of T" is a strong statement.

[06:47:00.0000] <yecril71>
Upon encountering a malformed entry, a shared content server can do one of two things:

[06:47:01.0000] <yecril71>
It can fix it or it can reject it.

[06:47:02.0000] <yecril71>
If it rejects, it can return the entry to the author for further processing.

[06:47:03.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: The problem is that it's ambiguous what "x" means when it's not explicitly quantified

[06:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
(at least when it's nested in more complex logical statements)

[06:49:01.0000] <rubys>
OK, I'll grant you that.  An "∀ x" in front would help, or in words: "S is a subset of T" is equivalent to saying "for all x, x is a member of S implies x is a member of T"

[06:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
That sounds about right to me

[06:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Now S and T are implicitly quantified, but I suppose that's okay since they're at the outermost level

[06:52:00.0000] <yecril71>
If the users cannot embed SCRIPT elements, how can they use jQuery.Validate in the first place?

[06:52:01.0000] <yecril71>
And if ID is not supported, why should CLASS be?

[06:58:00.0000] <yecril71>
I cannot imagine how submitting invalid HTML content could crash the server.

[06:58:01.0000] <yecril71>
And in the corporate environment.

[07:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: You can bring the site down by posting ill-formed XML content, if the site is served as XHTML and displays your content to all other users, even though the server is unaffected

[07:10:00.0000] <yecril71>
A corporate site that would allow such unsupervised arbitrary manipulation of key elements would be pretty insane.

[07:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
Not really - it's what happens whenever a site lets a user post comments

[07:11:00.0000] <yecril71>
That affects only one page, not the whole site.

[07:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
and even if it's plain text, they'll forget to deal will illegal characters that mean the output will be ill-formed when the text is inserted into their page

[07:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
The user can post a comment to every page on the site :-)

[07:12:00.0000] <yecril71>
Not really; key pages should be protected anyway.

[07:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How's y'all?

[09:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Pointing out the smallest invalid subtree"

[09:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Assuming more than one XML error, is that technically possible?

[09:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's technically vague, so you can't tell - "subtree" only makes sense after you've parsed the document, and you can't parse the document if it's ill-formed, so you can't point out an ill-formed subtree

[09:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and "ill-formed" seems to be what was meant by "invalid", if I remember correctly)

[09:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Ah, there's that angle too 

[09:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Then it's even less possible :)

[09:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: A subtree of the b element exists in the character-stream: <a><b><c/></b><d></a>

[09:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Despite that not being well-formed, the XML parser doesn't need to throw a fatal error until the </a>

[09:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Yeah, but we're talking about subtree containing the invalid part

[09:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: True

[09:21:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Which is impossible

[09:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is half asleep

[09:21:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has been awake for five hours!

[09:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's a long time to be half asleep!

[09:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I suppose you could parse it as HTML and keep track of where the ill-formed token ends up, but that seems awfully complicated compared to just using HTML :)

[09:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: And awfully user-hostile, if you're going to pop up a dialog box with several options for every error they made

[09:39:00.0000] <yecril71>
A subtree containing the invalid part is possible: <d/>

[09:39:01.0000] <yecril71>
This would always be a one-node subtree.

[09:40:00.0000] <yecril71>
Internet Explorer indicates the error by quoting the text stream.

[09:41:00.0000] <yecril71>
Are scripts executed in a detached document?

[09:41:01.0000] <yecril71>
I think they should not be, because there is no window.

[09:43:00.0000] <yecril71>
InnerHTML is a poor way to insert a script, DOM manipulation is better.

[09:49:00.0000] <yecril71>
A document cannot be backward-compliant.

[09:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
HTML5 does not deprecate.

[09:57:00.0000] <yecril71>
Custom scripting engines are out of scope.

[09:57:01.0000] <yecril71>
CORBA and the like are served by the OBJECT element.

[10:07:00.0000] <yecril71>
An ECMAScript array object, being an ECMAScript array object, must carry all properties and methods of an ECMAScript array object.

[10:09:00.0000] <yecril71>
The way to serialise complex data structures is XML and perhaps JSON.

[10:09:01.0000] <yecril71>
XML has an advantage of being programming-language-neutral.

[10:10:00.0000] <takkaria>
JSON is pretty programming-language neutral as well, really

[10:11:00.0000] <yecril71>
Will you be so kind and point be to a JSON reader implemented in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition?

[10:11:01.0000] <yecril71>
(I am not saying it cannot be done)

[10:16:00.0000] <yecril71>
Digit-labelled items are not positional properties.

[10:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
OK, the lynching started.

[10:21:00.0000] <yecril71>
Communicating with remote server is done via cross-domain network requests, not by passing window messages.

[10:26:00.0000] <takkaria>
those four posts are far too long for me to read :)

[10:26:01.0000] <yecril71>
Do not worry, I shall do it for you :-)

[10:27:00.0000] <yecril71>
Tunnelling through one dedicated window to save on HTTP connections is utter nonsense.

[10:29:00.0000] <yecril71>
A Web application should not use more than one window.

[10:45:00.0000] <yecril71>
defaultscript is called language in HTML.

[10:46:00.0000] <yecril71>
Voiding an unsupported script would be harmful for other scripts.

[10:48:00.0000] <yecril71>
Dynamic attributes and declared attributes should obey the same semantic rules.

[10:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
Stranger scripts should be able to access all event handlers as defined.

[10:53:00.0000] <yecril71>
Since classic event handler attributes are just strings, no harm is done by providing access to them.

[10:58:00.0000] <yecril71>
Detection whether a particular scripting language is easy: just include a script in that language setting some global property.

[10:59:00.0000] <yecril71>
If it is not set, other scripts can infer that it is not supported.

[11:00:00.0000] <yecril71>
That way, the scripts can negotiate the preference order themselves, and with a better granularity than the host.

[11:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
What if it's a pure functional language like Haskell and it's not possible to modify any state?

[11:02:01.0000] <yecril71>
It has nothing to do in HTML then.

[11:02:02.0000] <yecril71>
Because HTML DOM is about modifying states.

[11:03:00.0000] <yecril71>
You could have an analogue of document.write in Haskell, but that is all.

[11:08:00.0000] <yecril71>
Event handlers are synchronous.

[11:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: Did you see Philip`'s comment about the structured cloning and multiple references to the same object?

[11:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
no?

[11:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you have an object a and send [a, a] through the algorithm, you get [a', a"] out

[11:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes, that's intentional

[11:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It seems that since there's no serialization going on, the relationship could be maintained (which would also save work on those cases)

[11:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess

[12:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html-wg/20081216#l-134 is the aforementioned comment

[12:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
But I don't see any real value in trying to 'fix' it - UAs will presumably already have to handle out-of-memory conditions when cloning, and this just provides an easier way to trigger that

[12:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I see value in less work while still maintaining the assocations

[12:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it a pattern that's likely to be common in practice (and not just in malicious cases)?

[12:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh if we did this OOM protection wouldn't be the reason

[12:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: That's a hard question to ask about a brand new feature :)

[12:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
we could trivially make loops and non-loop duplicates get preserved

[12:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
the question is whether we want to

[12:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
it makes it much harder for UAs to use serialisation mechanisms to do it

[12:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. JSON

[12:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
since they'd have to extend JSON to not only support things like NaN (not hard to do) but also to support labels and references.

[12:14:03.0000] <Philip`>
Firefox can already serialise cyclic and duplicative data structures in uneval(), using the #1# property syntax or whatever it is

[12:15:00.0000] <gavin>
"sharp variables"

[12:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Gavin Sharp variables? :)

[12:16:00.0000] <gavin>
unfortunately not :)

[12:16:01.0000] <yecril71>
labels and references can be handled by host application.

[12:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand http://www.w3.org/mid/1229450642.7182.401.camel⊙pl

[12:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
I nearly poked my eye out on a sharp variable once

[12:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm…

[12:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
do I go to christmas dance or not?

[12:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I've been getting more spam in my moderation queue on my blog. Seems spammers are getting less dumb.

[12:53:00.0000] <hober>
that reminds me, I've been meaning to ask DanC about the origins of his [[...]] quoting style.

[13:00:00.0000] <jwalden>

[13:00:01.0000] <jwalden>
!summon abarth

[13:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: how do you feel about preserving cycles?

[13:28:00.0000] <jwalden>
when did we decide just using JSON to convert to and from strings passed through these APIs wasn't good enough?  I'd thought that was what the plan was going to be

[13:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
roughly when we looked at JSON

[13:29:01.0000] <jwalden>
when was this?  some thread in whatwg@ I missed?

[13:29:02.0000] <jwalden>
/me is about six months out of the loop, mind

[13:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
it was discussed last night on IRC, primarily

[13:30:01.0000] <jwalden>
oh, just then?

[13:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
(it can't preserve things like undefined, NaN, Infinity, it screws up arrays, etc)

[13:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
(it stringifies host objects, which seems dangerous)

[13:30:04.0000] <jwalden>
holey arrays, not especially common I suspect

[13:30:05.0000] <jwalden>
host objects are an author error, no?

[13:30:06.0000] <Hixie>
well the point is why would we _want_ to break these things if we didn't have to

[13:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, the api here isn't JSON, the JSON would be just an implementation detail

[13:31:01.0000] <jwalden>
keep things simple to understand

[13:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
might as well use XML or something else

[13:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
simple for whom?

[13:31:04.0000] <jwalden>
authors

[13:31:05.0000] <jwalden>
you use JSON to push it through, you use JSON to get it out

[13:31:06.0000] <jwalden>
and I think authors are familiar with JSON nowadays

[13:31:07.0000] <Hixie>
oh you mean just not supporting it natively?

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
and only doing strings in the API?

[13:32:01.0000] <jwalden>
basically

[13:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[13:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
sorry, my bad

[13:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
different discussion

[13:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
i added structured data passing because mozilla implemented it

[13:32:06.0000] <jwalden>
we did?  another thing I'm six months behind on, I guess

[13:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[13:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was trying to delay it as much as possible, so that implementations would focus on what was in the spec, but no point not speccing it if implementations are doing it anyway

[13:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: yt?

[13:33:03.0000] <jwalden>
sicking: pass me a bug number when you get back?

[13:34:00.0000] <jwalden>
that changes things somewhat

[13:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: ou have no idea how much i want support for cross-spec xrefs :-)

[13:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i should just code it up myself

[13:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: :)

[13:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how hard it is to write anolis plugins

[13:37:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: The whole design of anolis is based around a single doc,

[13:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: well this would just be a fallback for things that couldn't be xreffed already -- so it would just need a separate bit before to set up fallback references in a separate list

[13:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
not sure exactly how it would work

[13:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[13:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does it need to be automatic crossreferencing, rather than something explicit like <a href="workers#some-id-value">?

[13:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: How urgently do you need xdoc xref?

[13:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really "need" it, but it would make my life simpler instantly as soon as i could use it

[13:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
mostly right now i'd use it for web workers -> html5, and for html5 -> webidl

[13:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
please don't put it ahead of your schoolwork or anything :-)

[13:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has the issue of having an English dissertation and computing project to do by the 8th of Jan

[13:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't really put much ahead of that :)

[13:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Apart from procrastination, obviously :)

[13:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
well feel free to use this as procastrination :-)

[13:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I need to ship 1.0 first

[13:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Though I don't foresee anything changing

[13:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Apart from making it possible to install with easy_install

[13:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(i.e., easy_install anolis would install anolis and all dependancies)

[13:52:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, preserving cycles?

[13:52:02.0000] <sicking>
jwalden, bug# for what?

[13:53:00.0000] <jwalden>
sicking: this structured-data passing mechanism Hixie says we implemented

[13:53:01.0000] <sicking>
jwalden, ah

[13:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
For either 1.1 or 2.0 (if you nag my enough into doing xdoc xref soon) I want to re-evaluate depending on html5lib at all

[13:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: in postMessage(), what do you think of preserving  [a, a]  as an array referencing the saem object twice? (also lets us preserve cycles)

[13:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: ah

[13:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: well html5lib will get faster in time, i expect (and hope!)

[13:54:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i'm not really the person to ask. I think we need to solve the to JSON-or-not-to-JSON question first

[13:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Yeah, but if you're using the libxml HTML parser, should I really require html5lib to be installed?

[13:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: do you know who is?

[13:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
I hope html5lib won't get too much faster, because it should remain pure Python (since there are situations where you can't use C modules)

[13:55:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, brendan, sayrer, and/or maciej

[13:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: given that the people actually hosting it are also the html5lib implementors, it seems not a problem to rely on it :-)

[13:55:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: But for those of us who want our own local copies? :)

[13:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i hope html5lib will also have a C module implementation if that is the only way to make it faster

[13:55:05.0000] <Philip`>
html5lib isn't exactly hard to install

[13:55:06.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, IMHO it comes down to: is JSON a native data-interchange-format for javascript? Or is it just specific to the JSON object

[13:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: k, thanks

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I think we've more or less reached the limit of pure Python without massively redesigning the codebase and making it less powerful :)

[13:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there any reason why html5lib should be slower than sgmllib?

[13:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Because HTML5 is simpler than SGML?

[13:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm not actually sure if it is slower or not - maybe I should test that...)

[13:58:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Or more likely sgmllib is an incomplete implementation of SGML.

[13:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Most of the cost is just reading characters while tokenising, which should be pretty much the same in html5lib and sgmllib

[14:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
any software being slower than instantaneous is a bug almost by definition, not counting time spent waiting for other software, hardware, or user interaction.

[14:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blames jgraham for getting him to keep trying to write it in Python and not learning C++ and trying to write Anolis in that

[14:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: But you wrote it in Python and you have something that works, whereas if you wrote it while learning C++ then you probably wouldn't :-)

[14:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[14:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: If I tried to write it while learning C++ I'd probably give up trying to learn C++

[14:01:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: And thus would have nothing

[14:01:04.0000] <Philip`>
and even if it did work in C++, you'd think it was ugly since it was the first program you ever wrote in that language and so you'd want to rewrite it immediately

[14:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It's the first program I wrote in Python!

[14:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[14:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
But Python is much more forgiving of first-time programmers than C++ :-)

[14:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[14:09:00.0000] <yecril71>
Except that it requires an indentation-aware editor and a wide screen.

[14:09:01.0000] <yecril71>
So it has some serious hardware/software requirements :=)

[14:10:00.0000] <yecril71>
I was on the verge on writing an indenting preprocessor when I wrote in Python.

verge of

[14:11:00.0000] <jruderman>
writing C++ pretty much requires an indentation-aware editor ... even more than python, i'd argue, since you end up writing 3 times as many lines of code

[14:12:00.0000] <yecril71>
I do not use indentation when I code over Telnet.

[14:12:01.0000] <yecril71>
In C++, that is.

[14:13:00.0000] <yecril71>
80 columns are hardly enough to hold an expression, I cannot afford any indentation.

sgmllib tokenises the HTML5 spec in 2.7 seconds, html5lib takes 10.5 seconds

[14:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Both give the same output when I use them to count the number of start tags)

[14:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
(The input is a string in both cases)

[14:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what the difference is

[14:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
and don't say 7.8

[14:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
sgmllib is pure Python, as far as I can see

[14:19:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe sgmllib uses byte strings?

[14:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
html5lib does almost four times as many function calls as sgmllib

[14:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
Are function calls really expensive in Python?

[14:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
where "really expensive" means "about a thousand clock cycles"

[14:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
I can imagine that they possibly are

[14:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: They are fairly expensive

[14:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: 7.8 seconds.

[14:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[14:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I concluded on my laptop, IIRC, that a function call cost 1µs

[14:31:00.0000] <karlcow>
http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips

[14:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I conclude that your laptop is a bit slow, since mine does about 2.5e6 function calls (plus some non-trivial work doing all the tokenisation) in about 1.6 seconds

[14:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: This was an IIRC case

[14:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
karlcow: I think we've got beyond that document, really :)

[14:37:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me should take a look again at html5lib

[14:37:01.0000] <karlcow>
it has been a super long time I have done so

[14:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm

[14:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
I can save about 10% just by replacing "class X(object):" with "class X:", for X in ('HTMLInputStream', 'HTMLTokenizer')

[14:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
New style classes are slow?

[14:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Apparently so

[14:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
(at least in Python 2.5 on x86)

[14:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
(on classes that aren't doing any inheritance)

/me comes across webkit's LayoutTests/fast/forms/old-names.html

[14:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
you have GOT to be kidding me

[15:01:00.0000] <gavin>
ugh

[15:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
what's so bad about it?

[15:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
well the most crazy part is the "third" part

[15:02:01.0000] <gavin>
emulating a Firefox bug because one site depended on it is pretty gross

[15:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
but the whole thing is insane

[15:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's not just emulating a Firefox bug

[15:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
Firefox is emulating an IE bug

[15:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
IE doesn't update the array at all when names change

[15:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is clearly wrong, but sites rely on it it seems

[15:03:02.0000] <gavin>
oh

[15:03:03.0000] <Lachy>
oh crap

[15:03:04.0000] <gavin>
so Firefox explicitly chose that behavior

[15:04:00.0000] <gavin>
presumably

[15:04:01.0000] <gavin>
to both be compatible, and try to Do The Right Thing

[15:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[15:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm most amused and horrified that form.x and form.elements.x are different

[15:04:04.0000] <gavin>
I feel better about it now

[15:05:00.0000] <hallvors>
I know that issue. We had to do it too.

[15:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how to spec it

[15:05:02.0000] <Lachy>
Opera fails this test, but I don't see why based on the result: FAIL form.third should be [object HTMLInputElement]. Was [object HTMLInputElement].

[15:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
opera probably remembers the last settign isntead of the first

[15:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
which does firefox do?

[15:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
possibly, but I mean it's telling me the expected result is the same as the actual result, but still fails

[15:06:02.0000] <hallvors>
(some years ago some software vendor who apparently sold web backends to banks relied on this IE bug. Several banks had login forms doing excactly nothing if you behaved per the spec)

[15:06:03.0000] <Lachy>
Firefox 3 passes everything

[15:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
the expected result is 'a' and you're getting (i guess) 'b'. But they are both HTMLInputElement objects, so the output isn't very helpful

[15:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
hallvors: good times

[15:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
webkit does too

[15:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
makes sense that webkit passes it :-)

[15:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
/me fires up VMWare to test IE8

[15:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll have a list of objects to remember

[15:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
this is going to be Fun!

[15:08:02.0000] <hallvors>
/me crosses fingers and toes that no page depends on the stuff Firefox does

[15:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'll do this after heycam reviews my last checkin

[15:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder why VMWare is taking an extra long time to start up this time?

[15:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
my iMac desperately needs more RAM

[15:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Do you have IE8b2, or the newer release?

[15:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
I installed the newest release a couple of days ago

[15:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
The non-public newest one?

[15:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[15:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
Okay

[15:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
That version says "FAIL successfullyParsed should be true. Threw exception [object Error] / TEST COMPLETE"

[15:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's version 8.0.6001.18343, Release Candidate 1

[15:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
There's a script error "Object doesn't support this property or method" on "line 14, char 5"

[15:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
That doesn't make any sense. Line 14 is: form = document.getElementById('form');

[15:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, IE's developer tools are broken. It's says the error is line 14 of the script, but points to line 14 of the file, without taking into account the lines before the script.

[15:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
It is actually the getElementById line that's failing, as far as I can tell

[15:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
(if I make a local copy and then insert alerts everywhere)

[15:23:02.0000] <ghostbyte>
Anyone know where the PDF version for WCAG2 guides are? They talk about them but don't link to it

[15:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually, no, it's the "form = ..." that's failing

[15:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
"var form" works much better

[15:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah

[15:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is there an id="form" perhaps?

[15:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
wow, IE8 fails most of those tests after fixing that line

[15:25:02.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, yes

/me commits trivial fixes to make html5lib ~20% faster


2008-12-17
[16:01:00.0000] <hallvors>
Hixie: how is work on security contexts for script execution going?

[16:02:00.0000] <olliej>
Philip`: what did you do?

[16:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
olliej: Changed the tokeniser and inputstream from new-style classes to old-style classes

[16:03:01.0000] <olliej>
Philip`: ah 

[16:03:02.0000] <olliej>
python?

[16:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
olliej: (and also cached a len() call, for 1-2% extra speed)

[16:03:04.0000] <Philip`>
olliej: Yes

[16:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Getting rid of the position() stuff saves another 20%, but that's occasionally a useful feature when you want error locations...

[16:10:00.0000] <takkaria>
christ, I'm going to have to optimise the hell out of hubbub or htm5lib will be faster :)

[16:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think that's pretty unlikely :-p

[16:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
This is still Python, where a method call takes a thousand clock cycles

[16:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
hallvors: hm?

[16:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be nice if html5lib never had an unget buffer larger than one character

[16:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it seems not entirely trivial to make it do that :-(

[16:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
but probably worthwhile, because that would also involve it being properly streaming and not doing lots of lookahead like it does now

[16:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and then I think the whole line-length / position thing could be simplified, because you'll never to unget more than one newline character)

[16:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/to//

[16:38:00.0000] <hallvors>
Hixie: I was just looking at some tricky tests using with() to sneak stuff from another security context into a script's scope. I guess you haven't written any spec for such things yet ;) .. and I suppose you should also try to make the ES4 people deal with it rather than do it yourself..

[17:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
hallvord: if you see this, can you give an example?

[19:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
tag cloud markup

[19:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
hmmmm

[19:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://24ways.org/examples/marking-up-a-tag-cloud/example.html seems plausible

[19:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
(though without all the duplication)

[19:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, tag clouds were discussed on #whatwg here: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081004

[19:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, the lead-in to that conversation started here: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081003#l-581

[19:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[19:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's kind of in line with what i just wrote in this omnibus e-mail

[19:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, it's nice when things like that happen. :)

[19:50:00.0000] <Hixie>

[19:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love the way the main function is called "readSGML"

[22:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That's odd seeming it was originally not even meant to be SGML, just something like it

[22:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmmm…

[22:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
html5lib fails a lot of tests

[22:47:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, i think it would be better if DOMStringMap still had operations annotated with [NameGetter] etc., and then for me to introduce something in Web IDL to indicate that the operations don't correspond to functions, and then for you to use that functionality

[22:50:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, so something like http://paste.lisp.org/display/72289

[22:51:00.0000] <heycam>
it'd have the advantage of both making the description of the named property accessors simpler (since you'd just do your usual description of operations) and also makes the interfaces suitable for languages that don't support object indexing

[22:51:01.0000] <heycam>
s/makes/making/

[22:53:00.0000] <heycam>
i can add that [OmitNamedPropertyOperations] (or something like it) before Web IDL is republished later in the week, probably

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: well, i want  for (var i in element.dataSet)  to work

[00:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It only fails about 906 out of 9953, so it's correct most of the time

[00:26:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, right that's still fine, because it comes from the use of [NameGetter]

[00:27:00.0000] <heycam>
and the definition in prose as to which named properties exist

[00:27:01.0000] <heycam>
/me goes to cook some curried sausages

[00:30:00.0000] <roc>
mmm

[00:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me gets confused, until he realises that 'curried' is a culinary term and not a functional programming term

[00:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Does prefab count as curried food? :)

[01:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has a mostly working html5lib at home

[01:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
But I have no internet access

[01:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
But it gets parse errors wrong, doesn't do xml cocecion properly (I started working on that) and fails a bunch of stuff in the liberal xml parser and in the validator, both of which I am tempted to mark as abandoned unless someone fixes them

[01:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/parse/some parse/

[01:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh and doesn't do MathML or SVG

[01:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me feels bad using old style classes for something as trivial as performance :)

[01:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Having the parser pass tests seems more valuable than having the liberal XML parser and validator pass tests

[01:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I wouldn't complain about that :-)

[01:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: If performance was trivial, we wouldn't talk about chtml5lib as much as we have :-)

[01:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: :p

[01:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wouldn't think it was worthwhile if it only gained 1-2%, but it appears to be ten times that

[01:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually, that's not true, I probably would still think it was worthwhile, but I wouldn't change it if people objected on the grounds of compatibility or something

[01:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Well it will have to change for Python3 anyway

[01:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Does Python 3 just remove the "class X:" syntax, rather than redefining it to mean new-style classes?

[01:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: AIUI class Foo(): now means a new style class 

[01:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd guess that's the least of our worries when porting to Python 3, given the whole unicode vs string thing

[01:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Porting to python 3 will indeed be awful (I expect)

[01:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
Unless the 2to3 tool is actually a way ofreleasing magic pixies into your computer that do all the work for you

[01:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Gentoo only added Python 2.5 as stable a few months ago, so I think it's going to be rather a long time before everyone stops using 2.x and switches to 3.x

[01:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I guess it's more useful for html5lib to be written for 2.x than for 3.x for the next few years

[01:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It took that long because dozens of packages were incompatible with 2.5)

[03:15:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#NoIndexingOperations

[04:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Does your mostly working html5lib have lots of changes that would cause annoying conflicts if I was trying to make other changes to reduce the use of unget()?

[04:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Nothing in the tokenizer iirc

[05:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is value of input type=datetime supposed to allow as conforming time zone designators other than "Z"?

[05:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as far as I can tell, the fourth para under http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#date-and-time-state says that any time zone is valid, but the third para requires UAs to produce only UTC results

[05:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what happened to oninput and oninvalid?

[05:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Okay, good

[05:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (My vague poorly-thought-through plan is to get rid of the unget buffer, and only allow a single character to be ungotten at once, because then there's no need for the lineLengths array and all the related complexity)

[05:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (But a much more useful plan would be to make the tokeniser match the spec and pass tests, before trying to optimise anything)

[05:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (so maybe I should try that instead)

[06:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Or maybe I should fix my OCaml tokeniser generator, and then generate an html5lib-compatible tokeniser, so it's easier to attempt fancier optimisations like inlining stuff to avoid function calls)

[06:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: How will you do readahead one token at a time?

[06:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/token/character/

[06:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/read/look/ maybe

[06:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Also, if what's checked in has test faliures in the tokenizer other than ones related to non-BMP unicode characters then I probably have changed something there

[06:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: By looking ahead one character, and if it's not what was expected then unget it, otherwise look ahead one more character, and if it's not what was expected then unget the latest character and do something special to the first character (like emit it as a character token or whatever is appropriate)

[06:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
and then repeat until done

[06:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, I haven't actually run the tokeniser tests, I just assumed it hadn't been updated when the spec was changed to add MathML and suchlike

[06:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I assumed the tests had been updated

[06:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
so either of those assumptions could be wrong

[06:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Does that work for things like entities where you need multiple characters before you decide what the right thing to emit is?

[06:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Oh I might just have disbaled things to do with namespaces, MathML, etc. locally

[06:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/things/tests/

[06:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Yes, because if you're not going to treat it as an entity then you're going to (output it as a character token | append it to the attribute value), so you can do those directly with the list of characters you've collected inside the entity function instead of ungetting and passing control back to some other state

[06:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, I'm not sure that sentence entirely made sense

[06:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I think it does. Basically you just end up buffering characters locally inside the state rather than globally, right?

[06:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yep

[06:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you can ensure those characters are only [^"'>&], so you can trivially process those buffered characters without sending them through the whole tokeniser state machine again

[06:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well it sounds good if you can make it work :)

[06:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
But at best it'll probably only make things 20% faster, which isn't a groundbreaking improvement :-(

[06:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
I seem to remember that the linelengths thing seemed very complicated so getting rid of that seems like a win in any case

[06:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I get quite a few doctype wrong-number-of-ParseError test failures - is that something you fixed locally?

[06:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Dunno. I seem to remember something related to doctypes

[06:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
If you fix it, I will deal with the merge problems :)

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Okay :-)

[07:06:00.0000] <takkaria>
Hubbub doesn't have an unget buffer at all, but I don't know if that approach is portable to html5lib

[07:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: What does it use instead?

[07:11:00.0000] <takkaria>
it sort-of does, but really it just doesn't advance into the buffer until it knows that there is not going to be ungetting necessary

[07:12:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, until it's not going to be necessary to unget

[07:12:01.0000] <takkaria>
it peeks ahead instead

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: How does it work when there aren't enough characters in the buffer for lookahead (because it hasn't come across the network yet, so it's not EOF)?

[07:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
it returns control back to the caller to push more characters into the input stream

[07:14:01.0000] <takkaria>
and keeps track of how far ahead it was looking

[07:15:00.0000] <takkaria>
just means that after every peek call, you check that the return code wasn't "out of data"

[07:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
The Validator.nu HTML Parser has no lookahead. Instead, I've transformed the tokenizer states in such a way that no lookahead is needed

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: Does it retain enough state that if the input is "<!doctype publi", and it's parsed until before the 'p' and then done some lookahead and returned "out of data", and then receives a "c" character, it doesn't have to reread the "publi"?

[07:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: So what you have InAttributeValueMaybeEntity states?

[07:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
(and so on)

[07:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
Philip`: yup.  the only state it needs to retain is the number of characters it's peeking ahead

[07:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me guesses that html5lib is the only implementation that will receive "<!doctype p>" and then require another four characters before it emits the token

[07:24:00.0000] <takkaria>
yeah

[07:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
OK so html5lib sucks, there's no need to rub it in 

[07:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
:)

[07:25:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, it's hardly a performance issue :)

[07:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
html5lib was the first(?) implementation so it can't be expected to do everything perfectly, and now it has the opportunity to benefit from the experience of all the other implementations

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: It's (indirectly) a performance issue in html5lib :-(

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
because if the input is "<!doctype p>\nx\n\n" then it'll unget a load of newlines, and it'll have to fiddle around to work out what line number it should report errors from

[07:27:01.0000] <takkaria>
ah

[07:28:00.0000] <takkaria>
hubbub switches into a special state for the SYSTEM and PUBLIC bits, that seems like the best solution really

[07:29:00.0000] <jmb>
it's "a" solution, at least :)

[07:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
There are other cases like "<script></\n\n\n\n\n\n" with the same problem in html5lib

[07:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
I hate computers

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me quite likes them

[07:32:01.0000] <takkaria>
jmb: I can't see any better one for hubbub, but maybe python has some constructs which are better for it :)

[07:33:00.0000] <jmb>
takkaria: I agree it's what fits best with hubbub :)

[07:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: The character processing model is probably a more significant difference than the language

[07:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
html5lib's tokeniser calls stream.char() which always returns the next character (which might involve reading chunks of bytes from the underlying input stream)

[07:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/bytes/characters/ maybe

[07:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's not possible to suspend the tokeniser and wait for more input

[07:46:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, I see

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't fancy changing that, so he won't

[08:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: The entity state is essentially a "maybe" state in the sense that if it's not an entity, it appends what it saw

[08:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: so it buffers what it saw instead of looking ahead

[08:13:00.0000] <takkaria>
appends back on to the front of the buffer?

[08:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
appends to the attribute value buffer

[08:17:00.0000] <takkaria>
ah, I see

[08:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: is http://philip.html5.org/tests/ie8/cases/unknown-element-styling.html fixed in the latest build?

[08:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: seems like it

[08:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: thx

[08:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I'm almost entirely sure it is

[08:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=364356

[08:56:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i'd like it to work without the script workaround

[08:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how html5lib tokenises "<xmp>foo</xmp/" into [[u'Character', u'foo'], u'ParseError', [u'EndTag', u'xmp'], u'ParseError', [u'EndTag', u'xmp']]

[08:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Uh, ignore the lack of a StartTag token - that's not relevant)

[09:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Wow, really?

[09:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: That's the output I get from a test case

[09:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I don't think it's using code that I've locally modified

[09:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Wow, that is really bad

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems to happen when the input is a simple plain "<x/" too

[09:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, it's just ignoring the return value of self.processSolidusInTag()

[09:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://twitter.com/perrins/statuses/1062462587

[09:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me gets quite worried when he can comment out lines of code in the middle of important functions without causing any tests to fail

[09:29:00.0000] <takkaria>
hmm, I really should get round to contributing all of the hubbub tests back to html5lib

[09:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
we have character encoding stuff that html5lib didn't have tests for

[09:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
That would be a nice thing to have

[10:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't think the idea to deprecate text/html is going to get much traction in the WHATWG

[10:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
(in response to mailing list)

[10:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah i wanted to allow authors to use their own time zone when setting the value

[10:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok. thanks

[10:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i'm scared that that's like giving implementors a loaded gun and telling them to point it at their foot and set the safety and then pull the trigger -- implementors who aren't paying attention will shoot themselves

[10:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i.e. they'll think "what's NoIndexingOperations? oh well let's ignore it for now" and we'll get the functions exposed

[10:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i'd much rather have the idl look like the js object and have [IndexSetter] etc take arguments to provide names for the other languages

[11:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatwg.org%2Fspecs%2Fweb-apps%2Fcurrent-work%2F

[11:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's a bit disturbing that in the past year and a half or so, I've had to change the max file size from 1 MB to 4 MB to accommodate the spec

[11:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
the file size sharnk significantly since i complained

[11:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
shrank

[11:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
it was only big temporarily because i had all the rfc2119 terms marked up as a test

[11:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's still over 3 MB, though

[11:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[11:47:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, ping

[11:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: pong

[11:59:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, why is outerHTML/insertAdjecentHTML in HTML5. Alternatively, why aren't they supported in XML 'mode'?

[12:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone found any more release critical bugs in Anolis, or can I push 1.0?

[12:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: they're in HTML5 because several browsers support them

[12:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: they're not supported in XML because I didn't spec it and nobody asked for it

[12:21:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, so they are considered required for web compat?

[12:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
apparently several browser vendors think so, yes

[12:21:03.0000] <sicking>
well, we all know that browser vendors are on crack most of the time...

[12:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's not a line of argument you want to convince me of :-)

[12:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't really matter if they're on crack or not though

[12:22:02.0000] <sicking>
i'm surprised you are not convinced of that already?

[12:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
i find browser vendors as a group to be amongst the sanest of the people i deal with on a daily basis

[12:23:01.0000] <sicking>
so given that criteria, why isn't document.all in html5?

[12:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
mainly, i haven't gotten around to it yet

[12:23:03.0000] <sicking>
ok

[12:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
partially because i have no idea how to spec its magical behavior

[12:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
(there's lots that i haven

[12:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
't specced yet, like window.focus())

[12:25:00.0000] <sicking>
a nice thing about document.all is that it's unlikely that we can ever get browser compat on one critical aspect of it

[12:25:01.0000] <sicking>
namely weather if |document.all| produces true or not

[12:26:00.0000] <sicking>
for the same reason that we'll unlikely to get compat on what Navigator.appName returns

[12:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
well i just need two complete bug-free implementations of HTML5, and I've already given up on IE being one of those two

[12:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
Navigator.appName doesn't have to return the same value in all browsers, it just has to return a value that conforms to the spec

[12:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
and the spec says: Must return either the string "Netscape" or the full name of the browser, e.g. "Mellblom Browsernator".

[12:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
...which it is possible to implement interoperably

[12:26:05.0000] <sicking>
my point is that document.all is used as browser detection as much as navigator.appName is

[12:27:00.0000] <sicking>
so people *want* it to return different things for different browsers

[12:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
given the route IE is taking, i wouldn't be surprised if that changed

[12:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
but yeah

[12:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[12:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's not a huge deal

[12:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really see how to define document.all returning false anyway

[12:28:01.0000] <sicking>
magic pixie dust :)

[12:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[12:28:03.0000] <sicking>
but back to my original question. If we think outerHTML is worth implementing, why not do it for XML mode?

[12:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i can argue that document.all should be in zcorpan's Web DOM Core instead of HTML5!

[12:29:00.0000] <sicking>
hah!

[12:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me re-discovers why parsing entities is not much fun

[12:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
It has too many edge cases :-(

[12:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
and I have to transform the spec's notion of unconsuming multiple characters into an implementation that can't unconsume more than one

[12:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders why on earth Anolis failing ow

[12:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*now

[12:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://pastebin.com/m7e39a551 — ideas

[12:36:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, but back to my original question. If we think outerHTML is worth implementing, why not do it for XML mode as well? Seems like all the parts are there anyway due to innerHTML being supported

[12:37:00.0000] <hallvors>
/me thinks outerHTML is mainly useful for debugging

[12:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That line is codec = inputstream.codecName(atributes["charset"])

[12:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: which is clearly not going to work because it spells "attributes" wrong

[12:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: so presumably it's never been tested

[12:38:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But the line numbers don't even match up

[12:38:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: so presumably nobody noticed it probably needs a "import inputstream" too

[12:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Don't they? That's what I get on line 588 in html5parser.py

[12:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't

[12:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm

[12:39:03.0000] <gsnedders>
oh, I'm just being stupid

[12:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It'd be good if you could add a test case to html5lib for that problem :-)

[12:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: So even more can fail? :)

[12:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: where should the import go? Just after import sys?

[12:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
which test dir should parser go under? tree-constructor?

[12:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: So it can be fixed and no longer fail :-)

[12:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That sounds fine for the import

[12:42:03.0000] <gsnedders>
and then how do I know which test[1-12].dat to put it in? :\

[12:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has never got this

[12:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I don't know if it's possible to test using that framework - I'd guess they're all Unicode strings, so you couldn't get it to give charEncoding[1] == "tentative" and trigger the bug

[12:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that is a bit of a problem

[12:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
now AttributeError: HTMLInputStream instance has no attribute 'changeEncoding'

[12:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
yay

[12:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me just changes it to raise NotImplementedError

[12:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Might be easier to just write the test case in Python, in tests/test_encoding.py (as a new method in Html5EncodingTestCase)

[12:46:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But that still doesn't help me

[12:46:03.0000] <Philip`>
or it might not; I don't know really

[12:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: i wouldn't mind doing it for XML too if you think we should (innerHTML is available in XML too)

[12:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders why it used to work but why it doesn't anymore

[12:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Just force everything to be UTF-8, then you can avoid all these encoding issues :-)

[12:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: nobody (other than you now) has asked for it though, and generally i'd rather people used something more compile-time-checked than strings in innerHTML/outerHTML

[12:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: (e.g. e4x, though that doesn't seem to be doign well)

[12:47:04.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, just seems silly to basically add |if (DocIsXML()) return;| to the top of the implementation of those functions

[12:48:00.0000] <sicking>
e4x is doomed IMHO

[12:48:01.0000] <sicking>
it's a good idea, but with a terrible execution

[12:49:00.0000] <sicking>
maybe someone could come up with a decent e5x that actually works more like JS

[12:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
well if we support this in XML instead of |if (DocIsXML()) return;| you'd have |if (DocIsXML()) { /* something much more complicated than return */; return; }| instead

[12:49:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: seems like jgraham broke it

[12:49:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That n00b.

[12:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: we if the goal is making the implementation easier, not supporting it is easier. :-)

[12:50:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i'd imagine not. I'd think that the code that implements this for HTML will work out of the box for XML too. Since that code will likely implement innerHTML as well

[12:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me realises this is the fifth programming language in which he has implemented entity parsing

[12:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: the idea is that if you have an XHTML-only UA, you don't need an HTML parser

[12:51:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, sure

[12:51:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, we'd do the same as for innerHTML and use the XML parser

[12:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[12:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
well then

[12:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
quite different code, no?

[12:52:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I guess you must be getting good at it now

[12:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"XML is neither more performant nor stricter than XML."

[12:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: innerHTML for HTML and XML are quite different in the spec

[12:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: oops

[12:55:00.0000] <sicking>
basically i'd structure the code as follows      |insertMarkupInContext(Node context, String markup) { DocumentFragment res; if (IsXML(context)) { res = parseUsingXMLParser(context, markup) } else { res = parseUsingHTMLParser(context, markup) } context.appendChild(res); }

[12:55:01.0000] <sicking>
and just call that function from innerHTML/outerHTML/insertAdjecentHTML

[12:56:00.0000] <sicking>
codereuse FTW

[12:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Not at all

[12:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Every implementation has been almost entirely different

[12:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: fair enough

[12:59:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, it'd be a bit more complicated since an insertion point is needed as well, but it seems trivial to add

[12:59:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i guess i don't care much, but as an implementor i'd argue that the cost is very low to implement. And it's always ugly with difference between HTML and XHTML IMHO

[13:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: well, send mail and i'll add it... i have nothing intrinsically against adding it, i just wanted to add the bare minimum when i added it

[13:00:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, cool

[13:04:00.0000] <dave_levin>
I don't know if this an html5 question or a webapps question.  When one clicks an <a href=url"... in a something like a webapp/prism, is there something to indicate to whether the new window should still be part of the webapp/prism or launch a new browser?

[13:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Hooray, numeric entities pass tests)

[13:06:00.0000] <dave_levin>
The closest thing I found was "sidebar" but that isn't right for what I'm asking about.

[13:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Hooray, all entities pass tests)

[13:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and now I'm not calling unget() at all)

[13:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: what tests?

[13:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: The ones in testdata/tokenizer

[13:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But only the entity ones? /me shrugs

[13:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis — tip is currently last call for blockers before shipping 1.0 :P

[13:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
oh, entities.dat

[13:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That simplifies things

[13:15:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: All of them, not only the entities ones

[13:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
right

[13:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Anolis 1.0 now available

[13:30:00.0000] <yecril71>
outerHTML is good for breaking MSHTML.

[13:30:01.0000] <yecril71>
It causes null pointer exception when applied carefully.

[13:32:00.0000] <yecril71>
A validating XML parser checks for attribute types.

[13:32:01.0000] <yecril71>
In the case of HTML, whether the attribute definition must be quoted or not does not depend on attribute type.

[13:33:00.0000] <yecril71>
It depends on the attribute value.

[13:33:01.0000] <yecril71>
And it is not a bottleneck.

[13:34:00.0000] <yecril71>
Parsing HTML or XML does not require a browser.

[13:35:00.0000] <yecril71>
<div><p>some text</div> does not trigger quirks mode.

[13:36:00.0000] <yecril71>
It is official: the closing tag is optional.

[13:36:01.0000] <yecril71>
<div><p>some text<p>some more text</div> is <div><p>some text</p ><p>some more text</p ></div>.

[13:36:02.0000] <yecril71>
There is no ambiguity.

[13:37:00.0000] <yecril71>
Strict checking means less errors but it also means less content.

[13:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wow. I've not blogged since September

[13:39:00.0000] <yecril71>
Because the authors will find it too much trouble to comply, or they will use Microsoft Word, which will only be for worse.

[13:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
yecril71: That does trigger quirks, as it has no doctype

[13:39:02.0000] <yecril71>
It was meant to be a fragment.

[13:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ah

[13:40:01.0000] <yecril71>
I am commenting on a recent message from Giovanni.

[13:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It wasn't clear in that email whether it was meant as a fragment or not either :)

[13:42:00.0000] <yecril71>
He explicitly stated that </div > triggered quirks mode in his universe.

[13:43:00.0000] <yecril71>
XHTML1.0 explicitly refers to HTML4 as semantic base.

[13:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You negatively rated r1235, which was my commit, not jgraham's

[13:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: it's somewhat up to the app

[13:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: html5 defines target="" which could be used as a key

[13:59:00.0000] <dave_levin>
Hixie: So if a given user agent (UA1), choose target="_SomeCoolNameHere", then the web app should modify the links to have this target *only* when running in UA1.  This is to avoid other user agents would interpret this as a name and replacing the contents of that window as links are clicked.  Right?

[14:03:00.0000] <yecril71>
I have read that FONT is more powerful than CSS with respect to size.

[14:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me appears to have made html5lib about 10% faster, but it's still spending about 10% of its time computing line numbers :-(

[14:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: sod

[14:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: OK, fixed

[14:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
"some_string == None" is surprisingly expensive compared to "some_string is None"

[14:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: i would not recommend minting a new value

[14:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: what's the diff between == and is?

[14:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
dave_levin: i would recommend supporting target="" as is, but saying that any links that would normally open a new browsing context should instead open a browser window

[14:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.google.com/search?q=python+%3D%3D+is

[14:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmph, stupid search engine :-(

[14:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
I assume the difference is that == does type coercion in some cases, and 'is' doesn't

[14:43:00.0000] <yecril71>
HTML5 can roughly describe some semantics but you cannot encode a semantic network in HTML.

[14:44:00.0000] <yecril71>
HTML can say <span class="Person" >John</span >, but it cannot encode that John likes Mary.

[14:45:00.0000] <yecril71>
And John can dislike Mary "on the fly".

[14:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
<span>John likes Mary</span> - that's encoding the semantics in HTML

[14:48:00.0000] <yecril71>
It is no better than "John likes Mary", i.e. no encoding.

[14:51:00.0000] <yecril71>
If Siemens is a name of a company, the browser can offer to look it up on Yellow Pages.

[14:52:00.0000] <yecril71>
If Siemens is a name of a person, the browser can offer to find his blog/avatar/whatever.

[14:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doubts browsers will ever implement such a thing

[14:52:02.0000] <yecril71>
If Siemens is a foreign word, the browser can offer to translate it.

[14:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
or if they do, they'll do it like IE8 does

[14:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
and just have the user select the text

[14:53:02.0000] <yecril71>
Microsoft Word (which is not a browser) has been doing that for some time now.

[14:53:03.0000] <yecril71>
It is called "intelligent tags" in MSspeak.

[14:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes OS X (and through it all browsers on OS X) support right click -> search with google

[14:55:00.0000] <yecril71>
Of course, but a specific search is sometimes better than a general search.

[14:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that Opera does too

[14:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
yecril71: The question is where do you search?

[14:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Also Opera provides a "search with" menu so you can select specialist search engines)

[14:56:00.0000] <yecril71>
Where to search depends on what to search for.

[14:56:01.0000] <yecril71>
And that is semantic information.

[14:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
If you're searching for a person, where do you search for them?

[14:57:00.0000] <yecril71>
E.g. in Windows Live registry.

[14:57:01.0000] <yecril71>
(depends what I need to do).

[14:57:02.0000] <yecril71>
Or in Wikipedia.

[14:57:03.0000] <gsnedders>
The problem is there are so many places you could search

[14:58:00.0000] <yecril71>
People have habits and places, the browser can learn about them.

[14:59:00.0000] <yecril71>
If I do not use Skype, and am unwilling to, searching the Skype registry is useless for me.

[14:59:01.0000] <yecril71>
But perhaps not for you.

[15:00:00.0000] <yecril71>
But that is too much detail; I wanted to say that it would be useless to search a registry for people when a translation is needed.

[15:00:01.0000] <yecril71>
And vice versa.

[15:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I think the other main issue is complexity inevitably adds cost, and all programs should run in zero time ideally

[15:01:01.0000] <yecril71>
Microsoft definitely does not go that way.

[15:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It's not true that all programs should run in zero time ideally

[15:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: What shouldn't>

[15:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: e.g. you might have a stopwatch program

[15:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*?

[15:02:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: zero CPU time?

[15:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me waits for Philip` to find an issue with that too

[15:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You might have an electric heater emulation program, which uses as much CPU time as possible in order to heat your room in the middle of winter when your central heating system has broken down

[15:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes he did once use a Power Mac G5 for exactly that use-case

[15:04:01.0000] <yecril71>
/me thinks he has such a program running on his machine

[15:04:02.0000] <gsnedders>
The only problem was it used CPU time making it slower for me to do what I wanted to do :(

[15:04:03.0000] <yecril71>
/me recalls it is called GIMPS

[15:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Also there are games, where you have 1/60 seconds of CPU time that you might as well use as much as possible to get the best possible output

[15:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That's what "nice" is for :-)

[15:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: nice has it's limitations :)

[15:05:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It was still slightly slower :P

[15:05:04.0000] <Philip`>
s/'//

[15:05:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is half asleep

[15:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Don't expect me to get stupid English right.

[15:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Apostrophe is possessive! "It's" therefore should be possessive!

[15:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
And so should "him's" and "me's"?

[15:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yes.

[15:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
and "you's"

[15:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Natural languages are stupid.

[15:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
and "us's"

[15:08:02.0000] <yecril71>
What about d�ya?

[15:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
d'ya's?

[15:08:04.0000] <Philip`>
Natural languages have pronouns, which are very useful, and which most programming languages (except Perl) seem to lack :-)

[15:08:05.0000] <yecril71>
And except AppleScript

[15:09:00.0000] <yecril71>
(and Visual Basic has ME)

[15:10:00.0000] <yecril71>
(and Smalltalk has yourself)

[15:10:01.0000] <yecril71>
Ergo, AS + VBS + Smalltalk = full grammar :-)

[15:13:00.0000] <takkaria>
Perl has pronouncs?

[15:13:01.0000] <heycam>
my and our

[15:13:02.0000] <yecril71>
Only typographers would say that B is not semantic.

[15:13:03.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: It has $_ which effectively means "it"

[15:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
true

[15:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
(since it's a way to refer to values without assigning a name to them)

[15:14:02.0000] <yecril71>
Bold has some meaning in real life too.

[15:14:03.0000] <heycam>
actually are "my" and "our" considered pronouns?  i guess not.  what part of speech are they?

[15:14:04.0000] <blooberry>
javascript has "this", but no "that"

[15:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
heycam: Even if they were pronouns in English, I wouldn't call them pronouns in Perl, since there's nothing pronounish about them except the interpretation of their names in English :-)

[15:16:01.0000] <heycam>
yes you're right

[15:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me uses arguments called 'that' quite often in C++ and JS

[15:17:00.0000] <yecril71>
So does /ME

[15:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ewww

[15:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
like Integer::add(Integer that) { this.n += that.n; } and so on

[15:17:03.0000] <gsnedders>
confusing.

[15:17:04.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, this->n or whatever

[15:17:05.0000] <gsnedders>
how about "somethingElse"?

[15:17:06.0000] <yecril71>
/me thinks it is impossible to /ME in Irish

[15:17:07.0000] <heycam>
i think i usually use "other" for those kinds of arguments

[15:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
IRC is English-centric

[15:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Integer::add(Integer that, Integer tother) { this->n += that.n + tother.n; }

[15:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
yecril71: Depending on your client you may be able to map another command to /me

[15:18:03.0000] <heycam>
/me wonders if the command should be /one

[15:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"We're one/But we're not the same"

[15:19:01.0000] <yecril71>
But I still cannot say

[15:19:02.0000] <yecril71>
Ta /ME go maith

[15:19:03.0000] <yecril71>
in /ME mode

[15:19:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me throws NotImplemented exception on the Irish

[15:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me heads off to bed

[15:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
For the, uh, third time to do.

OutOfPotatoesException

[15:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, "x is y" seems to do identity comparison rather than equality comparison

[15:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
(which seems fine when y is None, because there's only one None object)

[15:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but doesn't work in general if y is a string)

[15:26:00.0000] <yecril71>
Except if strings are interned.

[15:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
In general, they aren't

[15:26:02.0000] <takkaria>
in Lua, == is always identity, so it's always uberfast

[15:26:03.0000] <takkaria>
works nicely when all strings are interned

[15:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
But then you have to pay the cost of interning all your strings

[15:28:00.0000] <takkaria>
Lua does it very fast

[15:28:01.0000] <yecril71>
I would say it would give positive ROI for well-written code.

[15:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has only ever used Lua for writing a build script

[15:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems like a potentially interesting language

[15:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
lua's syntax baffles me

[15:30:01.0000] <takkaria>
it's a lovely language to work in, though it does lack a bit in utiity languages

[15:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
(it's the language for ion's configuration scripts)

[15:30:03.0000] <takkaria>
really?  I always thought it was pretty simple

[15:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i may have just not spent enough time learning it, or maybe ion does weird things to it

[15:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
but yeah

[15:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
it wasn't intuitive at all

[15:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
I enjoy writing in Lua when I can.  I wrote a fairly large project in it once, and have used it perephially in a bunch of things

[15:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me looks at his [actually not really "his", someone else wrote most of it] build script, and sees that it's 1268 lines, which seems like quite a bit

[15:37:00.0000] <yecril71>
Media-specific markup is good when it addresses media-specific properties.

[15:37:01.0000] <yecril71>
But then, since they are media-specific by definition, they do not need the media-specific tag at all.

[15:43:00.0000] <yecril71>
Calogero wanted to say that he has no idea how to map B et al. to real-world semantic notions.

[15:45:00.0000] <hallvors>
/me wonders why Hotmail's compose feature is broken in EVERY UA.. Fx3, Safari, IE8, Opera 10, Opera 9 - makes it sort of hard to figure out what is supposed to happen to enable the editor..

[15:45:01.0000] <yecril71>
And that he would like HTML to be more precise, and that they always bear the same meaning.

[15:47:00.0000] <yecril71>
I think link[sizes] should really use &times;

[15:47:01.0000] <yecril71>
You are encouraging bad practice here.

[15:52:00.0000] <yecril71>
Cameron�s algorithm leaves the case for a missing key unspecified.

[15:52:01.0000] <heycam>
yecril71, in web idl?  or in the suggested text in the mail?

[15:53:00.0000] <yecril71>
In the text.

[15:53:01.0000] <yecril71>
How is all this different from what a generic Object does?

[15:53:02.0000] <heycam>
how is it unspecified?

[15:54:00.0000] <yecril71>
What happens if the key is absent?

[15:54:01.0000] <yecril71>
You say "

[15:54:02.0000] <yecril71>
the entry whose name component"

[15:54:03.0000] <yecril71>
as if it always existed

[15:54:04.0000] <heycam>
that behaviour for retrieving a named property would only get run if there exists a named property on the object already

[15:55:00.0000] <heycam>
if you do dataset.abc, and abc wasn't the name of one of these named property (because it's defined at a given time what those properties are), then it's just a regular property lookup that will return undeifned

[15:55:01.0000] <heycam>
*undefined

[15:56:00.0000] <yecril71>
Got it.  How is it different from what Object has?

[15:57:00.0000] <heycam>
it's different because it invokes particular behaviour when named properties are get/set/etc., which for dataset results in attributes being get/set/removed

[15:57:01.0000] <heycam>
and for dataset, when setting the property the value is converted to a string

[15:57:02.0000] <yecril71>
I see, thanks.

http://www.w3.org/2008/12/17-w3m-irc.html

[20:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
oops

[20:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
sorry

[23:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: can you remind me where source for your spec splitter is?

[23:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and what structure does it expect in the source doc it's meant to split?

[00:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: http://code.google.com/p/html5/source/browse/trunk/spec-splitter/spec-splitter.py

[00:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
It expects the source document to be the HTML5 spec

[00:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
thought it may not be too hard to modify for other documents, mostly by modifying the split_exceptions variable (which defines some ids to split on, in addition to the default of all <h2>)

[00:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
*though

[01:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me apologises for breaking the meta tag handling in html5lib

[01:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
We need to implement the character encoding changing stuff

[01:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
Also maybe it would be a performance win to intern tag names and then compare with is rather than == in the tree builder?

[01:04:00.0000] <takkaria>
a massive perf win, I'd have thought

[01:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: I guess that depends on how slow interning strings is and whether Philip` implements it or me :)

[01:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
The entire tree builder has very little cost compared to the tokeniser, as far as I can tell

[01:07:00.0000] <takkaria>
Hubbub doesn't intern tag names yet, and some 20% of runtime is spent in string comparisons on tag names ATM, IIRC

[01:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually, I suppose "very little" might really mean "about a third of total runtime", which is still significant

[01:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
String comparison in Python is implemented in C, so it's relatively fast - I think it's all the Pythonic bits that are taking all the time

[01:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is pretty sure you can't solve a theroem

[01:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it not reasonable to say that e.g. Fermat's Last Theorem has been solved?

[02:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I guess that is common although I think it is inaccurate (should be Fermat's Last Theroem has been proven or something). However I'm the example in the spec that talks about "Solving Pythagoras' theorem" to mean "solving for the third side of a triangle given the other two sides" seems more wrong

[02:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me supposes it should have been called Fermat's Last Hypothesis

[02:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: The spec says it's 'solving for some variable', which seems a different meaning to simply 'solving'

[02:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It seems probably clear enough that it means it's taking an equational form of Pythagoras' Theorem and solving that equation in terms of some variable, which is what it's doing)

[03:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I could tell what it was talking about but I still don't think that a theroem is something you can solve.

[05:32:00.0000] <yecril71>
A popup window can accomodate to page size.

[05:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
html5lib r1233 takes 16.1 seconds to parse the HTML5 spec

[05:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
html5lib r1241 takes 13.1 seconds to parse the HTML5 spec

[05:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose that's not an entirely worthless improvement

[05:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: !

[05:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
you spec splitter, can you remind me where the source is?

[05:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081218#l-244

[05:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, thanks

[05:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dunno why I didn't see that before

[05:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, so it splits on all H2s? (plus whatever IDs are in split_exceptions)

[05:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes (except in things with class="no-toc")

[05:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, I mean:

[05:46:03.0000] <Philip`>
Yes (except for H2s with class="no-toc")

[05:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, I don't mean that

[05:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes (except for anything before the first H2 without class="no-toc")

[05:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, html5lib parses in 12.2 seconds if I make it use a string for input (instead of a stream)

[05:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
?!

[05:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
That seems odd. I thought we had to work to make strings look like file-like objects

[05:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
stringio?

[05:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
iirc

[05:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Uh, I mean: ...if I make it use a string for input (instead of a stream) and change HTMLInputStream to behave more efficiently when it's got a string as input

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
(There's no point messing around with chunks and unget buffers if you've already got the entire string stored in memory)

[05:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well that sounds more sensible ;)

[05:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
If I also disable the position-recording code, it parses in 11.4 seconds

[05:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Might it be reasonable to add a constructor argument to disable position computation, which people can use if they're sure never going to care about positions (e.g. they're not going to look at parse error messages)?

[05:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Can you put a profile somewhere?

[05:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: How much do you unget in the worst cases? Enough that a double buffer for the file IO wouldn't be practical?

[05:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders hat a double buffer is

[06:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Something like http://philip.html5.org/misc/html5lib-profile-r1241.txt ?

[06:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: One character

[06:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (That's from running parse.py --no-html -t)

[06:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (with the input being the HTML5 spec from 25 July 2008)

[06:02:01.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: (in this case) keeping two buffers so you can read into one and still have the other available for use. That way you always have old data available for ungetting

[06:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that the current tokeniser updatePosition function is pretty much entirely unrelated to the function that was called updatePosition in the last-but-one revision of html5lib

[06:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Now it's the thing that counts newlines in the string returned from charsUntil, to update the position information)

[06:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Like that but sorted by total time rather than cumulative time, I guess

[06:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: http://philip.html5.org/misc/html5lib-profile-r1241-2.txt ?

[06:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
(There is a sadly a lack of blatant bottlenecks :-( )

[06:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
who's up for a naming debate? http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6298

[06:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm all out of bikes to shed

[06:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: HTML5 (All Your Error Are Belong To Us) should cover it I think

[06:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Indeed. Maybe we could just get Hixie to remove stuff from the spec so we have fewer tokens to process

[06:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or make everything valid so you don't need to spend time reporting errors

[06:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: It spends almost no time reporting errors in my profiling, since the input only has one error (missing doctype)

[06:26:01.0000] <zcorpan>
oh. ok

[06:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's intentional that I'm profiling the parsing of the spec, rather than of more realistic web content, because my use case for html5lib is parsing the HTML5 spec and so that's what I want to optimise for)

[06:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
(If someone else wants to use html5lib for parsing loads of invalid content, they can optimise those parts themselves :-) )

[06:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: He's already added 25% more bytes to the spec than the version I've been using :-(

[06:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Well that's no good at all.

[06:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Actually I've mostly been testing with the first 10^4 lines of the spec, because I'm too lazy to wait for the entire thing to be parsed every time I make a change)

[06:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
I do not think authors think about tags at all, they just want to publish information.

[06:52:00.0000] <yecril71>
18 comparisons would be enough for 2^17 insertion modes.

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
"if an end user finds an error, he probably will report it to the owner of the web site, who in turn will report it (quite angrily) to web designer." - I don't think that's true - if I find an error on a web site, I just moan about it on IRC

[06:54:00.0000] <yecril71>
I sometimes do when the site steps on my toes too heavily.

[06:54:01.0000] <yecril71>
But I am not an ordinary end user anyway.

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
If it's an ill-formed XML error, I'd find it hard to report to the owner even if I wanted to, because it would prevent me from reading their site and finding the contact details

[06:55:01.0000] <yecril71>
You can look for @ in the page source.

[06:56:00.0000] <yecril71>
(if it is not disguised as something else, that is)

[06:56:01.0000] <yecril71>
Frex, I reported the CSS proble with the spec to Ian, and he boldly ignored my complaint.

[06:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm far too lazy to do that

[06:57:01.0000] <yecril71>
I have had more success with less knowledgeable webmasters though :-)

[06:58:00.0000] <yecril71>
Especially if they boast the W3C badge.

[07:00:00.0000] <yecril71>
Is cross-domain xsl:import guaranteed to throw?

[07:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me remembers (a very long time ago) using imdb.com as an example of why the <image> tag has to be supported, and someone saying that they were going to notify the IMDB web people about the problem as a demonstration that it's possible to clean up that kind of legacy mistake

[07:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
...and imdb.com still uses <image> today :-(

[07:01:00.0000] <yecril71>
Ian belongs to the minority who reply there is a problem with my browser.

[07:02:00.0000] <yecril71>
I have just got a similar response from Apple.

[07:02:01.0000] <yecril71>
But Ian was at least right, while Apple is wrong.

[07:06:00.0000] <yecril71>
html5lib is an implementation of HTML5 parser.

[07:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me is aware of that :-p

[07:07:00.0000] <yecril71>
<div><p>some text<p>some more text</p></p></div> is correct but it amounts to three paragraphs instead of two.

[07:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
An unmatched </p> is correct?

[07:08:00.0000] <yecril71>
Isn�t it?

[07:09:00.0000] <yecril71>
The opening tag is optional so it can be inserted when needed.

[07:10:00.0000] <yecril71>
I do not think optional tags are a result of guessing.

[07:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If the stack of open elements does not have an element in scope with the same tag name as that of the token, then this is a parse error; act as if a start tag with the tag name p had been seen, then reprocess the current token.

[07:11:01.0000] <yecril71>
I think they are rather straightforward to invent.

[07:11:02.0000] <yecril71>
And what about <div >&nbsp;</p >?

[07:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's <div>[text:&nbsp;]<p></p> as far as I can see

[07:13:00.0000] <yecril71>
That would be a change from HTML4 IMHO.

[07:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yecril71: <p> is not optional

[07:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, it was mandatory in html4 too

[07:15:00.0000] <yecril71>
/me is ashamed for talking rubbish

[07:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
You cannot check every input after publishing; there are exponentially many ways to arrange things.

[07:19:00.0000] <yecril71>
Giovanni should be given the title Master of Colourful Narration.

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that his view of the world has been entirely wrong

[07:20:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What was it this time, Philip`?

[07:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
I thought calling charsUntil() would be faster than repeatedly calling char(), but it turns out that it's not :-(

[07:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
at least for short strings

[07:20:04.0000] <Philip`>
like tag names

[07:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh. That sucks. Can't we make charsUntil faster

[07:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
?

[07:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
If I'm not doing something stupid, removing the charsUntil from tagNameState makes parsing go ~3% faster

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It seems there's a tradeoff in charsUntil between being efficient for short strings and being efficient for long strings

[07:22:01.0000] <yecril71>
I actually need HTML.

[07:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Currently it constructs a regex for each set of characters, and then matches that against the input document

[07:23:01.0000] <yecril71>
Typing </td ><td > and </li ><li > makes me sick.

[07:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
which I suppose is adding some fixed overhead that doesn't pay off when you're typically going to be finding two characters

[07:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though it's very helpful in dataState, where you might be finding hundreds of characters before the next '<' or '&')

[07:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: How about a non-regexp version of charsUntil that just has a while loop or something?

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: How would we decide which version of charsUntil to call?

[07:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Assume that character strings are typically long and markup strings are typically short?

[07:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
data-* (and maybe aria?) might be trouble

[07:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: They are rather uncommon though

[07:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like the cross-over point is when you're matching six characters

[07:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Below that, a loop is faster; above that, the regex is faster)

[07:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so use loop for tag names and attribute names, maybe unquoted attribute value...?

[07:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think I'd prefer the idea of gathering statistics rather than guessing :-)

[07:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Only problem is I don't know how to do that

[07:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me was looking at http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/survey/2007-07-17/analyse.cgi/index

[07:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
Does Python provide an easy way to find your caller's function name?

[07:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
When I tried, it was all hacky and ugly, looking at stack frames

[07:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
sys._getframe(1).f_code.co_name - that seems to work

[07:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me would just have parsed something and done the stats on the resulting tree

[07:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
(But I would like an instrumented version of html5lib that showed the call sequence and arguments for any input so that you could tell what was going wrong)

[07:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
In fact I sort of wrote that once for making graphs of the phase transitions but I deleted it because it was even more ugly than normal

[07:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: The tree doesn't give you the right information about charsUntil

[07:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. it won't tell you that the whitespace bit in dataState will read an average of 3.3 characters

[07:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
(because in the tree it'll be merged with all the other characters)

[07:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Right, it maybe doesn't give you everything you want but it allows determinations of the length of e.g. comments, tag names, etc.

[07:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
You are also limited by the input data that you measure, regardless of what the method is

[07:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: Philip` only cares about the html5 spec, remember :)

[07:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
We could just rewrite it to be a C extension

[07:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That'd be quick.

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
A pure Python parser is more usable than one that relies on C

[07:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: A C one is quicker.

[08:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Lengths of comments aren't quite the right information to gather - it's the length of the strings between hyphens in comments that matters, since that's what charUntil collects

[08:31:00.0000] <yecril71>
I think user agents that do not expect HTML as their primary medium should not be bound by the HTML specification at all.

[08:32:00.0000] <yecril71>
Like when the content type is something other than text/html.

[08:33:00.0000] <yecril71>
My legal theory is that section 3.3.2 applies only to a transfor served as text/html to a user agent expecting HTML.

[08:33:01.0000] <yecril71>
XSLT processors are unaffected.

[08:34:00.0000] <yecril71>
Why anyone should do this remains a mystery to me.

[08:35:00.0000] <yecril71>
Another possibility is when elements from XHTML namespace are embedded in XML documents that are styled with CSS.

[08:36:00.0000] <yecril71>
In that case, behaviour may be taken from the XHTML definition.

[08:36:01.0000] <yecril71>
That would be true particularly for form controls and scripts, because XML does not allow scripts.

[08:37:00.0000] <yecril71>
(or rather, does not provide for scripts or any kind of interactivity explicitly.)

[08:38:00.0000] <yecril71>
But even then, XSLT has a tendency of scattering the constituents of the output page across templates,

[08:39:00.0000] <yecril71>
so the page as viewed from XSLT would be rather useless.

[08:40:00.0000] <yecril71>
Stylesheet is a legacy word to describe a transformation.

[08:40:01.0000] <yecril71>
It is really not appropriate any more.

[08:41:00.0000] <yecril71>
That does not mean that "transformation sheet" is good.

[08:42:00.0000] <yecril71>
It is a transformation, certainly not a sheet.

[08:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: how should i phrase it then?

[08:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, turns out that tagNameState is the only thing that gets any practical benefit from not using charsUntil

[09:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I would probably circumvent the problem by using a different example e.g. solving the roots of a quadratic using the quadratic formula

[09:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me gives up for now, before he introduces more pointless bugs into html5lib

[09:01:00.0000] <jcranmer>
ironic that I was just talking about square roots in another channel

[09:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
Otherwise I would say "using Pythagoras' theroem to solve for the hypotenuse <var>a</var> of a triangle of sides <var>b</var> and <var>c</var>"

[09:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Wouldn't the quadratic formula take millions of lines of MathML and be impossible to read?

[09:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: that works, i'll use that

[09:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yes

[09:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
At least it's possible for a human to read the Pythagoras one

[09:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: How many lines depends on how much whitespace you put in it :)

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if text in examples like "flavours of ice cream" should be translated to en-US

[09:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: However the first law of MathML is that the total amount of markup needed to express a given concept is greater than the total amount of markup it was possible to use to express that concept

[09:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: :)

[09:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/it was/anyone thought it was/

[09:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
Anyway the example is clearly misleading, because you should expect 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> flavours of ice cream since they can choose whether or not to include each piped-in ingredient

[09:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
(the first law of ontent MathML is roughly similar but with the words "much much greater")

[09:16:00.0000] <yecril71>
You cannot solve roots and you cannot solve a hypotenuse.

[09:16:01.0000] <yecril71>
You can only solve problems, including special kinds of equations.

[09:17:00.0000] <yecril71>
You calculate roots and the length of the hypotenuse.

[09:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
Er yeah, I meant to say "solve /for/ the roots"

[09:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me appears to be parsing the spec in 12.6s now

[09:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
solve what?

[09:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
for the roots :)

[09:18:02.0000] <jgraham>
Or, if you like, the quadratic

[09:19:00.0000] <yecril71>
Solve what for the roots?

[09:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
The quadtratic, whatever it happens to be

[09:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
*quadratic

[09:19:03.0000] <yecril71>
Quadratic equation?

[09:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
yes. An equation can be solved. A root is a particular point on the solution.

[09:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hence "solving for the roots is both common and makes sense :)"

[09:20:02.0000] <yecril71>
A root is a particular member OF the solution.

[09:20:03.0000] <yecril71>
The solution is a set of numbers, and calling them points is an exaggeration.

[09:21:00.0000] <yecril71>
"solving for the roots" misses the object.

[09:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems equally valid to see the solution as a (discontinuous) line

[09:22:00.0000] <yecril71>
That is redundant information.

[09:22:01.0000] <yecril71>
{(x1, 0), (x2, 0)} is much better handled as {x1, x2}

[09:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well the roots are a special case you could equally say solve y=f(x) for y=5 or whatever

[09:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/case/case;/

[09:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
yecril71: There's no reason for a line to exist in a two-dimensional space

[09:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/exist/only exist/

[09:26:00.0000] <yecril71>
f(x)=5 are not roots.  f(x)-5 are roots, but it is a different equation.

[09:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The algorithm for setting document.domain should probably mention the fact that setting document.domain to a tld (or maybe a domain on the public suffix list?) is a security error

[09:29:01.0000] <jgraham>

[09:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'll be adding that. send mail. :-)

Hixie: s/theroem/theorem/

[10:26:00.0000] <yecril71>
What does it mean that HTML is not written by hand?  I am confused.

[10:26:01.0000] <yecril71>
My idea of writing HTML "not by hand" is to use XSLT or document.write.

[10:26:02.0000] <yecril71>
But the sources for these are again written by hand.

[10:32:00.0000] <jcranmer>
yecril71: WYSIWYG?

[10:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
It means whatever the person using that phrase wishes it to mean, which is usually not quite the same as what anyone else thinks it means

[10:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: replaceHeadings is now in the normal Anolis repo

[10:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
WYSIWYG is deplorable in case of HTML.

[10:51:00.0000] <yecril71>
WYSINWTRG.

[10:55:00.0000] <yecril71>
And the documents thus produced usually have the MOTL.

[11:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: should aside not be a sectioning root?

[11:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: ?

[11:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: surely having headers in aside elements show up in outlines doesn't make sense?

[11:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
why not?

[11:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
"surely" isn't a good argument :-)

[11:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
"surely".

[11:34:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[11:34:04.0000] <gsnedders>
If you look at the sidebars on most blogs, those should be an aside, right?

[11:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Surely headers in them don't make sense in an outline?

[11:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
oh woops.

[11:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I just got pimpmyspec into an infinite loop :)

[11:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Update the copy of Anolis!

[11:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me makes html5lib do a lot more memory copying every time you call unget(), which results in 2% faster parsing

[12:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, cool.

[14:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
I love how OpenOffice.org Calc makes it impossible for me to change a cell value from "foo" to "Foo", if there are other cells in the same column that also say "foo"

[15:03:00.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/help/faq/download_and_install_realplayer.shtml BBC provides a special real player. I think they had to do it because of their contract

[15:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
karlcow: That's only for radio, not TV

[15:04:01.0000] <karlcow>
though I don't know if it's still working with bbc programs. I have not used it for a very long time.

[15:04:02.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: ah thanks :)

[15:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
The iPlayer provides nice simple DRM-free MP3 versions of radio programmes to iPhone users, so the same iPhone-masquerading tool can download them too :-)

[15:05:01.0000] <Philip`>

Philip`: you still awake?

[16:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Yes

[16:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I'm getting an error from spec splitter, trying to figure out to fix it

[16:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if e.getnext().tag == 'h2' and 'no-toc' not in (e.getnext().get('class') or '').split(' '):

[16:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tag'

[16:48:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I have lxml 2.something installed

[16:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
2.1.3

[16:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: What input are you using?

[16:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
my document-conformance draft

[16:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does it work if you run it with http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/source ?

[16:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: trying now

[16:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
no, I get:

[16:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
    del short_header[3:]

[16:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
TypeError: 'NoneType' object does not support item deletion

[16:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, though it does work if I run it on the "index" file (instead of the "source" file)

[16:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Oops

[16:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
I should have said index

[16:59:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
?

[17:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, index file works

[17:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
If it doesn't work on your document, I guess your document is insufficiently similar to HTML5

[17:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
but there's no kind of documentation or anything to describe what structure is expected

[17:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
For the original error you mentioned, it looks like that would only fail if it couldn't find an <h2> child of <body> that didn't have class=no-toc

[17:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: OK

[17:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: <h2> child of <body>, or <h2> descendant of <body>?

[17:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[17:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Child

[17:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I see

[17:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, I can see I'll need to mess around with it a bit to see if I can make it work with my doc

[17:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not at all designed as a general purpose tool

[17:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it'll probably need various tweaks

[17:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yep, I can see now from looking at the code.. But I don't think it'll be too much work to make the tweaks I need

[17:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone seen aaronl recently?

[17:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
or know how to contact him?

[18:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: Aaron Leventhal?

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[18:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
you got his e-mail address?

"While [noembed] can be positioned anywhere on the page, it is a good idea to include it as a child element of embed so that it is clear to assistive technologies that a text alternative is associated with the embed element it describes." -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/H46.html

[23:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>

[23:29:02.0000] <heycam>
zcorpan_, and the point is the <embed> is an empty element, so can't have children?

[23:29:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
the point is they ignored my comment

[23:29:04.0000] <heycam>
:(

[23:29:05.0000] <heycam>
is that the final version of that document?

[23:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes, it's a REC now

[23:30:01.0000] <heycam>
that one you linked to is a NOTE though, so perhaps that can be updated easily

[23:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe

[00:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
this is a nice article: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/5_exciting_things_in_html_5.php

[00:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(which probably most here have seen already)

[01:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: pms.n should have the laetst anolis now

[02:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Totally the wrong pklace to ask but does anyone have any ideas why I can't run Firefox 2 under Ubuntu 8.10 (it dies when trying to show the main window with an unhelpful X11 error; the profilemanager window appears fine)

[02:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, is it possible the profile its using is corrupt in some way?  have you tried creating a new profile and running it?

[02:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
usually, whenever I get Firefox crashing regularly, it's because there's something wrong with the profile

[02:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
My router's configuration interface says: <tr> <script language="javascript">document.write('<td onmouseover="this.style.backgroundColor='+mouseover+'" onmouseout="this.style.backgroundColor='+mouseout+'" onclick=parent.location.href="/status.stm">');</script> <a class="section" href="sindex.stm" target="main1"><p class=p1>Security</p></a> </td> </tr>

[02:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is fun

[03:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also it doesn't work in Opera - something to do with changing two frames' location simultaneously when you click causes it to not load sindex.stm (and therefore it's impossible to access the Security section)

[03:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, please file a bug about that

[03:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me will have to try to produce a reproducible test case, and is too lazy to do that right now

[03:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, just make your router config page publicly accessible and I could do that from here :-)

[03:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I would be happy to do that, but I can't get to the configuration page that lets me make it publicly accessible :-p

[03:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me will look at it later today anyway

[04:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Yes, I tried that

[05:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I can't work out how to reproduce the router's behaviour in Firefox

[05:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
is that because Firefox doesn't suffer from the same bug as Opera, or is it returning different pages to it or something?

[05:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Did you have an archive of the whole acid 3 test somewhere?

[05:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, yeah, on Opera's t server

[05:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
I think that one might be a little out of date though.

[05:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I mean I'm trying to make a simplified test case based on the HTML that the router serves (to Firefox, but I don't think it varies between UAs), but it doesn't have the same behaviour in Firefox that the real router's HTML has

[05:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, see t/core/standards/acid3/

[05:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Thanks

[05:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I'll update it now to the latest version. Just give me a few minutes

[05:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, the test has been updated

[05:31:00.0000] <wilhelm_>
http://people.opera.com/wilhelmja/nested-form.html <- what is correct behaviour here? Firefox submits with both buttons. Opera does not.

[05:33:00.0000] <olliej>
wilhelm_: webkit appears to only submit on the first

[05:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
wilhelm_, Firefox 3 doesn't submit with the second button

[05:33:02.0000] <Lachy>
the reason is because of the way nested forms are parsed

[05:33:03.0000] <Lachy>
if you look at the DOM, you'll see that the second button isn't within the form

[05:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
wilhelm_, http://james.html5.org/cgi-bin/parsetree/parsetree.py?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fpeople.opera.com%2Fwilhelmja%2Fnested-form.html

[05:36:00.0000] <wilhelm_>
Indeed. Firefox did submit with both buttons a few changes ago, though. Looks like I reduced the test too much. (c:

[05:36:01.0000] <wilhelm_>
/me looks at it again.

[05:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm the HTML5 spec still defines the form elment pointer but doesn't seem to use it anywhere

[05:42:00.0000] <wilhelm_>
There. Reload and try again now. Firefox submits on button 2, Opera does not.

[05:42:01.0000] <wilhelm_>
(I removed a <div> too much :)

[05:44:00.0000] <olliej>
wilhelm_: webkit submits on both

[05:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess IE submits on both?

[05:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, yes, IE and Opera give the same results as each other, and Firefox and Webkit give the opposite result

[05:47:01.0000] <wilhelm_>
IE6 gives the same result as Opera.

[05:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
if the html5lib parse tree viewer is giving the correct result, then Opera matches HTML5.

[05:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I was more concerned that HTML5 might be wrong :)

[05:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
IE8's DOM includes the second submit button within the form, but still doesn't let it submit it

[05:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
If HTML5 matches IE then it seems OK

[05:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
IE's behaviour is buggy, so HTML5 shouldn't match it

[05:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Not IE8, IE6 (in this case)

[05:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, oh, ok. I don't have IE6 to test with, so I don't know what it's result is

[05:51:00.0000] <wilhelm_>
Lachy: IE6 and IE7 do not submit #2.

[05:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, that matches the IE8 result, and Opera, so that's good enough

[05:54:00.0000] <wilhelm_>
Yep. Answers my question. I was wondering if we were doing something wrong here. (c:

[06:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/dump/ecmascript-whitespace.txt

[07:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm. a multiline comment in ecmascript is considered a linebreak for the purposes of semicolon insertion

[07:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
although ie and webkit don't get that right

[08:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/5_exciting_things_in_html_5.php#comment-120375 - "It's possible to write in HTML5 now if you ignore IE's inabilty to render XML properly. I've wrote 3 sites in it now, http://ortatherox.com is a pretty good example."

Philip`: I don't think I said otherwise :)

[09:00:00.0000] <erlehmann>
well, firefox doesn't even display the <footer> element on my blog

[09:01:00.0000] <erlehmann>
comments ? the article is failing itself - code as graphics, yay !

[09:02:00.0000] <erlehmann>

tun, getan, welcome to conjugations :-)

[01:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't remember the word "tun"

[01:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but I only spent two years learning German)

[01:55:00.0000] <jwalden>
I spent four, but only two of those were from a competent teacher

[01:55:01.0000] <jwalden>
and those last two sort of turned me off to continuing in college

[01:56:00.0000] <jwalden>
not that I had time, given the other classes I wanted to take

[04:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the "best" way to align multiline text to the bottom of the view port with CSS these days (assuming that the content as a whole fits in the view port)?

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the implementation status of http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#text-outline ?

[06:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So, apparently 2009 is going to be the year of Linux of the desktop.

[06:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Why am I sure I've heard such statements before?

I figured they had already postponed it to 2010 :)

Amusing

[06:40:02.0000] <krijnh>
Sorry :)

[06:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, absolute positioning should do the trick. bottom: 0; position: absolute

[06:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, assuming the text can be selected from CSS, so you might need an element around it

[06:43:00.0000] <krijnh>
BenMillard: fixed (hope it doesn't wreck others)

[06:47:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, I did a bit more to the IRC demos: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/irc-logs/

[06:48:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, ticking boxes in the "day" demo now toggles the highlighting of lines

[06:48:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, a dictionary of element and property names from HTML5 might make wrapping <code> around stuff feasible, although perhaps not worthwhile :)

[06:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(and for CSS, HTTP, SVG, MathML, etc, etc...)

[06:49:01.0000] <BenMillard>
words ending () are usually function names, words containing . are usually code as well

[06:49:02.0000] <BenMillard>
words with camelCase

[06:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
join/part messages seem less than useful...maybe they should be hidden by default?

[06:50:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(and other status messages, for that matter)

/me is upgrading his install of Opera for Windows.

[06:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hmm, the Opera installer has "Set Opera as default browser" ticked by default. But since it isn't my current default browser and I don't want it to be. Good thing I'm too cynical to think upgrading would be "click Next a few times without thinking"!

[06:57:01.0000] <BenMillard>
although that's how I remember it being with previous updates, which was nice

[08:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish CSS had a font size unit relative to the height or width of the view port

[08:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, can you show what you're working on?

[08:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: not much to *show*, but I can *say* that I'm considering how to use CSS to format captions if the CSS viewport exactly overlays the video frame

[08:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, I see.

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>

[20:21:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
does anyone here know what's up with accesskeys in html5? any chance they're making it back into the spec?

[21:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
raspberry-lemon: we're (i'm) not sure what to do with them

[21:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
raspberry-lemon: as implemented in browsers today and as defined in html4, they're a disaster

[21:39:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
Hixie: i see... reading up on the problems now

[21:42:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
i didn't even know they'd been removed from html5 before i tried to validate my wiki a few hours ago

[21:42:01.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
and had absolutely no idea the implementations were so bad..

[21:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
basically they either are undiscoverable for users, or they clash with other existing shortcuts, or any number of other problems

[08:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't get this post. http://yorksranter.wordpress.com/2008/12/21/fruit-of-the-poisoned-tree/ - it's quoted that Hixie quote from the last "This Week in HTML5" about onbeforeunload, and sent a pingback to the whatwg blog, but the Hixie quote seems to be completely unrelated to the post itself.

[08:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It seems the point is that there are fundamental flaws running through the whole system (of government and its handling of terrorism suspects / of scripting in HTML5), and it's really hard to fix ("I really have no idea how we would go about reversing this") because you can't fix a small piece of the problem without getting bogged down in the more fundamental problems that underlie it

[08:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Each attempted fix reveals a problem in a wider system, requiring an even more difficult fix

/me both has too much hair and too little hair

[09:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if gsnedders is referring only to hair on his head

[09:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is indeed referring only to hair on his head

[09:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders if the too much hair could be moved to the places with too little hair and create a balance

[09:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, I have too much hair insofar as it gets in the way, and not enough insofar as I can't tie it back

[10:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Does anyone have a clue why http://gsnedders.com is so screwed in IE?

[10:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
lang="en-gb-x-sneddy"

[10:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether to take Dashiva seriously

[10:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The DOM being produced is all that renders on screen

[11:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So all the unknown elements and their contents are missing.

[11:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Not all.

[11:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The pagination appears

[11:04:02.0000] <yecril71>
What Giovanni describes smells XHTML2.

[11:04:03.0000] <yecril71>
This is a good language for restricted purposes but it is not as good for being on the Web.

[11:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me suggests gsnedders shaves his hair all off, and that he shouldn't consider the ability to tie it back a goal

[11:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: That's just a regular <p> isn't it?

[11:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, removing Document.createElement("header") fixes it all :\

[11:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: And it also seems to only be within divs, which goes against my memory of it :)

[11:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>

/me wonders how hard it'll be to update his OCaml meta-tokeniser to match the current spec

[11:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me gets off to a bad start, since it appears he installed a new version of OCaml some time ago, and now all the libraries are incompatible and have to be reinstalled

on my site <http://dieweltistgarnichtso.net> the footer element is only displayed when being enclosed in a div or something

anyone knows how to change that behaviour ? i mean its like arbitrary XML isnt rendered at all.

Paged media is *hard*. I wish Prince was more affordable and had a GUI that showed the reformatted pages in near-real-time when tweaking the CSS or cropping images

How fun, the OCaml JSON parser doesn't understand surrogates and just throws an exception

[12:52:00.0000] <Philip`>

one would think that laying out books with images on a computer were a solved problem by now...

hsivonen, I expect it is to people who are trained. :)

[13:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: nope. my mother has previously bought the service from trained people, and it wasn't a solved problem then, either

[13:17:01.0000] <BenMillard>
oh

Hooray, now my OCaml code passes all of the tokeniser tests (excluding the content model / escape flag ones)

[16:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's sometimes horrendously inefficient, e.g. every time it consumes an entity it sorts the whole entity list by length and then iterates through to find the first match, but that's okay because efficient is a non-goal

I'm not talking about premature optimisation :)

Overly late optimisation is a problem too - you have to be careful to get it just right :-)

Philip`: that's the entire state-transition diagram for HTML5, I take it?  beats out ECMA-262 for simplicity as I recall

[00:42:00.0000] <yecril71>
The advantage of having window for global scope is that otherwise you would not be able to differentiate between local and global.

[00:44:00.0000] <yecril71>
It does not cover all identifiers, e.g. it does not apply to constants and class names, but it is useful nevertheless.

[00:52:00.0000] <yecril71>
Modern blogs and wikis allow users to embed images in editable content.

[01:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
jwalden: That's just for the tokeniser

okay, I *think* that's analogous

[04:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Any good ideas about how to implement the character encoding reparsing stuff in html5lib?

[04:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/encoding/encoding switching/

[04:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I know almost entirely nothing about how character encoding works in HTML5 or html5lib or Python, so I have no ideas :-(

[04:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: What I know: If we hit a meta element we need to either be sure that all the characters consumed so far have the same encoding as the previous characters or restart the parsing. The underlying file-like object may not natively support reseeking to the beginning so we either have to reread it or buffer the whole thing ourselves. 

[04:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
We already try to buffer the first 10KB of the stream as soon as you start parsing it

[04:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: We don't want to re-read it if it's a urllib object of a POST request, for example

[04:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: So we probably need to buffer it

[04:54:02.0000] <jgraham>
I _think_ we need to buffer the raw character data before replacment characters are inserted and line breaks are normalised

[04:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Oh, that sounds true, and we only buffer the post-preprocessed input stream

[04:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is there some fixed limit on how much would need to be buffered?

[04:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: AFAIK, no

[04:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
So maybe we should make a BufferedStream type that adds a .tell() and .seek() method to non-buffered streams

[04:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
By storing all the read data in a buffer

[04:56:03.0000] <jgraham>
(there is something like this already but it is not quite what we want)

[04:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
So for a document that never confidently declares a character encoding, the entire thing will be buffered in memory?

[04:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
In that case, we could just slurp the entire stream into a single string at the start, and then parse that

[04:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh but then there is another problem because when we hit the <meta> element we don't know where in the unprocessed stream we are

[04:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
(assuming we want to read that in chunks for the sake of efficiency)

[04:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why does it matter where we are in the unprocessed stream?

[04:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
If the encoding changes incompatibly, it would just have to seek to 0 and start again, and it wouldn't matter where it had changed

[04:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[05:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
It matters if we want to continue without reparisng if the encoding is compatible

[05:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it needs to work out whether anything has changed incompatibly, up to the end of the meta charset element

[05:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
which means it needs to know where it's read up to

[05:00:03.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, and that too

[05:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be easier if html5lib decided not to be a "user agent [that] supports changing the converter on the fly"

[05:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, we could ignore that for now

[05:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
(but it would be a perf. in if we supported it)

[05:01:03.0000] <jgraham>
/in/win/

[05:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
(assuming supporting it didn't place an undue burden on the implementation)

[05:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (Probably not much of one, since meta charset will typically be near the start of the document and it wouldn't have to reparse much at all)

[05:02:02.0000] <takkaria>
Hubbub doesn't allow changing the convertor on the fly, it just reparses

[05:02:03.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: Is its input a stream or a string or something?

[05:03:00.0000] <takkaria>
yes, a string, so not a particularly useful comment from me there. :)

[05:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Is there a reason why html5lib should use streams rather than slurping everything into a string?

[05:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
Memory is cheap, after all :-)

[05:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It seems nicer? (especially for long strings). Also, we could, in principle, throw the buffer away once the encoding confidence was certian

[05:06:00.0000] <takkaria>
more properly, what hubbub actually does is call a "character encoding change" hook, which then can set a flag on the tokeniser so that it stops parsing and returns the new character encoding

[05:06:01.0000] <takkaria>
and then the app that's using hubbub has to send the data in again

[05:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me mostly just wants to reduce the overhead of calling char(), to make things much faster, but that seems independent of the encoding-related buffering/reparsing issue since it's on the opposite side of the decoder

[05:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
BufferedStream with .seek_to_zero() (and reparse when the encoding changes, don't do the complex changing-on-the-fly thing) sounds like the sanest approach, I guess

[05:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if hsivonen solved this issue

[05:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: OK, I will look at that at some point soon

[05:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
(like maybe this evening)

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for Java, I figured that it happens too often that the buffering in the character decoder causes non-ASCII to be buffered by the time of changing encodings

[05:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so I decided to remove support for changing decoders in place

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
instead, the java.io-based driver restarts the parse unconditionally when changing encodings

[05:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I intend to implement the same strategy for Gecko, but the current Gecko behavior is different, so I'm not sure if the spec as currently written is completely Web-compatible here

[05:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
We'll see

[05:18:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: What does GEcko do?

[05:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I don't understand what it does.

[05:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: my hypothesis is that it reparses if scripts haven't run and changes decoders in place if scripts have run

[06:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip` or someone - let me know if I just horribly broke html5lib in some way and I'll back out the change (I checked in more than I intended to anyway)

[06:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It already fails enough test cases that I probably wouldn't notice if all the rest started breaking too :-)

[06:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: BTW, I think it should be a little faster now

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees ihatexml.py

[08:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me generates twelve thousand tokeniser test cases, and finds one bug in html5lib

[08:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Then you don't have enough test cases

[08:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I can't think of any more test cases to add, since I have one case for each interesting character that can occur from every tokeniser state

[08:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Do you test every possible unicode character in every state?

[08:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, you don't.

[08:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: No, because those aren't interesting characters

[08:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That doesn't mean there aren't interesting bugs

[08:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It means it's very unlikely that there will be bugs, because I test all the characters that a sane tokeniser would depend on, and every other character is equivalent and has no special processing

[08:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You are assuming tokenizers are sane, which is very naïve

[09:19:00.0000] <takkaria>
Philip`: please do make those testcases public. :)

[09:25:00.0000] <jruderman_>
Philip`: i bet you'd find more bugs by fuzzing than by trying to be exhaustive wrt one aspect of parsing

[10:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: I think it'd be a bad idea to add them all into html5lib, but I could just upload them to the web somewhere

[10:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Add them all into html5lib, please.

[10:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
jruderman_: This seems like a case where exhaustiveness is relatively feasible, since there's an algorithm with a well-defined series of states and state transitions, and most implementations are pretty close to that definition, so it works at providing decent coverage of the implementations

[10:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Why?

[10:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Also: No

[10:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Because then we have test cases located in one place

[10:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: But if there's twelve thousand tokeniser tests, and it takes ages to run them all, people will run the tests less often, which is detrimental

[10:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But if they aren't there then they won't be wrong, which is detrimental

[10:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/wrong/run/

[10:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Interesting typo.

[10:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It's only detrimental if they would have caught a bug that the remaining tests would have missed

[10:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and most of these tests are very redundant)

[10:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
(e.g. there are tests for "<!DOCTYPEa", "<!DOCTYPEb", "<!DOCTYPEy", "<!DOCTYPEz", "<!DOCTYPEA", ...)

[10:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also, if I did check in all these tests, and then the spec changed, someone would find hundreds of errors and get really annoyed trying to manually fix all the test cases

[10:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oops, there's only actually about one thousand tests, since I didn't sufficiently uniquify them

[10:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That certainly isn't too many.

[11:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ergh. This is going to be horrible. Having the same @cite over and over again.

Is it reasonable to write notes for English in HTML?

[12:30:00.0000] <jruderman_>
"for English"? as in classroom lecture notes?

[12:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jruderman_: Well, not lecture notes, but for my final year of school (in the en-gb meaning of school)

[12:31:00.0000] <jruderman_>
i used HTML for a few papers in college

[12:31:01.0000] <jruderman_>
and TeX for others

[12:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
These are notes for my dissertation: I intend on doing the dissertation itself using XeTeX

[12:32:00.0000] <jruderman_>
i liked using HTML because i could easily tweak styles across an entire document. wysiwyg word processors usually don't do that well.

[12:33:00.0000] <jruderman_>
for example, if i needed to pad my paper a little, it was a simple matter of p { line-height: 1.05em; }

[12:33:01.0000] <jruderman_>
slightly less obvious than changing the font size ;)

[12:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
For notes that isn't so needed :)

[12:33:03.0000] <jruderman_>
hehe

[12:34:00.0000] <jruderman_>
still useful to be able to change the styles of all the headings at once, though

[12:34:01.0000] <jruderman_>
another advantage of HTML is that you can put the notes on your web site and not worry about what software viewers have; )

[12:37:00.0000] <Philip`>

[12:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>

[12:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
Why?

[12:37:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Can't so easily build TOCs for text/plain :)

[12:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why do notes need a TOC?

Philip`: "The cite element represents the title of a work"

[12:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
Who cares what specs say?

[12:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
You're citing stuff, so use <cite> - it makes perfect sense

gsnedders: my view about marking up a bibliography: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/thesis/html5-conformance-checker#references

gsnedders: they are bad for googling and disapproved by feminists

[13:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: also, emphasizing author names over titles of works sucks when you are mostly referencing specs and technical documents some of which conceal their authors/editors

[13:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I'm referencing a book for English work, so that isn't relevant :)

[13:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: you could still make the argument that in cultural contexts where the surname of the author is the surname of the spouse, abbreviating the first name of the author diminishes the personal identifier of the author to one letter, which is uncool

/me suggests focussing on the parts of the dissertation that are likely to result in marks :-)

[13:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: at least it's positive that they approve of listing the ISBN

[13:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: They don't, I ignored that part.

[13:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[13:28:03.0000] <hsivonen>
oh well

[13:28:04.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: They do however, as with most of the style guide, give a lot more flexibility than almost anything else

[13:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yeah, I should :)

[13:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: "A person's name is not the title of a work "

[13:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Lolita's name is the title of the book about her!

[13:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Only if you do a plain string comparison and ignore the context and semantics

[13:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Oh, sure. :P

[13:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(and yes, I am doing my dissertation on such books)

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
can someone explain to me IE's behavior with that test

[21:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
is the HTML5 SQL database feature supported in Mozilla trunk now?

[21:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I noticed http://twitter.com/millenomi/status/1072607044

[21:39:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
"@factoryjoe It's just HTML5 databases put to use. Already available in Safari 3.0 and up and recent Firefoxes."

[21:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ne'er mind

[21:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the Opera 10 "Download All Snapshots" feature doesn't seem to be working for me

[21:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see from http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2008/12/19/the-christmas-edition that a new snapshot is available

[21:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I have the "download all snapshots" option selected

[21:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but if I do "check for updates", Opera tells me I already have the latest version

[22:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess Edward Yang's been making progress on his HTML5 parser in PHP

[22:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yesterday: http://twitter.com/ezyang/status/1071810135 "The score... Edward: 425, HTML5: 739 + 8 infinite loops."

[22:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
today about 30 minutes ago: http://twitter.com/ezyang/status/1073793318 "Final score... Edward: 1108, HTML5: 0. Of course, that's ignoring tests of parse errors, doctypes and self-closed tags."

[23:21:00.0000] <yecril71>
The instruction

[23:21:01.0000] <yecril71>
w.w = window

[23:21:02.0000] <yecril71>
creates a proxy.

[23:22:00.0000] <yecril71>
Immediately after that, !(w.w === window).

[23:22:01.0000] <yecril71>
Because w.w is a proxy to window.

[23:23:00.0000] <yecril71>
It has nothing to do with document.open.

[23:25:00.0000] <yecril71>
U+000B is a range.

[23:26:00.0000] <yecril71>
It begins with U+000B and ends with U+000B.

[23:26:01.0000] <yecril71>
(Or it can be trivially coalesced to a range, if you prefer).

[23:28:00.0000] <yecril71>
I can see no necessity to delete an image for a page that the user failed to save on the server.

[23:28:01.0000] <yecril71>
Once the user uploads the image to the server, it can remain there until the user explicitly requests its deletion.

[23:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
yecril71: window.w = window; window.w === window;

[23:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
is true

[23:43:00.0000] <yecril71>
However, w.w !== window.

[23:43:01.0000] <yecril71>
window.w = window is equivalent to w = window.

[23:43:02.0000] <yecril71>
w.w = window is different.

[23:46:00.0000] <weinig>
yecril71: what is the first w

[23:46:01.0000] <weinig>
yecril71: cause it looks like that should be a reference error

[23:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
window.w = window; w.w === window  is true

[23:48:00.0000] <yecril71>
The first w is a parameter to b.

[23:49:00.0000] <weinig>
ok, this is about Hixie's test

[23:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
alert(w.w === window) shows false at my place, immediately after the assignment.

[23:51:00.0000] <yecril71>
window.w = window is equivalent to w = window.

[23:52:00.0000] <yecril71>
I think Hixie needs some sleep.

[23:54:00.0000] <yecril71>
undefined == undefined, as of the Microsoft engine.

[23:56:00.0000] <yecril71>
"window.window.window" is not the same as "".

[23:56:01.0000] <yecril71>
"window.window.window." is.

[23:56:02.0000] <yecril71>
But only in the global context.

[23:57:00.0000] <jwalden_>
I think none of you are being particularly clear

[23:57:01.0000] <jwalden_>
:-P

[23:57:02.0000] <yecril71>
Prefixing with "window." can be used to single out global variables.

[23:58:00.0000] <yecril71>
Dead season for thinking :-P

[00:00:00.0000] <yecril71>
"window" does not belong to javascript.  WSH has no "window".

[00:00:01.0000] <jwalden_>
/me nitpickingly wishes that page closed the document it opened so the browser throbber would stop

[02:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, it's interesting that the some of the things you listed technically aren't HTML

[02:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: In what sense?

[02:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
Offline Storage is a DOM API, MathML and SVG

[02:57:00.0000] <annevk>
offline storage is also <html manifest> ...

[02:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Well it's in "HTML5". It's only "not HTML" if you try to make some distinction between HTML the markup language and HTML the application platform

[02:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, that would be covered by offline applications in his list

[02:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
(also the ability to embed SVG+MathML is a feature of the markup language so I disagree with that regardless of definitions)

[02:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/that/that not being technically not HTML/

[02:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/not being/being/

[03:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I guess Web Sockets should make the top 5 but I don't kno what to drop...)

[03:34:00.0000] <annevk>
parsing rules

[03:34:01.0000] <annevk>
they're boring :)

[03:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Yeah, but "better browser interoperability" is interesting

[03:36:00.0000] <annevk>
not as interesting as web sockets :p

[03:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
I was thinking "Rich Form Controls" were sort of covered on the original list so they maybe didn't need to be covered again

[03:38:01.0000] <hendry>
annevk: have you seen the socket demo here http://www.jnext.org/

[04:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: MathML+SVG in text/html doesn't seem like it'd be an exciting feature to many people - almost nobody even uses non-inline SVG, despite that being easy and useful and well supported

[04:07:01.0000] <olliej>
yoyo annevk 

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Also I don't see why anyone would care about parsing rules, because they can just write proper valid pseudo-XHTML like they always have and it'll work fine in current browsers

[04:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Things that are exciting to people here are probably almost completely separate from what is exciting to normal people :-)

[04:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: IIRC there was a bug in an early version of Google maps that was due to a difference in parsing comments before the HTML element or somesuch

[04:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Most people don't write Google Maps

[04:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yes, but most people don't write site x for any value of x

[04:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Most people don't write sites of equivalent complexity to Google Maps

[04:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, most people don't get too excited about the parsing rules themselves. They will only get indirectly appreciate them once they start seeing real practical results from more interoperable browsers

[04:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
s/only get/only/

[04:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
I know :) But I thought that high on authors list of complaints about HTML was poor interoperability 

[04:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think I've encountered DOM uninteroperability far more than parsing uninteroperability

[04:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
CSS and DOM interop are bigger issues

[04:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
Obviouslyt HTML5 won't help with the CSS or DOM problems but it seems like something that helps interoperability would be seen as good

[04:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
cool things are HTML5 features. see http://www.google.com/search?q=%22html5+geolocation%22

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as for quality and popularity, see w3schools :-(

[04:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: "helps interoperability" seems too abstract a concept to get excited about - people will only care when it's solving the real problems they encounter, which are much more likely to be CSS and DOM problems

[04:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
where do people get the idea that geolocation is part of HTML5?

[04:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Everything cool happening in the web is part of HTML5

[04:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
(actually geolocation was floated on WHATWG list at one point so that might be why)

[04:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me hopes browsers could detect when they are running on a desktop PC, and therefore are unlikely to be moved, so if they don't have a GPS receiver then they could simply ask the user to enter their address once and then they will be able to implement the Geolocation API

[04:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and for laptops they could just ask for the address of each wireless access point you connect to)

[04:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, or they could use wi-fi access point triangulation techniques

[04:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hit an interoperability issue in Prince yesterday

[04:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
It raised an OutOfCash eception on your bank account?

[04:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
*exception

[04:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That sounds like something that would need added OS and driver support (and hardware support too?), so it's unlikely to happen any time soon except on mobile devices

[04:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, AFAIK, it only needs software that works like Navizon and an internet connection

[07:39:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, Skyhook already works on laptops, no?

[07:41:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, maybe not

[07:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Sounds like it could do - it seems to just look at the signal strength of visible WAPs and compare against a database of predetermined locations of known WAPs, and doesn't need any lower-level access to the wireless hardware

[07:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
I was assuming "wi-fi access point triangulation" was something that depended more on physical properties of the wireless signal or something

[07:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
There are places with enough known WAPs that that works?

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Presumably only in cities with enough customers to justify the data collection to seed the system

[07:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
(then it sounds like it'll update the location database dynamically when users encounter new unknown WAPs)

[07:53:02.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, apparently so

[07:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
You only have to make it work in the cities where tech reviewers live :-)

[07:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I guess that is true. Maybe just "return Silicon Valley" would be a good v1 implementation, with "improved accuracy" being a v2 feature

[07:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I guess it would be just as useful as an implementation that required an actual wifi signal around here)

[07:59:00.0000] <gavin>
/me wonders how it uniquely identifies access points

[07:59:01.0000] <gavin>
I suppose just using the MAC address is probably good enough, but I wonder if they try using more than that to avoid problems with spoofing

[08:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that Skyhook do indeed show a map of San Fransisco as their example of urban coverage

[08:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
and that there is no coverage here :)

[08:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
gavin: http://www.skyhookwireless.com/howitworks/submit_ap.php implies that it is just MAC address

[08:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
My computer seems to like identifying WAPs by their BSSID

[08:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
which appears to be typically the same as the MAC

[08:06:00.0000] <gavin>
/me helps them out by submitting the ~6 AP MAC addresses he can currently see from Orleans, Ontario

[08:06:01.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if there's an "open data" equivalent

[08:07:00.0000] <gavin>
hmm, that would be cool

[08:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me should submit the 11 WAPs he can see from his small village in England, while claiming to be in New York

[08:13:00.0000] <gavin>
hmm, they already have data for "six Canadian markets where the majority of that nation’s people live" apparently

[08:14:00.0000] <gavin>
/me decides he doesn't want to help them out

[08:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has visions of lots of canadians living in market stalls

[08:45:00.0000] <annevk>

krijnh, possible new slogan for the logs: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081223#l-205

[08:48:00.0000] <annevk>
krijnh, there should be a CSS rule for .flagged:target

[08:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, you can sneak extra rules into the "CSS for ..." textboxes on the IRC Logs front page

[08:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, I'm using this in "CSS for lines at you": background: #efe; } li.flagged { background: #9f9; } li:target { background: #fa0; 

[08:54:01.0000] <krijnh>
BenMillard: sorry I didn't respond to your log improvements a few days back

[08:54:02.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, hey no worries :)

[08:54:03.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, sure, but I want krijnh to fix it :p

[08:55:00.0000] <krijnh>
Color?

[08:55:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, does having a checkbox instead of a coloured <span> help? http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/irc-logs/day

[08:56:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, I like your color scheme

[08:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
yay :)

[08:57:01.0000] <krijnh>
/me too :)

[08:57:02.0000] <BenMillard>
there's demos for other types of page if you click "IRC Logs" or chop the end off the URL

[08:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>

[08:58:01.0000] <krijnh>
Just no time to implement/copy them yet

[08:58:02.0000] <BenMillard>
yeah, modifying irc logging systems when it's nearly Xmas would be pretty sad :P

[08:59:00.0000] <krijnh>
Correct ;)

[08:59:01.0000] <annevk>
hey, I was considering hacking on my blog!

[09:01:00.0000] <krijnh>
I'm...My girlfriend is considering visiting our parents ;)

[09:01:01.0000] <annevk>
my parents considered as much for me :p

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if working on tokenisers over Christmas would also be considered pretty sad :-)

[09:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I'll probably be doing family stuff

[09:31:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, jgraham and I did that (or at least close to Christmas) two years ago

[09:32:00.0000] <annevk>
not sure if that answers your question though :)

[11:18:00.0000] <takkaria>

[11:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i've run into a lot of people who think that "html5" is the name for the open web standards stack

[12:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm…

[12:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me still hasn't worked out how to organize his English notes

[12:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I want to have a quote, and notes related to that quote

[12:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And then I want to categorize those quotes

[12:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The only problem is some quotes need to be in multiple categories

[12:13:01.0000] <takkaria>
can you not use a text editor like everyone else? :)

[12:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: :P

[12:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: My problem is I don't want to duplicate the notes.

[12:14:00.0000] <jmb>
ah. you want transclusion </ted nelson>

[12:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Use tags, not categories

[12:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But I can't be bothered writing code :P

[12:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Then you could make a tag cloud! It'd be great)

[12:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Ideally I want the quotes sorted by page reference

[12:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Does IE6 support XPath?

[12:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What would be the most performant way of doing something like //dd[starts-with(., "Themes: ")]?

[12:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
/<dd>Themes: /.match(document.body.innerHTML)

[13:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
While actually returning the dd element?

[13:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
/<dd>Themes: (.*?)<\/dd>/.match(document.body.innerHTML)

[13:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The sad thing is I know that probably will really be the quickest solution

[13:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's no need to overcomplicate things :-)

[13:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me gets "TypeError: Result of expression '/<dd>Themes: (.*?)<\/dd>/.match' [undefined] is not a function."

[13:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
I can never remember how JS RegExps work - check the documentation :-p

[13:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I can never remember how Python 're' works either)

[13:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
(But I can always remember in Perl that you just do $foo =~ /bar/ which is nice and easy and doesn't involve forgettable method names)

[13:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
String.match or RegExp.exec

[13:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
document.body.innerHTML.match(/<dd>Themes: (.*)/g) returns stuff

[13:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
document.body.innerHTML.match(/<dd>Themes: (.*)<\/dd>/g) does not

[13:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
. doesn't match new lines, does it?

[13:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
It only does if you add the /s flag

[13:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
(You probably want .*? rather than .* otherwise it'll break if you have more than one dd element)

[13:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me could just go for the http://pastie.org/345813 suggestion

[13:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
How boring

[13:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[13:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
That for loop seems like a good example of premature optimisation

[13:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me didn't write it

[13:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"iirc, for in has problems in IE"

[13:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me was thinking of the use of 'max', rather than of anything involving 'for in'

[13:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, that

[13:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Who wants to bet I write more code for my English dissertation notes than I do for my computing project over the holidays? :)

[13:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
And more English for your computing project than for your English dissertation notes?

[13:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Nah

[13:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is there any sort of mapping structure in JS?

[13:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: What do you mean by 'mapping'?

[13:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: like a Python dict, a key/value mapping structure

[13:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: {'key':'value'}

[13:41:03.0000] <gsnedders>
heh

[13:41:04.0000] <Philip`>
and thing.key = value

[13:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
JS barely has any structures *except* the mapping structure :-)

[13:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is there anyway to get an array of keys?

[13:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
var ks = []; for (var k in thing) ks.push(k); is the only way I know of

[13:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, sux :\

[13:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
or [k for (k in thing)] if you're using Firefox, maybe

[13:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I need more than Fx support :P

[13:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(I need it to work on school computers running IE6)

[13:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Just write a function keys(obj) { ... } and then you'll never have to worry about it again

[13:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How do you do a string replace in Javascript (a non-regex one)?

[13:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me concludes you don't

[13:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
Wild guess: thing.replace("foo", "bar")

[13:51:00.0000] <takkaria>
you know, using plain text works everywhere

[13:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: If you really want it to work everywhere, you'd have more luck with paper than with plain text

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I guess you'd start to hit issues with water, though.

[13:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has more bug reports on SP due to XML parse errors

[13:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Can you finish XML5, please?

[14:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That's not much of a problem - you can get waterproof paper, and then you can write with it underwater by cutting it into stencilled letter shapes

[14:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders WTF is going on

[14:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://pastebin.com/m7a92716b — how come the two alerts aren't the same?

[14:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Like, "Themes: Protagonist's Introspection" v. "undefined"

[14:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Because in the second one, element === 0

[14:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
why!?

[14:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Because 'for in' iterates over keys, not values

[14:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
oh.

[14:09:04.0000] <gsnedders>
duh.

[14:09:05.0000] <Philip`>
and the key is 0

[14:09:06.0000] <Philip`>
(and the value is what you want)

[14:09:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeh.

[14:09:08.0000] <jruderman>
for each ... in ;)

[14:09:09.0000] <Philip`>
You could use 'for each' if you only want to work in Firefox :-)

[14:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And if I want it to work in anything else for(i=0…)

[14:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
?

[14:10:02.0000] <Philip`>
That's probably the easiest way

[14:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
meh

[14:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
lovely Javascript…

[14:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's your fault for using crippled browsers that don't support modern JS features :-p

[14:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[14:56:00.0000] <annevk>
twitter works

[15:09:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, "WHATWG" could be it once we take over the appropriate specs

[15:09:01.0000] <annevk>
/me blinks

[15:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[15:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me becomes unhappy with Perl's JSON module turning "10.00" into 10.00 and therefore losing information

[15:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me also doesn't like how the current version of the module is totally different to the earlier version that he has installed


2008-12-24
[17:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me connects just to mention that he to plans to work on html parsing over Christmas but doesn't think that has much bearning on whether it is considered sad

[17:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
Also BenMillard should consider redesigning the WHATWG blog because it is currently really ugly

[19:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I'm not a designer but I could try applying the IRC log demos look-and-feel to it :)

[19:33:01.0000] <BenMillard>
or rather, create a demo of that

[21:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, how about this? http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/whatwg-blog/

[21:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"entry" should have the sidebar same as any other page, imho

[21:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I removed a <style> block from the markup which was adding a background image, other than that the markup remains the same

[22:47:00.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, if you read the archives (and I think you do), blog design looks great!

[22:47:01.0000] <annevk>
definitely a lot better than having the default

[22:56:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, setAttribute behaves differently in HTML and XML, dataset is defined in terms of setAttribute and does not do anything with the string beforehand (e.g. lowercasing)

[22:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
dataset isn't defined in terms of setAttribute.

[22:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
(well, except for the exception stuff)

[22:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
(but that's unrelated to what we're talking about here)

[22:57:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, that's confusing

[22:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
it is?

[22:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
why is it conusing

[22:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
what is confusing

[22:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused.

[23:00:00.0000] <annevk>
the "If setAttribute() would have raised an exception when setting an attribute with the name name, then this must raise the same exception." made me think the algorithm was the same as for setAttribute...

[23:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
it would have said so if it was

[23:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[23:01:02.0000] <annevk>
true

[23:02:00.0000] <annevk>
hopefully DOM core defines an abstract way of setting an attribute that we could use << zcorpan

[23:02:01.0000] <annevk>
that would also avoid potential confusion if setAttribute was prototyped or something like that

[23:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
that would be nice

[23:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i worked out why that guy used such long paragraphs

[23:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
he in fact broke his paragraphs as much as he could

[23:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's just that some of his sentences were very long

[23:18:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: hmmm

[23:18:01.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: i'm not sure if hedral's technique counts as smart or stupid

[23:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it works

[23:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
stupid would be just bashing his head against the frame

[23:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. something that doesn't work

[23:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
it may not be optimal, though...

[23:19:04.0000] <olliej>
hehehe

[23:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey where in the spec does it say that <script> elements inserted by innerHTML don't execute?

[23:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
did i accidentally drop that at some point?

[23:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh nm found it

[23:26:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: hehe

[23:40:00.0000] <annevk>
olliej, is that thing from yesterday still important?

[23:41:00.0000] <olliej>
annevk: i was wondering what your/opera's opinion of drawImage(<video>,...) is?

[23:41:01.0000] <olliej>
on canvasrenderingcontext

[23:46:00.0000] <olliej>
annevk: the ffx nightlies already support it, and i have a prototype implementation for webkit

[23:48:00.0000] <annevk>
I think we're planning on doing it too

[23:49:00.0000] <annevk>
Maybe not when we first publicly release our <video> impl though

[23:50:00.0000] <olliej>
you haven't yet?

[23:51:00.0000] <olliej>
/me is surprised

[23:51:01.0000] <olliej>
does that mean safari is still the only release browser with <video> support?

[00:02:00.0000] <annevk>
olliej, I think so

[00:02:01.0000] <annevk>
well, I'm pretty sure, unless Firefox 3.1 is final now...

[00:03:00.0000] <olliej>
annevk: looks like 3.1 is the release for <video> -- i guess that means that opera needs an additional 2.1 revisions ;)

[00:05:00.0000] <olliej>
/me hides from the opera engineer who has to deal with UA shenanigans

[00:05:01.0000] <annevk>
heh

[00:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: any clues if the Opera 10 "Auto Update" feature actually works? Particularly "Download All Snapshots"? .. It doesn't seem to be working for me.

[00:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe I'm doing soemthing wrong

[00:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
opera 10 actually finally has an autoupdate?

[00:14:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, I don't, sorry

[00:14:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, that's the idea

[00:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
holy crap

[00:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
took y'all long enough :-P

[00:14:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: in theory..

[00:14:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
in practice, it ain't actually working for me at least

[00:14:06.0000] <Hixie>
man, i might actually upgrade opera soon then

[00:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there a "beta channel" like for other browsers?

[00:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
or a dev channel or something?

[00:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: you mean IRC?

[00:17:01.0000] <annevk>
haha: http://websocket.org/

[00:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
no i mean like with firefox and chrome you can have it autoupdate along different channels

[00:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
depending on how bleeding edge you want to be

[00:17:04.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, yeah, there's a setting

[00:17:05.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[00:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me sees that http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2008/12/19/the-christmas-edition has been updated

[00:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
"Update 2008-12-23: The builds haves not been added to the autoupdate server yet due to people going on vacation. Sorry for the false start, but we'll get back to you with automatic updates as soon as possible (depending on when people return from vacation)."

[00:19:00.0000] <annevk>
/me was just about to quote that

[00:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: those dudes do love web sockets

[01:06:00.0000] <annevk>
<noframes> can be present without <frameset> ?

[01:06:01.0000] <annevk>
so it seems

[01:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: That looks much better than the current look. Personally I would make it even more minimal, in the style of http://tomayko.com/ or 

[01:28:00.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, I think you should blow up the font size a bit though

[01:28:01.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, just realized I had zoom set to 150 when I first viewed it

[01:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
<noframes> is always non-conforming

[01:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
as is <frameset>

[01:37:02.0000] <annevk>
oops, I meant in HTML4

[01:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[01:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.crummy.com/2008/12/23/1 - "... html5lib (not as slow as I'd thought) ..." - that sounds encouraging

[01:45:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm a bit confused as to how compliant he's planning to be with HTML5

[02:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ooo… xkcd Christmas special!

[03:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me gets horridly broken quotes when trying to reply to Hixie's latest public-html message

[03:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah my bad

[03:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
pine doesn't do encodings well

[03:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
so anything non-ascii gets screwd up when i reply

[03:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me struggles on with Javascript

[03:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what he's doing wrong now

[03:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
oh, I see

[03:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
.length and not .len

[03:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What's the easiest to get all elements in the current dt/dd group when you have a dd element?

[03:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: maybe Alpine does better with encodings

[03:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: ?

[03:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: Alpine is a fork of Pine, under a free license and with some enhancements, I think

[03:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Replacement of Pine

[03:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh, i see

[03:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah maybe

[03:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: One of the main points is Unicode support :P

[03:28:04.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, doesn't Pine support UTF-8?

[03:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really care too much :-)

[03:28:06.0000] <gsnedders>
/me makes sure to send Hixie as much email as possible that he can't read because it's Unicode :)

[03:28:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
Doug McIlroy uses Alpine, so it must be good :)

[03:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
actually, fwiw, I remember now that it's Brian Kernighan that uses Alpine, not McIlroy

[03:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Does <http://pastebin.com/m11e9d4f2> seem sane for getting a dl group?

[03:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Linus Torvalds uses Alpine, IIRC

[03:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Write all your emails using Unicode's full-width letters, claiming it's so that readers will get the proper monospaced rendering even if they've got a silly proportional font

[03:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: :)

[03:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Now, what about that code? :P

[03:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
surely no one attempts to read plain text email using a proportional font?! That's crazy cause it makes ASCII art render poorly

[03:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Do Javascript arrays have any equiv of Python's list.extend?

[03:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, what does list.extend do?

[03:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
it takes one parameter, another list, and adds every member of that list to the list on which you call it

[03:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think there's a join() method for that

[03:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finally finds in MDC what he wants

[03:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
concat

[03:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
join turns it into a string

[03:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat

[03:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Gmail uses a proportional font

[03:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
doesn't it have an option to use a monospace font?

[03:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Why is that not listed in <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Array>!?

[03:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, because they moved them all to https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, you call it both storage and storageArea...

[03:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
oops

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
fixed

[03:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[03:56:00.0000] <annevk>
the title attribute in the IDL is still wrong...

[03:56:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, ^

[03:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
crap

[03:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok will fix shortly, hold on

[03:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[04:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs

[04:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wishes toggling display of an element was easier in JS

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
element.style.display = (element.style.display == 'none' ? 'inherit' : 'none'); I think

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
or $(element).toggle()

[04:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That doesn't work when I need to explicitly set a special display value

[04:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me writes a more complex function that caches the display value

[04:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has mostly given up doing everything by hand and uses jQuery nowadays

[04:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it bad I've written more code for my English dissertation than for my computing project?

[04:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
<html xmlns:spaces xmlns:Web class="ClientFramework" web:culture="en-GB"> is amusing in far too many ways

[04:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me would need so much custom code for this project that using JQuery for one or two functions wouldn't be worthwhile

[04:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Yes, it is

[04:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me prefers the term "correct" rather than "pedantic"

[04:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wants to add a youN00b exception to Anolis

[04:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: just toggle the 'hidden' attribute and have  [hidden] { display: none }  in the CSS

[04:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's Compliant HTML5! (tm)

[04:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Does that work in IE6?

[04:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
if you're trying to make something work in IE6, you have bigger problems

[04:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[04:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
in ie6, just use a class instead

[04:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Thankfully, I'm not trying to do very much

[04:36:03.0000] <Philip`>
In IE6, use *{display:expr(this.getAttribute('hidden')?'none':'inherit'}

[04:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: thanks for the data, i don't see anything there that argues for spec changes, so i won't reply

/me sees "SVG Tiny 1.2 is a W3C Recommendation" while brushing his teeth

[04:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder where the test cases are

[04:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether Hixie typed that while brushing his teeth

[04:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can only find about 600 tests

[04:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
which doesn't seem right

[04:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
how did they test a 434 page spec with only 600 tests?

[04:51:00.0000] <takkaria>
the spec is obviously very verbose and repetetive :)

[04:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Quite easily and quickly I expect.

[04:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok bed time for real

[04:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How does "magicStringSets[magicStrings[i]] = getMagicStringSet(magicStrings[i] + ":");" add one to i?

[04:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
I guess other groups simply don't think they need 20,000 TCs for a spec that size, or the spec just doesn't define all that much that is testable.

[04:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe each test case tests many features of the spec

[06:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: The <script language> data is kind of suggesting a spec change

[08:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TRs aren't being served :\

[08:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How can you see if something is in a JS array?

[08:31:00.0000] <gavin>
ar.indexOf(something) != -1

[08:31:01.0000] <gavin>
though it doesn't work in IE

[08:31:02.0000] <gavin>
otherwise, there's no good way other than iterating

[08:31:03.0000] <gsnedders>
ergh. Yay. :\

[08:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I need to find all the items in one array that aren't in another n arrays

[08:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But if I'm going to have to iterate this much, it may be quicker to just hide everything and then show it again.

[08:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Actually, it'll take the some number of iterations just more re-drawing

[08:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: x={}; for each (i in one_array) x[i]=1; for each (i in the other n arrays) delete x[i]; for (i in x) do something with i

[09:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, the main text should be around 12px which is actually towards the larger end of what's common on the web

[09:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, maybe your using a laptop with a small screen and very high pixel density?

[09:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, any more minimal and you can't tell things apart...but feel free to download the files and create your own demo

[09:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ultimately the style of the WHATWG Blog is determined by who does the work on it

[09:37:01.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, I just like larger fonts, e.g. simply the browser default of 16px

[09:37:02.0000] <annevk>
(my laptop has a large widescreen with very high resolution)

[09:37:03.0000] <annevk>
"large" and "very high"

[09:38:00.0000] <annevk>
just trying to influence you :)

[09:38:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, then you should use a browser which respects your DPI setting, imho, then the whole web will get scaled as you want it

[09:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
does anything break when you view it at 150% zoom?

[09:39:01.0000] <annevk>
nope, but I rather not change settings

[09:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
well, if you apply the theme to the blog then you can use as much or as little as you like from the demo :)

[09:40:01.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, family dinner is starting, cya round

[10:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Does that change it to a string?

[11:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't get why this isn't working

[11:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
oh dud.

[11:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*duh

[11:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me realizes

[11:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
anyone have IE6?

[11:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me gets an error in IE7

[11:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"object doesn't support this property or method" on a line/character combination which is LF

[11:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It seems to be failing on quotes = document.getElementById("quotes");

[11:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
now "textcontent is null or not an object"

[11:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
yay :\

[12:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
IE doesn't/didn't support .textContent

[12:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
(assuming that's what you meant)

[12:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
as of what version?

[12:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: No idea. I'm pretty sure 6 doesn't support it

[12:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is currently trying 7

[12:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, it simply doesn't support it at all

[12:03:02.0000] <jgraham>
(it looks like you could use something called .innerText for IE)

[12:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it not the case that DOM prototypes don't exist in IE?

[12:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, they don't.

[12:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Now failing on for (item in magicStringSets[magicStrings[k]])

[12:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Can't use item as a variable

[12:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
.checked on input@type=checkbox is reset on adding it to a document in IE

[13:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i couldn't work out how to decide what strings would be downplayed if we allow javascript1.x.

[13:14:00.0000] <ap>
hi Hixie - do you have a moment for an AppCache question?

[13:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[13:15:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I can't understand what this note means: "The Document with which the ApplicationCache object is associated can only itself be associated with an application cache if it is in a top-level browsing context."

[13:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's a lie

[13:16:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: is it that appcache used to be tied to a top-level context, but it no longer is?

[13:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[13:16:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: thanks! would you like me to send an e-mail about this?

[13:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've just removed the note

[13:17:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: one more question, about application cache selection algorithm - what are the examples of "f the resource is not being loaded as part of navigation of a browsing context" there?

[13:18:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I'm having hard time fully understanding this section, as "the resource being downloaded" is not defined in it

[13:19:00.0000] <ap>
s/downloaded/loaded/

[13:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. a document downloaded by XHR

[13:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's always a resource being downloaded when the algorithm is invoked

[13:21:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: will application cache selection algorithm even be invoked for XHR?

[13:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
sure, it's invoked by the HTML parser

[13:22:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: ah well, it's just that we don't parse HTML there, only XML

[13:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
with xhr2 you will

[13:23:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: am I right that document.write cannot be used to make an html tag with a manifest?

[13:25:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: as for "there's always a resource being downloaded when the algorithm is invoked" - what about XMLParser?

[13:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
document.write() could be used to generate a manifest if the docment was document.open()ed first, iirc

[13:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
as in, if it all came from document.write()

[13:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
but if you see a <script> tag then you can no longer document.write() the <html> tag

[13:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
what about XMLParser?

[13:27:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: that's a way to invoke parser (which will invoke cache selection algorithm) without downloading any resource

[13:28:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: same for document.write, as you just explained

[13:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
(actually come to think of if document.open() wouldn't be part of navigation so it wouldn't trigger this)

[13:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
(it would trigger the If clause you asked about -- the "do nothing" one)

[13:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
in all the cases where you hit the mentions of "resource being loaded", there is a resource being loaded

[13:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
because if there wasn't, you would hit the first If clause and bail out

[13:30:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: hmm, maybe it's good enough for a spec, but formally a clause that says "If the resource is not being loaded as part of navigation of a browsing context" doesn't match if there is no resource

[13:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
how can there be no resource?

[13:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's always a resource

[13:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
even if it's just a Document created by createDocument()

[13:38:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: is "resource" formally defined somewhere? that's not how I understand that

[13:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What's the best way to loop over an object (à la for…in) but sorted in JS?

[13:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
ap: i'm just using it in the dictionary sense of "asset"

[13:46:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: so, if a Document created with createDocument is a resource - is any Element a resource, too?

[13:46:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: to me, a resource is something that can be loaded

[13:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
ap: *shrug* what terminology would you rather we use here?

[13:47:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: to me, it would have been much easier if the resource was an explicit input parameter of the algorithm, just like manifest URL is, and it were specified at call sites

[13:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i can do that

[13:48:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: cool, thanks!

[13:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
done

[14:00:00.0000] <ap>
looks good

[14:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You might need to be careful to do "var quotes = ...", since window.quotes is the element with id="quotes" or something like that

deltab: Yeah, basically

[16:45:00.0000] <deltab>
oh, well, I can't suggest anything better than building a list of the property names, sorting it, and iterating over that

[16:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That's pretty much what I concluded. Sucks.

/me admires the candor of Hixie commit message for r2584

[00:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are problems of vagueness in specs where the text leaves room for multiple interpretations

[00:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
when such cases involve multiple roughly equally reasonable interpretations, pedancy and preciseness is important

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
when such cases involve one sensible interpretation and one interpretation that, upon a mere few seconds of reflection, can be seen to be quite ridiculous, my patience for pedancy is reduced

krijnh, everything in #css and #wai-aria for the past 8 days are just status messages. Are those channels used?

[01:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, could you avoid generating columns when all their values are 0? That would make #html-wg, #css #wai-aria and #webapps narrower (for me).

[01:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
#css is used

[01:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
just not regularly

[01:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
or rather

[01:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
not frequently

[01:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
yeah, there's not much regular activity in any channel to the right of #html-wg, although there is some from time to time

[01:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, I guess you could store the sum of values for each column before making each table, then only generate each cell in that table if the sum of that column was greater than 0?

[01:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
(did it just as soon as you sent that e-mail, iirc)

[01:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
yup, it's literally the next message in the archives

[01:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I said something along these lines in my Standards Suck interview: "It assumes that authors are willing to write accessibility annotations, which has repeatedly been shown to not be the case."

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, should this say "1" rather than "-1" given that step 6 would abort if either was -1? "For each invocation of this algorithm, one of Δx and Δy will be −1, and the other will be 0." (http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tabular-data.html#header-and-data-cell-semantics)

[01:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh wait, I'm getting Δx confused with x

[01:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
man, and I thought the old algorithm was hard to follow :(

[01:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: if you would implement the new table algorithm, that would be really helpful :-D

[02:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, my understanding is slots with no cell are treated as if they had an empty cell by ATs, so the user can move straight through "gaps" at the ends of rows. If that's the case, slots without a cell should get associations as if they were an empty cell? "If there is no cell covering slot (x, y) [...] return to the substep marked loop."

[02:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the column header and row header definitions look good

[02:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
yay, time for presents :D

jgraham: Can I pm you about something totally different?

[14:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Of course

[14:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Variables are scoped to functions

[14:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That's about all there is to know :-)

[14:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And they go into all child functions?

[14:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[14:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
(if the inner function doesn't redeclare them in the inner function's scope, using 'var')

[14:27:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Using var?

[14:27:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah.

[14:27:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Ergh.

[14:27:06.0000] <gsnedders>
JS--

[14:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
The location of 'var' has no effect whatsoever, as far as I can tell - all that matters is its presence somewhere in a function, which causes it to belong to that function's scope

[14:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
(so "x=1; var x=2" is exactly equivalent to "var x=1; x=2")

[14:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and to "x=1; x=2; if (0) { var x }" etc)

[14:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, I think js teats all vars as if they were declared at the start of the block

[14:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Function, not block

[14:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
OK, function

[14:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think it's the same as Python, except that Python does an implicit 'var' declaration whenever you assign to a variable

[14:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It's just the var stuff I didn't know about

[14:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I was assuming it was the same as Python (i.e., implicit)

[14:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[14:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
If you don't use 'var', it's just global scope

[14:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Re-assigning a variable doesn't change it's scope?

[14:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*its

[14:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: By "re-assigning", do you mean re-declaring it with var?

[14:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: no, just foo = "bar"

[14:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Assuming we're still talking about JS, assignment never affects scope at all

gsnedders: i can get as far as jumping into the air with the bike. it's never gone well beyond that.

[15:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
(the shooting people is trivial, just a pain in the ass)

[15:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
(cos it's so long)

[15:00:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Yeah, it took me several tries on my first attempt

[15:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You just have to make sure you miss all the hard barrels and keep your speed up on to the ramp

[15:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You know what happens straight after the jump?

[15:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is trying to avoid spoilers :P

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
no idea :-)

[15:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
but i can guess, either i land in the helicopter or the boat, i assume

[15:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that's obvious enough :)

[15:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
and peroggino randomly becomes mortal again probably

[15:05:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Not yet

[15:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh lovely :-P

[15:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
anyway we'll see

[15:05:06.0000] <gsnedders>
He's still immortal for a bit longer :)

[15:05:07.0000] <gsnedders>
As for when he becomes mortal, that you will have to see :)

[15:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i hate that they did that though

[15:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's so stupid

[15:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i shot the guy in the bag for god's sake

[15:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I totally agree

[15:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
in the back even

[15:07:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I got hit by such things several times

[15:07:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(or rather, I hit the other person)

[15:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ergh. Why on earth does this need Flash!?

[15:18:00.0000] <jruderman>
/me wonders how to "file bugs with the ECMAScript committee"

[15:18:01.0000] <jruderman>
wow, they have a public bug-tracking system

[15:18:02.0000] <jruderman>
http://bugs.ecmascript.org/

[15:19:00.0000] <jruderman>
that's pretty cool

[15:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://secret.gsnedders.com/school/The%20Enchanter.html — now with (almost) completely pointless Javascript!

[15:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(see the headings under "Quotes", those uls with checkboxes are automagically created)


2008-12-26
[16:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jruderman: thanks for pointing that one out

[16:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see http://bugs.ecmascript.org/report/1

[16:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
trying to remember what's different between 3.1 and Harmony

[16:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=es3.1:es3.1_proposal_working_draft

[16:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
great that they don't publish the draft in HTML, but they do provide it in MS Word format in addition to PDF. way to go the extra mile

[16:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: HTML is dead, compared to MS Word, HTML is lame

[16:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
Only old people use HTML

[16:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[16:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Real users need entiprise features like Wordart

[16:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I prefer OpenOffice format, because using the OpenOffice applications is great torture test of the CPU and memory resources of my machine

[16:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
heh

[16:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: So, basically, I'm just trying to do a dissertation as controversial as possible :)

[16:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: reading Nabakov is great cure for sleeplessness

[16:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: I am, however, starting to run out of (English) Nabokov I haven't yet read :)

[16:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I recommend abandoning him completely and reading all of Flann O'Brien instead

[16:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: That wouldn't bode well for my English dissertation, though

[16:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
fuck it, prove to them that you are a risk-taker and an original

[16:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[16:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if they don't like that, burn the school down

[16:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, I think my English teacher would let me

[16:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that fallback strategy always worked well for me

[16:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has already completely changed his computing project

[16:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is now working on Anolis in a slight guise

[16:51:04.0000] <takkaria>
read Camus instead :)

[16:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
my sister found me a first english edition of The Plague for christmas, it really made my day

[16:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah

[16:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: English teachers are easy to manipulate, because their grasp of reason and logic is usually pretty shakey. Most of them did really poorly at math and science, which is why they ended up becoming English teachers

[16:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I got a couple of non-fiction books from my mother, and The Time Traveller's Wife from my sister

[16:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(which I have had several friends recommend to me)

[16:54:00.0000] <takkaria>
ay, it's a good book

[16:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(I could make an interesting observation about their choice of recommending that book to me with what they know about me, but this is publicly logged :))

[17:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(hint: It relates to the title character's first name)

[17:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok finally completed gta iv

[02:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Did I ever say that myself and BenMillard found the Spiderman walk-through level hard?

[02:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Mainly because we were laughing so much we didn't actually know what we were meant to do.

[04:45:00.0000] <annevk>
"PS: what we probably need now is more implementation of current W3C Reccomandations like XForms 1.0, instead of running behind the latest HTML5 Editor's Drafts)"

[04:46:00.0000] <annevk>
/me thinks Giovanni missed the reason the WHATWG was initiated

[05:53:00.0000] <olliej>
annevk: hehe

[06:48:00.0000] <yecril71>
1st of all, I wish everyone an abundance of Christmas blessings.

[06:48:01.0000] <yecril71>
It is easy to tell the first occurrence of a technical term from the following ones.

[06:48:02.0000] <yecril71>
That is what the DFN element is for.

[06:49:00.0000] <yecril71>
Alex wanted to say that it should be possible to attach other script engines to existing HTML documents.

[06:49:01.0000] <yecril71>
But that is already supported.

[06:51:00.0000] <annevk>
yecril71, some context in the form of quotes or URLs would help when you place one of your comments in IRC

[06:51:01.0000] <annevk>
I often have a hard time telling what you're on about

[07:06:00.0000] <yecril71>
I am trying to formulate my remarks so that they are context-free.

[07:07:00.0000] <yecril71>
Aren�t they?

[07:08:00.0000] <yecril71>
The context would be visible if I were allowed to use e-mail reply function.

[07:09:00.0000] <yecril71>
But I have been asked not to do this because my remarks are considered unconstructive.

[09:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
<blockquote><p>foo<p>bar</blockquote> magic

[09:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How can I get the magic to be displayed just after the "bar", on the same line?

[09:37:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders, use css to make the blockquote an inline-block

[09:38:00.0000] <erlehmann>
"display:inline-block;" should do it

[09:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: Does that stop margins from folders?

[09:38:02.0000] <erlehmann>
what are "folders" ?

[09:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
*folding

[09:39:01.0000] <erlehmann>
inline-block behaves like an "inline replaced element", AFAIK

[09:40:00.0000] <erlehmann>
but i think margin folding stops only when using floats, wasn't it that ? i am unsure.

[09:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It appears to stop folding in Saf

[09:40:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(It's no issue, because I shouldn't really have a margin on the blockquote anyway)

[09:42:00.0000] <erlehmann>
what is "saf" ?

[09:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Safari

[09:42:02.0000] <erlehmann>
ah

[10:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm…

[10:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
q for something someone said is fine (e.g., <q>I am</q>, he said), yet isn't fine in fiction, as you aren't actually quoting anyone arguably.

[12:01:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: ayt?

[12:47:00.0000] <dave_levin>
ap: Dec 27 is Hixie's b-day (according to what he said in irc a day or two ago), so in 10 minutes for you.... :)

[12:48:00.0000] <ap>
cool, if he was here, I could perhaps be the first to congratulate :-)

[12:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Happy One-Year-To-Doomage!

[15:06:00.0000] <erlehmann>
anyone here at 25c3 ?

[15:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
Happy Birthday Hixie


2008-12-27
[00:45:00.0000] <annevk>
Happy b-day Hixie, if it indeed is today :)

[00:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks anne and everyone

[00:51:00.0000] <olliej>
ooh, happy being old day Hixie !!

[00:51:01.0000] <olliej>
:D

[00:53:00.0000] <nessy>
happy birthday, Hixie!

[00:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks :-)

[01:10:00.0000] <annevk>
"Unbiased journalism on HTML5 & WHAT WG since September 2008" meh, lastweekinhtml5 stole the standardssuck tagline

[01:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
shocking

[01:11:01.0000] <gavin>
"journalism"?

[01:11:02.0000] <annevk>
indeed :p

[01:13:00.0000] <ap>
Happy birthday Hixie!

[01:13:01.0000] <ap>
Do you have some time for an appcache question?

[01:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks :-)

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[01:14:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I'm wondering about applicationCache.update() - is it by design that it usually does nothing, because the manifest is in browser's http cache?

[01:15:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: the spec doesn't seem to say that it should be reloaded from server, and neither Gecko nor WebKit do that

[01:17:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I'd also appreciate some info about the intended behavior for reloading a page whose main resource is in an application cache - it seems that once a manifest attribute is added to an HTML, there is no way to undo that, other than resetting appcache via browser preferences

[01:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
the HTTP caching semantics should be honoured, yes, but i expect most people will set no-cache headers on manifests

[01:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
to un-cache a cached page, just make sure the manifest returns 410

[01:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
(or 404)

[01:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
see step 5 of The Algorithm

[01:21:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: a-ha! thanks, that helps

[01:22:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I think this is also an answer to people saying that they need manifests served with a wrong Content-Type to be honored - they need to send no-cache for reasonable behavior, and if they can do that, they can also send a correct Content-Type

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
we don't need an answer to those requests other than "http requires us to do that" :-)

[01:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we shouldn't honour the cache though

[01:28:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: when updating a cache, we probably need to reload all resources, not just the manifest

[01:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
defeating the http caching semantics for all resources is going to such massively given how often teh manifest is checked

[01:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
suck

[01:29:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: well, other resources only need to be reloaded if the manifest changed

[01:30:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: they can always stick an app version in a comment to force a full update

[01:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh true, the manifest being the same is just treated as there being nothing to do

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
do people think i should make "heading content" a kind of "flow content" by definition, or should i make all the elements that are "phrasing content" also be "flow content" explicitly?

[02:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. is it better to be explicit about what is flow content, or is it better to have a diagram somewhere that shows how the various kinds of content are subsets of each other?

[02:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, do both

[02:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
but that's more work!

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, should <body> be sectioning content or sectioning root?

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
(or does it not make a difference)

[02:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, make it sectioning root

[02:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
sweet, that makes sectioning content elements all flow content now too

[03:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
lachy: how's http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#kinds-of-content

[03:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Happy Hixieday! :)

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks :-)

[03:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: make heading content flow content, and IMO it's better to have a diagram somewhere, and body should be a sectioning root

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: how's http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#kinds-of-content ?

[03:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: kinda odd with the overlapping areas, but I can't see anyway to get rid of them

[03:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: And SVG > PNG :P

[03:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(overlapping as in things like the phrasing content)

[03:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Can anyone pass me any water?

[03:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to provide a better diagram :-)

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
I don't have a nice SVG editor

[03:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Write it by hand :P

[03:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has never found any SVG editor that actually produces sane markup

[03:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me realizes he still hasn't started on his computing project implementation, though he has started on English notes,.

[03:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Meh.

[03:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Fun "holidays".

[04:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Why do you want an SVG editor that produces sane markup?

[04:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
Just treat the output as an opaque blob of data, the same as if it were PNG

[04:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[07:41:00.0000] <annevk>
so to learn SVG I thought of doing that HTML5 content model diagram in SVG, how do you make an oval shape?

[07:42:00.0000] <annevk>
nm

[07:42:01.0000] <annevk>
I should RTFM

[07:42:02.0000] <annevk>
well, RTFS

[07:52:00.0000] <annevk>
sort of annoying to do this by hand as everything has to be positioned absolutely more or less

[07:53:00.0000] <annevk>
I suppose I could create <g> containers for some bits, but that only helps slightly

[07:59:00.0000] <annevk>
so much for <g> elements, they don't have x/y or cx/cy attributes

[07:59:01.0000] <annevk>
at least, I think they don't

[07:59:02.0000] <annevk>
I guess you can fake it using a translate...

[08:00:00.0000] <annevk>
(transform="translate(x,y)" works)

[08:15:00.0000] <annevk>
http://annevankesteren.nl/2008/content-venn-svg-sketch

[08:15:01.0000] <annevk>
(I stopped because it was boring)

[08:17:00.0000] <annevk>
(bit annoying that there's still no user unit in CSS so you have to fake it using px...)

[08:19:00.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: I have an idea for the graph :) just have to find the energy, will to do it :) not sure for now

[08:25:00.0000] <annevk>
k, cool

[08:25:01.0000] <annevk>
I wasn't actually thinking of improving it, just making an SVG version

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Just use Inkscape :-)

[08:27:00.0000] <annevk>
<svg:image xlink:href="..."/>

[11:14:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, http://www.w3.org/mid/495670E0.5000700⊙gc is great

[13:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Happy Birthday 

[13:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me has been away from the computer all day

[13:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Wow, lastweekinhtml5 has become dull recently

[13:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why more people have commented today on Hixie's birthday than commented a couple of days ago on Santa Claus's birthday

[13:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I thought it was regulation if you wanted to be in the cult of Hixie

[13:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Did I miss a memo?

[13:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Also today, after I finally bought some presents to wrap, I discovered that the amin problem with wrapping is not that using the paper efficiently is NP hard because that can be circumvented by using paper inefficiently

[13:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
The main problem is that it requires hand eye cooridination to do all the sellotaping

[13:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that http://www.google.com/search?q=christmas puts some little candy-cane icons next to the side adverts

[13:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders why Philip` was googling for Christmas

[13:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wasn't, I was Googling for Santa and found that it has icons for several Christmas-related search queries

[13:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders why Philip` was googling for Santa

[13:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
To see the Wikipedia page about him, in a (failed) attempt to verify the date of his birthday

[14:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me would like to complain that Google translate doesn't remember the langauge you last chose but instead seems to always default to Spanish-English which shows a remarkable ameri-centricism in a tool designed to reduce cultural barriers

[14:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, bookmark this URL to make it remember which languages you want. http://www.google.com/translate_t?sl=no&tl=en

[14:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
just change the "no" to whatever langauge you need 

[14:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Yeah I gues that would work. It really shouldn't be necessary though...

[14:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
Thanks

[14:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries to install the seemingly straightforward Net::Amazon::S3 module, and is surprised to discover that it requires a gazillion dependencies

[14:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
including the oddly named Moose::Cookbook

[14:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I agree it's annoying. But that's the only solution I've found that was simple to set up

[14:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
you could also try creating a user JS that automatically changes it for you whenever you visit the page

[14:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I was trying the "complain in a random unrelated IRC channel in the hope that someone would say 'you idiot you can fix it like this or communicate the problem to Google like that' solution

[14:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/t'/t'"

[14:47:00.0000] <heycam`>
annevk, yeah relative layout in svg would be nice to have.  hopefully i get some time this year to put together a spec (and implementation) for it.

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
so, what's everyone up to on this great day

[15:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me is listening to the Pinafore soundtrack while replying to crazy whatwg e-mails

[15:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me is playing TrackMania

[15:28:00.0000] <heycam`>
/me is reading the java vm spec

[15:29:00.0000] <nessy>
/me is preparing to head off for a wedding

[15:29:01.0000] <nessy>
/me would much prefer some video hacking :)

[15:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is also trying to write some scripts to control an EC2 server, and wondering if it's considered murder or suicide when you program something to terminate itself

[15:32:01.0000] <annevk>
/me is off to party

/me spent all day buying Christmas presents, having not bothered before Christmas

[15:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
Which sounds much more boring than what anyone else has been doing

[15:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me pages through stream-of-consciousness e-mails from Calogero


2008-12-28
[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
the holidays are boring. no controversy on the tag or ac lists.

[16:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
still no replies to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2008Dec/0083.html

[16:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
and i doubt it's because everyone was suddenly convinced

[16:07:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: That's a lovely simple case-study of why defining error-handling is a Good Thing.

[16:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben: yeah

[16:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben: i just love that it was brought up as an attempt of reductio ad absurdum, and it was really a perfect simple example

[16:32:00.0000] <webben>
very neat, yes :)

[17:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me learns about "SACD" disks

[17:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
apparently this christmas present will not play on normal audio players

[17:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
though the ps3 supports it!

[17:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
not that that helps me at all

[17:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
man, these have even more obnoxious drm than bluray

[17:07:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: "not that that helps me at all" ... unless you were looking for an excuse to buy a PS3, presumably ;)

[17:09:00.0000] <myakura>
/me thinks that current PS3 has removed its playback

[17:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
they removed digital playback iirc

[17:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i think analog still works

[17:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
(by ps3 is hooked up to a 20 year old tv, so...)

[17:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'd never heard of an SACD before either

[17:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
wikipedia says there's currently no way to crack the DRM. That sucks.

[17:15:01.0000] <myakura>
yeah, that really sucks

[17:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
though if SACD ever becomes popular enough, someone will be motivated enough to crack it.

[17:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just buy all my music in DRM free format online anyway. I don't think I'd ever be interested in returning to physical media, especially with DRM, again

[17:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
I discovered that 7digital.com doesn't seem to enforce regional restrictions, like stores like Amazon MP3 do

[17:18:01.0000] <myakura>
(though the sound quality is way better than ordinary CDs, i kinda like the format

[17:18:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't have a sound system that can take advantage of the better quality sound anyway

[17:19:00.0000] <myakura>
/me neither :(

[17:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
but even if I did, I'd still rather rip the music to a hard drive than have to use a disc

[17:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
that's what I do with my DVDs. Rip them with MacTheRipper and create an ISO with mkisofs

[17:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
btw, my christmas present is probably going to end up costing me up to $800 in a repair bill, thanks to faulty manufacturing of DVD packaging

[17:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
(that's $800 AUD. I was told up to 4000 NOK) 

[17:27:00.0000] <webben>
faulty packaging did that?

[17:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have very nice speakers (audioengine5) but they're still just 2.0 stereo

[17:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
so this sacd is lost on me anyway

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[17:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's my fault, i should have noticed it wasn'ta cd when i put it on my amazon wishlist :-)

[17:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
webben, glue from the DVD packaging had become stuck to the underside of the disc, and without noticing, I put that into my DVD drive. The drive is now screwed

[17:40:01.0000] <webben>
eww... that's one to watch out for :(

[17:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
It was The Simpsons Season 11, limited editon collectors box set

[17:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
it worst package design I've ever seen. The discs are so hard to get out

[17:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
I contacted Fox today, asking them to replace the disc and compensate me for my repair expenses. Though it's the weekend and I probably won't hear back till next week

[18:50:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is back; time to go to bed :)

[19:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
so www.whatwg.org traffic spiked the week of feb 17th 2008, and the week of april 30th

[19:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder why

[19:39:00.0000] <dave_levin>
Happy birthday Hixie.

[19:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks :-)

[19:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder which bot is using "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)"

[19:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg's highest usage is from that bot this month

[19:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
can someone tell me what this means?:

[19:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
> Just one thing: a note says a synthetic click doesn't perform the same 

[19:56:02.0000] <Hixie>

[19:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
> telling the UA to take care of the synthetic click source (user's device

[19:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
> or document scripts) if such causes any difference, aren't they?

[23:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm, either the forums weren't spammed during christmas, or it was cleaned up already

[23:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
190 new emails, less than i expected

[23:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah so little e-mail

[23:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me wonders when https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8131 will be fixed

[00:50:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: is this conforming? <svg><foreignobject> foo <br> baz </foreignobject></svg>

[00:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
i believe so

[00:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
though i don't know which spec is responsible for knowing how to render the "foo"

[00:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
ask the svg wg i guess

[00:52:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the spec seems to only talk about which *elements* are allowed

[00:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[00:53:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)" was causing the huge traffic spike on html5.org

[00:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: did you get an IP address?

[00:53:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
what does interleaved mean? is it not allowed to nest mathml in html in svg?

[00:53:04.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it uses a proxy

[00:53:05.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, lots of them

[00:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: which country?

[00:54:01.0000] <annevk>
dunno, I'm using the stats package from dreamhost

[00:54:02.0000] <annevk>
it seems it is still hitting the server, but it now gets 403 back (it always requested URIs with &amp; in them rather than &)

[00:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: <a/><b/><a/><b/> is a and b interleaved together

[00:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: <a/><a/><b/><b/> does not have interleaving

[00:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: make sense?

[00:57:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: yeah

[00:57:01.0000] <annevk>
<svg><foreignObject><h1>test</h1> <math/> <p>wow</p><foreignObjecct></svg> should be fine, no?

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
what does svg say about how you render that?

[00:58:01.0000] <annevk>
dunno, I believe I asked once

[00:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
the reason i made the spec require all the html to be in one block is that then we can define the rendering sanely without stepping outside our area of responsibility and authority

[00:59:01.0000] <annevk>
I'd hope rendering of <foreignObject> does not depend on children...

[01:00:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i think i tested this before and didn't find any interesting interop problems, so the svg spec should just allow it and define it

[01:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i don't really mind allowing multiple html blocks if we can define what it means somewhere

[01:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
svg 1.2 tiny got through CR, so presumably one just has to look at the tests they wrote to test <foreignObject>, and then see what part of the spec those tests are testing

[01:02:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the svg 1.2 tiny testsuite is sad

[01:02:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
or should i say tiny

[01:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i couldn't find it -- all i could find were about 600 tests somewhere

[01:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno where the actual test suite they used to exit CR is

[01:03:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
i think that's it

[01:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
what's it?

[01:03:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
the 600 tests are the testsuite

[01:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
can't be, that would mean they violated w3c process again

[01:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i asked ed and he said there were about 600 tests

[01:04:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
iirc

[01:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
how odd

[01:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll ask www-svg

[01:09:00.0000] <annevk>
roc had some idea on how <foreignObject> should work at some point, though I believe it still had an issue with what exactly the root element would be

[01:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if zcorpan_ knows that he got invited to his house for New Year

[01:12:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
jgraham: yep :)

[01:12:01.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if that sentence is grammatically dubious

[01:12:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
i.e. jgraham got invited to my house

[01:13:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
anyone else wanna join?

[01:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me takes that as a no

[01:16:00.0000] <takkaria>
christ, Hixie, you've been working hard the last few days

[01:17:00.0000] <annevk>
/me will come to Linkoping somewhere in 2009 for slightly longer than a day :)

[01:18:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: we should have a beer at de klomp then

[01:18:01.0000] <annevk>
hehe

[01:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me has been there once already

[01:19:01.0000] <annevk>
full of Dutchies?

[01:19:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
some of them were dutch

[01:19:03.0000] <annevk>
seems Hixie reached a new low: http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html

[01:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
though i had to ask for frietssaus so i'm a bit disappointed

[01:22:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe 'cause it's called mayo?

[01:23:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
whatever it's called i didn't get it without asking for it

[01:24:00.0000] <annevk>
:/

[01:24:01.0000] <annevk>
do they have poffertjes? :)

[01:24:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
and they didn't wet the glass before drawing the beer

[01:25:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
no don't think so

[01:25:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
i had poffertjes when we were in amsterdam

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to reach 1500 by the 31st

[01:38:00.0000] <takkaria>
Hixie: going on vacation any time soon?

[01:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
no

[01:48:00.0000] <roc>
annevk: what's the issue with foreignobject rendering?

[01:50:00.0000] <annevk>
roc, if <foreignObject> gives you a viewport, like <iframe> or something, what is the root element in http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#containing-block-details ?

[01:50:01.0000] <annevk>
in a case like <foreignObject> <html/> <html/> </foreignObject>

[01:50:02.0000] <roc>
ah

[01:50:03.0000] <roc>
this is certainly underspecified

[01:50:04.0000] <roc>
in Mozilla, <foreignObject> does not create a viewport

[01:52:00.0000] <roc>
it wraps the children in an anonymous block which is a block formatting context and an abs-pos container

[01:52:01.0000] <roc>
it should also be a fixed-pos container; we don't do that yet

[01:52:02.0000] <annevk>
ok, so a new kind of container basically?

[01:53:00.0000] <roc>
only the fixed-pos container part is really new

[01:53:01.0000] <roc>
but CSS transforms also need to create fixed-pos containers that are not the viewport

[01:54:00.0000] <roc>
and it's not that hard to do

[01:55:00.0000] <roc>
we already implemented fixed-pos container-ness for CSS transforms and extending that to foreignobject should be simple

[01:56:00.0000] <annevk>
kk

[01:58:00.0000] <roc>
I realize these decisions are a bit arbitrary but obviously if any child of the foreignobject can have a containing block that's outside the foreignobject, you're doomed

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
some spec should actually define that somewhere

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
but html5 isn't the right spec, so...

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
gah, i wish there an xml parser spec

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
where do specs define that a 'load' event is fired after parsing an xml doc?

[03:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
sigh

[03:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i should write a section for html5 that defines an xml parser

[03:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what state dom3 events is in

[03:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyone following that at all?

[03:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
not me, though i probably should

[03:17:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: <pre><code> breaks the leading line break authoring convenience feature

[03:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i can tell it _fixes_ the feature :-P

[03:18:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and makes some people write <code><pre> instead which made you have to expand the aaa list

[03:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[03:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
wtf? I just got a BSOD in Windows XP running inside a Virtual Machine

[03:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
what was the error?

[04:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
it was one that required it instantly restart, so I didn't get a chance to read the BSOD, as it only flashed for a second

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can configure whether Windows restarts automatically on BSOD

[04:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
in, uh, Control Panel -> System -> Error Recovery or something like that?

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
otherwise it'll always just restart straight away

[04:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I've had BSODs in the past that didn't automatically restart, and I've never touched that setting before

[05:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
is it just me or is lists.w3.org down?

[05:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
lists.w3.org is down more often than whatwg.org

[05:13:00.0000] <karlcow>
and me who thought that someone grew older a few days ago

[05:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
?

[05:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
i believe that statement to be accurate

[05:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg.org is down all the time

[05:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
and lists.w3.org is down more often

[05:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's actually rather annoying (indeed, both are)

[06:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard has managed to get Hixie to call me "G" now, too :P

[06:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie, annevk: http://simon.html5.org/dump/content-venn.svg

Hixie: yt?

[09:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes (gladly) he's got no bug reports on Anolis since 1.0 shipped

[13:00:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me applauds http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#sectioning-root for (already) saying that headings inside blockquotes don't contribute to outlines

[13:00:01.0000] <jwalden>
was afraid I was going to have to propose that to the list :-)

[13:00:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jwalden: But that means I don't need to read the algorithm and work that out! That's boring!

[13:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me should create a service which just displays the outline for a document

[13:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Does it really need to be a service, and not just a bookmarklet or whatever those things are called?

[13:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
There are duplicate tests in the validator tests in html5ib

[13:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's to provide extra assurance that the validator implementations are deterministic, and that they don't fail if you feed them the same input twice

[13:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Actually, I think I'm being stupid

[13:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
They are however outdated

[13:49:00.0000] <virtuelv>
gsnedders: just FYI, RDF is still relevant

[13:49:01.0000] <virtuelv>
thinking otherwise is misguided, at best

[13:50:00.0000] <virtuelv>
fwiw, on the relevance of w3c: web technologies are being used outside of average web 2.0-startups

[13:50:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(In reply to various tidbits on twitter)

[13:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has only interacted with RDF data once, and that was dmoz.org's URL listing, and he just used regexps for that since he had no idea what else to do with it :-(

[13:53:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I'd just like to point out that every firefox extension uses rdf

[13:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes that doesn't help bots crawling the web understand it

[13:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
virtuelv: I'd say it'd be a push to say that RDF was irrelevant. but is it relevant for what it set out to do (i.e., making the web more semantic)? I see almost no websites using RDF, so it doesn't seem to have done what it was meant to

[13:56:00.0000] <virtuelv>
gsnedders: the web also happens to be more than what google is willing to index

[13:56:01.0000] <virtuelv>
"almost no websites"?

[13:56:02.0000] <virtuelv>
you know that RSS 1.0 is RDF?

[13:56:03.0000] <virtuelv>
and FOAF?

[13:56:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes, I am aware.

[13:56:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I have written a not unheard of feed parser

[13:56:06.0000] <virtuelv>
(Note, I'm not a huge RDF fan myself, but calling it "irrelevant" is hyperbole)

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
From a parsing point of view, RSS 1.0 isn't whatsoever

[13:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't think I touch anything in the RDF namespace at all

[13:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, apart from checking the root element

[13:59:00.0000] <virtuelv>
that you don't have to use an RDF parser to parse it, doesn

[13:59:01.0000] <virtuelv>
't make it any less RDF

[13:59:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That you don't need to touch RDF at all does in my mind make the fact it is technically RDF irrelevant

[14:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what the motivation is for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=420506

[14:00:01.0000] <virtuelv>
fwiw, behind the scenes, http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/ is all semweb

[14:02:00.0000] <virtuelv>
(There was a pretty awesome presentation about that site at XTech in Dublin this year)

[14:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me would've gone to XTech is study leave had started when it normally did and not two weeks later

[14:02:02.0000] <svl>
Philip`: iirc mostly that RDF code in Mozilla is effectively unmaintained and hard to work with.

[14:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*if

[14:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm sure I saw something some time ago discussing trying to remove Mozilla's dependency on RDF for extensions, but I can't remember where I found that

[14:06:00.0000] <roc>
RDF might be an OK interchange format for some uses, but it's totally inappropriate as an internal data structure for an aplication

[14:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
roc: and while I agree with that, I still hope that people can stop labelling it as "irrelevant" and other hyperbole

[14:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone got any music suggestions for me?

[14:32:00.0000] <annevk>
oi va voi

[14:32:01.0000] <annevk>
spinvis

[14:33:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: in Norway already again?

[14:34:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, to celebrate new year and do some work :)

[14:35:00.0000] <svl>
gsnedders: http://viennateng.com/listen/ (in general: what kind of music do you like?)

[14:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
svl: That's a hard question to answer. I like random things of pretty much any genre.

[14:36:00.0000] <annevk>
(my second suggestion is Dutch music btw)

[14:36:01.0000] <virtuelv>
gsnedders: Jan Garbarek

[14:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
svl: http://www.last.fm/user/gsnedders if you want to get a vague idea

[14:36:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(the top two bands are such primarily because they a) have a lot of albums, b) I own all their albums)

[14:39:00.0000] <svl>
gsnedders: Almost but not entirely completely unlike my own taste. The one strain of recommendations I have branch off from Death Cab for Cutie: Try Mesh - http://www.mesh.co.uk/ - and No-man - http://www.myspace.com/nomanuk 

[14:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: The second one sounds nice, I just fail to understand everything :)

[14:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me listens to preview of Mesh on last.fm and concludes it's way too like EDM

[14:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(EDM that I can at all stand is rare)

[14:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
OK, nice load of suggestions

[14:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Random bands I have recently liked: Sigur Ros, The Decemberists, Malcolm Middleton

[14:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/bands/artists/

[14:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Bright Eyes, Bat for Lashes

[14:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
Joy Division, Arcade Fire

[14:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes jgraham's list is longer than pretty much everyone else's put together ;)

[14:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
* :)

[14:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
I can go on :)

[14:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but I don't know if I'm being useful or just naming bands that I like)

[14:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has heard of most of them

[14:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
Belle & Sebastian, Nick Cave

[14:57:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Oh, I like so much random stuff that naming bands you like is about as useful as you can be :)

[14:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/media/ has a bunch of free sigur ros to download

[14:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's a good price.

[15:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Sorry, but Malcolm Middleton has a Scottish accent from the wrong part of Scotland.

[15:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders who gsnedders hasn't heard of

[15:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Falkirk?

[15:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
Why is that the wrong part of scotland?

[15:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Wrong accent.

[15:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[15:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh well, I thought you'd like the humor and misery

[15:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[15:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Nah, most of his stuffis decent

[15:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I've heard of obscure stuff, just not what my friends have heard of ;)

[15:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
* :)

[15:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't type toniht

[15:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*tonight

[15:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Eh? Since I don't know what your friends have heard of that doesn't help much

[15:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Oh, like what's actually popular

[15:11:02.0000] <jgraham>
Also: Flight of the Conchords (but it's good if you watch the TV show too)

[15:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I have no idea what is acually popular. Nothing I like I guess

[15:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
Jeff Buckley. Is that too obvious?

[15:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Nor do I. That's why I don't know what they like.

[15:12:03.0000] <jgraham>
amiina http://www.myspace.com/amiina

[15:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't thinnk he has ever linked to myspace before

[15:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders who in #whatwg has MySpace

[15:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't

[15:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has been meaning to get some The View since before anyone had heard of them

[15:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
In other random culture recommendations, anyone who is in London soonish should try to visit the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition at the Natural History Museum

[15:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: "soonish"?

[15:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Before it closes. I don't quie recall when that is. Maybe april?

[15:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
26 Apr 2009

[15:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
There's also an exhibition on Darwin till the 19th

[15:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether to go to London in Feb

[15:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
me is very submissive, apparently

[15:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders how you pronounce Amiina

[15:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me generally has no idea how to pronounce icelandic words

[15:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone got any clue about why <http://www.jrcnetwork.com/designprohibited/> doesn't have its background image (which is a JPEG) match up (in a colour sense) with the background colour in Safari?

[15:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
the JPEG probably has a color space set

[15:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
to something other than sRGB

[15:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
I agrre with Hixie although it sems to WFM

[15:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, OK

[15:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me forgot that JPEG could have gamma explicitly

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh yeah, could be the gamma too

[15:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
The colour space is set to sRGB

[15:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
If I'm not reading the metadata wrong, it is sRGB, and there is no gamma set

[15:48:00.0000] <jwalden>
hm, html5 doesn't allow a profile attribute on <head>?  seems like that "breaks" the part of the web that's wordpress-based, mostly

[15:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jwalden: One update to WP can fix that

[15:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
jwalden: how does it break it?

[15:48:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jwalden: And WP is XHTML anyway, and good luck convincing them to output HTML.

[15:48:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Sorry, "XHTML".

[15:48:05.0000] <jwalden>
Hixie: "breaks" in the sense of doesn't validate, hence the quotes

[15:48:06.0000] <Hixie>
oh well it doesn't validate as html5 anyway

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's html4 :-)

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
or xhtml1

[15:49:02.0000] <gsnedders>
No, it's XHTML 1.0

[15:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
either way

[15:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's not going to validate

[15:49:05.0000] <jwalden>
sure, I'm ignoring the doctype error I get now

[15:49:06.0000] <gsnedders>
It's impossible to get WP to output HTML 4.01


2008-12-29
[18:42:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, typo in most recent commit (you have "it's" instead of "its")

[18:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
where is it?

[18:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't recall what the last commit was :-)

[18:45:00.0000] <heycam>
in the Obsolete features / Conformance checkers section

[18:48:00.0000] <heycam>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-diffs/2008Dec/0121.html

[18:49:00.0000] <heycam>
/me afk for a bit

[18:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
"The presence of a profile attribute on the head element, if it's value is ..."

[19:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i fixed it as soon as heycam said "in the Obsolete features / Conformance checkers section" :-)

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
what does one call a statement that doesn't modify something? as opposed to a statement that _does_ modify something

[01:25:00.0000] <heycam>
idempotent?

[01:26:00.0000] <heycam>
referentially transparent?

[01:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
idempotent statements can still change things, they are just guaranteed to not cause further changes if executed again

[01:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
referentially transparent might be it...

[01:26:03.0000] <heycam>
ah yes

[01:27:00.0000] <heycam>
side-effectless

[01:27:01.0000] <heycam>
/me cooks

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
referentially transparent seems right

[01:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
although...

[01:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
UPDATE TABLE x SET a=0 WHERE 0==1; is referentially transparent

[01:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i don't want to include that

[01:33:00.0000] <roc>
"pure" is sometimes used

[01:34:00.0000] <roc>
"pure function" maybe

[01:34:01.0000] <roc>
a statement that changes no state and does not return a value (i.e., is not an expression) could also be referred to as a "no-op"

[01:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i used "referentially transparent" but refer only to "the statement's main verb" (this is about sql)

[01:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
and then i give an example to show what i mean by "main verb"

[01:39:00.0000] <roc>
"has no side-effects" is probably more meaningful to more people

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i considered that but i was worried people might think that "DROP TABLE foo" had no side-effects, only one primary effect.

[01:41:00.0000] <roc>
seems much more likely that people will have no clue what "referentially transparent" means

[01:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
well that's why i include the example :-)

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
here, what do you think of this: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#modifications-fail-if-read-only

[01:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
step 6.2

[01:49:00.0000] <roc>
hmm

[01:49:01.0000] <roc>
actually "referential transparency" is not what you want here

[01:49:02.0000] <roc>
since, strictly speaking, functions that read mutable global state are not referentially transparent

[01:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
good point

[01:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the right term?

[01:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
what i want is the accessor version of "immutable"

[01:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
i can think of half a dozen ways to describe a data structure that can't be modified, but no way to describe a function that doesn't modify a data structure

[01:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
go figure

[01:51:00.0000] <roc>
maybe "can modify the database" is as good as it gets

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me removes the parenthetical

[01:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sure there's a word

[01:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
but "can't modify" will have to do for now

[02:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wasn't mpt particularly interested in notifications?

[02:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: the gears team were the only people who said anything about implementing it as far as i know

[02:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: and they want full-on HTML notifications

[02:32:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[02:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: which i'm not willing to spec if they're the only implementation, because that's heavy duty stuff

[02:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I can understand that

[02:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: If there is significant interest from them in having taking a spec for it to the Webapps WG, I would kinda hope to get word on it sooner rather than later

[02:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Is there somebody in particular you can suggest I ping about it?

[02:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or course it'd be great to have somebody willing to commit to being the editor for it

[02:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know of any interest from that team to write a spec yet

[02:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i'm trying to encourage them to work with the w3c

[02:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
the thing is there's no point having a spec if there's only one company interested in it

[02:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
because once the other vendors start getting interested, they'll want to change it

[02:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yep

[02:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think Andrei's work on the Geolocation draft has proven that when there is interest among multiple vendors, work on standard can get done relatively quickly and successfully

[02:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
with multiple implementations

[02:49:00.0000] <yecril71>
Modifying the fingerprint on the advertising site would only disrupt the site.

[02:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
It would not cause the downloaders to download the trojan � since the original file has not been modified.

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
yecril71: just change the link to point to the trojan on some other site. or upload the trojan straight to that site. or do both.

[02:52:00.0000] <yecril71>
That would be easy to recognise since the browser starts downloading from another domain.

[02:52:01.0000] <roc>
the problem with HTML notifications is that that makes it impossible to integrate with platform notification frameworks such as Growl or libnotification

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: yeah i'm not really a big fan of it. i've been trying to discourage them (unsuccessfully)

[02:56:00.0000] <yecril71>
(it seems the fingerprint could cover the URL as well)

[02:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
?

[02:56:02.0000] <yecril71>
Oops, that is irrelevant, sorry.

[03:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Judging by http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/commit-watchers-whatwg.org/2008/001779.html , the .png file probably needs its svn:mime-type property set to something non-textual

[03:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do i change that?

[03:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
svn propset svn:mime-type image/png content-venn.png

[03:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
... I think

[03:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Apparently anything not starting with "text/" is considered to be binary, and prevents textual merging and newline conversion and all that stuff)

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
done

[03:55:00.0000] <annevk>
data:text/xml,<test xmlns="&gt;">test</test> should this work?

[03:55:01.0000] <annevk>
"The attribute's normalized value MUST be either a URI reference — the namespace name identifying the namespace — or an empty string."

[04:01:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/#fn-digest should we have something like this for password fields?

[04:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
what problem does it solve?

[04:03:00.0000] <annevk>
sending passwords more securely over the wire without having to resort to scripting aiui

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
what does that protect against?

[04:05:00.0000] <annevk>
knowledge of the original string used which may be in use on other locations

[04:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[04:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
seems like SSL is a better solution to that

[04:06:00.0000] <annevk>
blog software etc. is not going to switch to SSL, is it?

[04:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
(also, if you can sniff the hash for one site, seems likely that you can sniff the hash for another site)

[04:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you're using the same password for a blog as for something which matters, you're pretty screwed anyway

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
the other problem is that it would mean one of two things

[04:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
either the site has to store the actual password instead of a hash

[04:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
or the site has to support both legacy login and new login

[04:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
the former increases the risk of the site being hacked and the passwords leaked, which is a bigger risk than sniffing in practice

[04:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
the latter seems like an unlikely thing for sites to do

[04:22:00.0000] <yecril71>
If a number property cannot be coerced to an IDL number because it is too big, 

[04:22:01.0000] <yecril71>
the property accessor returns 0.

[04:22:02.0000] <yecril71>
But it looks rather like NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR than 0 to me.

[04:23:00.0000] <yecril71>
Because the property contains a valid number, only its value is inaccessible to the script.

[04:28:00.0000] <heycam>
yecril71, do you have some examples/tests that show this?

[04:30:00.0000] <yecril71>
It is specified in 2.8.

[04:30:01.0000] <yecril71>
I do not know how implementations behave.

[04:31:00.0000] <heycam>
2.8?

[04:31:01.0000] <heycam>
oh of html5?

[04:33:00.0000] <heycam>
hmm those algorithms in 2.4.3 Numbers don't say what to do with overflow

[04:34:00.0000] <heycam>
or rather, the section on reflecting dom attributes don't say that such overflows are not "successful"

[04:35:00.0000] <heycam>
/me → bed

[04:41:00.0000] <yecril71>
Numbers do not overflow in HTML5 at all.

[04:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how to define what a valid floating point number represents without resorting to the parsing algorithm

[04:48:00.0000] <yecril71>
A valid floating point number represents an abstract object with the following properties:

[04:49:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, ABNF!

[04:49:01.0000] <yecril71>
sign, value (as integer), exponent (as integer).

[04:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: that doesn't define what it means, only what the syntax is

[04:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
yecril71: that doesn't say what a particular string represents

[04:49:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes RFC 3339 doesn't define what the string means

[04:50:00.0000] <yecril71>
Figuring out what a particular string represents is called parsing.

[04:51:00.0000] <yecril71>
Do you want to parse without resorting to the parsing algorithm?

[04:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
no, i want to define what a string means for authors, without them having to understand a fifteen step parsing algorithm

[04:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me does so and checks in the result

[04:55:00.0000] <yecril71>
Authors are expected to understand what a decimal expansion is.

[04:55:01.0000] <yecril71>
The exponent is a notation for multiplication.

[04:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
nothing in the spec actually said that until abotu 2 minutes ago

[04:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how to resolve zcorpan's feedback regarding the parsing of numbers

[04:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
IE's parsing algorithm is wacky

[04:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me places bet it's saner than its HTTP parsing

[04:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
 IE checks if the next character is [a-zA-Z] or [\192-\214] or

[04:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
> [\216-\246] or [\248-\501] or [\506-\535] or [\592-\680] or \902 or

[04:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
> [\905-\906] or \908 or [\910-\929] .... etc, and if so, drop the

[04:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
> attribute. 

[04:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me doesn't understand what determines membership in that set

[04:58:05.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: IE's number parsing algorithm parses HTTP? :P

[04:58:06.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: :P

[04:58:07.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: I haven't even looked a number parsing in HTTP

[04:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But that description so far seems saner than parts of the HTTP behaviour

[05:01:00.0000] <yecril71>
I would say IE treats letters as invalid but allows symbols at the end.

[05:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
define "letters"?

[05:02:01.0000] <yecril71>
You already have.

[05:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
as what?

[05:03:00.0000] <yecril71>
[a-zA-Z] or [\192-\214] or�

[05:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
or what? the list above is incomplete.

[05:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
and i certainly don't want to list the entire unicode table with "yes" or "no" for each character.

[05:04:00.0000] <yecril71>
You can just refer to Unicode.

[05:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
...and say what?

[05:06:00.0000] <yecril71>
Letters are invalid, symbols are ignored.

[05:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
what do you mean by "letters"?

[05:07:00.0000] <yecril71>
Characters used to spell words.

[05:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
is U+8273 a letter?

[05:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
or U+2874

[05:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
or any other character?

[05:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
we need to define this precisely

[05:07:05.0000] <Hixie>
in a way that matches IE

[05:07:06.0000] <Hixie>
if we are to do this

[05:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
just saying "letters" is inadequate

[05:08:01.0000] <yecril71>
U+8273 is a letter.

[05:09:00.0000] <annevk>
Is "Letter" a character class in Unicode?

[05:09:01.0000] <yecril71>
I guess so.

[05:09:02.0000] <annevk>
e.g. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/20bw873z.aspx suggests Microsoft might use something like that

[05:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
guessing isn't really going to cut it here

[05:10:01.0000] <yecril71>
The meaning of punctures depends on the language.

[05:11:00.0000] <yecril71>
I think they should not be treated as letters.

[05:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
what we think isn't really relevant here

[05:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
if we're trying to match IE

[05:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yeah that might be what they're using. i'd need to check the ranges.

[05:12:00.0000] <yecril71>
Note that IE supports BMP characters only.

[05:16:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/PropList.txt code points marked L& are that class prolly

[05:16:01.0000] <annevk>
/me is not sure whether the list is complete, though it looks like it

[05:19:00.0000] <yecril71>
The list is expected to grow as new characters are identified.

[05:19:01.0000] <annevk>
/me whois test

[05:20:00.0000] <annevk>
wtf, HTTP stopped working

[05:20:01.0000] <annevk>
yecril71, sure

[05:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Should "-0" be a valid signed integer?

[05:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: If it is, it doesn't represent the negative number represented in base ten by the string "0", it just represents zero

[05:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm

[05:27:00.0000] <yecril71>
How can a script detect HTTP 404 in a window it is driving?

[05:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: better?

[05:28:01.0000] <yecril71>
responseXML is called XMLDocument in mshtml

[05:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
yecril71: the server knows it sent a 404, so it can put a marker in the page

[05:29:00.0000] <yecril71>
But the marker can be faked.

[05:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Sounds okay now

[05:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
if the server is faking the marker, it can fake the 404...

[05:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
(where "okay" means "probably about correct", as opposed to "understandable and helpful to normal people")

[05:30:03.0000] <yecril71>
The server cannot fake the 404.

[05:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
The server can fake the 404.

[05:31:01.0000] <yecril71>
If the server returns 404, it is genuine.

[05:31:02.0000] <jwalden>
<?php header("HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"); ?> or somesuch

[05:31:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Valid floating point numbers don't really represent m*10^e - they represent a floating point approximation of that number

[05:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: wow, congratulations on your appointement in the svgwg

[05:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: how do you mean?

[05:32:01.0000] <jwalden>
Hixie: 2, not 10

[05:32:02.0000] <yecril71>
jwalden: that is still genuine.

[05:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why he is able to send messages to this channel but has not received any for the past few minutes

[05:32:04.0000] <jwalden>
not sure I understand "genuine"

[05:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thus relies on krijnh's logs to allow bidirectional communication

[05:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
yecril71: if your point is that the server can make mistakes, then yes, but that's a bug in the server. it can just as easily make the mistake of sending back 404 for a page that it shouldn't send back a 404 for.

[05:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
jwalden: 5e3 is 5 x 10 ^ 3

[05:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
jwalden: not 5 x 2 ^ 3

[05:34:00.0000] <yecril71>
The server has an ultimate authority on the resources it serves.

[05:34:01.0000] <jwalden>
maybe I don't have enough context; I was assuming this was in reference to idealized floating-point numbers

[05:34:02.0000] <yecril71>
If it says it is not there, it is not there.

[05:34:03.0000] <yecril71>
It is like immaculate conception.

[05:35:00.0000] <yecril71>
God cannot lie, and the server cannot fake 404.

[05:35:01.0000] <yecril71>
Once it returns 404, the resource is REALLY NOT THERE.

[05:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
god is omnipotent, of course he can lie :-)

[05:36:00.0000] <yecril71>
God cannot lie in the sense that whatever he says, becomes truth at the very moment.

[05:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
so what happens if god says "This sentence is a lie"?

[05:37:01.0000] <yecril71>
Our universe transforms to an alternative one.

[05:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
(or what happens if you are trying to find a picture of god, and you go to http://example.org/god, and the server returns a picture of god, with the status code 404?)

[05:38:01.0000] <takkaria>
"please leave your sense of logic at the door" has never been more applicable

[05:39:00.0000] <yecril71>
The client script cannot detect it is 404.

[05:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I mean that e.g. "1e-1" doesn't represent 1*10^-1, it represents (something)*2^(something) which is a different number

[05:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: no, it represents 0.1. Now the browser might have a hardware limitation that prevents it from accurately representing that number efficiently, and thus it might not in fact treat it as 0.1 but as some rough approximation of 0.1, but the string itself actually represents 0.1.

[05:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess that's just a matter of perspective :-)

[05:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: put it this way. if a browser implemented html5 using bcd representations, would it be non-conforming?

[05:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Probably, because ECMAScript requires IEEE 754 double semantics

[05:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
certainly when exposing the numbers to ECMAScript they'd need to be converted to base-2 representations

[05:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
but we're not talking about JS APIs here

[05:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

I thought BCD was something they made up to waste time in computing classes

[05:47:00.0000] <yecril71>
BCD is for calculating your tax returns.

[05:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
Some CPUs have special instructions for BCD computations

[05:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
What's BCD?

[05:47:03.0000] <yecril71>
And the balance of your bank account.

[05:47:04.0000] <yecril71>
Binary Code for Digits.

[05:47:05.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Binary Coded Decimal

[05:48:00.0000] <takkaria>
fixed-point, surely, not BCD?

[05:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: which is where you take a decimal number, then represent each digit as 4 binary digits

[05:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
fun

[05:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: (so e.g. a 32-bit register could represent a 8-digit decimal number)

[05:48:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[05:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
It makes arithmetic more fun

[05:49:01.0000] <yecril71>
IMB invented BCD for financial calculations on mainframes.

There is no way the page can know if the document has been printed or not.

[05:51:01.0000] <yecril71>
Short of revieweing a scan of the printout, that is.

[05:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: You'd want fixed-point rather than floating-point, but I guess you'd want it to be decimal fixed-point rather than binary fixed-point so that you can convert to/from human-readable decimal representations with much less cost

[05:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to make notes on 100 pages per day to get through all the texts for his English dissertation before term starts again

[05:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: (because converting a binary number to a decimal string is probably very expensive when the numbers have a dozen digits and your CPU is made of cheese and string)

[05:54:00.0000] <takkaria>
true

[05:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me once made a three-digit binary-to-decimal converter at school using simple NAND/NOR/etc chips, and it took two whole breadboards

[05:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I probably should have just used a BCD chip, but that would have been no fun)

[05:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Your school had BCD chips?

MikeSmith: Music suggestions?

Footnotes are different from asides.

[06:04:00.0000] <yecril71>
Asides provide illustrative content, 

[06:04:01.0000] <yecril71>
foot notes provide technical content that is no fun to read.

[06:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Flann O'Brien proved some things about footnotes a while before that

[06:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: But I've never read anything he wrote, whereas I have read HHGTTG, so I can only use the latter as evidence :-p

[06:13:00.0000] <takkaria>

What is fun in "op.cit., 100-157?"

[06:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yecril71: stop, stop, you're making me do bellylaughs

[06:16:00.0000] <yecril71>
I shall consider stopping as soon as I get a decent footnote element.

[06:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: you have something to look forward to if you've never read Flann O'Brien

[06:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: That's only something to look forward to if I ever plan to read him in the future

[06:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me goes back to writing notes on Nabokov

[06:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yecril71: I recommend you stick to telling jokes like "op.cit., 100-157?".. that one's a classic. You should be a professional footnote comedian.

[06:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
That seems a very specialised profession

[06:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
LaTeX makes it a bit tricky to have footnotes inside footnotes, which always annoys me

[06:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

[06:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tries to imagine Philip` trying such things

[06:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me fails miserably

[06:26:00.0000] <yecril71>
It is not possible to getElementById an element in a disconnected subtree,

[06:27:00.0000] <yecril71>
therefore the uniqueness restriction of identifiers in disconnected subtrees

[06:27:01.0000] <yecril71>
arguably serves no purpose.

[06:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: I think the closest I'll ever get to that is trying BSD

[06:31:00.0000] <annevk>
yecril71, fwiw, IRC is not the best place to comment on the spec (I might have mentioned this already...)

[06:32:00.0000] <annevk>
yecril71, that is, unless Hixie is around and happens to be editing that part of the specification, it's generally a waste of time

[06:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I guarantee you the Berkeley guys who came up with BSD did their fair share of ther *SD and psilocybin. Billy Joy needed the holy ghost to be able to write his TCP/IP implementation

[06:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yecril71: I think your IRC comments need more footnotes, preferably humorous ones.

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: That's not possible unless IRC has explicit syntax to represent footnote semantics

[06:40:00.0000] <yecril71>
Hixie has encouraged me to share my comments here.

[06:40:01.0000] <yecril71>
This way, he wastes my time by sending irrelevant information to me,

[06:41:00.0000] <jwalden>
probably to stimulate discussion before a proposal, I suspect

[06:41:01.0000] <yecril71>
while I do not waste his.

[06:41:02.0000] <jwalden>
email discussion is no fun for hashing out basics, too slow

[06:41:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I'm already on top of it. I'm on the #irc channel the master IRC network alerting J. Oikarinen about his lack of foresight

[06:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: Are you writing a XML-based replacement as well?

[06:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Atom is a good starting point

[06:44:02.0000] <takkaria>
the IRC protocol is a wonderful mess that deviates significantly from its documentation

[06:45:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva :D

[06:45:01.0000] <yecril71>
I imagine Hixie can scan the logs if he wishes to, provided the log machine works.

[06:46:00.0000] <yecril71>
So it is not quite like typing into the void.

[06:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: I think that's an understatement

[06:47:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, he has his own logs, but he rarely replies to random banter :)

[06:48:00.0000] <yecril71>
It is me who is replying here.

Dashiva: I'm writing it in Lisp

[06:53:00.0000] <takkaria>
s-expressions for IRC actually aren't a bad idea

[06:54:00.0000] <yecril71>
Playing jingles in the backround of spoken text does not seem like a good idea.

[06:54:01.0000] <yecril71>
It can make the text significantly harder to understand.

[06:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Why are there so many good Finnish bands?

CSS behaviors, as implemented by Internet Explorer, are quite convenient.

[07:05:00.0000] <yecril71>
On the other hand, they require scripts to run anyway, 

[07:05:01.0000] <yecril71>
and once scripts can run, the events can be attached using a setup script.

[07:06:00.0000] <yecril71>
This would require the CSS selector API.

[08:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: XMPP already supports multi-user chat, so that'd probably be a better starting point

[08:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
or maybe it's already the finishing point

[08:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
but anyway it uses XML so it must be good

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Never mind that you can basically destroy an entire channel by sending namespace-ill-formed XML that the server will blindly retransmit to every other user in the channel and cause their connections to drop)

[08:13:00.0000] <jwalden>
that's a server bug, no?

[08:13:01.0000] <jwalden>
or so I'd expect

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes (in ejabberd) - it's fixable, but not trivially, and it's the kind of bug that XML seems to encourage

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's non-trivial because you need a namespace-aware self-contained-XML-fragment serialiser, and you need it written in Erlang)

[08:20:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, class names are case-insensitive?

thanks Hixie (re svgwg)

[14:04:00.0000] <heycam>
Philip`, i'd say that "-0" shouldn't be a signed integer, one reason for which would be that the integral types in Web IDL don't include a "-0" value

[14:04:01.0000] <heycam>
(though float does)

[14:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
heycam: There already isn't a one-to-one mapping between strings and values, e.g. "01" and "1" both mean the same number, so is it bad if "-0" and "0" both mean the same number too?

[14:11:00.0000] <heycam>
i don't think having multiple strings mapping to the same number is a problem.  but the fact that "01" means the same regardless of whether the type is a long or a float, but "-0" means different things, might be trouble.

[14:11:01.0000] <heycam>
well not trouble, ...

[14:11:02.0000] <heycam>
but unexpected

[14:12:00.0000] <heycam>
(though i expect the number of authors to know about negative zeroes in floats to be small anyway)

[14:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
heycam: As far as I can tell, "-0" means the same as "0" in HTML5's definition of floating point numbers, because it's defined in terms of ideal real numbers

[14:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and ideal real numbers don't have a -0)

[14:20:00.0000] <heycam>
oh

[14:20:01.0000] <heycam>
so html5 parsing of floats is different from ecma-262 parsing of floats

[14:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
HTML5 parsing of floats doesn't even allow "1e+1"

[14:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It only allows "1e1" and "1e-1")

[14:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is probably going to be horribly confusing for anyone who's generating HTML from a language that serialises large floating point numbers with "...e+...", i.e. pretty much any language

[14:24:01.0000] <heycam>
yeah, i think it would be better if they parsed the same

[14:24:02.0000] <heycam>
is there a particular reason to disallow "1e+1" and other things?

[14:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ask Hixie :-)

[14:25:01.0000] <heycam>
Hixie is hereby asked

[14:26:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
iirc, it's to be compatible with parseInt() in as many languages as possible

[14:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Why would you parse a floating point number with parseInt?

[14:26:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
er

[14:26:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
parseFloat

[14:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems much more useful to be compatible with printFloat, because millions of people are going to be doing that, whereas about five people are going to be writing web browsers that have to parse these floats

[14:27:01.0000] <heycam>
and they already have routines for parsing floats with "e+" in them from the js engines, i suppose

[14:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
please send e-mail if you want e+ support

[14:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me was thinking of http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#number

[14:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Ah, I was thinking of http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#rules-for-parsing-floating-point-number-values

[14:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
particularly when it's used for reflecting content attributes

[14:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me will send e-mail

[14:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me often emails himself

[14:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is that much of a loner

[14:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me waves from London

[14:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
I arrived here earlier this afternoon

[14:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
How come you're in London?

[14:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
holiday

[14:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
also because there is an Australia shop here where I can stock up on my supplies of Vegemite, Tim Tams, Aeroplane Jelly and Cottees Cordial

[14:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is Vegemite much different to Marmite?

[14:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
I just hope they have all that stuff in stock. If they don't, I'll be disappointed because the shipping costs for that stuff if I have to get it posted are expensive

[14:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
Vegemite is the original and superior version of Marmite

[14:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think marmite is quite disqusting, actually

[14:48:02.0000] <Lachy>
*disgusting

[14:49:00.0000] <smedero>
what are the differences in texture and/or taste?

[14:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
marmite is a lot more runny

[14:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
it's difficult to describe the differences in taste

[14:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
smedero, what country are you in?

[14:50:01.0000] <smedero>
united states

[14:50:02.0000] <smedero>
/me hides

[14:50:03.0000] <Lachy>
there are some Australia stores in the US. Order a small tube of it and try it out

[14:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
do you get marmite in the uS?

[14:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me takes his pitch-fork to smedero

[14:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
It comes in tubes? How odd

[14:51:03.0000] <Lachy>
it comes in tubes and jars

[14:51:04.0000] <smedero>
yeah, i've come across it from time to time... more so in the northeast than here on the west coast.

[14:51:05.0000] <Lachy>
the tubes are smaller, lighter and cost less to post

[14:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
it also comes in 1.5kg tubs, which I will get if I can find it here

[14:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
1.5KG!?

[14:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah. I only saw it a few times though while I was in Aus. Though I never bought it because the smaller jars were more convenient and getting more wasn't a problem back then.

[14:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
larry finally replied to my e-mail on www-tag

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
but it seems he just restated his original statement using a different pair of terms

[14:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
ignoring my points entirely

[14:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Why would we care about your points?

[14:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, you're Hixie.

[14:54:04.0000] <gsnedders>
By definition, you are wrong. You're not Linus Torvalds.

[14:55:00.0000] <roc>
Marmite predates Vegemite

[14:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
woah! 2.5kg http://www.everythingaustralian.com/ve2tubainst.html

[14:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
roc, wow. I didn't realise that. I always though marmite was the rip off product

[14:58:01.0000] <roc>
of course, you're Austrlian

[14:58:02.0000] <roc>
you obviously think you invented the pavlova as well

[14:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
of course :-)

[15:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
wtf? Wikipedia says it may have come from New Zealand 

[15:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hah.

[15:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
and it also claims ANZAC biscuits came from there too. I refuse toe believe that

[15:01:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Australia does not rule the world.

[15:01:04.0000] <Lachy>
s/toe/to/

[15:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought pavlova was designed as a treat to be used in canine psychology experiments

[15:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, sure it does

[15:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
well, at least we can still claim to have invented the Lamingtons

[15:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
You can _claim_ whatever the hell you want.

[15:02:04.0000] <gsnedders>
You just probably won't be right to claim absolutely anything.

[15:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me congratulates Lachy for the invention of something he's never heard of

[15:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamington

[15:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
I made a batch of those myself yesterday and brought them with me to London

[15:04:01.0000] <heycam>
"Tea and lamingtons are part of the festivities that follow Australian Citizenship ceremonies."

[15:04:02.0000] <heycam>
citation required? :)

[15:05:00.0000] <roc>
that seems too hokey to be true, even for Australians

[15:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That whole article seems rather devoid of citations

[15:05:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I was surprised when I read that. But I can't confirm or deny it since I never had to go through the ceremony

[15:05:03.0000] <roc>
after the tea and lamingtons you have to go surfing and play "Waltzing Matilda" on a digeridoo

[15:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[15:07:00.0000] <heycam>
one thing you do get after being conferred citizenship at a cermemony is a native australian plant

[15:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
heycam, is that a Gum Tree or Wattle or something else?

[15:08:01.0000] <heycam>
Lachy, i'm not sure, i never looked closely to see what sort of plant it was

[15:08:02.0000] <heycam>
(for the 2 or 3 that i've seen)

[15:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
heycam, those 2 plants are distinctive enough to not need a close inspection to identify

[15:15:00.0000] <heycam>
probably, although i don't know if a young wattle would have the bright yellow flowers to make it easier to distinguish

[15:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[15:18:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: i'd like to look at some pages that match (maxlength|hspace|vspace|border|cols|rows|size|span|colspan|rowspan|cellpadding|cellspacing|topmargin|leftmargin|marginwidth|marginheight|scrollamount|scrolldelay|start|value|width|height)\s*=\s*["']?\s*\d+[a-zA-Z]

[15:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[15:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
i know what zcorpan is doing!

[15:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
and i approve

[15:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
please do let me know your results

[15:19:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Working out WTF IE is doing :P

[15:20:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
no, trying to figure out if we should do what mozilla does or not

[15:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: btw, firefox does it in standards mode too... my remark about quirks was unrelated

[15:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
really? i fouund differences when i tested it

[15:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what i was testing

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe it was safari

[15:26:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it's easy to get confused while testing it (i got width/height backwards when testing moz) :)

[15:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Millions of people write <td width="123px"> etc - should I try excluding those?

[15:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Lots of people write <input value="123abc"> etc too - should I remove 'value' from the list?

[15:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Man, there is no consensus for weather forecasts for Saturday for Edi

[15:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
I forecast that it will be cold, and maybe wet

[15:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[15:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is probably going to go to Edinburgh for no real reason

[15:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Just to do something different.

[15:39:00.0000] <roc>
zcorpan_: what are you talking about?

[15:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: http://philip.html5.org/data/attribute-numbers-followed-by-letters.txt

[15:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: http://philip.html5.org/data/attribute-numbers-followed-by-letters-excluding-boring-stuff.txt

[15:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: (I can make the list longer if you wait a while)

[15:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
the "px" case seems like a very important one

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
does IE really ignore all those cases?

[15:42:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
roc: <table width="100a"> vs <table width="100x">

[15:43:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: ie doesn't do it for width/height

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[15:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
then philip should exclude width/height, not "px" :-)

[15:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
most of the rest seem to be <font size=...pt>

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
does it do it for size=""?

[15:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
did i write a-z? i meant a-f :/

[15:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[15:47:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
sorry

[15:47:03.0000] <Philip`>
Should I try it again with [a-f]?

[15:47:04.0000] <Philip`>
(Should I still include 'value'?)

[15:49:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
if you like :) (and no)

[15:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/data/attribute-numbers-followed-by-af.txt is not many yet

[16:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that he made it case-insensitive, and added \s at the beginning because otherwise it picked up lots of lines of JS code like thing.style.width='10px' etc

[16:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: "Decriminalise incest and prostitution." — trying to be controversial? :P

[16:26:00.0000] <takkaria>
no, I just don't think the state should be moralising

[16:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
(incest marriage or incest conception? the latter isn't a moral matter but a health matter.)

[16:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
the chance of having congenital defects if born from a incestuous couple is only a tiny bit larger than non-incestous couples, AIUI

[16:31:00.0000] <webben>
/me thought the point of the state was to be demoralizing. ;)

[16:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: Maybe it's only a tiny bit larger for the first generation, but it compounds if you carry on several times?

[16:37:00.0000] <webben>
Philip`: I wonder if that's not unlikely in the absence of socio-political structures actively encouraging incestuous unions?

[16:37:01.0000] <webben>
(e.g. structures like inheritance regimes where you're trying to keep property or power within a given kin-group)

[16:38:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me -> bed

[16:40:00.0000] <VeXocide>
hi, besides the html5lib python and ruby implementation, i was wondering if there was one in C++

[16:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria has one, i believe, and hsivonen is working on converting his java implementation to C++

[16:41:00.0000] <VeXocide>
nice, and are they open source, because if so, it'll mean a hell of a lot less work for me :)

[16:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
i believe so

[16:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria, hsivonen?

[16:41:03.0000] <jmb>
yes, and yes

[16:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria: the chances of defects go up significantly with each incestuous generation, as i understand it (just look at the european monarchies of the last millenia)

[16:43:00.0000] <VeXocide>
any links, and this means i can stop trying to do it myself, which is probably a good thing

[16:43:01.0000] <jmb>
http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/

[16:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
VeXocide: http://www.netsurf-browser.org/projects/hubbub/

[16:44:00.0000] <takkaria>
Hixie: right, but I find it unlikely that that will happen

[16:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Right, but I think at the state of the first generation it is fairly low

[16:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not disagreeing with that, i was just saying that it wasn't a moral issue

[16:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: What about the age of consent as well, then :P

[16:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Now that really is a stupid law. Any law which the vast majority break really should be reconsidered.)

[16:46:01.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: I would like to see a study on the possible effects of lowering age of consent by a couple of years before saying anything firm on that

[16:46:02.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: I expect it would make pretty much no difference whatsoever

[16:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It's still a moral issue, because you're balancing the health of future generations and the desires of current generations

[16:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is listening to Desire by U2 from Rattle And Hum

[16:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: well, insofar as any law is a moral issue, sure

[16:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: I mean, currently here there are two different legal statuses. One is statutory rape (< 13), and the other is the lesser charge of underage sex.

[16:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: I wonder how many people are actually convicted of the latter charge, and what their mean age is

[16:49:01.0000] <VeXocide>
and there actually is some documentation, how lovely \o/

[16:49:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has also totally dragged the channel off-topic, again

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah how dare you take us away from whining about the w3c process

[16:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
There again, expecting the channel to be on-topic would be logical

[16:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Therefore, being off-topic is to be expected

[16:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyone want to volunteer to find out which properties should be [Replaceable] ?

[16:51:03.0000] <VeXocide>
haha, thanks a bunch Philip`, gonna have a serious look at hubbub

[16:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: freedom of information act could tell you that :)

[16:52:01.0000] <takkaria>
VeXocide: any questions direct at me or jmb, we wrote it :)

[16:53:00.0000] <takkaria>
probably me, since volunteering jmb probably isn't appreciated ^_^

[16:53:01.0000] <jmb>
/me disowns all responsibility :P

[16:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: That means putting in a request in all likelihood, which means bothering

[16:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Instead of just randomly wondering on IRC

[16:54:00.0000] <takkaria>
true.  I suspect that child protection laws are probably strong enough to drop the age of consent a couple years without any ill effects

[16:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Rape would still apply as it does now, so it would make little difference

[16:55:01.0000] <VeXocide>
takkaria, is there any simple implementation which reads a file, parses it, and outputs it in some form ?

[16:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Other issue with getting data: Scotland is seperate

[16:55:03.0000] <takkaria>
VeXocide: yeah, the test programs do

[16:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: I also have no idea how to actually make such a request :P

[16:59:00.0000] <VeXocide>
great, then i'm going to bookmark this, and actually catch up on sleep

[17:00:00.0000] <jmb>
takkaria: I suggest we take NetSurf's hubbub_binding.c and turn it into an example driver for hubbub

[17:01:00.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: just send a request to the home office, or the equivalent in scotland

[17:02:00.0000] <takkaria>
jmb: yeah, not a bad plan.  I could get onto that tomorrow morning

[17:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Not the justice ministry?

[17:02:02.0000] <VeXocide>
well, if there is any way of taking a piece of possibly borked html input, and outputting a clean tree, i'd be very happy

[17:02:03.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: maybe them

[17:03:00.0000] <takkaria>
VeXocide: you mean, serialised?

[17:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
VeXocide: Do you need a real HTML5 parser, or could something like libxml2's HTML parser work too?

[17:04:00.0000] <takkaria>
we don't serialise, but you can get a tree easily enough

[17:04:01.0000] <VeXocide>
takkaria, preferably, but i can do serialisation myself

[17:04:02.0000] <VeXocide>
fair enough

[17:04:03.0000] <jmb>
implementing the serialisation algorithm is on the todo list. somewhere, anyway :)

[17:04:04.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/scots/index.htm — awesome.

[17:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I have never seen anything so format in Scots.

[17:05:01.0000] <takkaria>
jmb: I guess we'd have to have a vtable for the tree access functions in the serialising code, since we can't rely on any particular implementation

[17:05:02.0000] <jmb>
takkaria: yeah

[17:06:00.0000] <jmb>
takkaria: basically the inverse of the treebuilder, I guess

[17:06:01.0000] <VeXocide>
Philip`, it's mostly the borked html which causes problem, we currently have a tokenizer and parser which works fine but there are seemingly infinately many corner cases

[17:06:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm not sure where in Scotland would be relevant

[17:07:00.0000] <VeXocide>
taking clean html or xml and turning it into a tree is relatively easy compared to parsing the mess out there on the interwebs

[17:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
VeXocide: libxml2 says it "should be able to parse "real world" HTML, even if severely broken from a specification point of view", though I have no idea how well it works in practice, and HTML5 is much more likely to be similar to what web browsers do

[17:08:01.0000] <VeXocide>
Philip`, the reason i found html5 interesting is because the spec describes a complete tokeniser 

[17:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It doesn't that well

[17:08:03.0000] <jmb>
Philip`: badly

[17:08:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(libxml2)

[17:08:05.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[17:08:06.0000] <jmb>
Philip`: if it worked, hubbub wouldn't exist

[17:08:07.0000] <jmb>
(NetSurf used to use libxml's parser)

[17:08:08.0000] <VeXocide>
that was basically my conclusion

[17:09:00.0000] <VeXocide>
libxml2 works fine if the input is nice, but it will mess up under pressure

[17:09:01.0000] <jmb>
takkaria: feel free to relicense the result under MIT or somesuch -- only you and I have done anything significant to that file

[17:10:00.0000] <VeXocide>
we're basically looking for a tree which describes the html as well as it can, but one we can rely upon to be good

[17:11:00.0000] <takkaria>
jmb: alright

[17:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders quite how to write the request

[17:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finds an issue with the Sexual Offences Act 1956 which surely goes against Human Rights legislation

[17:13:01.0000] <takkaria>
what's that?

[17:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
"A man also commits rape if he induces a married woman to have sexual intercourse with him by impersonating her husband."

[17:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
That doesn't take into account (and there is no amendment thereof) for same-sex civil partnerships

[17:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is the Act full of useful tips like that?

[17:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1956/cukpga_19560069_en_1 if you are curious

[17:14:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Good reading at 1:20am.

[17:15:00.0000] <takkaria>
VeXocide: well, libxml2 does alright, but not always and html5 is the better option.  hubbub can give you a tree easily, so it sounds like it might be useful to you.  it is C, though C++ bindings would be quite welcome

[17:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Section 6 of part one is what is relevant

[17:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wow, the law is bizarre

[17:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
"A man is not guilty of an offence under this section because he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of sixteen, if he is under the age of twenty-four and has not previously been charged with a like offence, and he believes her to be of the age of sixteen or over and has reasonable cause for the belief."

[17:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(it then goes on to define "a like offence")

[17:16:03.0000] <VeXocide>
takkaria, C is just fine, i basically used C++ because i had a tokeniser, scanner and parser framework for it

[17:17:00.0000] <VeXocide>
and if i can build and walk a tree in memory, i'd be delighted, serialization should be relatively easy

[17:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The act of buggery is illegal between two men if it happens when more than two person take part or are present, or in a public loo.

[17:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(WTF?)

[17:18:01.0000] <VeXocide>
actually, if i write a nice serializer i'd probably release it under mit

[17:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: it was considered that gay men would meet up in public toilets to have sex, tha law was put there to try and stop it

[17:21:01.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: are you sure there's no updated legislation?

[17:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: There's no modification noted

[17:22:01.0000] <webben>
Are modifications from subsequent statutes noted?

[17:22:02.0000] <takkaria>
it could have been superceded, maybe?

[17:22:03.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: And I'm aware of its origins. I just didn't think it still existed. And the first part still seems odd.

[17:22:04.0000] <webben>
/me would have that that such notes could be legally arguable.

[17:22:05.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: That would be noted as a modification.

[17:22:06.0000] <takkaria>
since they seem like anarchonisms that shouldn't be on the books anymore

[17:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The act in 2000 lowering the age to 16 doesn't touch it

[17:25:00.0000] <jmb>
VeXocide: hubbub is designed to allow you to use whatever in-memory format you like -- the client has to provide a bunch of callbacks used to build a tree. test/tree.c should give you some idea of how to drive it (though it's not remotely well commented). hopefully takkaria will have something more friendly soon :)

[17:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs

[17:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
The entire issue of homosexuality is stupid.

[17:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(I mean in the sense of making it an issue whatsoever.)

[17:26:01.0000] <VeXocide>
jmb, well, consider me seriously interested and following this code

[17:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Not homosexuality being an issue itself.)

[17:27:00.0000] <VeXocide>
and probably committing some stuff if it's usefull

[17:27:01.0000] <jmb>
VeXocide: cool

[17:31:00.0000] <VeXocide>
jmb, well, it's nice to see a browser which actually uses a seperate parser

[17:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
This act is screwed up and hard to read.

[17:31:02.0000] <VeXocide>
webkit and gecko need you to initialise a rendering engine to parse html

[17:31:03.0000] <gsnedders>
The punishment for intercourse with a girl whose age is 13 ≥ age > 16 is two years, I think.

[17:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Did you intend that to be a zero-sized range?

[17:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, I've misread stuff.

[17:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm looking at the wrong act

[17:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: How is that zero-sized?

[17:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: The set of possible values for 'age' which are simultaneously less than or equal to 13, and greater than 16, is quite limited

[17:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I typed ≥ and not ≤

[17:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Or have I totally fucked up?

[17:34:03.0000] <VeXocide>
don't think so

[17:34:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You said "13 >= age" which is equivalent to "age <= 13"

[17:34:05.0000] <VeXocide>
then again, i'm falling half asleep

[17:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: and also you said "age > 16" which means what it says, and is also wrong

[17:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yes, I have

[17:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
13 <= age < 16.

[17:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me was trying to evaluate from rtl and not ltr

[17:35:04.0000] <Philip`>
Too lazy to find the Unicode character this time? ;-)

[17:37:00.0000] <heycam>
/me would love to be able to use vim digraphs in os x / gtk input fields

[17:37:01.0000] <heycam>
or even to be able to escape to a vim to edit the contents of them

[17:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No, I was just copying and pasting what I was checking in Python :)

[17:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: And Py doesn't like ≤

[17:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone here write chinese or japanese?

[17:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: I give up with the 2003 law, I'm just confused by it

[17:41:00.0000] <jmb>
gsnedders: that's the point of legislation, right?

[17:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jmb: The 1956 act is readable

[17:41:02.0000] <VeXocide>
i've had a pretty serious look at the python tokenizer from html5lib, and it looks pretty ok

[17:41:03.0000] <jmb>
gsnedders: provide a barrier to entry to its interpretation :)

[17:41:04.0000] <jmb>
gsnedders: ah, they knew how to write in those days

[17:42:00.0000] <VeXocide>
it's just a shame the inputstream is slow, mostly because there aren't any pointers in python ;)

[17:42:01.0000] <jmb>
gsnedders: these days, noone has the attention span

[17:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It seemingly makes it illegal for someone 18 or older to do any sexual touching (snogging?) of someone under 16

[17:44:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, what level do you need?

[17:44:01.0000] <heycam>
i can read/write a very tiny amount of chinese

[17:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
VeXocide: The input stream doesn't seem to be a huge bottleneck now - it's the whole parser that's slow, which makes it hard to optimise :-(

[17:44:03.0000] <VeXocide>
Philip`, hmz ok, never got that far

[17:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Oh, sex is a public loo is now illegal regardless of who it involves

[17:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
I found quite a few ways to get ~5% speedups in html5lib, but it's still orders of magnitude slower than the Java parser

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: enough to make up a convincing example of <ruby> usage in japanese and/or chinese

[17:55:00.0000] <heycam>
the use of ruby isn't that common in chinese, a japanese example would be more convincing

[17:55:01.0000] <heycam>
and for that i suppose MikeSmith would be a good person to ask

[17:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jmb: Also, the proposed new Scottish law is readable

[18:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The amount of crime done by each age increases up to the age of 18

[18:04:00.0000] <olliej>
Philip`: the best way to improve performance is to rewrite it in assembler. duh. :D

[18:04:01.0000] <olliej>
/me hides

[18:04:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:D

[18:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm still convinced of where to make a request under the freedom of information act

[18:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i'd like both

[18:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
woo, MikeSmith is here now

[18:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: would you be able to provide a more correct example of <ruby> than the one now in the spec?

[18:07:03.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, ok i'll try to come up with a chinese example

[18:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: or more than one

[18:07:05.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: cool, that'd be really helpful

[18:07:06.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: if you can just lift one from some existing text that's even better, fwiw

[18:10:00.0000] <heycam>
oh i found an example of using bopomofo ruby in css3-ruby

[18:10:01.0000] <heycam>
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ruby/ figure 4.1.3

[18:11:00.0000] <heycam>
that's nifty, i didn't know bopomofo goes vertically top-to-bottom besides each ltr chinese character

[18:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to introduce new examples rather than reuse the ones in those specs -- reusing the one that's in the html5 spec now is how i ended up needing a new example in the first place :-P

[18:14:00.0000] <heycam>
how big do you want the example?  just a few characters?

[18:15:00.0000] <heycam>
and what do you want, a png/svg of some text using ruby?  the html markup?

[18:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie, heycam: a simple example would be 漢字

[18:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
かん じ

[18:16:02.0000] <jcranmer>
kanji :-)

[18:17:00.0000] <jcranmer>
that's really the kanji for kanji?

[18:17:01.0000] <heycam>
no, hanzi :)

[18:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[18:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
is that one base and one ruby?

[18:17:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
two base and two ruby

[18:17:05.0000] <Hixie>
awesome

[18:17:06.0000] <jcranmer>
I'm guessing the かん is ruby for the first, じ for the second

[18:17:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[18:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
字 is じ "ji" .. it means "character"

[18:19:00.0000] <jcranmer>
The only kanji I can recognize is nippon

[18:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
文字列 also uses 字

[18:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
文字列 might be a good choice too

[18:19:03.0000] <heycam>
ㄏㄢˋ ㄗˋ

[18:19:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
it means "string"

[18:19:05.0000] <heycam>
i think is the bopmofo for han4zi4

[18:19:06.0000] <heycam>
gotta check the second syllable tho

[18:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
string in the programming sense

[18:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
もじれつ

[18:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
mo-ji-retsu

[18:24:00.0000] <jcranmer>
drat, I seem to have lost japanese character support somewhere along the line

[18:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: is the example at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-ruby-element right then?

[18:26:00.0000] <heycam>
ok i'm pretty sure "ㄗˋ" is right for the second character

[18:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yeah, it's right for Japanese

[18:27:00.0000] <heycam>
might be good to have an example using pinyin too

[18:30:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, http://paste.lisp.org/display/72812

[18:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: sweet, thanks

[18:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder why Brian Smith said "Also note that Chinese uses Ruby markup differently than Japanese, so a Chinese-language example would be a good idea as well"

[18:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/mid/003101c8bf64$f536e730$0202a8c0@T60

[18:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'll have to ask him

[18:33:00.0000] <heycam>
and here's a pinyin one: http://paste.lisp.org/display/72814

[18:33:01.0000] <heycam>
as would be used in mainland china

[18:33:02.0000] <heycam>
(the bopomofo would be for use in taiwan)

[18:34:00.0000] <heycam>
so with the pinyin one, the ruby would go on top of the characters (at least i've seen it like that in some children's books)

[18:34:01.0000] <heycam>
but bopomofo goes vertically on the right of each character

[18:34:02.0000] <heycam>
MikeSmith, in japanese you can write some string of ruby that corresponds to multiple kanji, can't you?

[18:35:00.0000] <heycam>
in chinese i don't think you would do that

[18:35:01.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, also note that in that pinyin example the 汉 is the simplified form of 漢, so it's really the same word

[18:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heycam: yeah, that's one of the things about written Japanese that makes it challenging.. it's not a one-to-one relationship between kanji and reading.. most individual kanji have at least two readings, and some have more

[18:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g.,  山 is both さん and やま - "san" and "yama"

[18:39:01.0000] <heycam>
さん sounds like the chinese-derived reading

[18:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[18:40:01.0000] <heycam>
but actually my question was more: for a given reading, would you map multiple kana to multiple kanji?

[18:40:02.0000] <heycam>
or can you always decompose that to multiple (or one) kana mapping to a single kanji?

[18:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
of the two base readings, one is a reading that orginally came from Chinese

[18:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
multiple kana to multiple kanji.. not sure what you mean

[18:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
you mean the same pair or string of kanji could have multiple readings?

[18:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., it would be ambiguous how to read them as a set?

[18:43:00.0000] <heycam>
i mean do you ever consider two kanji together, inseparably, and map those to a given string of kana?

[18:43:01.0000] <heycam>
or can you always split the kana up to the two kanji?

[18:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you read the two kanji together, inseparably

[18:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
you can't know how to read them just by looking at them individually

[18:44:02.0000] <heycam>
ok

[18:44:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
or you can't determine how to read them by looking at them individually

[18:44:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
an example:

[18:44:05.0000] <heycam>
and then the ruby is centered over the middle of the two kanji

[18:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, not necessarily

[18:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or not even usually

[18:45:02.0000] <heycam>
<ruby>kanji1kanji2<rt>blahblah</rt></ruby> ?

[18:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
no, they are still written over each kanji.. even if the reading depends on the combination

[18:46:01.0000] <heycam>
ah ok, understood

[18:46:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
馬車道 is an example

[18:46:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's the name of a place in Yokohama

[18:46:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
and my 10-year-old daughter and I were going there a while back

[18:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but neither of us know how to read that name

[18:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
although we knew all the characters

[18:48:01.0000] <heycam>
:)

[18:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
we said, うま くるま みち

[18:48:03.0000] <heycam>
horse chariot something?

[18:48:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, 

[18:48:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
but the way we were reading it, we knew it was wrong

[18:48:06.0000] <heycam>
heh

[18:48:07.0000] <heycam>
could people understand what you meant if you said it?

[18:48:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
the real reading is ば しゃ みち

[18:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heycam: yeah, they would

[18:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
though they would laugh

[18:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
they'd know what we were saying

[18:49:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
"basha" is the reading that comes from chinese

[18:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"uma" and "kuruma" are the normal Japanese readings for those

[18:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but "michi" is also the Japanese reading

[18:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
if that name were consistent in the way it used Chinese readings instead of Japanese ones,

[18:50:03.0000] <heycam>
so many options for the novice to choose!

[18:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that place should be called "bashadou"

[18:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heycam: yeah, it can make learning to read quite a challenge

[18:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and complicated by the fact that it doesn't always seem consistent

[18:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., why "bashamichi" instead of "bashadou"? who knows...

[18:54:00.0000] <heycam>
sounds more idiomatic than english pronunciations

[18:54:01.0000] <heycam>
/me afk dry cleaning

[19:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://bookoutlines.pbwiki.com/Predictably-Irrational is interesting

[19:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know what font this is? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/images/sample-ruby.png

[19:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm having trouble reproducing the quality of that example

[19:23:00.0000] <olliej>
lucida grande?

[19:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems like it

[19:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[19:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
next question

[19:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
why doesn't IE8 render Lucida Grande with antialiasing...?

[19:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me fakes it with safari

[19:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: should a ruby text be centered above its base? or left-aligned?

[19:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: for text that's written horizontally, it's centered

[19:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
k, thanks

[19:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok japanese ruby case done; now let's look at these chinese cases from heycam

[19:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: btw is your example the kanji for hanzi? or did i get confused at some point with the conversation earlier.

[19:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: what are the magic words i should use to describe these two examples?

[19:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: kanji

[19:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
the kanji for kanji?

[19:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
that is, the kanji for "kanji"?

[19:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yep

[19:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the actual kanji for "kanji"

[19:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[19:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
and heycam's examples are the bopomofo and pinyin respectively for "hanzi"?

[19:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
(which happens to be the same word but in chinese?)

[19:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I think so, but I don't know.. I don't know Chinese at all

[19:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what lang="" to use for his two examples

[19:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: what is the relationship between all this and "furigana"? any idea?

[20:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
(or zhuyin?)

[20:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah, zhuyin = bopomofo

[20:01:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, correct

[20:02:00.0000] <heycam>
so that's the same word ("chinese character") in japanese (mikesmith's example), traditional chinese (the bopomofo example) and simplified chinese (the pinyin example)

[20:03:00.0000] <heycam>
and yes zhuyin is bopmofo

[20:03:01.0000] <heycam>
i'd use zh-TW for the first and zh-CN for the second

[20:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
for both the base and the ruby?

[20:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: furigana is the normal/general term in Japanese for those annotations for readings, even outside of the online context

[20:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
or, as far as Japanese goes, ruby is a way to represent furigana

[20:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok so furigana=ruby, not one of the alphabets or languages used in the ruby

[20:05:01.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, yeah i'd use it for the whole thing

[20:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool, thanks

[20:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love hsivonen's validator

[20:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
it even checks language codes for correctness

[20:08:00.0000] <heycam>
you could even use zh-Hans-CN and zh-Hant-TW respectively, i suppose

[20:08:01.0000] <heycam>
dunno if there's an advantage in doing that though

[20:13:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, in the rendering of the pinyin example, you should put it over or under the characters, not next to like bopomofo

[20:13:01.0000] <heycam>
not sure which (above or below) is preferred, i've seen both

[20:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've done the pinyin already, take a look

[20:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
doing the middle one now

[20:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
(bopomofo)

[20:14:03.0000] <heycam>
ok cool, looks good

[20:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
two questions for bopomofo

[20:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
should the single bopomofo character be centered vertically next to the base glyph, or top-aligned?

[20:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
and how should I render the "..." bit?

[20:15:02.0000] <heycam>
vertically centered

[20:15:03.0000] <heycam>
dots just like in the pinyin example

[20:15:04.0000] <heycam>
but the tone mark needs to be placed specially

[20:16:00.0000] <heycam>
the ˋ should go just to the above and right of the previous bopomofo character (in this example, at least)

[20:16:01.0000] <heycam>
i found an image before showing this placement, hold on

[20:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's a ` ? :-)

[20:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh i see

[20:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
so there is

[20:17:01.0000] <heycam>
you can see it in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo#Writing

[20:18:00.0000] <heycam>
and in http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-ruby-20010216/bopomofo.gif

[20:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
wouldn't the ` go to the above and right pretty much automatically by virtue of just being next to the character?

[20:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
for the dots, i mean, how are ellipsis done in vertical text?

[20:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there a vertical ellipsis character?

[20:20:01.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, if you place the ` in the same line, instead of breaking before it?

[20:20:02.0000] <heycam>
i suppose it would

[20:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
cool ok, that's what i did without thinking of it :-)

[20:20:04.0000] <heycam>
not sure if the spacing would look right, or what the actual requirements are

[20:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me sidesteps the ... issue by removing the dots in the example!

[20:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, check it out now

[20:24:00.0000] <heycam>
if you include literal "." characters, then it would render like that

[20:24:01.0000] <heycam>
you'd need to include the actual other ellipsis character if you wanted it

[20:25:00.0000] <heycam>
oh you made the characters top-to-bottom

[20:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
is that wrong?

[20:26:01.0000] <heycam>
no, you can find vertical text in chinese

[20:26:02.0000] <heycam>
online it's more common to be ltr tho

[20:27:00.0000] <heycam>
the bopomofo looks good

[20:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok cool

[20:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
we'll try this and see who complains! :-D

[20:27:03.0000] <heycam>
heh ok

[20:28:00.0000] <heycam>
i sorta think the horizontal chinese characters looks cooler though, since then you have a combination of horizontal text with the vertical ruby

[20:28:01.0000] <heycam>
but it doesn't matter

[20:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
i had to fake all the typography using tables in safari

[20:28:03.0000] <heycam>
heh

[20:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
so we'll just go with this for now

[20:29:00.0000] <heycam>
/me lunch

[20:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
later

[20:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam, MikeSmith: thanks for the help

[20:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
cheers

[21:57:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, should the "<pre class=zh-TW>" be "<pre lang=zh-TW>"?  (and similarly for the zh-CN example)

[21:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
er yes

[01:55:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, heycam, why is the callback definition so verbose? can't the interface and handleEvent method all be implicit?

[02:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me replies from a mail from 2005

[02:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
man, i didn't realise i had any of those left

[02:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
(other than in the folders that i've intentionally not opened yet)

[02:16:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: slacker

[02:44:00.0000] <annevk>
heh, the Predictably-Irrational link is great

[02:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: s/next to/above/ in the pinyin ruby example

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
thx

[02:54:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: have got your irritating test case to 10fps now :p

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[03:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, we ain't popular on http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=3234

[03:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I like how that one guy puts CSS 3 as a success and CSS 2.1 as a failure

[03:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
I was more asonished that the original author had managed to get someone to publish a book they had written

[03:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
(the CSS3 guy has the cute belief that MS's motivation for Silverlight is mainly to create the best product it can technically)

[03:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm just surprised by how much effort they went to to make blogs.zdnet.com's comment (uh, TalkBack) system as hard to read as possible by putting every comment on a separate page

[03:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if I'm the only person who still associates the term "talkback" with that crash reporter tool that Netscape used to ship

[03:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
It wasn't just Netscape - Firefox used it pretty recently

[03:42:02.0000] <roc>
jgraham: certainly not!

[03:43:00.0000] <roc>
Yeah, Firefox 2 used it

[03:43:01.0000] <roc>
fortunately we got rid of it, with Google's help

[03:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
It is just amusing to have the commenting system named after something that recalls memories of browser crashes past...

[03:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I did also remember that Firefox used it but misguidedly thought that it wasn't too necessary to be accurate on IRC; obviously I should have known better)

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, that post doesn't have a lot of research behind it...

[03:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (I only commented on the Firefox association because you made it sound like an ancient forgotten tool from the prehistory of the web when people used Netscape, whereas actually it was current only six months ago)

[03:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
the post itself is just wrong (we're actually bang on schedule according to what i predicted back in 2006)

[03:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
but the blog comments are quite negative to html5 as a whole

[03:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what we should be doing about this

[03:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
if anything

[03:49:00.0000] <roc>
most of them just seem to want a clean-slate platform

[03:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
We should be amused by their misguided comments and assert our superiority here in IRC

[03:49:02.0000] <roc>
there's nothing really wrong with wanting a clean-slate platform, that's just not the Web

[03:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i was hoping for something that would work more effectively to convince them that html5 is the right thing to do :-)

[03:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
we probably need some sort of lightweight marketing to associate the name "html5" with something good

[03:50:02.0000] <annevk>
/me starts reading comments

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk>
we could call it BUBBLE programming, or some other weird term liking to Ajax, Comet, Clouds, etc.

[03:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
Are we suposed to backronym BUBBLE?

[03:52:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure it matters, people will prolly refer to it as Bubble anyway :)

[03:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Only two or three of the commenters seemed to really dislike HTML5

[03:53:01.0000] <annevk>
"The fail here lies with the browser developers who have misguidedly put their weight behind the red herring that is HTML5 instead of getting their **** together and implementing XHTML, XForms, and getting behind evolving the preexisting standards."

[03:54:00.0000] <olliej>
um

[03:54:01.0000] <olliej>
because xhtml is the future?

[03:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
but html5 _is_ evolving the preexisting standards...

[03:54:03.0000] <annevk>
"Why bother implementing something so completely worthless? The purpose of the HTML 5 working group isn't really to develop the next version of HTML, it's a case study on design by committee. Instead of Moore's law, why not talk about the HTML5 law: something about the inverse relation of the value of a product to the number of people who designed it."

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey at least that guy isn't complaining about me being a dictator

[03:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: And it is possible that paying too much attention to them is the fallacy whereby you mistake someone's percieved needs (what they say they want) for their actual needs

[03:55:02.0000] <roc>
the fact that these complaints are contradictory suggests things are somewhat on the right path

[03:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[03:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if there is a convenient name for asking what people want instead of observing their behaviour

[03:57:00.0000] <annevk>
then there is the longer comment from PB_z explaining a few things what's wrong with HTML5, but most of it seems not quite right

[03:57:01.0000] <webben>
jgraham: referendum?

[03:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
webben: heh

[03:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: seems pretty right to me (apart from the theory behind the motivations, though we might just be biased there)

[03:58:02.0000] <jgraham>
I guess "democracy" is close..

[03:58:03.0000] <annevk>
and then there's sobri who thinks XHTML is substantially better than HTML...

[03:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It has the X, of course it is

[03:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
That's why thy called the TV show the X-Factor afterall

[04:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if that reference works anywhere outside GB

[04:01:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, well, 1) "Backward-looking rather than forward-looking." I don't believe that's true; we're doing both; 2) " It's one monolithic spec." I indeed disagree with the motivation here; 3) He forgets to mention that Microsoft wasn't doing anything at all at the time

[04:01:01.0000] <webben>
jgraham: I think XFactor has crossed borders.

[04:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: By that reasoning, HTML5 should have been called Krypton-HTML

[04:01:03.0000] <webben>
jgraham: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I'm right about spellchecking, correct?

[04:02:01.0000] <annevk>
/me should maybe have asked that just before posting...

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[04:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
tristate checkboxes

[04:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me ponders whether to support them and how

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
btw i do think we should get more exposure in the media for html5, specifically the background reasoning, the timetable, and the features we've added

[04:17:01.0000] <annevk>
IE already has support for them, no?

[04:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
so that when we go to last call we have primed people to send comments

[04:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
IE has some weird support, yeah

[04:20:00.0000] <annevk>
you could write an article elaborating on those three things and then link it from the spec or some such

[04:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
"exposure in the media" probably involves things like press releases and emailing reporters, rather than just writing something and hoping people will find it

[04:22:01.0000] <annevk>
blogs would find it, at least

[04:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
we could also actually write an article for zdnet or some such

[04:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
Blogs that are outside of the existing HTML5 community?

[04:24:00.0000] <annevk>
our last news item was from 2006, nice

[04:24:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe http://www.whatwg.org/news/ should link to the blog

[04:25:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I'm assuming there's some kind of ripple effect

[04:25:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: well now we just have to implement it or we'll look silly for not being able to make up our minds :P

[04:25:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, that could work

[04:25:03.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, great :)

[04:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
updated whatwg.org/news

[04:36:00.0000] <annevk>
all of W3C seems to be taking a break, most mailing lists I track have their last message posted Dec 19 or so

[04:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
.indeterminate in IE is a weird attribute

[04:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand it

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk>
setting it to true puts the checkbox in the indeterminate state, quite simple, no?

[04:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
only if the checkbox is checked iirc

[04:51:02.0000] <annevk>
/me just tested it, the checked and indeterminate are orthogonal, with indeterminate winning

[04:52:00.0000] <annevk>
states are orthogonal...

[04:52:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[04:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
and what submits?

[04:57:00.0000] <annevk>
do you have some echo script somewhere?

[04:57:01.0000] <annevk>
/me is playing with the live dom viewer

[04:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
If you just submit to "" then it'll echo the query string

[04:58:00.0000] <annevk>
/me finds http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/cgi/test-tools/echo

[05:00:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, doens't affect submission

[05:00:01.0000] <annevk>
doesn't, even

[05:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's pretty useless then

[05:01:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought the main use case was some kind of UI used in tree views where submission is not important

[05:04:00.0000] <annevk>
Larry seems to be saying the same again... or I'm missing something

[05:05:00.0000] <annevk>
and not at all addressing points such as that the requirements for "web browsers" are not at all unique to them

[05:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
i considered just copy and pasting my last e-mail

[05:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
but that seemed rude

[05:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh he sent new mail

[05:17:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, i.e. three times the same message without addressing points raised

[05:35:00.0000] <billyjackass>
we clearly need to use the word "interoperability" interoperably

[05:36:00.0000] <annevk>
all of the W3C uses it to mean what Larry describes as "uniform"

[05:36:01.0000] <karlcow>
do we have an interoperable definition for it

[05:36:02.0000] <karlcow>
one which would permit that used separatly in texts written by different people would have the same meaning

[05:37:00.0000] <annevk>
e.g. http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/05/open-standards-interoperability.html or http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/#crec

[05:37:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe we need triples!

[05:37:02.0000] <annevk>
larrry:interoperable and w3c:interopable

[05:37:03.0000] <Philip`>
Define "interoperability" so that it MUST be interpreted as whatever each reader wants it to mean, and then the word will interoperable because it's got a conformance requirement

[05:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
s//be/

[05:38:01.0000] <karlcow>
/me remembers having written a mail about that in the past. 

[05:39:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, that might be hard to test

[05:39:01.0000] <karlcow>
http://www.w3.org/QA/glossary it is not defined here

[05:39:02.0000] <billyjackass>
I didn't realize we were all of us consistently using the word completely wrong all this time. Clearly we need to do some mass re-education on ourselves

[05:39:03.0000] <annevk>
just disambiguate yourself by using a colon ;)

[05:39:04.0000] <billyjackass>
and probably we need some Maoist-style struggle sessions to drill the re-think into ourselves collectively

[05:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Not at all - you just read the word, and if you think it means what you want it to mean then the test passes

[05:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: your complaint is ambiguous. Are you complaining about the attribute existing, or me not adding it to the spec?

[05:41:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: The attribute existing at all, and being supported at all

[05:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: the idea is to disable the feature when the input is known to be not spellcheckable, e.g. an address or some such

[05:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
or, say, a CAPTCHA

[05:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and the idea is to let the user override it to on anyway)

[05:42:03.0000] <karlcow>
ah no it was about conformance

[05:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me expects it will probably be abused anyway

[05:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Addresses are spell-checkable :P

[05:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
yours might be :-P

[05:43:02.0000] <karlcow>
but I came up with 

[05:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes code editors that spell-check comments and strings

[05:43:04.0000] <karlcow>
>The main goal of conformance and normative requirements is to ensure a minimum of interoperability (aka two products are able to work in the same technological space even if developed totally independently.)

[05:43:05.0000] <Philip`>
(and ignore the rest of the code)

[05:43:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Well, with a custom dictionary :P

[05:43:07.0000] <gsnedders>
(Heck, my surname isn't in most default dictionaries)

[05:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
the theory is that it's just a pain to see red underline every time one goes to google maps, i guess (or whatever site uses it)

[05:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me would rather not

[05:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I can never spell foreign city names

[05:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Having spell checking is a net-gain, IMO

[05:44:04.0000] <annevk>
it can also be used to implement your own spell checking and turn built in off, if you have your own custom language

[05:44:05.0000] <karlcow>
東京

[05:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Why would you do that?

[05:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[05:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Can't the spell checker just use whatever the language of the element is, and just have no spell-checking if the language is unknown

[05:45:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*?

[05:45:05.0000] <annevk>
ask Tolkien

[05:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think he used a web browser much while developing languages

[05:49:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, also, I could imagine a Web based spellchecker to be superior to the one offered by the browser because it can heuristic processing on some backend, sites might want to depend solely on such a service

[05:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I want my own damned spell-checker. If I want to use my spell-checker, let me.

[05:49:02.0000] <annevk>
as Hixie said, you can

[05:50:00.0000] <annevk>
that's part of the feature

[05:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But I have to manually re-enable it, no?

[05:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Which I think is stupid.

[05:50:03.0000] <annevk>
depends on your configuration

[05:51:00.0000] <jim_c>
Good morning all. For HTML5, is the correct content type(s) text/html, and application/xhtml+xml for the HTML and XHTML serializations, respectively?

[05:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also, I don't think it's entirely realistic to use spell-checking on a language where the entire known lexicon is only a few thousand words)

[05:52:01.0000] <annevk>
yup

[05:52:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: why not?

[05:52:03.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, programming languages then?

[05:53:00.0000] <annevk>
(the yup was in reply to jim_c)

[05:53:01.0000] <jim_c>
Thanks.

[05:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Because it means most words will be outside the known lexicon, and so spell-checkers will report far too many false positives

[05:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
meh.

[05:54:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, if you implement your own spellchecker it might take care of that though or allow you to add new words easily

[05:56:00.0000] <annevk>
anyway, it seems useful for sites to be able to go beyond what the browser offers by default; after all, there's vastly more developers out there than those part of the browser teams

[05:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Programming languages seem like basically the same case as e.g. blog comment forms where you can enter HTML markup, or forums where you use some custom markup language

[05:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
(since they're mixing some natural language and some special syntax)

[05:56:03.0000] <Philip`>
and in the latter cases you still want proper spell-checking

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I guess browsers ought to somehow cope with checking text that's mixed with a markup/programming language

[05:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TextMate does, IIRC.

[06:21:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, you changed your mind about submission?

[06:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i found that we already had interoperability

[06:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
lol, anne, you quoted text i wrote as a way to defend me

[06:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[06:24:00.0000] <annevk>
heh

[06:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
right, bed time

[09:40:00.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: maybe it is just a difference in philosophy over developping technical specifications more than words

[09:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Can I please be less good at procrastinating?

[09:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I just burst out laughing trying to say browsing context an absurd number of times in succession

[09:41:01.0000] <annevk>
karlcow, I suppose, I wonder why you'd persue such a distraction then...

[09:42:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, yeah, it's fun in a way :)

[09:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Now, I'm procrastinating again!

[09:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Damnit!

annevk: like in any social structures, strong advocates of one camp tend to think that their system is right. In fact it is rarely the case. Nobody is really wrong or right. They just chose different ways. :)  When I see such things, I try to not be fundamentalist on either sides. :)

hehe

[12:34:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
does anyone else think it's silly that boolean attributes don't accept true/false as values?

[12:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[12:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
but it's too late to change it now

[12:35:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
any idea why it's that way (or why it's too late to fix)?

[12:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
I would guess it's the way it currently is because HTML used to try to be SGML and tried to be concise, and SGML let you abbreviate attributes by skipping the attribute name, so <input disabled> would be equivalent to <input disabled=disabled> ...

[12:37:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
fair enough

[12:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
(which worked because only the 'disabled' attribute could have the value 'disabled', and so the SGML parser could guess the attribute name given the value)

[12:38:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
however required='true' should alias required='required'

[12:38:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
whereas required='false' should be the same as omitting required altogether

[12:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
and so the boolean states were <input disabled=disabled> and <input>, and implementations just looked for the presence/absence of the attribute and ignored its value

[12:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
and so <input disabled=false> got treated like <input disabled=disabled>

[12:40:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
do modern rendering engines actually treat disabled='false' as disabled='disabled' though?

[12:40:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
or is this old-school 'we think we're SGML' stuff

[12:41:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
-brb-

[12:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
They still do

[12:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
(They parse it into an attribute with value "false", but they process it as if it said "disabled")

[12:48:00.0000] <virtuelv>
implementors can't really change this either, given that the web has come to rely on such quirky behavior

[12:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
For the particular case of <input disabled="false">, I only find http://crafts.kaboose.com/holidays/chinese_new_year.html and that would actually work better if browsers did treat it as non-disabled

[12:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I would expect people do all sorts of crazy things with other attributes and would become very unhappy if the behaviour suddenly changed

[13:08:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i can't imagine there is any case where someone has disabled='false' when they mean disabled='disabled'

[13:09:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
implementors could check if the value == false before they interpret it as true

[13:09:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
it doesnt make any sense to have a boolean that doesn't accept true/false as attributes

[13:09:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
and considering most pages are built with dynamic languages where booleans are typed to true/false, it makes way more sense

[13:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But we're stuck and constrained by legacy content

[13:10:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
how is that constraining?

[13:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
doodlewarrior: Looking at real web pages reveals a lot of cases that one could never have imagined :-)

[13:11:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
Philip`: have you ever seen someone assign a value of false when they meant to have a value of true?

[13:11:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
the whole point of standards is to push the web forward

[13:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me would be surprised if there wasn't a website that relied on it

[13:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Sure, but we can't break existing websites.

[13:12:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
we shouldnt be shackled by previous nonsense

[13:12:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i dont imagine that would break many sites

[13:12:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Should we break 99% of the web because it is non-conforming?

[13:12:05.0000] <doodlewarrior>
youre not breaking 99% of the web

[13:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Why should we risk breaking anything making this change, though?

[13:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What do we gain by making the change?

[13:14:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
logical coherence for one

[13:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
There are far bigger things that aren't logical in HTML :)

[13:15:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
to call something a boolean and have it accept false as a value for true is asking for trouble

[13:15:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
(i only stumbled upon this because my HTML5 site stopped validating when i added attributes with true/false as values)

[13:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
To call something "SGML-like" and not say what it is is asking for trouble :)

[13:15:03.0000] <Philip`>
doodlewarrior: What about accepting "FALSE", or "0", or "no", or ""?

[13:16:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
Philip`: although i can see the case being made for those, the simple values of lowercase false and true are sufficient

[13:17:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
theres a difference between true and truthy

[13:17:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
true/false should definitely be supported

[13:17:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
truthy/falsy much less critical

[13:18:00.0000] <takkaria>
the rule at the moment is: if you have an attribute present, it is present, otherwise, it is not

[13:18:01.0000] <takkaria>
o

[13:18:02.0000] <takkaria>
your rule is just a different one that makes just as much sense

[13:19:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
im a usability guy, not an engineer

[13:19:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
so not-breaking the user's expectations is what i think about all day :)

[13:20:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
to someone who's designed in another major language, the a Boolean has a meaning

[13:20:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
which includes true/falseness

[13:20:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
to call something a boolean and have it behave differently is a major breakage of the designer's expectations

[13:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
doodlewarrior: Even if pages don't currently rely on disabled=false meaning disabled=disabled, there are scripts like http://code.google.com/p/qwin/source/browse/trunk/content/preferences.js?r=10#94 that rely on hasAttribute('disabled') telling you whether the element is disabled or not

[13:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, the user's expectation is set if they read that "if an attribute is present, then it is present, and if it is not, it is not, regardless of its value"

[13:21:01.0000] <takkaria>
it's just as boolean as what you propose, just in a different way

[13:22:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
Philip`: nice counterexample

[13:22:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i was thinking more about user agents than javascript

[13:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me failed to find examples of reliance on disabled=false in actual markup :-(

[13:23:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i figured standards-mode/html5 UAs could check for false before interpretting as true

[13:23:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
javascripts like you mention do raise a breakage-risk

[13:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
If we have to break people's expectations, it's best to do it immediately when they're writing their content (and the validator complains, or form controls are disabled when they shouldn't be, etc), rather than breaking the then-correct expectations that people had when writing scripts years ago

[13:25:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
im not sure thats correct, but i see your point

[13:26:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
there are plenty of designers who never bother validating

[13:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also there's the usual problem that if we defined new processing for disabled="false", users of old (i.e. current) web browsers will get exactly the opposite effect than the author intended, and the author may have only tested in futuristic browsers and would never be aware of the problem

[13:29:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
old browsers break a lot of things.  really, this is not a change that would probably happen for another generation for exactly the reason you mention

[13:29:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
but if bad behavior is never made obsolete, it will never go away

[13:29:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
hence why i brought it up

[13:29:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
at least now i know why it's there

[13:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
doodlewarrior: What bad behaviour that has been made obsolete in HTML has ever gone away?

[13:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hopefully it will go away when someone designs a new web language and learns from all the mistakes of HTML, but for now we're kind of stuck with what we've got

[13:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
doodlewarrior: the plaintext element was marked as obsolete from the first draft HTML standard, and still has to have special parsing rules in HTML 5 far-too-many-years later

[13:38:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, just replacing HTML is not quite going to cut it, I think

[13:39:00.0000] <annevk>
yay, RB returns

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
I might suggest an interjection other than "yay"

[13:50:01.0000] <takkaria>
more allegations of the parsing algorithm being severely broken :)

[13:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>

jgraham: that's a good start ;)

[16:18:00.0000] <yecril71>
disabled=yes is better than disabled=true,

[16:18:01.0000] <yecril71>
and just disabled is better than disabled=yes.

[16:18:02.0000] <yecril71>
disabled=disabled is a logical disaster.

[16:19:00.0000] <yecril71>
The problem with disabled=true is

[16:19:01.0000] <yecril71>
that it means "it is disabled"

[16:19:02.0000] <webben>
yecril71: Is this apropros of something?

[16:19:03.0000] <yecril71>
It is a propos of the syntax of boolean attributes.

[16:20:00.0000] <yecril71>
... whereas we really want to say "I want it disabled",

[16:20:01.0000] <webben>
yecril71: What change are you proprosing to the spec.

[16:20:02.0000] <webben>
*proposing

[16:20:03.0000] <yecril71>
It is not me, but the change proposed was that Boolean attributes

[16:21:00.0000] <yecril71>
should accept Boolean literals as values.

[16:21:01.0000] <webben>
yecril71: Change proposed where?

[16:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
webben: A few hours ago in this channel

[16:21:03.0000] <yecril71>
On IRC.

[16:21:04.0000] <webben>
oh okay

[16:21:05.0000] <webben>
disabled=disabled is normal for XML.

[16:21:06.0000] <webben>
disabled="disabled" rather

[16:22:00.0000] <yecril71>
and "I want it disabled" is better reflected by disabled=yes.

[16:22:01.0000] <yecril71>
disabled="yes" is also normal for XML.

[16:22:02.0000] <yecril71>
disabled="disabled" is a decision of XHTML, and it is a logical disaster.

[16:23:00.0000] <yecril71>
Because it means that the property of being disabled should be disabled.

[16:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems like simply a mapping of HTML4's boolean attribute syntax onto XML that will produce an equivalent DOM, rather than a real design decision of XHTML

[16:25:00.0000] <yecril71>
But the preferred syntax in HTML4 is just disabled.

[16:25:01.0000] <yecril71>
With no value.

[16:25:02.0000] <yecril71>
And SGML tells it means disabled="disabled".

[16:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
That syntax in HTML4 is just an abbreviation, and XML doesn't support that kind of abbreviation so it uses the equivalent unabbreviated form

[16:26:01.0000] <yecril71>
Anyway, it is very unfortunate.

[16:27:00.0000] <webben>
yecril71: Not quite. HTML4 doesn't prefer one or the other, but notes that many user agents don't recognize unmimimized boolean attributes. http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.3.4.2

[16:27:01.0000] <yecril71>
preferred in HTML4, not *by* it.

[16:28:00.0000] <webben>
ah I see.

[16:29:00.0000] <webben>
yecril71: The current spec says to use either disabled or disabled="disabled" for conformance: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#boolean-attribute

[16:30:00.0000] <webben>
or disabled="" I guess?

[16:30:01.0000] <yecril71>
Of course; this does not preclude my having an opinion on what is recommendable.

[16:30:02.0000] <webben>
yecril71: Absolutely. But it seems you are proposing a change to the current draft?

[16:31:00.0000] <yecril71>
Conditionally: If the proposal of disabled="false" would make it,

[16:31:01.0000] <webben>
yecril71: A potential hiccup is how do browsers treat disabled="no" or disabled="false"?

[16:31:02.0000] <yecril71>
I would prefer it to be disabled="yes".

[16:32:00.0000] <webben>
if they treat disabled="no" or disabled="false" the same as disabled="disabled", I'd say that makes disabled="yes" or disabled="true" even more confusing.

[16:32:01.0000] <yecril71>
Otherwise, it is all right with me, provided that XHTML agents do the right thing

[16:32:02.0000] <yecril71>
when they encounter disabled="yes".

[16:33:00.0000] <yecril71>
The proposition was to make disabled="false" an equivalent for not disabled.

[16:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
webben: Browsers ignore the attribute value entirely, and just care whether the attribute is present or not, as far as I'm aware

[16:34:00.0000] <webben>
I wonder whether any pages depend on disabled="false" or disabled="no" being treated as disabled="disabled".

[16:34:01.0000] <yecril71>
And the values "false" and "true" have a predicative modality, which is wrong because they are obviously intentional.

[16:34:02.0000] <webben>
Actually, I wonder the same for the other boolean attributes.

[16:34:03.0000] <yecril71>
Of course, disabled was just an example.

yecril71: disabled is the only case where the current spec makes things very confusing, isn't it?

[16:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
webben: A quick search didn't find any blatant examples of that, but there are pages doing things like in http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081230#l-917

[16:36:00.0000] <yecril71>
A cache manifest stored locally loses its content type header.

[16:36:01.0000] <webben>
Philip`: Interesting. _Perhaps_ one could define disabled="no" to be parsed as if the attribute was not there.

[16:37:00.0000] <webben>
and thus those scripts would still work as intended.

[16:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
webben: That might be possible but it would be insane :-p

[16:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
It would be particularly confusing when you setAttribute('disabled', 'no')

[16:39:01.0000] <webben>
hah, true.

[16:39:02.0000] <webben>
yecril71: Your proposed change doesn't sound viable.

[16:39:03.0000] <yecril71>
It would be better if manifest version were explicit in the magic line.

[16:40:00.0000] <yecril71>
It is not my proposition.

[16:40:01.0000] <yecril71>
s/my/MY/

[16:40:02.0000] <webben>
yecril71: Okay. I'm confused. Does the current draft do what you want?

[16:41:00.0000] <yecril71>
Yes, I only wanted to prevent disabled="false".

[16:41:01.0000] <webben>
Ah okay.

[16:42:00.0000] <webben>
Doesn't sound like disabled="false" is viable, then. :)

[16:45:00.0000] <yecril71>
How would browser vendors know what is plain text and what is encoded text?

[16:46:00.0000] <yecril71>
I would rather say that marking symbols in text as errors is acceptable.

[16:46:01.0000] <yecril71>
Or that text areas are subject to spell checking whereas simple controls are not.

[16:51:00.0000] <yecril71>
Safari in Polish wants to check everything everything as English, which is very annoying.

[17:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: lastweek seems to be getting political now

[23:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
"if everything is required to be the same, how can anyone invent something new?"

[23:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure where to even begin with that

[01:47:00.0000] <yecril71>
RDFa is not only about allowing the users to find relevant information.

[01:48:00.0000] <yecril71>
It is about hammering it onto the items so that it is hard to miss (particularly referring to licenses).

[01:48:01.0000] <yecril71>
And without modifying the resources themselves, unless they are in HTML.

[01:49:00.0000] <yecril71>
Which seems a particularly paradoxical requirement.

[01:57:00.0000] <yecril71>
First of all, Wikipedia seniors are extremely cross with semantics;

[01:57:01.0000] <yecril71>
they mostly want just the text, as simple as possible.

[01:58:00.0000] <yecril71>
They want to understand what the code is about at a glance.

[01:58:01.0000] <annevk>
Alex Russell now works for Google? Interesting...

[01:58:02.0000] <annevk>
/me didn't know

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
at the rate i've been replying to e-mails since october 2007, and the rate new e-mails have been arriving, i'll finish with dealing with e-mail feedback in october 2009, exactly on schedule

[02:30:00.0000] <annevk>
assuming an equivalent amount of new e-mail?

[02:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
right

[02:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
basically if you draw a line from the first point on the graph to the last point on the graph and follow that to zero e-mails, you hit october 2009.

[02:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
(if you do the same with the blue line, you end up with never hitting zero, but that's another story)

[02:46:00.0000] <takkaria>
lots of the current feedback seems to be blocked on other people, looking at the issues list

[03:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria: yeah

[04:00:00.0000] <gpy>
var happy = new Year("2009"); event.celebrate = function(event);

[04:07:00.0000] <olliej>
gpy: that's a syntax error

[04:07:01.0000] <olliej>
/me hides

[04:11:00.0000] <gpy>
olliej: yeah, cant do curlys at te moment ;D

[05:06:00.0000] <annevk>
is EH saying that following XML5 is allowed per XML 1.0 for text/xml byte streams?

[05:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: It would appear so, yes

[05:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(If that wasn't rhetorical)

[05:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"In order to support correction of errors, the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with intermingled character data and markup) available to the application."

[05:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's from fifth ed.

[05:22:00.0000] <annevk>
/me blinks

[05:23:00.0000] <annevk>
we could rename XML5 "XML Application 1.0" maha

[05:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:D

[05:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me decides to follow annevk and post a list of the cities he's been in this year

[05:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(albeit, a somewhat shorter list :))

[05:32:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, do you have numbers on start tags that should have a closing tag and also have a solidus?

[05:33:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, numbers on </br> in text/html would also be cool

[05:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://gsnedders.com/my-year-in-cities-2008

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I'm not sure what kind of numbers you mean

[05:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Integers, I expect

[05:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
...

[06:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Out of about 130K pages, I see 988 with at least one </br> (case-insensitive), and 95 with at least one <br></br>, and 909 with at least one </br> not preceded by a <br>

[06:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: Where should I run away to?

[06:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: This room is rather confining.

[06:34:01.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: loader bugs are scary and horrible, so anywhere the loader bugs aren't

[06:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me jumps into the unloader

[06:53:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, a statistic list of start tag with solidus occurances in your dataset

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Hmm, I can't think of an easy way of collecting that kind of data

[06:55:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I'm relatively certain we can't change this (we tried at some point), but it is prolly useful to have the data to convince Julian (though if he is the only one it might be a waste of time... meh)

[06:56:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, can you generate a file with links for the various </br> cases?

[06:56:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, (preferably HTML with <a>)

[07:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Like http://philip.html5.org/data/slash-br.html ?

[07:34:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, Julian hasn't really looked closely

[07:34:01.0000] <annevk>
not sure I should invest effort into the </br> stuff then

[08:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wow. That took around a minute to get around three hundred programs down to three.

[08:02:00.0000] <jcranmer>
good or bad?

[08:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It shows how badly personal finance programs on OS X are at being simple and being able to cope (at all!) with multiple currencies

[08:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Those were the only two criteria I used to eliminate around 300 programs.

[08:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me rules out another after around two minutes of trying it

[08:12:00.0000] <jwalden>
a winner?

[08:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Down to two

[08:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I have started hating the one I'm trying yet

[08:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.jumsoft.com/money/ — A program I can live with! :P

[08:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Money supports the account types you are most likely to need—Bank, Cash, Credit Card, Investment, and Loan. Create as many types as you need; try to use all the capabilities in Money!" - that last bit sounds like they're encouraging their users to get into as many forms of debt as possible

[08:43:00.0000] <jwalden>
meh, I think it's saying to use all the various types that you actually need, not to spread across multiple tracking systems

[09:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hahahaha

[09:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
New poll on lastweek

[09:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
which document will have the most impact on the world: "Hixies HTML5 specification" or "The bible"

[09:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Hixies HTML5 is kinda redundant, since the H is for Hixie

[10:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://pastebin.ca/1297237 — I am _so_ tempted to call that file ihatexml.php (with apologies to jgraham)

[11:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I hope that's not performance-critical code

[11:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Knowing PHP, that's probably the quickest way to do it

[11:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Also, do you want s/ifLetter/isLetter/?)

[11:03:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: (um, yeah)

[12:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finds issue with Unicode spec

[12:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
"these examples seem as easy to fix up as other parsing oddities like mis-nested tags (e.g., <b>foo<i>bar</b>baz</i>)" - I'm not sure the term "easy" is the best one to use

[12:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Perhaps "evil" or "insane" would be more appropriate

[13:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has not missed the start of the TV program he was going to watch on grounds he misremembered the time

[13:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wait, DOM can hold things that can't be serialized to XML!?

[13:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, it throws exceptions with all kinds of things, but it is still possible under DOM Level 3 Core + Load & Save modules to create something that isn't well-formed XML.

[13:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That, um, stupid

[13:34:00.0000] <jruderman>
that has been possible since forever. CDATA sections containing "]]>", empty text nodes, and adjacent text nodes, for example.

[13:35:00.0000] <jruderman>
that's why i serialize my pages as a series of createElementNS and appendChild calls

[14:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jruderman: It's still possible with that.

[14:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if using an SQLite database as a mutex is a bad idea

[15:09:00.0000] <heycam>
/me awakes happy knowing he didn't miss the leap second

[15:10:00.0000] <heycam>
/me awakens, perhaps

[15:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is kinda tempted to watch his computer clock over new year to see if it goes to :60

[15:15:00.0000] <heycam>
/me is more than just tempted!  although he doesn't have an actual new year's thing on at the leap second time, not being in UTC.

[15:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Write a program that does it for you ;)

[15:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: :P

[15:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me writes his objectives for the next three months

[15:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Catch up with email from the 19th century"

[15:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually a lot of it is splitting out sections -- websocket, uri, content sniffing

[15:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[15:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's for next year

[15:20:03.0000] <gsnedders>
You're that up to date?

[15:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[15:20:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, you've dealt with 18th cent. already?

[15:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
The main difficulty with responding to feedback from the 19th century is that you can't ask the original author for clarification

[15:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I smell a new hobby

[15:31:01.0000] <jwalden>
these seconds go to 60!

Writing feedback to specifications of the future

Thank you Microsoft for using disk volume labels like "\\?\Volume{110cf58b-d6f6-11dd-8afa-9ef3b601b1eb}\" and making my regexps incredibly ugly
