[17:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
Er, let's try that again

[17:03:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie, gsnedders: http://anolis.hoppipolla.co.uk/ 

[17:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
That domain name is not stable

[17:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
(i.e. I might change it later)

[18:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hi everyone

[18:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey

[18:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's good to be able to have internet again, anything interesting happen with the spec over the past week?

[18:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh crap, my whatwg and public-html folders are up to 800 unread emails :-(

[18:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[18:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: shoul i see something at http://anolis.hoppipolla.co.uk/ ?

[18:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://anolis.hoppipolla.co.uk/?url=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/source-whatwg seems very slow

[18:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm officially on holidays this week, so I should have time to catch up. The conference was quite good last week

[18:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
which conference?

[18:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
Web Directions South

[18:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[18:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
the one I came to Australia for

[18:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
right

[18:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
any interesting things happen there?

[18:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith's HTML5 presentation was quite good

[18:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk2, I recorded 2 more episodes for standards suck

[18:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll send them to marcos soon

[18:32:00.0000] <llimllib>
Am I correct reading the spec that there's no way to query a canvas for its transformation matrix?

[18:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[18:33:00.0000] <llimllib>
thanks, making sure before I go try and maintain that info myself

[18:40:00.0000] <llimllib>
I think it would be cool if HTML 5 had a texpath() method like nodebox's ( http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Reference_|_textpath() ), and I've implemented a Java applet that does text rendering and will let me play with hypothetical APIs for it ( http://github.com/llimllib/javatext ). Is this a thing that could hypothetically make the spec someday? Is there any interest in such a thing?

[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah there's a plan to eventually have path objects

[18:41:01.0000] <llimllib>
nice

[18:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
once we have that we'll be able to render text on path objects and convert the result to path objects, etc

[18:41:03.0000] <llimllib>
I implemented it because I've got half of a nodebox reimplementation in javascript, and I need textpath()

[18:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[18:42:01.0000] <takkaria>
I genuinely don't understand chaal's belief that if you want to extract SVG from HTML you might not need an HTML parser, or that the SVG WG's proposal would be better than the commented-out one for implementation...

[18:45:00.0000] <llimllib>
where should I go to find what's already been written about path objects?

[18:46:00.0000] <llimllib>
I'd like to catch myself up, if possible

[18:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
takkaria: his claim that Opera's core engine team thinks the SVG WG proposal is easier to implement kinda makes me want to get independent verification

[18:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not aware of anything that has been written, other than people saying the phrase "path objects" sound like a good idea

[18:48:00.0000] <llimllib>
fair enough

[18:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think text on a path is best added to CSS

[18:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you shouldn't be forced to make your text impossible to select, copy, or search just to make it flow along a path

[18:51:00.0000] <llimllib>
My interest is in things like this: http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/LetterKnitter ; at some point it's not necessarily valuable as selected text

[18:53:00.0000] <llimllib>
How do you select text that's not in rows anyway? How would you select text that followed a circular path around a block of text in the middle, but not the text in the middle? Is that the behavior you want?

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
llimllib: nothing is written about it yet as far as i know

[19:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
certainly on the whole we want to encourage text to be in css

[19:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
er

[19:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
html

[19:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
styled with css

[19:09:00.0000] <llimllib>
certainly

[19:13:00.0000] <llimllib>
currently, the ability to save a canvas creates a clean separation between text in canvas and text outside, AFAICS. Should there be text which is both styled with CSS and able to be saved with getImageData?

[19:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: sweet, your script seems the fastest

[19:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me sets up his script so it runs anne's, jgraham's, and bert's, and uses whichever one returns first

[19:38:00.0000] <takkaria>
redundancy ftw

[19:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham, gsnedders: looks like anolis does some bad things

[19:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
probably due to using libxml2's serialiser

[19:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
it sticks a lot of newlines in unexpected places

[19:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. before </code> and </a>

[19:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
or around <style>...</style> blocks

[19:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
it totally screws up idl blocks

[19:51:00.0000] <takkaria>
hmm, I should really work on hubbub sorted so we can make a release and anolis can use it

[19:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
that'd be awesome

[19:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham, gsnedders: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/anolis-generated-index

[19:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can't use that :-)

[20:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, a local camera store quoted me over $100 to repair a battery cover on my digital camera, but getting the part directly from the Kodak supplier and fixing it myself will only cost $5.50

[21:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
I'm not part of the 2001 Web

[21:45:00.0000] <gavin>
me neither :(

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html5 might develop into a feed worth following for tracking HTML5 questions outside the WGs

[02:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: wonder if it's worth adding it to Planet HTML5 now

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: insufficient data to tell yet. not much harm in trying, though

[02:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i have a (broken and not optimized at all) serializer for SDF in javascript

[02:38:01.0000] <zcorpan>
or maybe it was just a parser

[02:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk2: fixed, thanks

[02:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: wrting a SAX parser for SDF might indeed be the thing to try.

[02:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me still thinks SDF is unsuitable since it doesn't scale linearly

[02:41:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i'm sure it's possible to come up with a better format

[02:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
SDF was a quick hack for what i needed at the time

[02:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: btw, SDF doesn't have a default for the namespace on attribute nodes

[02:42:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: isn't it the empty string?

[02:42:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: ah. right

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I was merely comparing the definitions of e and a

[02:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
error handling isn't defined for sdf :(

[02:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
assuming the error handling i had in my parser it's not particularly extensible

[02:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(it just assumed it was correct and skipped past expected stuff without looking)

[02:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I just fixed a couple of things at anolis.hoppipolla.co.uk (it now displays a front page and doesn't excess whiespae in the source)

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries again

[02:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
It uses the html5lib serializer by the way

[02:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
So it's pretty easy to change the serialization code or options

[02:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: "Warning: Overriding document character encoding from utf-8 to UTF-8."

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
what happened to the spaces in the <head>?

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
and between the </dl> and the <p>?

[02:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: thanks

[02:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
also, any chance of it outputting entities instead of utf-8? the w3c has a bad habit of screwing up encoding declarations.

[02:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: isn't that something the W3C should fix

[02:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if the W3C can't get it right, the future with all the random joes out there looks bad

[02:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes but realistically i don't give that much of a chance and it's really not something i want to worry about

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: a lot of "unimportant" spaces get removed that make the source somewhat more messy, is that fixable?

[02:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Possibly. 

[02:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me needs to look at the serializer again

[02:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
might be libxml2's fault, i dunno

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's certainly much better than before

[02:58:01.0000] <erlehmann>
wtf does "Anolis ALPHABETA" do ?

[02:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
generates the spec

[02:59:01.0000] <erlehmann>
from what ?

[03:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
it generates http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/index from http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/source

[03:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Tell it to output ASCII, I think

[03:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: serializer.serialize(tokens, encoding='us-ascii') seems to make it do everything with entities

[03:01:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: so its essentially XSL ?

[03:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
in the same sense that C++ is essentially XSL, yes

[03:01:02.0000] <erlehmann>
hrhr

[03:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
or rather, that the C++ preprocessor is XSL

[03:17:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: the whatwg twitter account has some odd tweets at times

[03:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes, anyone can tweet on it at whatwg.org

[03:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: Well, you can blame me for <http://twitter.com/WHATWG/statuses/939592521>

[03:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: http://stuff.gsnedders.com/spec-gen/html5.whatwg.html — that has less excess whitespace than you

[03:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Should have fixed the UTF-8 thing now. Try adding &html5lib=true to the url; assuming I didn't screw up, that should both parse and serialize with html5lib (which is slower, obviously)

[03:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: "If you want to mention random topics of interest you should have a little more detail"

[03:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
making it even slower would fail at the only real need i had for this tool :-)

[03:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Like how interested?

[03:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: We should set up something that uses hsivonen's parser to parse it to XML first :P

[03:26:00.0000] <erlehmann>
http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a109/walrus0/obama2280473432_a0afd88685.jpg

[03:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Unfortunately you need to set up and run some long-running Java server process, otherwise it'll take much longer to launch the JVM than to do the actual parsing :-(

[03:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether we could use Jython

[03:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how much RAM you'd need for something like that

[03:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The point was to compare which errors are on the parser side and which on the serializer side :)

[03:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: ah :-)

[03:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You'd have to stop using the lxml API and start using whatever the relevant Java APIs are, I expect

[03:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries

[03:30:06.0000] <hsivonen>
/me guesses between 16 to 64 MB

[03:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No, I could parse it from HTML -> XML -> lxml

[03:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Should I just drop the examples in parenthesis in the second para.?

[03:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Do you mean how much detail?

[03:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: yeah

[03:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: And now I'm asking about the very existence of the other examples

[03:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Ah, okay, but you still can't use lxml in Jython since it's a C module

[03:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Ah.

[03:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
I think the examples in parens are somewhat better than the sentence "Recent things that have interested me are [...]"

[03:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
so you might as well have a separate external process that does HTML-string -> XML-string and then parse that with lxml in CPython

[03:33:04.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah

[03:33:05.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I'm just going to stab you :P

[03:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's not a bad idea to sounds up to date but they kinds of sound like "I just read some stuff recently for my UCAS form"

[03:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Ah, that doesn't sound too bad - what kind of software do people use if they just want to run a simple Java service where they can send it a string and get a string back?

[03:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: That won't help your application at all. Unless, I suppose, you find a way to stab me over the internet, in which case it will be such a major breakthrough that ou mght get into the OU from your prison cell

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: took about 4 times as long, but yeah, it fixed the problem

[03:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I wonder how much Pysco would help

[03:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Can I just concur with Philip` and my teacher in what it's fine?

[03:36:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: It helps quite a bit bu only on 32bit python

[03:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Actually, I need to add in TUSLIP.

[03:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ERGH>

[03:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*ERGH.

[03:37:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: You can do whatever you like, it's your application :)

[03:37:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I think Psyco gave something like 25-50% improvement in parsing stuff, with an old version of html5lib

[03:37:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: Jetty with your own main() method if you want HTTP

[03:37:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: And the rest of Anolis? :P

[03:37:07.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: or a simple loop doing accept() on ServerSocket if you don't want HTTP

[03:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I don't think I actually said it was fine; I just couldn't easily think of any worthwhile improvements to suggest :-)

[03:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: :P

[03:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That depends entirely on where your bottlenecks are

[03:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: TOC building is expensive (building it in memory from the entire tree, actually making a ol/li list is cheap)

[03:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: if the spec can be trusted not to have non-streamable errors, you could run the parser in the streaming mode and use up less RAM

[03:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: xref is very expensive

[03:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. I assume Psyco helps a lot with long arithmetic functions, but it doesn't help at all if you're spending all your time in C libraries

[03:39:04.0000] <Philip`>
or if you're spending all your time doing string manipulation and dict lookups

[03:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Should I just omit the backflipping car?

[03:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: The car thing might be good if it is really something that has motivated you to study physics

[03:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
But if it is you need to say that explicitly and expand it a but

[03:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
bit

[03:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me gives up on sending it off today

[03:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>
If I include the TUSLIP day, then I'll end up with it too long

[03:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Try removing generic sentences like "There are almost endless questions that can be asked about how and why systems behave as they do.". Hopefully the peorson reading your personal statement already realises that :)

[03:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
That also applies to things like "Two useful skills that physics teaches are..."

[03:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
You should say something about you e.g. "Two skills that I have developed through studyinging physics are..."

[03:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
Because the person reading the form already knows what physics is supposed to teach but they want to know what you have got out of it

[04:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
I enabled psyco on anolis.h.c.u I don't know if it's making a significant difference or not

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
no noticeable difference

[04:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
takes 8 seconds

[04:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is fine

[04:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
for now :-)

[04:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
so... anyone see anything wrong with http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/ ?

[04:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: looks like the multipage script works ok with the new ids?

[04:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders, jgraham: i'm still getting validation errors on the w3c verson of the doc: http://html5.validator.nu/?=&doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatwg.org%2Fspecs%2Fweb-apps%2Fcurrent-work%2F.w3c%2FOverview.html

[04:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
something weird happens to the table in the source

[04:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
the whole table vanishes

[04:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
ohhhh

[04:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
i bet i know what it is

[04:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i bet the newlines are being stripped

[04:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
and so the sed script is nuking the whole table

[04:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok now the only problem is that the serialisation adds an unnecessary <meta charset>

[04:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i can strip that with my postprocess step

[05:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It doesn't work okay, in the sense that it doesn't split things into sensible-sized chunks

[05:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
though it does still split things into chunks

[05:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I'll just need to upload the new version which has a new list of split ids

[05:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
which is hopefully trivial

[05:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/ is the new version

[05:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'm ready to flip the switch and check it in

[05:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
just give the word

[05:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmph, you've done too much work and now the sections are unevenly sized again

[05:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[05:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Did anyone conclude whether the lxml parser/serialiser has problems, that would mean I couldn't use them in the spec-splitter?

[05:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
the serialiser has issues iirc

[05:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
though i forget what

[05:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
the parser is already used by anolis so whatever problems it introduces are already payed for

[05:13:02.0000] <annevk2>
looks ok to me, though we need to fix some Anolis bugs too in due course

[05:14:00.0000] <annevk2>
but I thought the service from jgraham was not stable?

[05:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmm, better sizes now - the largest is 261KB for the forms section)

[05:14:02.0000] <Hixie>

[05:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me will stick with the html5lib serialiser, just to be safe

[05:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: seems wise

[05:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
and time is not an issue with the multipage script

[05:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: well, i have my system set up so it will fire up every anolis instance i know if (james' and yours so far) and use whichever one gets back soonest

[05:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
i know of, even

[05:17:04.0000] <annevk2>
ok

[05:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
But it slows down my server and steals CPU time away from its more important processes such as, er, irssi and not much else

[05:18:01.0000] <annevk2>
how was the issue serialization issue fixed?

[05:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: :-)

[05:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
issue serialization?

[05:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Updated the spec-splitter service now

[05:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Wait, no I haven't

[05:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Now I think I have

[05:22:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, with the validation errors

[05:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
(It should be faster since it still parses with lxml)

[05:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: oh

[05:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: not sure

[05:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk2: I switched to using html5lib for serialization

[05:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
I see

[05:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://hg.jgraham.webfactional.com/aquarium/ is the front end code I currently have

[05:41:00.0000] <annevk2>
sys.stdout.write versus print?

[06:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: shouldn't the content sniffing: unknown type allow whitespace before "<!DOCTYPE HTML"?

[06:30:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, the URL http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Reference_|_textpath() here: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081001#l-75

[06:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Opera's IRC doesn't include the ) but there is a ( just before it in the URL

[06:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/stdout.txt looks much prettier in Opera than in Firefox

[06:39:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Can I assume that 2007-06-07 is going to be a valid date string?

[06:39:01.0000] <annevk2>
I'd say yes

[06:40:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Ok, going to take the liberty of using it, then

[08:12:00.0000] <krijnh>
BenMillard: fixed :)

[08:32:00.0000] <virtuelv>
any proposals on how to represent all of these in HTML: http://people.brandeis.edu/~rind/bentley/symbols33.gif

[08:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the first three are probably <ins>/<del>

[08:34:01.0000] <virtuelv>
zcorpan: note that these are explicit corrections

[08:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah ... maybe <ins>/<del> isnt' appropriate for that

[08:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: HTML simply doesn't have precise native semantics for all those

[08:35:02.0000] <virtuelv>
question is, should it?

[08:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: I doesn't seem to me at least that the core HTML language needs markup for copy-editing markup

[08:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: in my opinion, no

[08:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: what hsivonen said

[08:36:03.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: because HTML is a general language and not specific to that particular domain

[08:36:04.0000] <virtuelv>
kids are being asked to turn in assignments electronically already

[08:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
could use <ins> with a class

[08:37:01.0000] <virtuelv>
before long, those assignments will be html, handled by a textarea on steroids

[08:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
most people have no need for that granularity of copy-editing markup nor any idea wtf those marks mean 

[08:38:00.0000] <virtuelv>
some are simply irrelevant, though, like 'stet'

[08:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[08:38:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess you'd want <mark>

[08:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: can't the teacher send back and edited file and the kid runs an html diff program on it?

[08:38:04.0000] <zcorpan>
with title or something

[08:39:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: or the tool could provide the diff

[08:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
the teacher sends a patch

[08:39:02.0000] <virtuelv>
can haz annotated patch

[08:40:00.0000] <virtuelv>
(it's just an open question, though, it just made me wonder)

[08:40:01.0000] <virtuelv>
4 and 5 has a tendency to throw off diffs, btw

[08:40:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[08:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders what's wrong with the sentence "His head was wrapped in a turbine." .. likes that sentence just the way it is

[08:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me makes his spec more readable by introducing the term "context node"

[08:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dglazkov: hei

[08:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe it doesn't need to be an explicit xref? what do you think? (http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core#dom-document-createelement and onwards)

[08:51:00.0000] <dglazkov>
MikeSmith!

[08:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dglazkov: please get to work on making it possible for me to build and use Chrome on Linux

[08:53:00.0000] <dglazkov>
MikeSmith: yessir!

[08:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[09:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
make -f client.mk build

[09:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
doh

[10:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
does anybody know who http://www.reddit.com/user/gst actually is?

[10:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: ↑

[10:05:01.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: no clue

[10:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think he's a script

[10:06:01.0000] <virtuelv>
based on his posting frequency, I suspect he's a bot

[10:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[10:06:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: coke jinx

[10:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me encounters the "cat herder" metaphor for the 3000th millionth time

[10:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
with apologies, I think what some work needs is more people with cat-drowning skills

[10:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me googles "cat drowner"

[10:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
01:11 where /me is, btw

[10:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so forgive me if I offend

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
I just want Chrome on Linux so that I can use http://ajeanius.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/first-release/

[10:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, that's a bad link since it doesn't give any indication what it is

[10:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://ajeanius.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/awesomium-google-chrome-hacked/

[10:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
The copy-editing issue has an easy solution: the teacher should just print all the electronic submissions, and mark them up with a red biro

[10:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"he API that Google put together is really quite kick-ass– it’s got support for injection of mouse/keyboard events, Javascript evaluation, invalidation callbacks, navigation callbacks, and best of all, it lets us do off-screen, selective rendering"

[10:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as the marking-up thing, based on my previous lives as both a schoolteacher (no joke) and textbook editor, marking up student/writers texts with red/baker-miller-red/soothing-blue copy-editing marks all the hell all over the place is not a terrifically efficient motivator at getting them to learn how to actually write

[10:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the better way is to sit down one-on-one and go through and have them mark up the changes themselves

[10:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
in whatever color they prefer

[10:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is, verbally pointing out where the problems are

[10:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
sort of the "teach a man to fish" approach

[10:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and they can use whatever arbitrary copy-editing markup format they want, in that case

[10:57:03.0000] <erlehmann_>
    MIRRORS ARE MORE FUN THAN TELEVISION

[11:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

thanks

[12:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: What service is adding in meta@charset?

[12:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It should be an html5lib option, and should be off by default

[12:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Why is inject_meta_charset defaulting to True in html5lib?

[12:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham? Philip`?

[12:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I didn't write that code but I guess it was decided that it is safer

[12:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think it should be False by default

[12:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Can you set it off?

[12:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Me too.

[12:19:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(at least for Anolis)

[12:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(the API doesn't actually change html5lib options from the default)

[12:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
Er, I guess I should check on the mailing list before changing the default but sure, I'll change it for anolis

[12:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: If you're running an up-to-date (from hg) copy of Anolis, you have no need for indent_char

[12:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is Hixie using it with html5lib parsing?

[12:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: No

[12:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Try that

[12:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: "that"? How?

[12:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: What were you complaining about?

[12:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Huh?

[12:26:02.0000] <jgraham>
I changed anolis.hoppipolla.co.uk to serialize without the inject_meta_charset option and to not use indent_char

[12:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, OK

[12:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that works fine

[12:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
inject_meta_charset is a bit slow too

[12:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Is there a version of the source with the WG-specific headers but without the postprocessed stuff somewhere?

[12:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/source-w3c?

[12:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
interestingly I'm seeing next to no difference with &html5lib and without

[12:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Is the output different? Otherwise it suggests a bug :)

[12:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
(psyco might have helped html5lib a lot)

[12:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Both are identical

[12:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: They are different for me

[12:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
You need &html5lib=something e.g. &html5lib=true

[12:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tries

[12:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I'm getting different stuff now

[12:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[14:01:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, ping

[14:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: ping

[14:17:00.0000] <annevk2>
yo

[14:17:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me is sort of available

[14:17:02.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, gsnedders, yo/pong

[14:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: you made mention to Anolis bugs that will need to be fixed. What bugs?

[14:18:01.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fannevankesteren.nl%2F2008%2Fajaxexperience seems wrong

[14:18:02.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, it was the serializer issues

[14:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: ah. That's lxml/html5lib bugs! :P

[14:19:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, what is the purpose of the "url return flag"?

[14:19:02.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, redirects?

[14:20:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, seems like a hook for the XHR2 spec, but I don't even get how it's used there

[14:20:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, ?

[14:20:02.0000] <annevk2>
you do a request from A to B

[14:20:03.0000] <annevk2>
B redirects to A

[14:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
in that case the status return flag will be "same-origin" and the "url return flag" the specific URL

[14:21:01.0000] <sicking>
why not just say "follow the redirect"?

[14:21:02.0000] <annevk2>
because the policy is different

[14:21:03.0000] <annevk2>
XHR2 starts using the same origin request policy at that point

[14:22:00.0000] <sicking>
so first off, i'm not sure that that is safe

[14:22:01.0000] <annevk2>
we discussed this model ages ago

[14:22:02.0000] <annevk2>
and you agreed to it

[14:22:03.0000] <annevk2>
:)

[14:22:04.0000] <sicking>
really?

[14:22:05.0000] <sicking>
i doubt that

[14:22:06.0000] <annevk2>
yes

[14:22:07.0000] <sicking>
i remember this was discussed, but i don't remember a resolution

[14:23:00.0000] <sicking>
it seems scary that if good.com loads what it thinks is a resource from evil.com, it might actually end up getting a private resource from good.com that was loaded with credentials

[14:24:00.0000] <sicking>
if good.com publishes that resource anywhere effectively evil.com can read private data from good.com

[14:24:01.0000] <annevk2>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2007Aug/0036.html

[14:25:00.0000] <sicking>
well, that was just crazy :)

[14:25:01.0000] <sicking>
s/that/I/

[14:25:02.0000] <annevk2>
fair enough :p

[14:26:00.0000] <sicking>
meaning you'll change it?

[14:27:00.0000] <annevk2>
to what?

[14:27:01.0000] <annevk2>
are you suggesting dropping that entire thing and simply always require the check?

[14:27:02.0000] <sicking>
yes

[14:27:03.0000] <sicking>
well, once you've been cross-site

[14:28:00.0000] <annevk2>
that'd make things simpler :)

[14:28:01.0000] <sicking>
not for requests that are strictly same-site

[14:28:02.0000] <annevk2>
basically dropping a bunch of text

[14:28:03.0000] <annevk2>
well, same-site has a different "spec path" anyway

[14:28:04.0000] <annevk2>
i need an e-mail though 

[14:28:05.0000] <annevk2>
so everyone knows

[14:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
and i can point it out to you in a few years and you can say "well, I was just crazy" again :)

[14:29:01.0000] <sicking>
yeah, i think this needs to be discussed. Things do seem somewhat non-ideal no matter what

[14:44:00.0000] <erlehmann_>

It seems they lacked sufficient foresight :-(

 "Accessing attributes as properties is discouraged and considered becoming obsolete"

[15:45:03.0000] <Dashiva>
what?

[15:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
why would the string comparison ever fail?

[16:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Must. Stop. Procrastinating.

[16:38:00.0000] <jcranmer>
gsnedders: meh, do it tomorrow ;-)

[16:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: Need to do this. Today.

[16:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Then stop talking about it on IRC


2008-10-02
[18:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
so.......

[18:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you have an <input> element

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
type=text

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
and you type in some text

[18:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
and then the script changes it to type=checkbox

[18:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
and you submit

[18:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
what value should be submitted?

[18:16:05.0000] <Hixie>
opera and mozilla say "on", safari says whatever you typed, IE says you can't change the type.

[18:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: off.

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
what.

[18:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
the hell.

[18:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
setting .value when type=checkbox causes the value attribute to change?!?!?!

[18:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
heh.

[18:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You obviously forgot to leave your sense of logic at the door.

[18:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: What's happening about Anolis, BTW?

[18:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's live

[18:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: But not committed.

[18:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
and committeed

[18:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
committed

[18:23:04.0000] <gsnedders>
It is?

[18:23:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I haven't seen that.

[18:23:06.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[18:23:07.0000] <Hixie>
i checked it in last night

[18:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
r2256

[18:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
no email on the list

[18:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(like the commit watchers list)

[18:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
probably was too long and hit the limit

[18:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Heh.

[18:25:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Like, almost every line changed, I expect.

[18:25:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Now, what need I do to get a special thanks (:)?

[18:25:05.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[18:25:06.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[18:25:07.0000] <gsnedders>
(I mean, why do you think I did this anyway)

[18:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
bert didn't get special thanks either :-)

[18:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
multi-file Anolis?

[18:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[18:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[18:26:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, but most of what you did about that was complain about its speed :P

[18:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/ — the TOC list has the ol numbers :(

[18:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Should I send a email to the list saying IDs are completely different now?

[18:37:00.0000] <aboodman>
Hixie: I don't see the craziness in the value attribute changing when the value property is changed

[18:37:01.0000] <aboodman>
am I missing something?

[18:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
aboodman: the value attribute doesn't change when the value property is changed for any other type value

aboodman: normally the value content attribute maps to the defaultValue DOM attribute

[18:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
man this really screws things up

[18:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
wtf

[18:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, at least this is scoped to the input element

[18:47:00.0000] <aboodman>
out of curiosity, are most attributes in html5 defined to reflect or not reflect

[18:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
most reflect

[18:48:00.0000] <aboodman>
yipp33

[18:48:01.0000] <aboodman>
argh

[18:48:02.0000] <aboodman>
i really must learn to type at some point.

[18:48:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Type? Why do that?

[19:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me changes topic to 'WHATWG (HTML5) -- http://www.whatwg.org/ -- Logs: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/ -- Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks! -- gsnedders had green hair, photos coming soon :-)'

[19:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the weird situation with .value, .defaultValue and value="" is kind of weird and pretty suboptimal

[19:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and now standardised.

[20:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, http://blog.whatwg.org/demos-2008-sept#comment-27669

[23:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
what does a radio button represent?

[23:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one of several mutually exclusive choices

[23:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
what if there aren't any others?

[23:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what does an <li> represent if there aren't any others?

[23:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what is the sound of one hand clapping?

[23:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: a list item

[23:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
then you could say a radio button represents a readio button

[23:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because in fact what it represents is a particular UI control

[23:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and the semantic of how such controls are used is dictated by convention

[23:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough

[01:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
well radio buttons turned out to be more of a pain than i expected

[01:36:00.0000] <jruderman_>
radio groups represent mutually exclusive choices, but so do <select size=1> and <select size=10>, and all three have different UI (by convention)

[01:37:00.0000] <jruderman_>
it annoys me when i get paper forms that say "check one" and have empty squares instead of empty circles

[01:37:01.0000] <jruderman_>
seems so wrong

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, only file, hidden, submit, image, reset, and button to do now.

[01:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.w3.org/2008/10/TPAC/TPDay-Agenda

[01:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if Hixie has been already invited as a panelist

[01:50:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hmph

[01:50:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Google is a harsh mistress

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: for which panel?

[01:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
this year it's no longer html5 vs. xhtml2. now it's html vs. xml

[01:51:02.0000] <virtuelv>
(completely off-topic, of course)

[01:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: hm?

[01:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
there's a topic here?

[01:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks at gsnedders :-P

[01:52:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: yeah, when Dreamhost was mass-compromised last year, my account were among the unfortunate 3500

[01:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Architecture and html&xml

[01:53:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I had one page left that I didn't actually notice when I cleaned up all of the injected spam, and for that, I'm now invisible in Google for the next couple of weeks

[01:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
aah

[01:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: session 2?

[01:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
or 7?

[01:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
someone should stand by the mic during the TP and pipe up briefly every time someone says something not true

[01:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. "The HTML5 work on the other hand uses a centralised extensibility mechanism based on formalized tagsoup parsing." "Actually that's not an accurate description."

[01:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually reading that abstract more carefully i don't even know what it means

[01:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
sounds like something palin might say

[02:08:00.0000] <heycam>
http://www.theage.com.au/photogallery/2008/10/02/1222651246843.html -- hmm, is that IE being used in the A380's cockpit?

[02:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I was wondering about your participation in both 2 and 7

[02:08:02.0000] <heycam>
regardless, it looks like a terrible interface for presenting that information (with the scrolling)

[02:12:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: this? http://images.theage.com.au/ftage/ffximage/2008/10/02/qantas__16__gallery__539x400.jpg

[02:12:01.0000] <heycam>
virtuelv, yeah

[02:13:00.0000] <virtuelv>
heycam: how can you tell?

[02:13:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I can clearly see it's windows, but IE?

[02:13:02.0000] <virtuelv>
the table?

[02:13:03.0000] <heycam>
yeah the table is what made me think that

[02:15:00.0000] <virtuelv>
looks like

[02:15:01.0000] <heycam>
windows in the cockpit is probably enough to make me worry though :)

[02:16:00.0000] <heycam>
i noticed linux booting up on a plane's entertainment system recently

[02:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
seems like a very bad idea to put Windows in the cockpit

[02:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd want a small well debugged real time OS in the cockpit

[02:17:00.0000] <heycam>
i assume that windows thing is isolated from any flight controlling systems, but still...

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Sun had the "high risk activities" clause in the non-GPL JDK licenses forever even though JDK on Solaris is probably more stable than IE on Windows

[02:20:01.0000] <virtuelv>
heycam: I'd assume so

[02:21:00.0000] <virtuelv>
but you're still pretty screwed for the 30 seconds it takes rebooting

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
why doesn't http://www.p01.org/releases/Demoscene/files/pNebula_canvas_256b_valid.htm work in Firefox/Minefield?

[02:23:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: I guess mathieu optimized away a few bytes too many

[02:23:01.0000] <virtuelv>
it worked a couple of days ago

[02:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: this is why: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0D%0A%3Ccanvas%20id%3DR%3E%3C%2Fcanvas%3E%3Cscript%3Ew(R)%3C%2Fscript%3E

[02:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: that's unintuitive

[02:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: but it works in ie/opera/webkit

[02:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh actually

[02:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3Ccanvas%20id%3DR%3E%3C%2Fcanvas%3Ex%3Cscript%3Ew(R)%3C%2Fscript%3E

[02:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i forgot about the more-script-to-head bug

[02:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh firefox only does that in quirks mode

[02:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I meant the Gecko tree building behavior is unintuitive

[02:41:02.0000] <zcorpan>
defining R in the global scope from id that is

[02:41:03.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: yeah, but that wasn't why the demo wasn't working

[02:41:04.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[02:41:05.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: the demo should work if you remove the doctype

[02:41:06.0000] <hsivonen>
now I see what you meant

[02:53:00.0000] <virtuelv>
zcorpan: just asked p01, and he indicated it chokes on something in the script

[02:53:01.0000] <virtuelv>
<p01> ff3.0.3 chokes on "R", pbly expecting "document.R"

[02:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
virtuelv: yes it doesn't do <elm id=foo> -> window.foo in standards mode

[02:54:01.0000] <zcorpan>
virtuelv: only in quirks mode

[02:54:02.0000] <zcorpan>
while other browsers do it in both

[02:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think he needs R=document.body.lastChild

[02:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and then he can drop id=R

[03:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
He could save another 6 bytes just by dropping the quotes around onload, I think

[03:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, = is not allowed in unquoted attributes? How annoying :-(

[03:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me has started using the convention of omitting quotes around attribute values for attributes that take keywords or numbers, and having them for everything else

[03:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
(strings, urls, script, css, etc)

[03:10:00.0000] <virtuelv>
zcorpan: his goal is to stay under 256 bytes *and* be in standards mode

[03:10:01.0000] <virtuelv>
if he drops being in standards mode, he can chop it down to 220+something, I think

[03:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
*and* be conforming?

[03:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Are you trying to say I often take us off-topic?

[03:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[03:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i'm going to change how type=file handles min/max

[03:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: If you are, I guess I can't really deny it.

[03:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: no comment :-P

[03:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I mean, you looked at me when talking about going off-topic :P

[03:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm anolis cuts off web-dom-core after the comment "<!-- TypeInfo dropped -->"

[03:44:01.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder what's up with that

[03:45:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: no

[03:46:00.0000] <virtuelv>
but we managed to chop off a version that runs in all browser, is valid and conforming to 248 bytes

[03:46:01.0000] <virtuelv>
fun way to spend half of your lunch

[04:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
can i make Node.prefix readonly?

[04:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
webkit and firefox don't check against Name or NCName (or anything) and opera doesn't do anything on setting

[04:47:01.0000] <zcorpan>
so you can end up with spaces in tags in webkit and firefox by setting .prefix = '1 2'

[04:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
though maybe the serializer would change prefixes again

[04:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
nope at least innerHTML in firefox doesn't

[04:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
data:text/xml,<html xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><script>var e = document.createElementNS('a','b');e.prefix = '1>2';document.documentElement.appendChild(e); alert(document.documentElement.innerHTML)</script></html>

[04:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
same with webkit

[04:51:02.0000] <zcorpan>
/me makes it readonly

[05:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me mumbles something about isSameNode being useless

[05:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is it just an == check for languages that don't support == or that let tearoff implementation details leak instead of overloading ==?

[05:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i'm not sure why it was added to dom3

[05:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
but it's the same as ==

[05:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
considering that it's bogus for *Web* DOM, i'll drop it and see if someone complains

[05:41:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm there's also isEqualNode

[05:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: well, back when distinguishing "" vs. null was considered, someone said that Delphi can't distinguish those...

[05:44:01.0000] <zcorpan>
that's unfortunate

[05:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yes, but as a reason for Web API design completely pointless

[05:45:01.0000] <zcorpan>
indeed

[05:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so, I expect you to get complaints :-(

[05:46:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder if isEqualNode is useful for something

[06:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, how about linking data: urls? From http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081002#l-282: data:text/xml,<html xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><script>var e = document.createElementNS('a','b');e.prefix = '1>2';document.documentElement.appendChild(e); alert(document.documentElement.innerHTML)</script></html>

[06:10:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, also irc: URLs like those at and just after http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20080226#l-321.

[06:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: If you don't escape spaces/etc in data URLs, how is any algorithm meant to work out where they end?

[06:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I guess they normally end at the end of the line in this channel?

[06:12:01.0000] <BenMillard>
or at </html> or something

[06:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
interestingly, Opera's IRC includes the : at the end of #l-282: in the link but doesn't include the . at the end of #l-321.

[06:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>

[06:32:01.0000] <annevk2>
:)

[06:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, fwiw, the tactic with "Web DOM" is that it's just for the Web browser environment and that we don't seek to obsolete other DOM specifications in any way

[06:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[06:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
that said, it might not mitigate getting people upset as browsers would no longer follow the DOM ... series of specifications

[07:06:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, btw, did you seem my semi bug report yesterday?

[07:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081001#l-626

[08:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: thanks. now recorded: http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=317

[08:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
the other bug was that the empty string is a valid contenteditable value

[08:12:01.0000] <annevk2>
iirc

[08:12:02.0000] <annevk2>
but i'll check that now in the spec

[08:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
yup: "The contenteditable attribute is an enumerated attribute whose keywords are the empty string, true, and false."

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Opera really doesn't work well when I run out of disk space

[08:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is glad he has reasonably-recent backups of all the .ini files

[09:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan, "The hasChildNodes() method must return false if the context node's firstChild is null, and true otherwise." what if I have a custom firstChild?

[09:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan, for textContent you have getting and setting reversed

[09:45:00.0000] <annevk2>
(re http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core for those reading the logs)

[10:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I just can't find a good line through the double S bend

[10:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: OK, I basically consistently do around 1:10.8

[10:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, yeah that S-bend is touch

[10:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
you have to favour the 2nd part...go deep into the first part so you are on the right-hand as you start the 2nd half

[10:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gnsedders, I'm helping my dad put pictures onto eBay now, chat later :)

make sure you add alt text to all of them

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how one should handle fatal errors in a streaming HTTP processor

[10:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
i.e. where you start sending the response before you've done all the processing (hence before you've detected all possible errors)

[10:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and maybe before you've even received the whole request)

[12:18:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me wonders when Bugzilla will gain OpenID support

[12:18:01.0000] <annevk2>
(and hopefully support for linking the OpenID to an existing account)

[12:40:00.0000] <virtuelv>
/me wants something better than OpenID

[12:40:01.0000] <virtuelv>
don't misunderstand me, openid is great within the current constraints

[12:40:02.0000] <virtuelv>
I'd just want browsers to act like ssh

[12:50:00.0000] <annevk2>
how would that work well if you use 10 different browsers on 10 different platforms?

[12:57:00.0000] <virtuelv>
that is an open question

[12:57:01.0000] <virtuelv>
your question is one of key distribution

[12:58:00.0000] <virtuelv>
more specifically, private key distribution

[13:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
ssh works without any private key distribution

[13:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Only if you always SSH from the same place

[13:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
or use lots of independent pairs of keys

[13:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
or just use passwords instead

[13:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how many people have their SSH private keys written on a Post-it note stuck on their monitor

[13:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
you're supposed to use independent keys

[13:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
it lets you knock one client out if it is compromised, without having to change the rest of your config

[13:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
But if one private key is compromised, the attacker can log in to all the other machines you have access to, which probably contain all your other 'independent' private keys, so the whole network of keys is compromised

[13:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
compromised was the wrong word

[13:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean like if you sell your hard disk

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you are compromised then yes, you have to nuke everything

[13:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems much easier to remove the private key from that disk before you sell it, rather than deleting the corresponding public key from every other machine in the entire internet that your public key has been copied to

[13:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and it's not useful to remove the private key after you sell it, because the recipient will already have compromised all your accounts)

[13:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[13:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/private key/public keys/

[13:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
wiping hard disks is non-trivial and assumes you can access the disk

[13:34:01.0000] <takkaria>
wiping hard disks only requires ddd

[13:34:02.0000] <takkaria>
*dd

[13:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. to each his own. :-)

[13:34:04.0000] <Philip`>
Wiping disks only requires a screwdriver and sandpaper

[13:34:05.0000] <Hixie>
not if you're going to sell it :-)

[13:35:00.0000] <takkaria>
though I guess the number of people who know about dd is probably lower than 1 in 1000

[13:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
same with ssh!

[13:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
If it's a disk you've used already, it's tiny and obsolete and would have negligible resale value :-)

[13:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Nobody would want to buy an old 250GB disk nowadays, you couldn't even fit six months of MP3s on it

[13:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/ says "ALTER_INFOSET is now the default", but http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/apidocs/nu/validator/htmlparser/sax/HtmlParser.html says "By default ... the this parser treats XML 1.0-incompatible infosets as fatal errors" which seems inconsistent

[13:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Also the latter says "the this parser")

[13:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
(which seems not grammar)

[15:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Commenting on his blog?

[15:02:01.0000] <annevk2>
!summon markp

[15:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Comments are only open for like two days on his blog

[15:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: The later feedback form just goes to email, AFAIK

[15:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Wait for him to post a new one :)

[15:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/autodiscovery/ — tests 47 to 50 are broken :\

[15:04:00.0000] <annevk2>
just make a blog post and hope he does an ego search

[15:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: what do you want to ask him?

[15:41:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, so we need to figure out this how-to-compare-Origin-to-Access-Control-Allow-Origin thing

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it was a string comparison

[15:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
no?

[15:43:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, yes, i question that that is wise

[15:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
for security-related things, it seems the most conservative option is best

[15:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's hard to get a subtle security bug when you do a strict string comparison

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we do something else, say partially case-insensitive IDN/punycode-equivalent full-URL comparison, we're setting ourself up for serious pain

[15:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
ourselves

[15:44:02.0000] <sicking>
everyone has to have code to do that anyway

[15:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah and everyone has had at least oen security bug with it

[15:45:00.0000] <sicking>
so you can compare if two frames are same-origin or not

[15:45:01.0000] <sicking>
sure, but it needs to get fixed

[15:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
the frame origin comparison isn't a url comparison

[15:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's a tuple comparison of exact strings

[15:45:04.0000] <sicking>
so why reinvent the wheel, even if the new wheel is simpler

[15:45:05.0000] <sicking>
yup

[15:45:06.0000] <sicking>
well

[15:45:07.0000] <Hixie>
i'd rather not have a wheel at all, i'd rather have just a twig, or whatever is the right analogy here

[15:45:08.0000] <sicking>
strings and numbers

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
string and numbers can be compared reasonably safely

[15:46:01.0000] <sicking>
it seems very confusing to have urls that are case sensitive though, when they aren't case sensitive anywhere else

[15:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
urls are a whole entire other ball game of extreme danger

[15:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
URLs are partially case-sensitive

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
which is FAR more confusing than just comparing a string

[15:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
especially given that in most cases the string will either be hard-coded or echoed

[15:47:02.0000] <sicking>
but this must be a solved problem already

[15:47:03.0000] <sicking>
for everyone

[15:48:00.0000] <sicking>
no implementation i've talked to has seen any risk security wise

[15:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
the latest security bug with URL parsing was _last month_

[15:48:02.0000] <sicking>
me included

[15:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
18 years into the life of urls

[15:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
and you want to rely on that?

[15:48:05.0000] <sicking>
would it have affected parsing origins?

[15:48:06.0000] <sicking>
i am already relying on url parsing

[15:48:07.0000] <sicking>
so ues

[15:48:08.0000] <sicking>
yes

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have no idea (i'm thinking of the :% -> crash in chrome)

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
how are you relying on url parsing?

[15:49:02.0000] <sicking>
when comparing if two frames are same-origin

[15:50:00.0000] <sicking>
all urls ultimately start as strings that are parsed

[15:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's nor a URL comparison, it's an exact tuple comparison of strings and numbers

[15:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[15:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
but by the time they are parsed if you got the parsing wrong you went to the wrong place

[15:50:04.0000] <sicking>
that's what the orign to ac-allow-origin will be too

[15:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
so you can't get the wrong security

[15:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
context

[15:50:07.0000] <sicking>
i'll reuse the same string->url parsing code

[15:51:00.0000] <sicking>
and then reuse the same url to url same origin code

[15:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i really don't see any advantage to doing that

[15:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
it seems like asking to use a tightrope to cross a ravine when there's a perfectly good concrete bridge right next to it

[15:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
what's the problem with comparing strings?

[15:51:04.0000] <sicking>
except that the tightrope is used everywhere in the already

[15:52:00.0000] <sicking>
in the product

[15:52:01.0000] <sicking>
how do you mean?

[15:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
what is the problem you want to solve by not doing a string comparison? (the url parsing having happened, as with origin checking, before having a security context)

[15:52:03.0000] <sicking>
the problem is in everywhere when there is a difference to url comparsing

[15:52:04.0000] <sicking>
which are 3 things:

[15:53:00.0000] <sicking>
1. scheme in url is case insensitive

[15:53:01.0000] <sicking>
2. domain in url is case insensitive

[15:53:02.0000] <sicking>
3. explicit default port is same as no port

[15:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
yes but the UA generates the string it is comparing to, so why does it matter? i mean, we could be generating hashes here too, why does it matter?

[15:53:04.0000] <sicking>
why aren't we using hashes?

[15:54:00.0000] <sicking>
or http.org.example.www(80)

[15:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
so that the user can see what is being compared more easily

[15:54:02.0000] <sicking>
user won't see this

[15:54:03.0000] <sicking>
my mom never will

[15:54:04.0000] <Hixie>
s/user/author/, sorry

[15:55:00.0000] <sicking>
that author will also be generating the urls for ac-allow-origin

[15:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm fine with using a new syntax too, it just seems gratuitous)

[15:55:02.0000] <sicking>
exactly, and doing string comparison is using a new syntax

[15:55:03.0000] <sicking>
because we no longer treat them as urls

[15:56:00.0000] <sicking>
i say that if something looks like a url, we should treat it as such

[15:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i'm saying that's a security nightmare waiting to happen

[15:56:02.0000] <sicking>
can you name any problems with url parsing that would have been made worse by using it for AC?

[15:57:00.0000] <sicking>
any problem with url parsing is already likely fatal

[15:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Oh, just to tell him those tests that I mentioned above are broken

[16:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: no, not off-hand. But defense in depth isn't done by making sure we don't do something that could be vulnerable to an already-fixed problem, it's done by making the attack surface smaller.

[16:02:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, it's a very gratuitous defense you are inventing

[16:03:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, if you have no idea what you are protecting yourself from, how do we know what you are inventing is better

[16:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's simpler

[16:03:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, you are also adding risks by inventing new formats

[16:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
simpler is better :-)

[16:03:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's not a new format, it's a canonicalised URL

[16:03:05.0000] <sicking>
simpler how? for who?

[16:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
(s1 == s2) is simpler than (ParseURL(s1) == ParseURL(s2))

[16:04:01.0000] <sicking>
simpler for who?

[16:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
and it's simpler for authors and implementors. for authors because once they have found the string that works, it'll always work, and for implementors because, well, (s1 == s2) is simpler than (ParseURL(s1) == ParseURL(s2))

[16:05:00.0000] <sicking>
it's not simpler for me, it's about the same number of lines of code  (about 5 vs 8), it's not simpler for authors as they have a surprising inconsistency with all other urls in the product

[16:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
as an implementor I'd say neither is particularly harder or easier

[16:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
seriously? doing a security audit of the url parsing is as simple as a security audit of just comparing two strings?

[16:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
those must be some damn complicated string comparisong algorithms y'all are using

[16:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
comparison

[16:06:03.0000] <sicking>
the code is already audited in both cases

[16:07:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie,  i don't have two strings, i have a string (the ac-allow-origin header) and a url (the requesting site)

[16:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
url parsing and comparison (and specifically of a url string converted to our SecurityOrigin class) is already audited

[16:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and already heavily exposed

[16:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: you have two strings, the string you sent the server, and the string it sent back

[16:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would be less nervous security-wise about a comparison of two SecurityOrigin objects than two Strings, but seems to me either could be sound

[16:08:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i don't have the string sent to the server saved. I could save it, but it'd add about the same number of lines of code that parsing to a url adds

[16:09:00.0000] <sicking>
yeah, i think both these solutions are simple and both are secure. The difference is that one seems more surprising to authors

[16:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: what's an example of a case where the author would see different behavior between the two?

[16:11:01.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, HTTP://Example.Org:80   vs    http://example.org     contains all 3 differences that i can think of

[16:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: ok, but walk me through the scenario

[16:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so let's say you loaded from a page of HTTP://Example.Org:80

[16:12:02.0000] <virtuelv>
sicking: what about http://example.org./ vs http://example.org/

[16:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: those are different

[16:13:00.0000] <sicking>
virtuelv, what hixie said

[16:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
my concern is with things like http:///example.com vs http://example.com, where on UA has a bug and treats it differently than other UAs

[16:13:02.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, well, the Origin header that the site is going to receive is always going to be on the "canonical" form (per spec)

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
or http:://, or http://foo.com:80⊙bc:81/ or whatever

[16:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems like for something this important you shouldn't need to be a spec lawyer to be able to tell if the string is going to work or not

[16:15:01.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, in most cases the server is going to have some sort of list of origins they want to approve. For example some list like      "*.company.com", "*.partner.com"

[16:15:02.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, and then match the Origin against that

[16:16:00.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, and then send back a matching origin if one is found

[16:16:01.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, (they're basically forced to do this given how simple the syntax of the AC-Allow-Origin header is)

[16:17:00.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, so if they generate the send-back string with a uppercase Company.com because that's how they normally type the company url internally, they'll currently fail

[16:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
but they'll _always_ fail, so it'll be trivial to catch

[16:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
with url parsing, they might find it works in the UAs they test, but some syntax error means it fails in the rest

[16:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
and they won't know until the deploy

[16:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
they

[16:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: so if you can generate the 

[16:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"canonical" form to send it

[16:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you can generate it for the comparison too

[16:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I see the point for the send-back

[16:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
requires a canonicalization on the server side, possibly

[16:20:00.0000] <sicking>
right

[16:20:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, differences like that are already breaking things and needs to be fixed

[16:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
not necessarily

[16:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
but sure, any interop issues should be fixed

[16:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
my point is just that this is too important to elevate all url parsing interop issues to that level

[16:21:03.0000] <sicking>
i don't think this is any more important than any other place

[16:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
it'd be like saying "well a lot of our houses are made of wood, and wood is quite flammable, so we have to fix that anyway, it's not a reason to not build the dam using wood"

[16:22:01.0000] <sicking>
but this is just another house, this is no more important than anything else in the browser

[16:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
?!

[16:23:00.0000] <sicking>
if two strings parsed into urls are considered same-origin in one UA but not in another we're already in the same trouble that would happen here

[16:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
this controls the ability for any random site to transfer all my money out of my bank account

[16:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think URL canonicalization is risky

[16:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's FAR more important than, say, whether i can type a URL safely in the address bar

[16:23:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think having different definitions of same-origin is more risky

[16:23:05.0000] <Hixie>
i agree with maciej

[16:23:06.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, so does the same-origin-url-comparison code that checks if cross-frame-scripting is allowed

[16:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the upshot of what I'm saying is that Access-Control defining same-origin differently is arguably bad

[16:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: this isn't defining same-origin differently

[16:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
since other same-origin checks canonicalize

[16:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it's serialising the origin, and then comparing it to someone else's attempt at doing the same thing

[16:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess you could see it that way

[16:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
origin comparisons aren't url comparisons, they're the same thing as here, except without serialising the origin, just holding it as a tuple

[16:25:03.0000] <sicking>
so for what it's worth, IE does have a different concept of what is same-origin than everyone else

[16:26:00.0000] <sicking>
they don't consider ports to be part of the origin

[16:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
(they could as easily be done by serialising, except for the unique ID case)

[16:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[16:26:03.0000] <sicking>
apparently they do for same-site XHR starting with IE7, but nowhere else

[16:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not the editor of the AC spec, so i'm not the one you have to convince :-)

[16:28:00.0000] <sicking>
anne has said he'll follow what websockets do

[16:28:01.0000] <sicking>
though technically speaking its not up to the editor but the group as a whole

[16:28:02.0000] <sicking>
i'd just rather it not get to that of course

[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
well technically it's up to Tim

[16:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
but sure

[16:29:02.0000] <sicking>
this is far too unimportant to raise to a vote even

[16:29:03.0000] <sicking>
imho

[16:29:04.0000] <sicking>
i just don't see any advantages to the current behavior

[16:29:05.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: When using your HTML2XML, any spaces in attributes get turned into \x20\xEF\BF\xBD (or whatever that is in UTF-8), which seems kind of weird and undesired

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: so where do you stand on WebSocket-Location?

[16:30:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, what is that?

[16:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
should that be parsed and components recompared too?

[16:31:01.0000] <sicking>
yeah, in general i think that when we compare url like things, we should compare them as urls

[16:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
cripes that makes things a lot more complicated for websocket

[16:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
so should relative URLs here be resolved ?

[16:32:01.0000] <sicking>
i don't know anything about websockets

[16:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
how should I handle IDN/punycode?

[16:32:03.0000] <sicking>
i was just told they had something similar as Access-Control-Allow-Origin

[16:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
another reason to not do URL comparison is that we might not always be dealing with URLs, e.g. if bz gets his way and we serialise the unique ID origins too

[16:33:01.0000] <sicking>
so IDN is a good point actually

[16:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
for WebSocket I really fear the mess that will occur if we start reparsing the output from the server

[16:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
the whole point is that we want to make the handshake as hard as possible to fake

[16:34:02.0000] <sicking>
i don't know if www.Å.com is the same as www.å.com

[16:34:03.0000] <sicking>
(not sure if that comes out correct, should be uppercase a-ring vs lowercase a-ring)

[16:35:00.0000] <sicking>
if the web in general consider those same-origin

[16:35:01.0000] <sicking>
but string comparison wouldn't, that seems bad

[16:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
string comparison compares the ASCII serialisation

[16:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
so you would compare the punycode version

[16:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
you can't send non-ASCII over HTTP

[16:35:05.0000] <Hixie>
HTTP doesn't define an encoding beyond ASCII iirc

[16:36:00.0000] <sicking>
are the punycode of the two the same?

[16:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
no idea, but that's not our problem at that point

[16:41:00.0000] <sicking>
well, it sort of is if string-comparison results in different behavior than url comparison

[16:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
how can it result in different behaviour?

[16:43:01.0000] <sicking>
/me ponders

[16:45:00.0000] <sicking>
so if the requesting page is www.å.com

[16:46:00.0000] <sicking>
actually, looks like they produce the same punycode


2008-10-03
[17:23:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, so what are the features of websockets that you are concerned about changing?

[17:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
the handshake

[17:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
specifically the processing of websocket-origin and websocket-location

[21:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: are you about?

[21:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
vaguely

[21:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: there's a new (highres and otherwise improved) timer API being discussed on webkit-dev - should I propose it for HTML5 or as a standalone spec in Web Apps WG?

[21:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
webapps

[21:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have an editor lined up for it

[21:16:02.0000] <takkaria>
wow

[21:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I might even be able to edit or co-edit myself.

[21:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems pretty simple

[21:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
only complexity is that it kind of conceptually ties into HTML5's event loop

[21:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
afk, bbiab

[21:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
later

[22:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2008/09/23-minutes.html -- the tag appears to be so far removed from what we're trying to do here that our meeting at the tpac ought to be quite interesting

[23:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: reading that belatedly... I see what you mean

[00:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
how does one run for TAG?

[00:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder how much I would hate that

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: an AC rep has to nominate you and you have to be picked

[00:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it was mentioned that there are "elected" members in those minutes

[00:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
someone offered to nominate me once

[00:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
i told them in no uncertain terms not to bother

[00:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
5 selected by the AC

[00:07:04.0000] <othermaciej>
er

[00:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
elected

[00:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
3 nominated by director

[00:08:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm wondering if having someone there with a real-world relationship to the web would help

[00:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
probably not worth it

[00:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
you have to ask: what is the purpose of the tag

[00:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
what effect can it have on the web

[00:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
"stewardship of the Web architecture"

[00:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
o_O

[00:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess participating in a group where my goal would be preventing damage rather than contributing something positive would be a waste of time

[00:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
reading the process document makes me wince

[00:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear to me that the TAG has ever caused harm, other than a few cases where people for some reason felt compelled to somehow change the tag's mind (usually fruitlessly, and later just ignoring them instead)

[00:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so much silly process and bureaucracy, which is the ignored when inconvenient

[00:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
(and then the harm was just wasting time)

[00:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
they rarely have managed to get up the energy to waste major amounts of time

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
are those TAG minutes meant to become public?

[00:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think so...

[00:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
why would they not be?

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: they aren't public now. but I guess that's just a review period thing

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish people would get over this secrecy nonsense

[01:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the people who'd be most offended or advantaged by knowing the secret stuff that might get removed already have access...

[01:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i know

[01:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's what boggles my mind

[01:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I see you didn't address my pending feedback about line breaks in input type=text. should I start sending comments on the form stuff or assume that there's still pending feedback for stuff that has been migrated to html5 spec?

[01:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't replied to a single WF2 e-mail yet

[01:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[01:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'd hold back if you have feedback that i haven't yet dealt with

[01:34:04.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[01:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm only about half-done on WF2 integration so far

[01:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's proving at least as hard as i imagined it would

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
only one more type="" to do!

[01:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
type=image

[01:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm glad to see that the CSS WG said no to versioning syntax: http://www.w3.org/mid/48E4132F.9060201⊙in

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
css is where i first realised the value of no versioning

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the specialness of lang&xml:lang continues to result in insane amounts of code... :-(

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
more code than prose?

[02:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: more code

[02:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in the Java version of the parser, I want to have a non-browser sanity mode that magically turns lang on HTML elements to xml:lang in the infoset

[02:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but in the C++ version, I don't want to pay the memory footprint that the feature would take if latent

[02:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(and in the Java version not paying for it as RAM footprint would make the code slower)

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on top of that, there are all sorts of checks on the validation layer

[02:15:01.0000] <gpy>
morning laddies

[02:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
different ones for HTML and XHTML 

[02:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
sounds like a pain

[02:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
i recommend not supporting xhtml. :-D

[02:15:05.0000] <Hixie>
(only kidding)

[02:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
If I could go back in time, I'd ask the definers of XML get rid of the xml: stuff and to grandfather lang and id. (and zap xml:space)

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
you'd be ignored like everyone who _did_ ask them to doso

[02:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
at least I had the foresight to arrange my data structures so that I can just clip my arrays by one element when generating the C++ version

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder what would break if we defined lang in HTML to become an attribute whose local name and qualified name are "lang" but the namespace is the XML namespace

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on HTML nodes, that is

[02:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not on SVG and MathML nodes

[02:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
getAttribute('lang'), for one, if i understand you right

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
also you'd still have a syntax issue, except now lang="" in HTML would be equal to xml:lang="" in XML and lang="" in XML and xml:lang="" in HTML would both be null-namespace attributes with no semantics, leading to no end of extra confusion

[02:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: why? it matches on qualified name, which would be "lang"

[02:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it matches on name + namespace=null

[02:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
IIRC, no

[02:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
so how are clashes resolved?

[02:26:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh, qname

[02:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
man that would be so confusing

[02:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: however, it would break setAttribute("lang", 'en')

[02:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
unless setAttribute were made magic

[02:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't care about lang enough to do this

[02:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[02:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, in general, namespaces result in an insane amount of code that doesn't do anything useful but has to be there for correctness and compat

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
why is multiple file upload missing? multiple file upload is crucial

[04:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me now has a streaming HTML-to-XHTML web service, but it takes about 6.5 seconds to convert the 3MB HTML5 spec, which is better than html5lib but not great :-(

[04:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's CPU-bound now, and I can't think of any obvious ways to improve it that don't involve getting a faster CPU)

[04:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
do you use Validator.nu?

[04:53:01.0000] <olliej>
yoyo annevk2 

[04:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
I use its parser and serialiser

[04:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
olliej, hey

[04:54:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me should really go to work; woke up midday due to jetlag

[04:57:00.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: wow, you need an excuse for that?

[04:57:01.0000] <olliej>
/me got to work at 2 today

[04:58:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`: HTML-to-XHTML ? why ?

[04:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
erlehmann: Because takkaria is slow ;)

[04:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or rather because html5lib is slow and the validator.nu parser doen't have a way of binding to python and takkaria doesn't have a stable hubbub release yet)

[04:59:01.0000] <erlehmann>
???

[05:00:00.0000] <jmb>
jgraham: we're working on that (slowly)

[05:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which means that parsing html in python is slow whereas parsing xml is fast

[05:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
So html->xml using validator.nu followed by xml parsing in python might be faster than html5lib

[05:02:00.0000] <erlehmann>
yay

[05:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
jmb: I was being tounge in cheek abot blaming you :) Although I am very much looking forward to hubbub

[05:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: What jgraham said :-)

[05:02:03.0000] <jmb>
jgraham: aye

[05:06:00.0000] <annevk2>
olliej, well, usually when I'm in Oslo I try to work 10-6 since I'm not here that often and most people work those hours

[05:06:01.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: it's 4am and i'm still alive

[05:06:02.0000] <olliej>
s/alive/at the office ;)

[05:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
ouch

[05:07:01.0000] <annevk2>
also, friday beer and general shutdown today is at 5PM

[05:07:02.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: ah

[05:07:03.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: i've just been trapped in MSVC hell

[05:07:04.0000] <annevk2>
anyway, got to go

[05:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: what was the problem with HTML2XML and escapes?

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa!

[05:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that's a weird bug

[05:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
just a break statement missing

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm amazed the bug was there for so long without getting noticed

[05:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: fixed in SVN

[05:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: thanks

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, it didn't render output ill-formed, so I guess an XML serializer can do something very bogus and still not get caught by an XML parser

[05:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so now Philip` has found a bug in my XML serializer but still not a bug causing ill-formedness :-)

[05:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
the spec even says "There must be no more than one file in the list of selected files." :/

[05:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: javadocs about default policy also fixed in SVN. thanks

[05:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, fwiw, I agree with you on string comparison; also note that it's not exactly a same origin check as you need an additional check for the path component which sicking neglected to mention

[05:47:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe s/neglected/forgot/

[05:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
(that is, making sure the path component is not specified at all so that Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com/ fails)

[06:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: If your criteria is limited to ill-formedness bugs and doesn't count other bugs, then the implementation is trivial, since you could write "String serialize(Document doc) { return "<foo/>"; }" and it would never be ill-formed :-)

[06:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Is there an easy way I can compile a new htmlparser-....jar with the fixed code?

[06:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: no. I'll build a new jar.

[06:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: new version released: http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/

[06:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(wow. now I've actually had to make a new release because of an XML serializer bug Philip` found...)

[06:34:01.0000] <annevk2>
is there some way to instantiate Validator.nu and get a Python bound libxml tree as output?

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: locally, you can invoke java -cp htmlparser-1.1.1.jar nu.validator.htmlparser.tools.HTML2XML and pipe the input HTML to it, pipe the XML out and parse it with libxml in Python

[06:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
it seems that DreamHost has JDK so it might be worth looking into that

[06:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hopefully later you could use the C++ translator with a type mapper that maps to the Python C API types instead of NSPR/XPCOM types

[06:37:02.0000] <annevk2>
for Anolis, that is

[06:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: Didn't Philip` just make a network service that is equivalent to HTML2XML?

[06:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(and that saves the JVM startup overhead)

[06:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
it does involve downloading 3MB in case of HTML5

[06:39:01.0000] <annevk2>
twice

[06:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
good point

[06:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Thanks!

[06:39:04.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: You really don't want to start up a new JVM each time you want to parse a document

[06:39:05.0000] <annevk2>
though maybe Philip` is working on Anolis now in which case I don't have to :)

[06:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
you could also try compiling nu.validator.htmlparser.tools.HTML2XML with GCJ to avoid the JVM overhead

[06:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
but you could run the web service thing (which is just a trivial wrapper around Jetty and the parser/serialiser) locally

[06:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: on dreamhost, doing so requires dreamhost PS

[06:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: not allowed on regular accounts

[06:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Oh, that could be a problem

[06:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: It's much less than 3MB if you compress it :-)

[06:41:04.0000] <Philip`>
but then it'll get CPU-bound more easily

[06:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
why would the JVM not be on by default btw?

[06:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Without compression, it takes about 6 seconds (on my very limited CPU) which is 500KB/s which isn't really much

[06:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
so you shouldn't really need to worry about bandwidth usage

[06:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: IIRC, Dreamhost default accounts allow you to run Java programs by default but you aren't allowed to leave the processes sitting in the RAM

[06:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and leaving the process waiting is the whole point of avoiding the JVM startup overhead

[06:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmm, 25% of the runtime is in sun.nio.cs.UTF_8$Encoder.encodeArrayLoop)

[06:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: do you have ICU4J in classpath?

[06:45:01.0000] <annevk2>
ok, Java support indeed there

[06:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
There's the HotSpot overhead too, since it's really slow the first time you try to pass a document through the process

[06:45:03.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Hmm... No

[06:45:04.0000] <annevk2>
but I suppose I can use the service from Philip`

[06:45:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: just wondering if the IBM UTF-8 impl is any faster

[06:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how many distributed moving parts the spec generation now has...

[06:46:01.0000] <annevk2>
but is Validator.nu much faster than the libxml HTML parser? that's currently being used and already it's slow :/

[06:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It still says it's spending lots of time in sun.nio.cs.UTF_8$Encoder.encodeArrayLoop

[06:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ok. I guess it's not picking up the ICU4J code automatically  :-(

[06:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
I presume it is actually using ICU4J now, since it's got some calls to com.ibm.icu.charset.UConverterDataReader.readMBCSTable too

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: from the name, that looks like a static method that runs on initial class loading

[06:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Oh, okay

[06:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: I haven't benchmarked the Validator.nu parser against libxml2

[06:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: On my computer, parsing/reserialising the spec with libxml2 (via a Python script) takes about 0.55 seconds and with validator.nu (via (local) HTTP) takes about 0.75 seconds

[06:58:00.0000] <annevk2>
so it won't go faster

[06:58:01.0000] <annevk2>
but since libxml2 html can't be used...

[07:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
If the UTF-8 encoding took zero time then it'd be faster than libxml2 :-)

[07:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
I should also figure out how to make Python run faster on DreamHost

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/ - "Fixed JavaDocs about XML violatation policy defaults." - s/violatation/violation/

[07:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: thanks. fixed

[09:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
id=draft-recommendation-&mdash;-date:-01-jan-1901 — that really isn't nice.

[09:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
do IDs after dates?

[09:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why does it need an id at all?

[09:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Currently all headers get ids

[09:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: Then it changes every time the date changes

[09:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Why? It seems pointless if nothing is linking to it

[09:21:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't remember

[09:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
There was a reason

[09:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
and for the headings where you might actually want to externally link to, like the status and abstract, they already have explicit non-auto-generated id values in the source

[09:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that isn't changed.

[10:02:00.0000] <erlehmann>
why does XHTML 5 not attempt to provide a replacement for the modularization scheme defined and used by XHTML 1.1 ?

[10:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: Because the people developing XHTML 5 do not see any value in defining a modularisation scheme, as far as I'm aware

[10:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
(No value to the web, in particular)

[10:04:01.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`: i used the modularisation to allow specific XHTML tags in comments.

[10:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: couldn't you have done that with a monolithic schema by deleting stuff from it?

[10:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: Why does modularisation help, rather than just you writing a list of the elements and attributes you want to permit?

[10:05:01.0000] <erlehmann>
yeah, but i'd have to write the DTDs myself ;)

[10:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: what happens when you and the XHTML2 WG disagree on the grouping of elements?

[10:06:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen: they'll probably win

[10:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: have you ever wanted to allow one but disallow another element within one module (as defined by the XHTML 2 WG)?

[10:06:02.0000] <erlehmann>
i'm no match for the internet alite

[10:06:03.0000] <erlehmann>
no.

[10:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: 3:19.594, with a large mistake going into the Porsche Curves on RM/RM

[11:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why does no normal web server with reverse proxying cope with streaming transfers? :-(

[11:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
All I want it to do is redirect the request to another server, and redirect the response back, without buffering everything in the middle

[11:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
(If I remember correctly, Apache and Lighttpd buffer the whole response, and Nginx also buffers the whole request)

[13:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Aha, Squid does reverse proxying properly

[13:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
though it only supports HTTP 1.0

[13:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
so if I use curl with default options then it gets an error message, because curl tries sending Expect: 100-continue which Squid doesn't like

[13:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
HTTP is so nice

[13:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: i want to do multiple file uploads with something other than min/max

[13:47:00.0000] <weinig|food>
Hixie: what were you thinking about besides min/max?

[13:47:01.0000] <weinig>
/me is about to implement multiple file uploads

[13:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno

[13:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
count="" or something maybe

[13:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
or multiple=""

[13:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
like on <select>

[13:53:00.0000] <weinig>
/me nods

[13:53:01.0000] <weinig>
/me thinks min/max is awkward for it

[13:53:02.0000] <aboodman>
i think multiple would be better than min/max fwiw

[13:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah it's totally overloading min max in a silly way

[13:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
i like multiple

[13:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i only just thought of it

[13:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't really looked at this carefully

[13:54:04.0000] <aboodman>
cprince brought this up a long time ago, but i forgot to ever mention it. sorry.

[14:14:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, I don't care strongly either way on the method I suppose, but it's needed

[14:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
just having a simple boolean attribute might be enough

[14:24:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: wouldn't it be multiple="multiple" ?

[14:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
it would be a boolean attribute called "multiple"

[14:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
i just use ="" to mean "attribute"

[14:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, afk, bbiab

[14:24:04.0000] <annevk2>
also, boolean attributes in HTML5 are allowed to have the empty string as value

[14:28:00.0000] <erlehmann>
empty means what exactly ? true or false ?

[14:28:01.0000] <erlehmann>
also, a tagcloud is a nav element, amirite ?

[14:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
if the attribute is present, true, false otherwise

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
tag clouds are a list

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
probably an unordered list with an attribute (e.g. data-freq="") giving the frequency (there's no semantic in html for marking up the frequency really)

[15:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
nested <em>

[15:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
glad to hear multiple files will be fixed

[15:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
i'm ok with it not being max=n I think, it doesn't really matter that much

[15:39:01.0000] <annevk2>
though we might have to support both for a couple of releases

[16:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I've seen <a href title="30 entries"> and similar used in tag clouds to indicate frequency to users.

[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: nested <em> would be wrong per html5. :-)

[16:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: that can work

[16:05:02.0000] <BenMillard>
sometimes it's in the content, like <li><a href>foo</a> (30)</a> or <li><a href>bar (30 entries)</a>

[16:05:03.0000] <BenMillard>
oops

[16:05:04.0000] <BenMillard>
<li><a href>Foo</a> (30)</li>

[16:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I might use <ol> if the items were ordered by their frequency

[16:11:00.0000] <BenMillard>
using <li value> to give the frequency makes sense in the markup but looks to weird in the rendering :)

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
not that i'm anywhere near being able to do anything about it what with all this web forms work, but, anyone know if the svg group made any progress on the svg in text/html thing?

[16:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
just curious

[16:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: yeah, the order is more usually alphabetic or something (for which <ul> probably makes sense)

[16:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I believe they are waiting for feedback from you on their proposal

[16:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
no, i sent them that feedback

[16:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, yeah that's what I see

[16:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, you'll be lucky to find many tag clouds using list markup today, though. :)

[16:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Aug/0852.html

[16:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: yeah really

[16:16:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I've seen <div class> in the place of <ul> and <div style> in the place of <li>

[16:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
for tag clouds which are just a big clump of links, <p class><a href> <a href> happens

[16:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
would be good to convey the semantics somehow

[16:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, it's trivial to make lists of links display like a clump so I think <ul> is fine

[16:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
<a href style> is the most common way to set the frequencies, AFAICT

[16:19:01.0000] <BenMillard>
where style contains different values of font-size

[16:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: something chaals said gave me the impression that SVG WG didn't think the ball was in their court

[16:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: but I can't find the specific email remark that made me think that

[16:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[16:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought last i spoke with shepazu he agreed that it was in their court

[16:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll speak to them at the TPAC

[16:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
hopefully i'll be done with wf2 by then

[16:21:03.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, <ul><li><a href title></li>...</ul> seems the best way to me (swapping to <ol> if you order the items in some significant way)

[16:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(typos aside...)

[16:23:00.0000] <smedero>
SVG in HTML is in the SVG WG

[16:23:01.0000] <smedero>
... court: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Aug/0861.html

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: the main thing the visual tag cloud has is an indication of the top terms, which you lose without semantics in audio

[16:24:01.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: i don't really get why you are pushing this hard for continuing SGML markup.

[16:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me checks to make sure he's still in the same universe

[16:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
come again?

[16:25:01.0000] <erlehmann>
i mean, there are things it can't do. why not just usi XML then ?

[16:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
who's using SGML?

[16:25:03.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, that's what I'd use title for (as well as making the visual experience more specific on-demand)

[16:25:04.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: HTML is SGML.

[16:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: HTML5 is not SGML

[16:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
see section 8.2

[16:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
in particular the sentence that says "While the HTML form of HTML5 bears a close resemblance to SGML and XML, it is a separate language with its own parsing rules.

[16:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
[...] This version of HTML thus returns to a non-SGML basis."

[16:28:00.0000] <erlehmann>
okay, yeah, sorry.

[16:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, the right-hand column here uses title in the way I describe under the "Tags" heading: http://wakeless.net/archive/2006/12/dom-inspector-release

[16:30:00.0000] <erlehmann>
still don't get it. migration of existing sites will be a huge task anyway, closing a few <br> elements may not add much

[16:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, it has <a href class title rel style> for every entry, which seems excessive :)

[16:31:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, but the title values are good, imho

[16:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: Migration of existing sites is trivial - you just write a <input type=email> or something, and now your site is making use of HTML 5

[16:32:01.0000] <smedero>
erlehmann: hsivonen did a good job summarizing the history of the "HTML is SGML" confusion in his master's thesis: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/thesis/html5-conformance-checker#history 

[16:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: (Migration to XHTML is far harder, because there are hundreds of obscure corner cases you have to cope with, and nobody ever gets them all right)

[16:33:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`: if i really want to be semantic, it could be a tedious task replacing all the <div>s with <header>, <aside> and whatnot

[16:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: You're free to waste time if you want, but there's no reason you should do so

[16:36:00.0000] <erlehmann>
back to tagclouds. i currently assign custom classes. what exactly would a value attribute's value [sic] say ?

[16:44:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i'd be all for it being a value from 0 to 1 on a log scale :)

[16:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hiho

[16:51:00.0000] <erlehmann>
huhu

[16:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Can I blame jgraham for the speed of Anolis? He bullied me into keeping with Python when I was going to give up and use C++?

[16:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is Python the bottleneck?

[16:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: For the sub process, more or less

[16:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
It would be nice to try to make it work in Jython

[16:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and then you can use Java to optimise bottlenecks)

[16:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/file/d0260bea7c0f/anolislib/processes/sub.py#l133 — can you see anyway to optimize that loop?

[16:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Do you have many nodes with no text, tail or attributes?


2008-10-04
[17:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Plenty with no attributes

[17:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm… I wonder how much would be saved by cutting out the .items call

[17:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Optimise it to zero cost by never executing it

[17:01:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Dunno if you'd save anything by using iteritems

[17:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: :P

[17:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: I wasn't meaning that, but that may work a bit

[17:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I'm being mostly serious - that's the best way I've ever found to make things faster

[17:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: How can I never execute it?

[17:03:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Is the instance_string_subs list long?

[17:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: no

[17:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Normally only three

[17:04:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Six at most

[17:04:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Are all elements generic enough to affect all of text, tail and attribs?

[17:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: All are to affect text and tail, IIRC

[17:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: By finding all the places you're executing it, and the redesigning so you don't have to

[17:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/the/then/

[17:06:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Any way to find whether I need to run it is more expensive (at least for the whole loop)

[17:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Well, I'm guessing the tree elements are your biggest factor, so everything you can cut on processing per node will give a relatively good payoff

[17:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
If you can eliminate half the subs for attributes, hey

[17:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: .iteritems() makes no diff

[17:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You could do something like only run it over a small section of the document where you define that the substitutable text must occur, not the entire thing

[17:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Any condition that eliminates that for loop for attributes makes no difference

[17:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It could be that the actual valid substitutions are dominating

[17:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And then there's nothing you can do

[17:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I think "if identifier in value:" catches most of it

[17:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It's the regex that is the really expensive bit

[17:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Replace regexp with string substitution :P

[17:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: That may be possible…

[17:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok all the types are done!

[17:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
All the typos?

[17:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, types

[17:40:00.0000] <erlehmann>
in there any UA doing webforms 2.0 ?

[17:40:01.0000] <erlehmann>
is

[17:41:00.0000] <erlehmann>
or rather, parts of it ?

[17:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
opera 9 does most of it

[17:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
safari has had bits of it for a while

[17:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
other than that not much

[17:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, autocomplete is in most of them, and the stuff from wf1 is everywhere, of course

[17:43:00.0000] <erlehmann>
opera is nice :)

[17:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: All browsers are nice, in their own special ways :-)

[17:48:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`: while i dislike opera for not being free, few others have done so well regarding standards

[18:01:00.0000] <erlehmann>
IE has web forms ? i am shocked and apalled.

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it was a proprietary extension that we co-opted

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
the spec source contains the text ="">^(?:</

[18:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's... wrong

[18:20:00.0000] <erlehmann>
how far go the regular expressions ?

[18:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
?

[18:20:02.0000] <erlehmann>
bah, common grammar mistake (i'm not really awake)

[18:21:00.0000] <erlehmann>
can i use only basic or also extended regexes ?

[18:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
in what?

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh for pattern=""?

[18:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
you can use whatever ECMA262 defines

[18:22:02.0000] <erlehmann>
thx. i'll look it up.

[18:26:00.0000] <erlehmann>
the spec apparently doesn't say anything about that

[18:27:00.0000] <erlehmann>
but for the record, wikipedia says ECMA262 has something derived from perl regexes which aren't really POSIX

[18:31:00.0000] <erlehmann>
oops, my fault, i had read only the second edition - the third edition has regexes in 15.10

[18:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ECMA-262 does define the regexp syntax

[18:36:00.0000] <erlehmann>
othermaciej: as i said, i got hold of an old PDF that was missing aforementioned section

[18:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
all righty

[18:38:00.0000] <erlehmann>
sadly, that old pdf is the first search result in google and not even hosted by ECMA

[04:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
Is the Chromium team planning to replace certain parts of WebKit over time? E.g. http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=label:newhttp

[04:55:00.0000] <fakeolliej>
annevk2: webkit doesn't provide a network stack

[04:56:00.0000] <fakeolliej>
annevk2: it expects the platform to provide those, just as it expects the platform port to provide the front end API

[05:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
ah, so it's similar to Skia? ta

[05:02:00.0000] <fakeolliej>
annevk2: chrome effectively is its own platform

[05:02:01.0000] <fakeolliej>
annevk2: a la Qt 

[05:02:02.0000] <fakeolliej>
annevk2: i have a dream that one day they may contribute to the engine itself

[05:03:00.0000] <fakeolliej>
annevk2: but my experience with adobe and nokia has lowered my expectation for such things :-/

[05:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
CSS Namespaces Module in CR, a test suite for it is ready and I was never forced to work on either. That I dislike namespaces is such a myth :)

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how did the WebKit XBL2 & MathML SoC projects go?

[05:30:00.0000] <annevk2>
if they were a success there would probably have been a blog post...

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
afaik the Web Forms 2.0 project only landed autofocus, bit disappointing overall

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
where did Chrome's old http come from?

[05:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: It's new as well

[05:35:01.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, heh, good question :)

[05:38:00.0000] <olliej>
/me reappears

[05:38:01.0000] <olliej>
sorry this system wasn't set to autojoin whatwg

[05:38:02.0000] <olliej>
:D

[05:38:03.0000] <olliej>
hsivonen: cpst's project morphed into the general "make jsc faster"

[05:38:04.0000] <olliej>
rather than the pattern matching stuff

[05:38:05.0000] <olliej>
or tile matching

[05:38:06.0000] <olliej>
which is what frostbyte actually does 

[05:39:00.0000] <olliej>
frostbyte == khtml's new js engine

[05:40:00.0000] <olliej>
the svg filters guy accomplished very little alas (which is not surprising given the level he was at -- i need to understand the us education system better i don't know what any of the crazy names mean)

[05:40:01.0000] <olliej>
keishi got the firebug api's going

[05:40:02.0000] <olliej>
even doing the work to jsc to make line number info get passed in appropriately

[05:40:03.0000] <olliej>
the xbl one didn't really get to completion

[05:41:00.0000] <olliej>
i think that's it

[05:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
olliej, wasn't there Web Forms 2.0 and MathML as well?

[05:47:00.0000] <olliej>
i don't think we had sufficient slots for the mathml person

[05:47:01.0000] <olliej>
and yes there was a webforms 2 guy

[05:47:02.0000] <olliej>
however based on my complete absence of rememberance i suspect he may have disappeared into the ether

[05:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
olliej: :-( that doesn't sound good

[05:48:01.0000] <olliej>
hsivonen: yeah

[05:48:02.0000] <olliej>
i assume he failed

[05:48:03.0000] <olliej>
but i honestly don't know for sure

[05:48:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me should get around to learn C++ so he can take part in two years time

[05:48:05.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[05:48:06.0000] <gsnedders>
*learning

[05:48:07.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: you cna work on the inspector

[05:48:08.0000] <olliej>
html+js+css

[05:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: That doesn't help me learn C++ though :)

[05:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: I had hello world -level C++ experience when I started my summer coding

[05:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes the first item on his summer to-do list was ship Anolis 1.0

[05:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That still hasn't happened.

[05:50:02.0000] <olliej>
hsivonen: you were GSoC type person?

[05:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
olliej: I was in 2006, but it was not Google's but a thing imitating SoC

[05:51:01.0000] <olliej>
ah righto

[05:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is too young for GSoC

[05:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I had much better payment terms that what one gets with SoC)

[05:52:01.0000] <olliej>
:D

[05:52:02.0000] <olliej>
$/LoC? ;D

[05:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
no, checkpoints instead of all or nothing at the end

[05:54:00.0000] <olliej>
GSoC has a midway checkpoint

[05:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: Like, "Does it do less than when you started?"

[05:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. is that a new thing?

[05:54:03.0000] <hsivonen>
(I thought they didn't have checkpoints in 2005)

[05:56:00.0000] <olliej>
hsivonen: maybe -- i haven't done anything in previous years

[06:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: You still want to get me on standardssuck.org for HTTP5?

about SVG in HTML - obviously <object> doesn't suffice, but why ?

[06:31:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders: standardssuck.org is true to its name and has only flash video :)

[06:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: Actually, FLV is fully documented nowadays :P

[06:34:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders: Adobe Flash Player isn't

[06:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: Sure, but you can just get the FLV and download that :P

[06:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And SWF is open too

[06:36:01.0000] <erlehmann>
you bet how often i look around in the source code ...

[06:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: ?

[06:38:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i meant it often comes to me that i look through the source of a web site to find the embedded FLV's url

[06:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: ah

[06:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, get someone to implement <http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/pdf/swf_file_format_spec_v9.pdf> :P

[06:39:00.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: open source != standard :D

[06:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: What open source impls are there? There is no open source impl. or standard! :P

[06:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Just a spec! :P

[06:40:00.0000] <olliej>
gsnedders: isn't there swfdec or some such?

[06:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: Nothing useful in the real world :P

[06:40:02.0000] <olliej>
righto

[06:40:03.0000] <olliej>
/me would much rather flash just died

[06:40:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Partial impls, but no full impls

[06:40:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Me too, but it won't.

[06:40:06.0000] <olliej>
but i dont' see that happening in the near future

[06:40:07.0000] <olliej>
yup

[06:41:00.0000] <olliej>
like IE it is a bain on our existence

[06:41:01.0000] <olliej>
(not that gecko and webkit haven't left bits of cruft all over the web)

[06:41:02.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders: gnash ppl already said that this docs don't help

[06:41:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wants Web 2.0 :P

[06:42:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders: you are wrong here. this channel is the web 3.11 workgroup

[06:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: Nah, we're just documenting Web 1.0

[06:43:00.0000] <erlehmann>
also, embracing and extending it ;)

[06:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: sssh. You don't mention that. The log watchers might see!

[06:45:00.0000] <erlehmann>
CAN I HAZ PLACEHOLDER ATTRIBUTE ?

[07:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, yes

[07:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: at TPAC?

[07:05:02.0000] <Lachy>
sure

[07:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
you can do it with either annevk2 or myself

[07:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
or marcos, if he'll be there

[08:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what stuff he needs to pack

[09:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how the canvas colour discussion has gone from "rgb("+r+","+g+","+b+")" being long and hard to type, to suggesting that people write { red: 0, green: 0.3, blue: 0.6, alpha: 1.0 } instead

[09:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
At least one of the people writing CSS3 Color clearly had a pro-HSL agenda, so I guess they wouldn't be happy at an API that was specifically for RGB(A) and non-extensible

besides, white's supposed to go first

[10:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Depends on whether your IRC client has black-on-white text

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
but then I think the king and queen would be the wrong way around

[10:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: yeah, they are

[10:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not that it makes any practical difference in the gameplay, but it's the principle that matters

[10:33:00.0000] <erlehmann>
mine has a) black on white and b) proper unicode support

[11:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Do you have GT4?

[11:10:00.0000] <jcranmer>
erlehmann: I have white on black and proper unicode support

gsnedders, Free Run in GT Mode around Circuit de la Sarthe I with Bentley Speed 8, my own setup but normal turbo, RSH/RSH: 3:15 :)

[18:44:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, overdriving he car and braking too late is where I was losing time

[18:44:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, that's my fastest ever lap of that track with that car in Free Run

[18:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, all driving aids at 0; tall but close gearing; low but not minimum ride height; max downforce

[20:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, my 2008 collection now has <code> markup in the descriptions to make them a bit more legible: http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2008/collection

[20:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
about 100 entries still need notes or categorisation or both

[20:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
and then I'll summarise each category

[20:10:00.0000] <weinig|away>
/me      

[20:10:01.0000] <weinig|away>
oops

[03:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: max downforce round there!?

[03:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: maybe max at front, but should be nowhere near at rear

[05:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
Does IE8 have support for <canvas> yet?

[05:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, yt?

[05:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: no

[06:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
Does Firefox 3.1 alpha support selectors api? I'm trying to download it to test it and find out, but my download speed has just been throttled to 64kbps for exceeding the bandwidth usage cap :-(

[06:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's the one thing that seriously sucks about Australian ISPs

[06:19:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
lol

[06:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
nevermind, it finished downloading and it does support it

[06:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Time to try and duplicate GT4 disk

[06:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(the original is scratched, and although it can be read, it can be very slow to read)

[07:08:00.0000] <erlehmann>
is the green question mark the official whatwg logo ?

[07:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
it's the WHATWG logo

[07:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, it's not really clear to me how to let XMLHttpRequest use the event loops concept

[07:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
the events all fire synchronously in XMLHttpRequest Level 1

[07:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, if you could provide some help with that at some point that'd be nice

[07:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, just use a scratch removal kit to polish them out

[07:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: That has thus far failed

[07:45:00.0000] <erlehmann>
BenMillard: your list is funny, kudos !

[07:45:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, oh right...I guess they must be really deep

[07:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, do other games run fine? the lense may be dirty

[07:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The DVD drive is generally broken, it is what scratched it in the first place

[07:49:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, d'oh! :(

[07:50:00.0000] <jcranmer>
/me notes that his disc 2 of Legend of Dragoon hangs in one place reliably

[07:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I wish Sony released a PS3 with full backwards compat. :)

[07:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
* :(

[07:51:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I wish Sony released a PS3 that could save PS1 and PS2 games to PS3 cards

[07:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(The annoying thing is they did — just only for NTSC)

[08:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Instead of a PS3, why not just buy a new PS2? They're not really that expensive :-)

[08:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wishes the Microsoft Incremental Linker didn't keep crashing

[08:27:00.0000] <mcarter>
hello

[08:27:01.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, you around?

[09:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Too expensive to just replace something I already have that sorta works

[09:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: But buying a PS3 (if it had proper backward compatibility) would be even more expensive

[09:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But would give me something I didn't already have

[09:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Then get a PS2 plus a 360 :-)

[09:14:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I already have a 360

[09:14:04.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[09:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Oh, then you already have the ability to play wondrous next-gen games, and few are platform-exclusive nowadays, so you wouldn't be getting any new capabilities if you got a PS3, so you might as well just get a new PS2 instead :-)

[09:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: GT5! :P

[09:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: There are plenty of other games with cars racing around tracks that you could play instead :-p

[09:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: A fairly small number of good sims

[09:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
and all racing games are the same, really

[09:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
except for Wacky Wheels which was great because you got powerups by running over hedgehogs

[09:17:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[09:17:04.0000] <takkaria>
Burnout is pretty awesome

[09:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Burnout is pretty awesome. But cross platform so I can already get it.

[09:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/wacky-wheels/screenshots/gameShotId,223326/ - yay, hedgehog

[09:19:00.0000] <takkaria>
I just wanted to mention it, really, since I think everyone should play it

[09:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I wonder what Forza 3 will be like

[09:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hopes it has tracks like Le Mans and Spa

[09:36:00.0000] <erlehmann>
MIcrs Machines !

[10:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
Have fun at TPAC everyone

[10:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me is about to go away

[10:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Have fun too

[10:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Try not to let TAG/PFWG/HTMLWG/other people's video games abilities (delete as appropriate) get you down

[10:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Thanks :)

[13:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: if everything is synchronous, then there's no need for any event loop stuff. but i thought there was asynchronous stuff, otherwise why would we have an "asynchronou" flag?

I never knew people could bikeshed over implemented features

[19:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, looks like I can't tunnel Web Socket connections through a Squid reverse proxy :-(

[19:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It messes up all the response headers, and then closes the connection immediately)

[19:40:00.0000] <famicom>
yo

[19:40:01.0000] <famicom>
takkaria what do you mean with bikeshed

[19:44:00.0000] <famicom>
blegh

[19:44:01.0000] <famicom>
html 5 is a Bad-Idea (tm)

[19:46:00.0000] <famicom>
as far as the new tags go that is.

[19:58:00.0000] <takkaria>
famicom: http://www.unixguide.net/freebsd/faq/16.19.shtml

[19:59:00.0000] <takkaria>
famicom: why do you think html5 is a bad idea?

[20:00:00.0000] <famicom>
if anything, it should feature LESS tags instead of more

[20:02:00.0000] <takkaria>
what tags do you have problems with in particular?

[20:06:00.0000] <famicom>
<article> <audio> <command> <footer> <progress> <time> <video>

[20:06:01.0000] <famicom>
<figure> etc etc

[20:08:00.0000] <famicom>
<aside> is horrible too

[20:09:00.0000] <famicom>
why on EARTH would you add a new element, when you can just use a css float

[20:19:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: audio and video actually provide completely new functionality

[20:19:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: the others mostly represent semantic information rather than style information

[20:20:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: then there are a few others that all the browser already implement, so defining behaviour == compatibility win

[20:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
famicom: elements are about semantics and behavior, not presentation

[20:21:01.0000] <famicom>
yeah, but what if i add 2 footer tags inside a document

[20:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML5 tries to add semantic elements for structures very commonly seen on the Web, to avoid the need to do everything with <div> soup

[20:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
then that would be invalid, unless each is in a different sectioning element

[20:22:02.0000] <famicom>
what is wrong with div soup

[20:24:00.0000] <famicom>
adding new elements is going to create an even bigger mess

[20:25:00.0000] <famicom>
and audio + video add NOTHING that hasnt been possible with embed

[20:26:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: um? you're entirely right, it's perfectly possible to use a variety of proprietary technologies in an embed tag

[20:26:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: non of which are styleable with css

[20:26:02.0000] <olliej>
ignoring the fact you should be using an object tag ;D

[20:26:03.0000] <famicom>
gehehehehe

[20:29:00.0000] <famicom>
but here's something, what about for instance flash video.

[20:29:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: what about it?

[20:29:02.0000] <famicom>
which is proprietary, but is a media container for video

[20:29:03.0000] <famicom>
well

[20:29:04.0000] <famicom>
which tag should be used for that

[20:29:05.0000] <olliej>
famicom: an object tag

[20:30:00.0000] <famicom>
but it displays video

[20:30:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: video == browser embedded video

[20:30:02.0000] <olliej>
famicom: eg. the browser knows what is happening

[20:30:03.0000] <famicom>
it is embedded in my browser isnt it

[20:30:04.0000] <olliej>
famicom: and an do correct compositing

[20:30:05.0000] <othermaciej>
with flash video, you're embedding a flash program that happens to play video

[20:31:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: plugins do not integrate with the page well -- you can't style them from css, they have all sorts of exciting compositing issues, they tend to be the most crash prone things on the web

[20:32:00.0000] <famicom>
agreed

[20:32:01.0000] <famicom>
but thats a whole other issue

[20:33:00.0000] <olliej>
um -- you've just effectively said "every reason that plugins are bad doesn't matter, what's wrong with plugins?"

[20:35:00.0000] <famicom>
no, im seperating markup from media-objects

[20:38:00.0000] <famicom>
because i sure as hell know that a lot of vendors won't  be implementing it in the way the specification discribes

[20:38:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: ?

[20:38:02.0000] <olliej>
famicom: <video> and <audio> need to be actual elements

[20:38:03.0000] <olliej>
famicom: they're not style information, they're semantic behaviour

[20:38:04.0000] <famicom>
explain the "need" for them

[20:39:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: they are also not generic content vehicles -- they don't allow you to use an arbitrary plugin -- they exist specifically for media, that the browser controls

[20:39:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: people want audio and video on the web, there is no standard way for them to do so without video and audio elements

[20:40:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: currently your only option is to use a proprietary plugin which does not interact with the webpage in any sane way, does not composite properly in the webpage, and cannot be styled with css

[20:40:01.0000] <famicom>
first of all, you cannot style audio:P

[20:41:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: well yes, but you can interact with it through a standard dom interface

[20:41:01.0000] <famicom>
secondly, whereas i understand the need for a standard for multimedia

[20:42:00.0000] <famicom>
i don't see why it should be so "specific"

[20:43:00.0000] <famicom>
or why it should be handled by the browser to begin with

[20:43:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: dammit, are you ignoring what i say deliberately?

[20:43:02.0000] <olliej>
famicom: plugins *cannot* compositie correctly with the page

[20:43:03.0000] <olliej>
famicom: they are entirely distinct

[20:43:04.0000] <famicom>
nor does multimedia

[20:44:00.0000] <famicom>
do you think lynx or elinks will ever be able to support it?

[20:44:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: nor does multiemedia what?

[20:44:02.0000] <famicom>
"qcompositie correctly with the page"

[20:44:03.0000] <olliej>
famicom: um? i take it you haven't actually played with the video tag at all then?

[20:45:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: because at least in webkit the video tag does composite correctly

[20:45:01.0000] <famicom>
your point being

[20:45:02.0000] <famicom>
just because it works in 1 single implementation, doesn't make it a good idea

[20:46:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: the whole point is it is specced to composite correctly

[20:46:01.0000] <famicom>
webkit also was the first implementation to pass the acid2 test

[20:46:02.0000] <olliej>
famicom: if it doesn't composite correctly in another implemetnation that is a bug in that implementation

[20:46:03.0000] <olliej>
famicom: and they will fix that

[20:46:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe that the Mozilla implementation of <video> also composites properly

[20:46:05.0000] <olliej>
famicom: however it is not actually possible to correctly composite plugins

[20:47:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: nor is it possible to colour correct them

[20:47:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: nor do they respect arbitrary transforms you can get with css transofrms, or through embedding in svg

[20:48:00.0000] <roc>
of course it composites properly

[20:48:01.0000] <roc>
it even plays nice in an SVG foreignObject with transforms, filters and the whole shebang

[20:49:00.0000] <olliej>
heya roc

[20:49:01.0000] <olliej>
i kind of assumed it would composite correctly, but didn't actually know for sure :D

[20:49:02.0000] <famicom>
well what about mobile browsers

[20:50:00.0000] <roc>
/me notes that olliej's complains about plugins apply only to *windowed* plugins, although for the sake of this argument, he's entirely on olliej's side

[20:50:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: video tag is preferable for a mobile browser as well

[20:50:02.0000] <olliej>
famicom: as it means less untrusted code running

[20:50:03.0000] <famicom>
ok

[20:51:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: note that all content from the web (JS, ActionScript, etc) == untrusted

[20:51:01.0000] <famicom>
so according to you, html is no longer about text, but about audio and video as well

[20:51:02.0000] <olliej>
ActionScript == untrusted code running in a closed off and proprietary vm

[20:51:03.0000] <famicom>
yeah, i hate flash as far as that goes

[20:51:04.0000] <olliej>
famicom: um, i haven't see you utter one complaint about the <img> tag

[20:52:00.0000] <famicom>
ollie, yup

[20:52:01.0000] <famicom>
because it exists, and that's it

[20:52:02.0000] <takkaria>
as soon as plugins were allowed, html was no longer about text, but about being an application platform

[20:52:03.0000] <olliej>
famicom: but i suspect you have basically gotten confused about semantics and style -- markup == semantic information, css = style information

[20:53:00.0000] <famicom>
not entirely

[20:53:01.0000] <olliej>
um yes

[20:53:02.0000] <olliej>
entirely

[20:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: however windowless plugins can be quite a bit slower than the browser providing the same functionality natively, in some cases

[20:53:04.0000] <roc>
yes

[20:53:05.0000] <famicom>
my problem, is that the video and audio tags are too specific

[20:54:00.0000] <olliej>
famicom: there are old tags that still exist that predate css for presentation, that's it

[20:54:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: how so?

[20:54:02.0000] <famicom>
you are basicly introducing a new set of font tags

[20:54:03.0000] <olliej>
no

[20:54:04.0000] <olliej>
goddammit

[20:54:05.0000] <olliej>
why do you not get this?

[20:54:06.0000] <olliej>
famicom: font == style

[20:54:07.0000] <olliej>
famicom: video == content

[20:54:08.0000] <olliej>
famicom: audio = content

[20:54:09.0000] <famicom>
because in 10 years time, i know that we will be able to embed 3d animations in webpages

[20:55:00.0000] <roc>
yeah, and then we'll create a new element

[20:55:01.0000] <olliej>
famicom: animation is presentation

[20:55:02.0000] <roc>
sometimes

[20:55:03.0000] <olliej>
famicom: webkit already supports transitions in css

[20:55:04.0000] <famicom>
so a 3d game is presentation

[20:55:05.0000] <famicom>
my ass it is

[20:55:06.0000] <famicom>
its a media object

[20:55:07.0000] <olliej>
famicom: canvas is technically able to provide a 3d context

[20:56:00.0000] <famicom>
so why add so many new tags

[20:56:01.0000] <olliej>
*sigh*

[20:56:02.0000] <olliej>
/me gives up

[20:56:03.0000] <takkaria>
give me a 't', give me an 'r', give me an 'o' 'l' 'l'

[20:56:04.0000] <roc>
good plan

[20:56:05.0000] <famicom>
adding more tags isnt going to solve it

[20:56:06.0000] <famicom>
just create one single tag, then give it meaning via attributes

[20:56:07.0000] <famicom>
<meta> allready does that

[20:57:00.0000] <roc>
yeah baby

[20:58:00.0000] <roc>
<tag type="h1"><tag type="p"><tag type="video">

[20:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
olliej: don't feed the trolls

[20:59:00.0000] <roc>
the big practical reason to introduce new tags is when new kinds of content need a specific API

[20:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: you probably shouldn't feed the trolls either

[21:01:00.0000] <roc>
This is important. Someone is *WRONG* on the Internet.

[21:02:00.0000] <famicom>
actually, im listening to roc

[21:02:01.0000] <olliej>
hehehe

[21:02:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej, olliej - so did I read correctly that the "Add to Home Screen" feature on the iPhone is implemented using ApplicationCache from HTML5?

[21:02:03.0000] <famicom>
plus, im listening to your arguments, because they all contain good points and some substance

[21:02:04.0000] <olliej>
i have no idea 

[21:03:00.0000] <famicom>
but was far as <tag type="h1"> goes

[21:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: when you "add to home screen", then if there is an HTML5 application cache manifest it takes effect

[21:03:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[21:03:03.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: we don't invent an application cache when none is specified

[21:03:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
sure, I understand that part

[21:03:05.0000] <famicom>
the <tag type="" would be redudant, because the < allready defines a tag

[21:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: all right, tell him how wrong he is

[21:05:00.0000] <famicom>
othermaciej please me more respectfull of other people's opinions

[21:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
famicom: roc is the one who said you were wrong!

[21:07:00.0000] <famicom>
othermaciej you once again confirmed it and reinforced it by adding the word "how"

[21:07:01.0000] <famicom>
it's all about semantics baby!

[21:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
famicom: I was being respectful of roc's opinion

[21:08:00.0000] <famicom>
hah, this is fun

[21:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
famicom: here is the short version of "why add new tags"

[21:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there are basically two reasons:

[21:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
1) To better express the semantics of Web documents and Web applications; the face of the Web has changed since 1998 when HTML 4.01 was published, and it is valuable to express the constructs of 2008-style Web sites, and not just what we had in 1998

[21:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
2) To add functionality and behavior that many agree should be a basic part of the open Web platform (such as multimedia support)

[21:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
given those goals, new tags are often a cleaner choice than new attributes on existing tags

[21:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and as you say yourself, it's the same amount of additions either way

[21:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so you may as well do it the cleaner way, with new tags

[21:12:01.0000] <famicom>
allright

[21:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML5 does also allow for extending semantics, using the class="" attribute and data- attributes

[21:12:03.0000] <famicom>
1

[21:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's unlikely that the main designers of HTML5 will be convinced that either of these goals is wrong, or that minimum number of tags is a more important goal

[21:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
most people working on HTML5 try to follow these Design Principles: http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/

[21:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I suggest reading it to get a feel for where HTML5 people are coming from

[21:15:01.0000] <famicom>
yup

[21:16:00.0000] <famicom>
right now im just checking the water for the generall attitude + where its coming from

[21:16:01.0000] <famicom>
people wise that is

[21:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it comes from acceptance of shared design goals

[21:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not so much from specific people

[21:29:00.0000] <famicom>
sure

[21:29:01.0000] <famicom>
in a perfect world perhaps

[21:29:02.0000] <famicom>
same as all wikipedia articles are written without a bias

[01:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
any recommendations of a mercurial tutorial for cvs/svn dummies?

[01:57:00.0000] <roc>
have you read the hgbook?

[01:57:01.0000] <roc>
it's very good

[01:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: I haven't. thanks

[02:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, so currently the sync stuff and the async stuff happily uses the same path, I guess if I used event loops that would all have to if/elsed :/

[02:42:00.0000] <olliej>
sigh

[02:42:01.0000] <olliej>
the number of people who think gears is a good thing saddens me

[02:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: so it's not sync, it's just that you don't define when the events fire :-)

[02:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: what is it they think is good?

[02:43:01.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: things that html5 supports

[02:43:02.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: especially the offline storage stuff

[02:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
so what's the problem with people thinking html is good?

[02:44:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: it will be good when we have safari and firefox release versions that simultaneously support all the offline storage stuff

[02:44:01.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: it's people promoting gears

[02:44:02.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: rather saying ooh look here's this standard and non-proprietary equivalent

[02:45:00.0000] <roc>
the funny thing is that as far as I can tell, Firefox and Safari have greater market penetration than Gears

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused by what you consider to be "gears", but that's maybe because the project has changed direction so many times that i don't know what it means anymore :-)

[02:45:02.0000] <olliej>
roc: yeah i know

[02:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
last i heard, gears was just supporting html5

[02:45:04.0000] <olliej>
roc: i suspect safari 3.1 alone has more market share

[02:46:00.0000] <olliej>
and it supports at least the database stuff

[02:46:01.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: it provides a different api

[02:46:02.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: people code to that api

[02:46:03.0000] <olliej>
and suddenly your site is dependent on an extension

[02:46:04.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, it's not entirely clear to me how to do that, for instance, the UA needs to schedule a set of events during a sync request that are handled directly after the request, just before the method returns

[02:46:05.0000] <olliej>
/me is still depressed that chrome has actively marketed gears rather than the standards that they turned off

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: if it's handled before the method returns, it's handled during the method call, and you can just define it as part of the algorithm

[02:47:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, but you're saying i need to add if/else for the async case then?

[02:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
because the method call returns earlier for that, but the rest is the same...

[02:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: there is certainly inertia behind existing APIs that Gears supports (and has to continue supporting), just like there is inertia behind safari's extensions

[02:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: but so long as we all converge on the long term, i don't see a problem

[02:48:03.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: yes, but to actively turn off standards support seems somewhat hokey to me

[02:49:00.0000] <olliej>
oh well

[02:49:01.0000] <olliej>
the past is the past

[02:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: i'm not aware of anything that was turned off (though there were things that won't ported)

[02:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
weren't, even

[02:49:04.0000] <annevk2>
I thought maciej said turning those things on required additional effort

[02:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
though that's just a scheduling issue

[02:49:06.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: client side databases are supported in the webkit revision chrome is based off

[02:49:07.0000] <othermaciej>
olliej: they chose to do work to integrate Gears and did not choose to do work to make WebKit's existing HTML5 Database support work

[02:49:08.0000] <olliej>
which is the wrong way round

[02:49:09.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: not multiprocess, they're not

[02:50:00.0000] <olliej>
othermaciej: they claim to be trying to deprecate gears yet it was a major advertising point

[02:50:01.0000] <annevk2>
seems a bit too early to tell whether Chrome is evil with respect to standards

[02:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: sure, because google had properties that used that API. that's just sensible.

[02:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
olliej: I am not sure all of Google is of one mind about this

[02:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me shrugs

[02:50:05.0000] <othermaciej>
debating it here also does not seem fruitful

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wasn't really aware of _any_ advertising for chrome, let alone advertising in favour of gears over standards

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
like i said, last i heard, gears was just working on html5 stuff

[02:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think more than bundling Gears, the prominent mention of Gears in the marketing campaign was what seemed weird

[02:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: doesn't using the HTML5 stuff in Chrome require access via a gears-specific object?

[02:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so to migrate sites, the sites need to change

[02:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Chrome doesn't have any HTML5 stuff

[02:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
or at least

[02:52:04.0000] <othermaciej>
not the Gears-equivalent HTML5 things

[02:52:05.0000] <othermaciej>
(not <video> or <audio> either which were in the version of WebKit their are based on)

[02:52:06.0000] <hsivonen>
I meant HTML5 stuff as implemented by gears

[02:53:00.0000] <roc>
the interesting question is really when, if ever, Google properties will use HTML5 APIs instead of Gears APIs where they overlap

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it's not html5 stuff if it's not as per the spec. but i don't think anything has shipped since they said they were giving up on their own apis and making html5 stuff only

[02:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
they have legacy Gears APIs provided by a bundled Gears extension that you access through a Gears-specific object with Gears-specific APIs

[02:53:03.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. I though they had the HTML5 API with a non-standard entry point

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it's not html5 if it has a non-standard entry point

[02:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
their APIs fail to match in ways other than the entry point

[02:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it's like saying fruit juice is "water" :-)

[02:54:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thought some Google presentation video suggested a copy of the HTML5 api might appear under a non-standard entry point

[02:54:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(so porting Google properties from Gears APIs to standard APIs might be nontrivial)

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: oh, that's possible

[02:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: well, it's not standard if you need a non-standard entry point, but there's still a practical difference between obtaining a standard interface in a non-standard way and obtaining a non-standard interface in a non-standard way

[02:55:02.0000] <annevk2>
othermaciej, btw, I saw somewhere a comment to the effect that Chrome was pre-Safari 3.1

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[02:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me goes back to trying to work out what <select> is

[02:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
is there some kind of chart of all WebKit forks/branches relative to Safari?

[02:56:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe they have a version of WebKit based on the same as the one that is in Safari 3.1

[02:56:04.0000] <othermaciej>
*had

[02:56:05.0000] <othermaciej>
for their initial release

[02:56:06.0000] <othermaciej>
with some selected changes from newer WebKit revisions backported

[02:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and some advanced features left disabled, since they had not implemented the back end

[02:57:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, from what other Google employees told me Gears will always need the non-standard entry point, but hopefully you're right

[02:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the ones I am aware of are Web Fonts, <audio>/<video>, HTML5 database, and text-shadow

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: when did you hear that?

[02:58:01.0000] <annevk2>
othermaciej, http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1533#c1 says pre-Safari 3.1 (via http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/ )

[02:58:02.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, last week at The Ajax Experience; I believe from Brad Neuberg

[02:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, i should speak to brad. that's not what i had understood.

[03:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: engineers from the Chrome team have told me it was essentially the same as what was in 3.1 (though 3.1 has had security updates)

[03:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: their current trunk is now only a month behind WebKit trunk though

[03:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe the general plan is to get completely in sync and do WebKit work out of webkit.org

[03:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
nice

[03:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway what Google does with their Web properties once at least one release browser supports the HTML5 versions of all three of the original core Gears features will show what they really think of standards more so than what they chose to do with Chrome or Gears

[03:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
IMO

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://google.com/privacy/ already uses html5, as do a number of other google sites

[03:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
the bigger properties will take proportionally longer

[03:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if the Nokia Widget platform version of WebKit is the same as in their S60 Browser

[03:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
does that use any HTML5 features other than the doctype?

[03:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think it uses anything that wasn't valid in html4 other than the doctype and the charset declaration

[03:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that's not really the point

[03:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's very little that wasn't in html4 that works reliably in IE yet

[03:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
and that's the target, along with the other major browsers

[03:08:01.0000] <roc>
there isn't much enthusiasm for implementing the HTML5 SQL stuff in Gecko  so I don't think we'll be able to test Google's goodness anytime soon

[03:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, we'll see what happens once workers and appcache are in a shipping Safari then

[03:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
since it seems most likely to hit the trifecta first

[03:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
we should convert webkit.org to html5

[03:09:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but that will require wrestling with wordpress for some of it

[03:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I gotta go to bed

[03:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[03:10:01.0000] <roc>
Hixie: the thing is, arguments about the importance of supporting IE+gears are a little flat when IE+Gears has much lower market penetration than Firefox+Safari

[03:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: change from http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/03/07/Design-By-Attrition#c1205011800 ?

[03:11:00.0000] <roc>
Perhaps. I have no idea who Hixie was referring to.

[03:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: the argument is about supporting IE alone

[03:13:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: note that below, sayrer says "I don’t think my employer supported it. Can you point to evidence of this, ..." ... and none is forthcoming

[03:14:00.0000] <om_sleep>
Apple representatives (including me) supported the idea of all Gears features being part of Web standards so they could be implemented by browsers

[03:14:01.0000] <roc>
/me himself does not object to SQL in HTML5

[03:14:02.0000] <om_sleep>
I don't believe we were specific as to which standard they should be in

[03:14:03.0000] <om_sleep>
this was in response to being asked to bundle Gears with various Apple products

[03:15:00.0000] <om_sleep>
to which we said no

[03:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't recall who it was who was pushing for sql from the mozilla side of things

[03:16:00.0000] <om_sleep>
I do not really see the problem with a SQL API being available to Web content, or why anyone who wants a strong and competitive Web platform would be against it

[03:16:01.0000] <om_sleep>
I believe it is easier to implement than either the appcache or Workers

[03:16:02.0000] <roc>
the problem is the lack of definition of exactly what SQL it is

[03:17:00.0000] <roc>
saying it's whatever SQLite does is problematic

[03:17:01.0000] <roc>
well, that's one problem

[03:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that is true, but it's hard to define exactly what SQL is, and unwise (it seems to me) to withhold the feature until someone does that work

[03:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
my plan is to spec the common subset of the first two implementations

[03:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
so the first two implementations, whatever they are, get to decide what the language is

[03:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
at least saying that one must bundle SQLite would be better than not saying so but bundling SQLite being de facto required anyway

[03:18:03.0000] <roc>
I'm not the right person to have this conversation since I'm not actually objecting to it

[03:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you did bring it up though

[03:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
prior to that, Gecko plans vis-a-vis the HTML5 SQL API were not a topic of conversation

[03:22:00.0000] <roc>
I thought the information might be relevant, even though I can't fully explain it. Sorry.

[03:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be valuable if whoever at Mozilla has concerns were to communicate them, as it would help improve HTML5

[03:23:01.0000] <virtuelv>
othermaciej: any particular reason why additional arguments to the TimerHandler are unspecified?

[03:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
virtuelv: the handleTimer method doesn't get any arguments besides the TImer

[03:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: btw you may be interested in this proposal I made for a high resolution (and otherwise improved) timer API: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2008OctDec/0009.html

[03:24:02.0000] <virtuelv>
othermaciej: I realised that, my question is more one of "shouldn't it"?

[03:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
virtuelv: I know setTimeout (at least in Gecko and WebKit, but not in IE) will pass extra arguments that were given to setTimeout to the callback function

[03:25:01.0000] <virtuelv>
startTimer(1,true,fade,$('myElement'))

[03:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
virtuelv: I don't think that's a particularly great feature

[03:25:03.0000] <virtuelv>
othermaciej: so does opera, btw

[03:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
startTimer(1,true, function() { fade($('myElement')); });

[03:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or if your JS library has support for making a thunk out of a function bound to arguments, then use that

[03:27:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm not sure I enjoy that syntax very much, though

[03:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not deeply philosophically against it or anything, it just seems a little odd and makes the API hard to extend

[03:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well that's the sort of thing you normally have to do for DOM API callbacks

[03:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
like events

[03:28:01.0000] <virtuelv>
othermaciej: how about: Timer startTimer(in double delay, in Boolean repeat, in TimerHandler handler, in Array argumentlist)

[03:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
virtuelv: that doesn't seem better than just passing along the extra arguments

[03:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
from the people who do lots of web development who have reviewed this API I have not really gotten requests to support the extra-args thing

[03:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm with maciej, the argument passing form of setTimeout is poor API design

[03:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
(as is the string form)

[03:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the string form is lame too, yes

[03:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
But you'll get memory leaks in IE if you use closures :-(

[03:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
saves you a few characters in exchange for losing syntax checking and lexical scope, and effectively invoking eval

[03:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: you won't be able to use this API in IE anyway

[03:32:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: proposal sounds OK with the revisions suggested in the thread. But I don't think this is the ultimate solution for JS animations

[03:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: animations are not the primary use case for this

[03:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(IMO)

[03:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
true zero-delay timers are the most important use case

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
are we sure we can't repurpose setTimeout() for those? maybe with some backoff logic in setTimeout() to prevent cpu hogging?

[03:34:00.0000] <roc>
that use case would be served by a single API equivalent to setTimeout(0)

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
it seems like whatever caused setTimeout() to end up with a clamp will end up happening to this API too

[03:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
(i.e. I don't see anything that shows lessons having been learnt from setTimeout's clamp)

[03:35:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: setTimeout/setInterval is, as othermaciej already noted in the proposal an ugly api

[03:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: WebKit already has setTimeout(0) as initially 0 with backoff logic

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so what's the problem?

[03:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the webkit.org version of WebKit

[03:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well apparently the Chrome folks found use cases where lowering the clamp was very helpful despite that

[03:36:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(though I have yet to hear citations of real sites)

[03:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: an existing ugly API is better than a redundant clean API with an ugly API as well

[03:36:05.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I did propose the even-more-minimal callSoon()

[03:37:00.0000] <roc>
so it's a tricky situation ... the API seems OK, but it's not ideal for any of its use cases, except I think use case #3 where you clearly have to have a new interface and a Timer object

[03:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: well we would presumably need more information on exactly what those cases are to determine if we have satisfied the use cases

[03:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the Chrome folks seem more interested in changing the clamp to different values than doing a clear study of the benefits and costs of changing setTimeout in various ways

[03:37:03.0000] <annevk2>
if it's just for having a real 0 initially, I believe Opera has that too

[03:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
a new API is the one thing I personally am sure will not break compatibility

[03:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(I'm also pretty sure starting with real 0 and ramping up for nested setTimeout calls is safe, but it doesn't help the case of significantly long-running work that wants to drop back to the event loop often)

[03:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
well without data we definitely shouldn't write a spec

[03:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the API I proposed has other improvements besides zero-delay

[03:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
namely telling you true time elapsed and making it easy to reset a timer's time

[03:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me just wants a "draw the next frame to this canvas as fast as possible, but don't bother going faster than the monitor refresh rate" function, and setTimeout doesn't work in practice since it's too slow and you can't tell precisely how much time has elapsed between frames

[03:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
which I am told are common use cases in real Web apps

[03:41:00.0000] <roc>
can't you tell how much time has elapsed using "new Date()"?

[03:42:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I can agree with the string form being ugly

[03:42:01.0000] <virtuelv>
roc: new Date() is actually quite slow

[03:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: If I remember correctly, that was limited to 16ms precision in some(/most/all?) browsers on Windows

[03:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: sure, if you saved the date at the time you started the timer or that it last fired

[03:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: some

[03:43:03.0000] <virtuelv>
roc: certain windows mobile implementations limit you to 1000ms

[03:43:04.0000] <roc>
virtuelv, Philip`: those are fixable bugs that don't require new API

[03:43:05.0000] <virtuelv>
(yes, really)

[03:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: If they do get fixed without a new API, I'd be happy :-)

[03:44:01.0000] <roc>
but thanks, that answers my question

[03:44:02.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: perhaps we could have a vsync callback :)

[03:44:03.0000] <roc>
onpaint

[03:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
virtuelv: this function is a handy way to bind arguments in a way that works for any callback API

[03:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
function bindArgs(f)

[03:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
{

[03:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);

[03:45:04.0000] <othermaciej>
    return function() { f.apply(null, args); }

[03:45:05.0000] <othermaciej>
}

[03:45:06.0000] <othermaciej>
(though I guess you can't get any real args passed to the callback that way)

[03:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: That's probably bad, because if it takes 1/59s to render the frame and the vsync rate is 60Hz, it'd only render at 30fps if each frame is locked to the vsync, which is uglier than rendering at 59fps and skipping one frame a second

[03:46:01.0000] <virtuelv>
/me points at the smiley

[03:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
vsync only works if you're pretty certain you're always going to be rendering faster than that

[03:47:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the high-resolution timer stuff is moot for the next couple of years anyway

[03:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
virtuelv: this version is better:

[03:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
function bindArgs(f)

[03:47:03.0000] <othermaciej>
{

[03:47:04.0000] <othermaciej>
    var savedArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);

[03:47:05.0000] <othermaciej>
    return function() { f.apply(null, Array.prototype.concat.call(arguments, savedArgs)); }

[03:47:06.0000] <othermaciej>
}

[03:47:07.0000] <othermaciej>
(completely untested though)

[03:48:00.0000] <virtuelv>
othermaciej: I can live with the closure

[03:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
what kind of black magic is Array.prototype.concat.call

[03:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh is this because arguments isn't an Array?

[03:48:03.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah

[03:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
but it's "generic" enough to work with Array methods?

[03:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you can write that a lot more simply if you prototype-hack arguments to have slice and concat on its prototype

[03:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me mumbles something about multimethods and interfaces and superior languages

[03:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe ES3.1 proposes to make arguments support the Array prototype methods

[03:49:03.0000] <othermaciej>
which would make that a lot simpler to write

[03:49:04.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: my perception is that browsers struggle getting anything over 30-40 fps anyhow for anything reasonably complex

[03:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
making bindArgs take an array of extra arguments would make it a bit simpler too

[03:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: Chrome gets >100fps on Canvex, which is reasonably complex

[03:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
but that's only possible because they stopped clamping setTimeout (or setInterval or whatever it is)

[03:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
they reduced the clamp on both of those to 1ms

[03:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
they will be trying 4ms next

[03:53:02.0000] <virtuelv>
they also got "yelled" at by Intel for the 1ms timeout, no?

[03:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, it's more the technique they use to achieve timer precision at all

[03:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
on Windows, to get accurate timers, you have to make a system call that increases the whole system's power consumption

[03:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
at least on XP

[03:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
because Microsoft can't code their way out of a wet paper bag

[03:54:04.0000] <othermaciej>
the webkit.org version of WebKit also does the timer accuracy thing, but we only leave it on while short delay timers are pending

[03:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(and for a little after, for hysteresis)

[03:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and no one has complained

[03:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(on Windows that is; on Mac and Linux there's no need for such nonsense to get accurate timers)

[03:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like a complex optimisation problem, with performance on one axis and getting-yelled-at-by-other-developers on the other

[03:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not that hard

[03:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
most sites do not have short-delay timers on all the time, at least not on purpose

[03:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's really the way of working around the suckiness of Windows that needs finesse

[03:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and SafariWin does not drain battery like Chrome does in that regard

[03:58:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: canvas is one thing, DOM manipulation is another

[03:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: DOM is boring, so canvas is the only thing I'm interested in :-)

[04:16:00.0000] <virtuelv>
speaking of canvas, will anything come of Sjoerd's proposal?

[04:19:00.0000] <olliej>
virtuelv: given there has been absolutely no form of consensus it's hard to say

[04:19:01.0000] <virtuelv>
context.fillStyle = imageData.slice(0,3) seems handy

[04:20:00.0000] <olliej>
virtuelv: imageData.data.slice isn't valid -- CanvasPixelArray is not an Array (although i suppose it could be)

[04:20:01.0000] <olliej>
virtuelv: but that's not actually a real use case

[04:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: Handiness seems irrelevant, since you can just write a function to convert whatever data structure you have into a rgb(...) string

[04:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
olliej: though you could rebind slice to apply

[04:20:04.0000] <olliej>
virtuelv: the specific issue that we're looking at is the need to convert a numberic colour representation in to an rgb() string

[04:20:05.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: and it'd be slower than neccesary

[04:20:06.0000] <othermaciej>
Array.prototype.slice.call(imageData.data, 0, 3)

[04:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wouldn't be very fast

[04:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
making and parsing the string is a waste

[04:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
and fillStyle = rgb(1, 0, 0) (where 'rgb' converts to string) is no harder to write than fillStyle = [1, 0, 0] and also is more flexible since you can do HSL and everything

[04:21:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think being able to pass 4 rgba values separately would be useful, but I can't say for sure how common it is to have an rgb triple or rgba quad that's not already in an array

[04:21:04.0000] <Philip`>
so it seems performance is the only real concern

[04:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
before we start adding APIs to canvas to do microsecond optimisations, lets see about getting the rest of the spec implemented

[04:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
What's the shortest string that can be appended to any prefix of a well-formed XML document, to make it ill-formed?

[04:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
(e.g. if I'm serialising to XML and then at some arbitrary point decide that I want to stop (e.g. because of an error) and make sure the output is not well-formed, and just have an opportunity to print some string onto the end to make sure it won't be accidentally parseable)

[04:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Random guess, ]]>\0

[04:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[04:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
Even just \0 should do it

[04:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
because that doesn't seem to be allowed even in CDATA blocks

[04:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's simpler than I expected - thanks :-)

[05:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually, I don't know why I was thinking it was a problem - I could just add some plain text (like "Error") onto the end, and it'll never be well-formed

[06:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Urgh... How can I make a web service that accepts HTML and returns equivalent XHTML, without making the site vulnerable to XSS attacks when external sites make users post forms to the service?

[06:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Would it be safe to require the request content-type to be text/html, and hope that nobody implements the bit of HTML4 that says <form enctype=text/html> should send content-type: text/html?

[06:05:01.0000] <annevk2>
what is the vulnerability?

[06:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, actually, HTML4 doesn't really say it should send with text/html - it's explicitly unspecified behaviour)

[06:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: The problem is <form method=post action=http://mysite/html-to-xhtml/ enctype=multipart/form-data><input name=x value="<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"><input type=submit></form> which would execute the script in my domain, since the service returns application/xhtml+xml content

[06:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh, you should run uch a service on its own domain I think

[06:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's ugly, so I don't want to do that

[06:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
And I can't even think of one domain name yet, so I'm just using the IP address :-p

[06:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
well, it's also necessary as far as I can tell to protect yourself

[06:11:01.0000] <annevk2>
I might be able to give you some subdomain of html5.org, iirc I set DNS for subdomains in some way

[06:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd be happier to just require the request to be text/html, since that seems to work in practice as far as I can tell

[06:17:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh, you require POST?

[06:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[06:17:02.0000] <annevk2>
that helps, yes

[06:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(GET requests don't even get sent to the same server process)

[06:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm making this slightly awkward on purpose, because that's more educational)

[06:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: XSS concern was the reason why I haven't offered the service as part of parsetree.validator.nu

[06:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
actually, livedom.validator.nu has the same XSS exposure

[06:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so the actual concern is that running an open proxy might attract the wrong kind of attention

[06:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
I require the content to be sent in the request, rather than sending a URL that the service downloads, which should prevent that proxy behaviour

[06:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and also prevents many DOS attacks, since it avoids multiplying the attacker's effort)

[07:17:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me grmbls at "event loop"

[07:18:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me wonders if he should copy "fetch" from HTML5 too

[07:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
I like HTML5 defining all this stuff, but architecturally it's a bit of a mess, but maybe that's ok

[07:23:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk2: I still want the ByteArray

[07:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
virtuelv, me too! :)

[07:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
oops, fetch assumes async

[09:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, yo?

[09:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, I'm wondering whether "remove cache entries" should remove everything regardless of "credentials flag" or not

[09:32:01.0000] <annevk2>
weinig, ^^

[10:31:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, hm

[10:31:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, i don't implement the remove stuff yet, so haven't thought about it

[10:31:02.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, seems like the safest is to remove more rather than less

[10:31:03.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, should be a rare case anyway that something is removed, right?

[10:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. it seems that HTML fragments in Gecko get an ancestor chain of context instead of just a parent

[10:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if it makes any difference in practice

[11:06:00.0000] <sicking>
hsivonen, IMHO we should do neither

[11:06:01.0000] <sicking>
hsivonen, but yes, we build the whole chain

[11:06:02.0000] <sicking>
hsivonen, partially because the parser is built to parse whole documents

[11:10:00.0000] <sicking>
hsivonen, actually, this is something that we should chat about, seeing that you are quite experienced with parsing HTML5 at this point :)

[11:11:00.0000] <sicking>
hsivonen, in which cases does it actually make a difference to use the parent as a context, vs. using no context?

[11:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It's a bit annoying that the tokeniser has a finally{} block that calls endDocument on the contentHandler which might be an XmlSerializer which calls writer.close(), because that closes the output stream and prevents me writing some error notification after an exception was thrown from the parser

[12:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, yeah, it's a rare case

[12:33:01.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, basically, when things don't go as expected

[12:33:02.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, right, so nuke it all IMHO

[12:33:03.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, btw, is 'with credentials' part of the primary key now?

[12:34:00.0000] <annevk2>
ok, I'll leave it as is then, although I might inline "remove cache entries" at some point

[12:34:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, (or intended to be)

[12:34:02.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, I haven't checked that change in

[12:34:03.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, I was waiting for you to see what to do with "remove cache entries" before making that change

[12:34:04.0000] <sicking>
ok

[12:34:05.0000] <sicking>
so what is the intent after you have checked in?

[12:35:00.0000] <annevk2>
that it's part of the primary key

[12:35:01.0000] <sicking>
sweet

[12:36:00.0000] <annevk2>
the optimization for non credentialed requests doesn't seem worth the effort

[12:36:01.0000] <sicking>
agreed

[12:36:02.0000] <sicking>
the alternative is to specify the semantic meaning of the various headers

[12:36:03.0000] <sicking>
and then let the spec cache as it pleases

[12:36:04.0000] <sicking>
err

[12:37:00.0000] <sicking>
and then let the spec implementation as it pleases

[12:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
I rather have it like this it's crystal clear what is to be done

[12:39:01.0000] <sicking>
ok

[13:17:00.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, I checked in the change for allowing HEAD and made the credentials flag part of the primary key

[13:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://econym.org.uk/gmap/chrome.htm#winding correct criticism?

[13:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
came from this thread: http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Maps-API/browse_thread/thread/562c3614e8ba034c

[13:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: i'd love for this stuff to be in its own spec

[13:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: easiest way to avoid xss problems is to avoid having anything on the domain that is valuable

[13:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: But I always complain about other people's XSS holes even when they're revealing no data of any value whatsoever, so I mustn't have the same problem on my own site

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
Content-Disposition might be a solution then

[13:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
or returning the data as the wrong mime type

[13:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there a practical problem if I require the request to be text/html? (I can't see any way to send that via a <form>)

[13:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and if someone changes HTML or browsers in the future so they can send text/html, that's their fault for introducing security vulnerabilities in perfectly adequate web sites)

[13:36:01.0000] <annevk2>
if that happens it would require Access Control opt in for cross-site requests

[13:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's zcorpan's e-mail address again?

[13:37:01.0000] <annevk2>
simonp⊙oc

[13:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: wf2 has a mechanism to upload arbitary files, but i've removed that feature in html5

[13:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: thx

[13:39:00.0000] <csarven>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#the-address-element "Typically, the address element would be included with other information in a footer element."  -- How was this determined?

[13:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[13:41:00.0000] <csarven>
The "typical" bit.

[13:41:01.0000] <csarven>
Is that based on verifiable data or just a conjecture?

[13:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
conjecture

[13:43:01.0000] <csarven>
I would venture to say that a good chunk of <address> data is used in the header along with the site logo.

[13:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
i imagine that happens too

[13:44:01.0000] <csarven>
I'm actually trying to reverify this: http://www.csarven.ca/logo-identity-in-address-and-document-heading#address_for_documents_contact_information

[13:46:00.0000] <csarven>
Hixie Got an opinion on that (or the whole article)? Agree/disagree?

[13:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
logos don't really seem to belong there

[13:46:02.0000] <csarven>
In any case, I would suggest to rewrite the part that suggests where <address> may "typically" occur.

[13:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
but otherwise sure

[13:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
by the time the spec is done, that sentence will hopefully be true :-)

[13:48:00.0000] <csarven>
I tend to agree that <img> is a bit misplaced there

[13:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Hmm, I suppose the ability to upload arbitrary files could be a useful feature, so I might as well support it and not make it be an XSS hole, since Content-Disposition seems like an adequately non-evil way of preventing browsers executing scripts from the response, so that sounds good :-)

[13:49:00.0000] <csarven>
Which is not so good as microformats are concerned since doing <address class="vcard"> and <img class="logo"> goes along pretty well as far as hCard is concerned.

[13:49:01.0000] <erlehmann>
WHAT

[13:50:00.0000] <csarven>
erlehmann Directed at me?

[13:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: :-)

[13:51:01.0000] <erlehmann>
csarven: so, only for fun ;)

[14:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmph, Firefox (3) doesn't accept xhr.open('POST', '')

[14:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE, it says)

[14:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://92.243.11.39/html-to-xhtml/ - hooray, it's a thing

[14:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
It would be a pretty pointless thing, except the point was to encourage me to set up the server and it has mostly succeeded at that

[14:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
But I still need a witty domain name

[14:30:01.0000] <csarven>
Philip` <link> gets translated to <link></link>

[14:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
csarven: That's intentional

[14:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
(hsivonen's intent, in particular)

[14:31:02.0000] <csarven>
Oh alright, I suppose true for all empty/null elements? Appears to be for <img> as well.

[14:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes - the serialiser always simply emits a start tag, then the (possibly empty) content, then the end tag

[14:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is a perfectly valid way to serialise XML, even if it's a bit weird :-)

[14:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
The inability to return a 500/etc error code after you've started sending the response seems like an unfortunate missing feature in HTTP :-(

[14:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
(unless it's a feature that exists but I've failed to notice)

[14:40:00.0000] <csarven>
Hixie Perhaps it can be argued that <img> *is* contextually valid inside <address>, since it provides contact information for the document. That is, the image (photo/logo) outlines what the entity looks like - which is a form of identifying an entity in order to communicate.

[14:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: i suppose it could also be argued that the whole document belongs in <address> since it provides a way to recognise the document, which is a form of identity...?

[14:42:00.0000] <csarven>
iff the information in the rest of the document is 'about' the identity.

[14:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
the idea of <address> is to put contact information in there... the less information ends up there the better, since that way it's very clear.

[14:44:00.0000] <csarven>
microformats touched on this with 'representative hCard's as it distinguishes an identity that is outlined in <address> from the author or contact information of the page.

[14:47:00.0000] <csarven>
I understand the argument about keeping it clear and focusing on common contact information like email, phone, physical address (iff need to contact by snail mail), however, the argument also works for existing practises in the wild where an entity stamps itself not just with that information but also with its logo/photo. In a way, logo/photo is not easily separated.

[14:48:00.0000] <csarven>
As I've mentioned earlier, the typical placement of <address> information can be found anywhere (e.g., header)

[14:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me shrugs

[14:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wish we could just drop <address> altogether

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
typically though i have most often seen that element in the footer of pages

[14:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i think that makes sense

[14:53:00.0000] <csarven>
I agree to some extent, however, it is very common to find a site put up its logo and contact information at the top of the page. If this is treated as <address> then they don't have to repeat this information at the bottom of the page.

[14:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me grumbles about IE having select.options === select

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: they don't have to repeat that information even if they don't use address

[14:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: they don't have to use address

[14:55:00.0000] <csarven>
Ok, let's put this aside for a sec and look into two things and perhaps they can reveal some insight.

[14:55:01.0000] <csarven>
1. Do we agre that logos should use <img> ?

[14:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
as opposed to what?

[14:55:03.0000] <csarven>
CSS

[14:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
either is fine

[14:56:00.0000] <csarven>
Well, placing a logo in CSS doesn't help much when you try to print the document.

[14:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[14:56:02.0000] <csarven>
Plus it is not for decoration and rather content oriented.

[14:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[14:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
depends on how it is used

[14:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
the logo on damowmow.com is decorative

[14:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
as is the logo on damowmow.com/portal

[14:57:01.0000] <csarven>
How so? You have it in <img> as opposed to CSS.

[14:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's fundamentally very little difference between having  <img alt="..." src=x>  and having  <span>...</span>  with  span { content: url(x); }

[14:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's an <img> on damowmow.com/ and in CSS on damowmow.com/portal/

[14:59:00.0000] <csarven>
I disagree because if an image is for decoration (as opposed to having contextual meaning in the document) then it should be in CSS, no?

[15:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't really matter

[15:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
if it's page-specific, it's easier to have it in the markup

[15:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
if it's site-wide, the css

[15:00:03.0000] <csarven>
If you identify yourself with the cat, then that is your logo. That is your branding. It is not just for illustration for the page because the cat has a meaning.

[15:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
coca cola identifies itself with the colour red, that is its branding. does that mean we should put the red into the markup?

[15:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
you are attempting to layer black-and-white requirements on a fuzzy and judgement-call-laden area.

[15:02:01.0000] <csarven>
Of course not. The colour red is part of their brand guidelines. The 'logo' is the whole (the name 'coca-cola' and the red and white..). Coca-cola doesn't brand itself out only with the colour red.

[15:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
google brands itself using a specific sequence of colours on the letters of words using a specific font

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
to the point where a random word, without the word "google" anywhere, using the right font and colours, can be immediately identified as google-related

[15:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
should we use <font color face> for such words?

[15:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
<googleword>Apple</googleword>

[15:05:01.0000] <csarven>
No we should not because as part of their guidelines, the logo (image, typography, sizes, objects...) is unique.

[15:06:00.0000] <csarven>
In order to be consistent and maintain that on all platforms, they need to use an image.

[15:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are many cases where we don't care if it doesn't turn out quite right

[15:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
especially on our intranet site

[15:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
in such cases there is no image

[15:07:00.0000] <csarven>
That's fine, but that is part Google's branding guidelines, that is, they are not that strict.

[15:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
ian.hixie.ch's header shows something similar

[15:07:02.0000] <csarven>
Which is not the case for many orgs.

[15:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
my point is that this is not clear cut

[15:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
and people should use their judgement when deciding what to put in css and what to put in html

[15:08:00.0000] <csarven>
I think logos need to preserved and be consistent and match the guidelines of the org as far as what is allowed and not allowed.

[15:08:01.0000] <csarven>
If consistency is not an issue for an org, sure, CSS will do.

[15:09:00.0000] <csarven>
In all other cases, <img> is more appropriate IMHO.

[15:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
you're not going to get much more consistency from img than from css

[15:11:00.0000] <csarven>
2. (Let's say we are using <img> for logos for the sake of this discussion) Can we agree that <h1><img></h1> is inappropriate since the document is not 'about' the contents of the image. (e.g., If I'm writing an article about cats, it should say something like <h1>I love cats</h1> instead of having <h1><img></h1>)

[15:13:00.0000] <csarven>
Here, I'm talking about the proper use of <h1>.

[15:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
depends what the img src is

[15:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
<h1><img src="googlelogo.png" alt="Google"></h1> is quite appropriate

[15:15:01.0000] <csarven>
Agreed, for that case.

[15:16:00.0000] <csarven>
http://damowmow.com is okay too in that case.

[15:17:00.0000] <csarven>
I'm referring to an ordinary document... say a blog post, a wiki page.

[15:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
<h1><img src="wikipedia.png" alt="Wikipedia"></h1> seems fine too

[15:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
also <h1><img src="blogheader.png" alt="Hixie's Natural Log"></h1>

[15:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
in all these caes, it would be fine to just replace the text with an image using CSS, too

[15:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
where are you going with this?

[15:18:02.0000] <csarven>
Is the rest of the document *about* "Wikipedia"?

[15:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
no, the <h1> here is the site header

[15:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
the <h2> would be the page header

[15:19:00.0000] <csarven>
Site header?

[15:19:01.0000] <csarven>
Why would <h1> speak for the rest of the site as opposed to the current document?

[15:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
how else do you give a site header?

[15:19:03.0000] <csarven>
Can you give me an example of a 'side header' content?

[15:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
imagine the site as one big page, which was then chopped into multiple smaller pages

[15:19:05.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[15:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
csarven: It's the highest level header. The fact that it applies to more than just that page is irrelevant

[15:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
the html5 spec's multipage version

[15:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
On an unrelated note, I'm amazed people haven't bitched about all the @id in HTML 5 changing

[15:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(or at least, not that I've heard)

[15:21:02.0000] <csarven>
Hixie "<h1>HTML 5</h1>" ?

[15:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: one person bitched to me privately because it totally broke the multipage links

[15:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: right

[15:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: But only one person?

[15:22:01.0000] <csarven>
IMO, that should have been marked as: <h1>HTML 5 <span>Draft Recommendation � 6 October 2008</span></h1>

[15:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: so far

[15:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: well, the <div class="head"> should be a <header>, but that's another problem

[15:23:02.0000] <csarven>
The reason is simply because when I'm about to read a document, <h1> should indicate what I'm about to read.

[15:23:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hasn't it broken single-page links just as much as multipage links?

[15:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yes

[15:23:05.0000] <Philip`>
since in both cases it'll just go to the top of the page, not the desired target

[15:23:06.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: but the guy got a 404 and complained

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
because the page filenames changed too

[15:24:01.0000] <csarven>
Hixie Just to be sure, you were referring to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/ correct?

[15:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: yes

[15:24:03.0000] <csarven>
Is that document used in <object> elsewhere?

[15:24:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Oh, I thought it was set up so 404 pages would redirect you

[15:24:05.0000] <csarven>
Either way, I don't understand what 'site header' means.

[15:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: only if the fragment identifier is recognised

[15:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Argh, fragment-links.js is broken

[15:25:02.0000] <csarven>
Hixie Perhaps 'Site header' should be handled by <title>?

[15:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: a header that applies to multiple pages

[15:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: this is all already discussed in the spec, i don't see anything wrong with what's there currently

[15:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: what problem are you trying to solve?

[15:26:02.0000] <csarven>
Do we have other elements that applies to multiple pages?

[15:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand what you mean by "applies to multiple pages"

[15:27:00.0000] <csarven>
Hixie http://www.csarven.ca/logo-identity-in-address-and-document-heading

[15:27:01.0000] <csarven>
[17:29:13] <Hixie> i don't understand what you mean by "applies to multiple pages" -- I was trying to understand [17:28:15] <Hixie> csarven: a header that applies to multiple pages

[15:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
the header is on multiple pages

[15:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
just like the "HTML5" header is present on multiple pages

[15:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
the element itself doesn't apply to multiple pages

[15:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's the header that is present on all those pages

[15:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You should have told me that you'd make IDs with "'"s in them :-(

[15:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I make IDs with anything allowed in ifragment

[15:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It's in the docs!

[15:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
jesus fricking christ IE's handling of <option> elements is screwed up

[15:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
it crashes at the slightest problem

[15:29:00.0000] <csarven>
Hixie What good is it to indicate that a heading is repeated in other documents on the site? Is there an accurate way to determine this? I don't think <h1> indicates this (or should) in any way. <h1> is just suggesting what the current document is about. Am I going slightly insane? :)

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
and does really weird things otherwise

[15:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: have you read the spec?

[15:29:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You can't expect me to read the docs :-p

[15:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I wasn't expecting you to :P

[15:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I was being sarcastic :P

[15:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: specifically http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#distinguishing-site-wide-headings-from-page-headings

[15:30:03.0000] <csarven>
Hixie What I'm trying to solve is a consistent way to represent logos, contact information and the main document heading.

[15:31:00.0000] <csarven>
Hixie You got me there. I have not read that bit (nor came across it)

[15:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: that's not a problem, that's a solution. what's the problem?

[15:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
(well, it's a requirement for a solution, not an actual solution)

[15:31:03.0000] <csarven>
The problem is simply people are incorrectly marking up their documents and there is a great variance in how people use those components

[15:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
why is that a problem?

[15:32:00.0000] <csarven>
Not consistent

[15:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
so?

[15:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
welcome to humanity.

[15:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
we're inconsistent.

[15:32:04.0000] <csarven>
Can we strive for some consistency?

[15:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
deal with it. :-)

[15:32:06.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm not!

[15:32:07.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[15:32:08.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm completely consistent!

[15:32:09.0000] <Hixie>
what is the benefit of being consistent? what problem would it solve?

[15:32:10.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: We get to be predictable!

[15:33:00.0000] <csarven>
Well, having an agreed upon vocab (and its implementation) leads to good things. Can we not agree there? :)

[15:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, it's completely predictable I'll never ask my <3 out, because I'm a hopeless romantic! I'm consistent!

[15:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/404#introduction - fixed now

[15:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: i agree that we should have some level of consistency, so that, for example, users of accessibility tools can read pages as well.

[15:33:04.0000] <Philip`>
(I'll continue blaming gsnedders for that bug)

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: what good things? i'm not going to worry about hypothetical good things here. we have enough real problems to deal with.

[15:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: the problem was bigger than that -- the IDs had changed, so there was nowhere to redirect

[15:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: effectively http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/404#404

[15:35:00.0000] <csarven>
Well a simple example would be that if we have a common way of marking a logo (and being able to identify it in a document) will allow us to extract that information from the document with tools.

[15:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
wtf am i going to do with select.add() and select.remove() and select.options.add() and select.options.remove()

[15:35:02.0000] <csarven>
<img class="logo">

[15:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: What was the bug?

[15:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: who on earth is trying to extract logos with tools?

[15:35:05.0000] <csarven>
Oh, I don't know... microformats?

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: if we really wanted to make logos easily extractable, we'd just do something like <link rel=icon src=...>

[15:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: "microformats" is not a person

[15:36:02.0000] <csarven>
:)

[15:36:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/fragment-links.js was saying "var fragment_links = { ...,'the-'icon'-property':'rendering',... }"

[15:36:04.0000] <csarven>
Hixie I'm going towards the use of hCards here.

[15:36:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: There was an RSS reader that used RSS's image element to give a logo with the feed

[15:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: You're going to spec what IE does

[15:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: no, i'm not, IE makes select.options === select and crashes for most arguments i tried to pass to select.add()

[15:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Why did you assume that there couldn't be '?

[15:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Because there wasn't '

[15:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blames bert

[15:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
If browsers popped a big ugly modal error dialog when there was a script error, I would have noticed this bug instead of letting it exist unknown for weeks

[15:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
s//up /

[15:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Like XML errors?

[15:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Exactly

[15:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Once browsers implement that, can we write ECMAScript 5 that specs how to deal with syntax errors non-fatally

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
OH MY GOD. <select> and select.options are SO FRICKING MESSED UP.

[15:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i even blogged about this before: http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1161042744&count=1

[15:48:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Welcome to our world

[15:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i've been here for some time

[15:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, it just felt like you had gone somewhere else since you were surprised by browsers being messed up :)

[15:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: i'm not used to this level of lack of interop and this amount of crashyness on one small feature

[15:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
even for html, this takes the biscuit

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
bbl.

[17:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: yt?

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
select.add()

[18:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
second argument

[18:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
IE: has to be a child of the <select>

[18:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
Safari: has to be a child of the <select>

[18:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
Mozilla: has to be a descendant of the <select>

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
Opera: has to be an <option> descendant of the <select>

[19:37:00.0000] <jruderman>
mozilla's behavior is probably nicest for selects with optgroups

[20:24:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: you still trapped in <select> hell?

[00:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sicking: the elements that make a difference as fragment parents are at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#reset-the-insertion-mode-appropriately

[00:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I think I moved the finally block from the portable tokenizer to the Java IO driver. It is there because the SAX API contract is specified to require endDocument to be called with finally semantics

[00:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it indeed is a bit annoying sometimes

[00:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if you want to spin graphics definitions out of the spec (or make them informative-only in the spec), PostScript Level 2 is probably the right normative reference

[00:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: ?

[00:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Re: IRC log about the winding rule and canvas and you saying you'd love to spin stuff out

[00:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: what compression implementation is breaking HTTP streamingness?

[00:42:00.0000] <olliej>
yoyo roc

[00:43:00.0000] <roc>
gdday

[00:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the winding rule thing is i just want a good original reference

[00:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: spinning things out is that i want a separate spec

[00:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. PostScript Level 2 is probably "original" from implementation point of view. I don't know if the concept has been stated earlier elsewhere than PostScript Level 1

[01:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm wonder why the forums always get spammed while i'm on vacation

[01:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: here now

[01:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: spam issues on the forums

[01:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: i recommend making a few of the more effective moderators (e.g. the three who contacted me) into admins or some such

[01:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the winding rule concept was invented in some paper or other originally, i'm sure

[01:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I expect it to be originally from a research paper, yes. But if the details changed at all between that paper and PS Level 2, PS Level 2 compat is what drives libraries

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it's a pretty simple concept, i dunno how it could really change. but what do i know. :-)

[01:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: who contacted you?

[01:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i've made mskinner admin

[01:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Does any contract require XmlSerializer.endDocument() to call OutputStream.close()? (I don't see why the serialiser would think it should take over control of the whole stream like that...)

[01:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: ryan jones

[01:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh and the other was mskinner again

[02:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: no, but that's the resonable behavior when you have one-to-one mapping with ContentHandler and OutputStream

[02:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me finally managed to visualize the object relationships in Gecko's HTML and XML parsers

[02:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It seems like there often isn't a one-to-one relationship, e.g. you'd often be serialising the document into an HTTP response where you've already written some header stuff to the stream, so the stream is not exclusively owned by the ContentHandler

[02:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: conceptually, the OutputStream you write XML to isn't the same OutputStream you write HTTP headers to but another OutputStream that just happens to delegate to the HTTP keep-alive-level stream

[02:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not only conceptually, but in practice, too

[03:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Convincing LaTeX to place figures in the correct location is great fun

[03:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me realizes 5 days later than annevk2 that there's now a blog for quoting bits out of the IRC logs http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/

[03:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://alistapart.com/comments/webstandards2008?page=5#48

[03:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think the WHATWG is the right place to come if what you want is a respectful environment

[03:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
(But it seems to work in terms of getting productive work done that nobody else would be doing)

[03:53:01.0000] <olliej>
who is that guy? and what's his problem?

[03:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it cuts both ways. the TAG uses a derogatory short name for their HTML5 meta issue (TagSoupIntegration-54)

[03:53:03.0000] <olliej>
hsivonen: and who/what is TAG?

[03:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
olliej: the last week blog says "TAG - W3C Technical Architecture Group - members include Tim Berners Lee"

[03:55:01.0000] <annevk2>
olliej, http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/

[03:56:00.0000] <olliej>
okayyy... and there approach to mature debate is to quote people out of context?

[03:56:01.0000] <olliej>
/me chooses not to pay any attention to such people

[03:56:02.0000] <olliej>
*their

[03:56:03.0000] <Philip`>
That blog is not related to the TAG

[03:56:04.0000] <olliej>
ah

[03:56:05.0000] <annevk2>
right

[03:56:06.0000] <olliej>
just a crazy person?

[03:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
And that blog isn't really quoting out of context - it has plenty of lines of the discussions, and a link to the whole context in the IRC logs

[03:57:01.0000] <annevk2>
misguided W3C fanboy? dunno :)

[03:58:00.0000] <annevk2>
I tried figuring it out, but couldn't find anything useful

[03:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me expects this discussion to show up on the blog

[03:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
You're still not giving the impression of showing respect and understanding :-p

[03:59:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, come on, do we have to be politically correct even on IRC?

[03:59:01.0000] <annevk2>
where is the fun in that

[03:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: I don't mean to suggest that you should be showing respect and understanding

[03:59:03.0000] <Philip`>
It's boring when people do that

[04:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Conflict with outsiders helps the group bind together more closely :-)

[04:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me likes how it Philip` never grows tired of pointing out flaws

[04:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
since the blogger seems to be pseudonymous, we can start guessing who (s)he is.

[04:08:00.0000] <mcarter>
anyone besides Hixie in the bay area?

[04:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Why does Jean-Baptiste Clamence seem to be a pseudonym?

[04:08:02.0000] <annevk2>
the image is titled marcos.jpg

[04:08:03.0000] <mcarter>
i think it'd be neat to do a social event for html5/whatwg

[04:08:04.0000] <annevk2>
s/titled/named/

[04:08:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the name is a character from a novel by Albert Camus

[04:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
mcarter, I'll be in San Francisco / Mountain View in the week of October 26

[04:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: He's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcomandante_Marcos

[04:09:02.0000] <annevk2>
(leaving October 31)

[04:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The person in the photo, not the person who wrote the blog)

[04:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me chuckles at the phrase "standards youth"

[04:10:02.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, k

[04:10:03.0000] <mcarter>
annevk2, perfect, i'll start a wiki and we can see who all can meet up thenabouts

[04:17:00.0000] <roc>
woohoo, I've already featured in lastweekinhtml5

[04:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: You were even emboldened in it, which is a rare privilege

[04:23:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me is reminded of http://html4all.org/pipermail/list_html4all.org/2007-August/000054.html for some reason

[04:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
though clearly they should use <em> instead of <span style="font-weight: bold;"> for that

[04:25:00.0000] <annevk2>
it seems only natural for an anti-fan blog to do everything wrong :)

[04:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
(or <em style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal"> to get the desired presentation)

[04:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
They're an anti-fan of the WHATWG but presumably a fan of the W3C, and the W3C says you should use semantic elements too :-)

[05:22:00.0000] <krijnh>
Oh, more linklove :)

[05:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has fun trying to fix a paper which he would not be able to understand at all, had he not spent the past year working on precisely what the paper is talking about

[05:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2008/10/monsieur-sivonen-makes-discovery.html didn't take long

[06:04:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe if we talk about it enough his blog will be filled with us quoting him :p

[06:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'll be an infinite loop of each party saying "hey look, they talked about us! it's like we're famous now"

[06:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Eventually we'll write a bot to automate the whole process

[06:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Maybe someone on the inside is making it to draw attention to our IRC channel?

[06:12:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I really don't get the selective highlighting thing there

[06:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: You mean a kind of subtle PR campaign to promote the existence of #whatwg?

[06:27:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
Monsieur Clamence uses <span style="font-size: 85%;"> instead of <big> and <small>

[06:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess that's what happens when you use the 'font size' dropdown menu in Blogspot's editing interface?

[06:28:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
that's possible. I haven't used Blogspot from the publisher side

[06:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Meet the WHAT WG Youth" - sounds like he's concerned that we are on his lawn

[06:30:01.0000] <krijnh>
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_27WEu4KHCYU/SODF7QM1Y_I/AAAAAAAAAAM/6zGKJZWJD1E/S220/marcos.jpg - why is it marcos.jpg?

[06:30:02.0000] <hsivonen_>
krijnh: the blogger borrowed his face from dictator Marcos

[06:31:00.0000] <krijnh>
Ah, doh

[06:31:01.0000] <krijnh>
Never heard of him before :)

[06:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
(unless it's just meant to be a reference to the Hitler Youth)

[06:31:03.0000] <annevk2>
also, rtfl

[06:31:04.0000] <annevk2>
/me already asked that

[06:31:05.0000] <Philip`>
(which might be a *little* too extreme)

[06:33:00.0000] <krijnh>
/me adds Meet the WHAT WG Youth to his subtitles :)

[06:33:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
oops. I had the wrong Marcos in mind.

[06:34:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
/me managed to confuse various political Marcoses

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
I have the advantage that I've never heard of any political Marcoses, so I just did an image search for "marcos" and the pipe and balaclava and hat were sufficiently distinctive to recognise him

[06:37:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: Ferdinand Marcos?

[06:37:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
virtuelv: I had Ferdinand in mind, but it's a Mexican Marcos

[06:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
Strangely Wikipedia gives the impression that he was actually serious and not just clowning around looking like that

[06:38:00.0000] <virtuelv>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcomandante_Marcos then?

[06:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: Who? :-)

[06:38:02.0000] <hsivonen_>
virtuelv: yes

[06:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: That one looks like the picture

[06:39:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Baader Meinhof syndrome

[06:39:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I encountered that WP article this morning in an entirely different context

[06:39:02.0000] <krijnh>
Perhaps it's just Marcos Caceres making a joke :)

[09:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
fyi: http://twitter.com/diveintomark/statuses/949726163

[10:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, whoever runs that blog seems pretty small-time

[10:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
and nasty

[10:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me bites

[10:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
none of these images have alt text: http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2008/10/meet-what-wg-youth.html

[10:26:01.0000] <BenMillard>
although that could be a red herring...

[10:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
doing it anonymously is cowardly

[10:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
deliberately choosing unflattering photos says more about the blogger's (or bloggers'?) personality than those photographed, imho

[10:40:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so the blogger is nasty-minded but too cowardly to own up to it

[10:40:02.0000] <BenMillard>
that narrows it down

[10:47:00.0000] <annevk_win32>
tell us when you get him sherlock :)

[10:47:01.0000] <BenMillard>
heh...it's like Cleudo :)

[10:47:02.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk_win32, whoever it is, what they're doing can only be good for WHATWG as it shows how petty the criticism has become

[11:32:00.0000] <annevk_win32>
there was a time when http://flickr.com/photos/novemberborn/4046399/ was the first hit for my name on image search...

[11:33:00.0000] <annevk_win32>
anyway, time to go

[11:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
I presume the blogger's identity is narrowed down by either being French, or being an actor capable of sounding very French

[12:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
so nobody noticed that i added lastweekinhtml5 to the list of ways you can track our community on the wiki? :-)

[12:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
if the blog was more cleanly set up and more readable, i'd have blogged about it from blog.whatwg.org already

[12:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
unfortunately while he does link to the irc logs, which is good, he doesn't realy do a good job of highlighting the controversies

[12:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
it just comes off as a conspiracy nut's blog

[12:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's quite sad really

[12:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
if it was better layed out it would be much more fun

[12:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Can we not just invite him to #whatwg-cabel?

[13:15:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: would it make sense to ask for 

[13:16:00.0000] <erlehmann>
a way to mark taglouds up on the mailing list ?

[13:16:01.0000] <erlehmann>
like @frequency for links or something ?

[13:17:00.0000] <erlehmann>
(since i'm fairly new, i don't know if it has been discussed and struck down before)

[13:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: Nested <em> has always been the conclusion

[13:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
nested <em> seems dubious to me, but i don't think we'll add a formal way to do tag clouds

[13:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to ask if you want though

[13:27:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders: nested em ? why would we neet <strong> then ? also, how semantic is that ?

[13:27:01.0000] <erlehmann>
need

[13:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: strong is importance, em is emphasize per HTML 5

[13:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
em is stress

[13:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think a tag cloud is strength

[13:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
is stress even

[13:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
or strength for that matter

[13:56:00.0000] <webben>
erlehmann: I think http://24ways.org/2006/marking-up-a-tag-cloud works reasonably well.

[14:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: We have a WHATWG cable channel?

[14:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I didn't say cable. I don't expect you to read though :)

[14:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You didn't say cabal either :-p

[14:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No, as that's what everyone thinks exists. We actually called it something else, just to mislead people :)

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there a unix command line program that takes stdin input, and if it is greater than zero bytes long, outputs a preset line of text followed by stdin?

[14:59:01.0000] <Hixie>

Hixie: s/user should/user agent should/g

[16:19:00.0000] <erlehmann__>
Hixie: i'd apuse grep for that

[16:19:01.0000] <erlehmann__>
abuse

[16:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
how?

[16:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would use Perl

[16:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
perl -lpe'print "Warnings:" if $. == 1' or something

[16:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
but that's just because I'm too lazy to learn Bash

[16:27:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
[_] I accept the _terms_*

[16:27:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
how do you mark that up?

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, |perl -lpe'print "Warnings:" if $. == 1'| is good.

[16:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't think of using $.

[16:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Of course you should golf it to be as short as possible, because anything else would be un-Perlish

[16:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
perl -lpe'$.-1||print"Warnings:"' is the obvious thing to do, but I can't think of how to improve on that :-(

[16:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
your definition of "improve" needs work. :-P

[16:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
perl -lpe'$1-1||$_.="Warnings:\n" is even more obscure

[16:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[16:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
that puts it on the wrong end

[16:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
perl -lpe'$1-1||$_="Warnings:\n$_" maybe

[16:34:04.0000] <Philip`>
The rules don't allow to prouce incorrect output :-p

[16:34:05.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[16:34:06.0000] <Philip`>
The rules don't allow you to produce incorrect output :-p

[16:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It'd be better if I didn't forget to type so many letters)

[16:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
perl -lpe'$.-1||$_="Warnings:\n$_" even

[16:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
see this is why one doesn't make things so hard to read!

[16:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you want hard to read, you'd have to do something more like perl -pe'@.[1]="Warnings:\n";$_=$.[$.].$_'

[16:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, that's a bit silly, I should have said perl -pe'$.[1]="Warnings:\n";$_=$.[$.].$_' though it doesn't make any difference in practice

[16:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
The @ looks prettier anyway

[16:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
wtf is @.

[16:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's just a variable

[16:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh it's not a magical one?

[16:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, or if it's magic then I'm just clobbering whatever magic value it contained

[16:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
dude. don't use punctuation as the name of your own variables. :-P

[16:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
perldoc doesn't say it's magic

[16:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's bad enough that i have to deal with perl's own magical 

[16:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
variables

[16:41:05.0000] <Philip`>
I just wanted an excuse to write $.[$.].$_

[16:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
It has a pleasing symmetry

[16:42:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
looks like a weird smiley

[16:42:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
$_[^_^]_$

[16:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: That looks like a pretty nasty ear infection

[16:43:01.0000] <erlehmann__>
is that valid perl code ?

[16:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann__: $_[^_^]_$ isn't

[16:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
m$_[^_^]_$ is

[16:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-D

[16:44:03.0000] <erlehmann__>
D:<

[16:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
#$_[^_^]_$ is too - it's easy if you're allowed to modify the code arbitrarily :-p

[16:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
it is an expression that returns true if $_ contains the string "_x_" for any value of x that isn't "_" or "^".

[16:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
wow

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
note that the occurance of $_ in the expression has nothing to do with the variable $_ though

[16:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
you should go through a list of smileys and try to interpret them as perl

[16:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
No language is as fun as Perl

[16:49:00.0000] <erlehmann>
#_[^_^]_# is too ?

[16:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
# starts a comment

[16:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
so anything starting with # is valid

[16:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
(except if the # is preceeded by an m or an s or a tr)

[16:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
(but that's another story)

[16:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
s#\##//##\\##/#s

[16:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
replaces Perl/sh/etc-style comments with C++-style comments

[16:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
s#\##//##\\##/#s is really "s#\##//#" with a comment

[16:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think relying on comments is really fair game

[16:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
But I want symmetry :-(

[16:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
(unless you're writing a polyglot in which case at the commented portion should be no a comment in some language)

[16:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
On that subject, and just out of interest: is there a nicer/conciser way than

[16:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
''/*

[16:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
document.write("VB")

[16:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
'*/document.write("JS")

[16:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
to write a script that can tell whether it's being run as VBScript or JScript?

[16:57:04.0000] <Hixie>
nicer or conciser?

[16:57:05.0000] <Philip`>
Conciseness is nice, so both :-)

[16:58:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, got a sec re importScripts?

[16:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i don't know VB well but i imagine the document. part can be abstracted out

[16:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: sure

[16:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
(i am deep in wf2 edits right now, but i can discuss whatever)


2008-10-08
[17:07:00.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: what's the question?

[17:08:00.0000] <sicking>
sorry, something came up in another channel, bbiab

[17:09:00.0000] <sicking>
so the issue is how to specify JS versions

[17:10:00.0000] <sicking>
something that is important in order for 'yeild' to work for example

[17:10:01.0000] <sicking>
(ff only for now, hopefully will be implemented cross browser)

[17:11:00.0000] <olliej>
sicking: you could try { eval("function(){var yield = 1;}") } catch(e) { /* no yield */} or something 

[17:11:01.0000] <olliej>
surely?

[17:11:02.0000] <olliej>
i''m assuming "yield" is considered a keyword

[17:11:03.0000] <sicking>
olliej, no, i mean that we as an implementation has to put the JS parser in a special mode when parsing

[17:11:04.0000] <sicking>
olliej, it's not unless the parser is put in such a mode

[17:12:00.0000] <olliej>
ah

[17:12:01.0000] <sicking>
olliej, since introducing keywords breaks stuff

[17:12:02.0000] <olliej>
true

[17:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think there should be an in-script way of specifying you want new keywords

[17:12:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: can't importScript assume the latest and greatest?

[17:12:05.0000] <othermaciej>
an external flag is not robust

[17:12:06.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: surely there's no legacy to worry about

[17:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
You just need to grep the web for all identifiers used in all JS scripts, and then choose keywords which don't conflict with any identifier usage

[17:13:01.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, that means that a page loaded in safari will work, but not in FF

[17:13:02.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, since the 'yeild' in FF will be parsed as a keyword, but in safari/opera/chrome not

[17:13:03.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: does it even make sense to load a js 1.5 script into a, say, js 1.4 environment?

[17:13:04.0000] <olliej>
sicking: you forgot ie

[17:13:05.0000] <olliej>
sicking: ;)

[17:13:06.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: you don't expect authors who write worker scripts to test in firefox?

[17:13:07.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, external meaning the server side content-type for example

[17:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: yeah, that seems bogus to me

[17:14:01.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, nope

[17:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: it means if I download the script, it won't work any more

[17:14:03.0000] <othermaciej>
since there's nothing to provide the Content-Type

[17:14:04.0000] <othermaciej>
so now I have to remember to set a flag wherever I embed it

[17:14:05.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, it seems to work in HTML today. You specify version per <script> element

[17:14:06.0000] <othermaciej>
versioning should be in the script itself, like the proposed "use strict"

[17:15:00.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: ok, i never use that feature, so i'm unfamiliar. sorry.

[17:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Safari completely ignores the version on the <script> element

[17:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's basically a Firefox-only feature

[17:15:03.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: maybe there could be an optional extra param in the ff version

[17:15:04.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, how would you deal with yield? 'use yield'?

[17:15:05.0000] <Philip`>
sicking: Most people specify versions like 1.1 or 1.3, and all browsers treat that as exactly the same as 1.5, so it doesn't seem like a particularly successful feature

[17:15:06.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, problem is that the function takes a list of uris

[17:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: I think whatever language version introduces it should have a "use es4" or "use harmony" or whatever to request new keywords

[17:16:01.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, i suppose we could check if the last one looks like a version number, but that seems like a hack

[17:16:02.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej, makes sense to me. Have you guys talked about this?

[17:16:03.0000] <aboodman>
or you could support something like:

[17:16:04.0000] <aboodman>
importScripts([[foo.js, 1.5], [bar.js, 1.3]])

[17:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: I have talked some about how the old-world ES4 approach to versioning was lame, but I am not sure what anyone else thinks

[17:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll bring it up on es-discuss

[17:17:02.0000] <aboodman>
horrific i know

[17:17:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
why are you concerned about js keywords but not new dom features?

[17:17:04.0000] <sicking>
Philip`, the differences between 1.1 and 1.3 doesn't generally matter. 1.5 to 1.8 is different

[17:17:05.0000] <zcorpan_>
i mean why should authors have to opt in to get new js keywords but not to get new dom features

[17:18:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, because introducing new DOM features generally doesn't break existing content

[17:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Because new JS keywords are likely to make perfectly valid not-uncommon scripts written in the old language version fail to compile in the new version, whereas you never get the same problem with new DOM features

[17:18:02.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, introducing new JS keywords does

[17:19:00.0000] <sicking>
i guess for now we can add something like 'mozilla.importScriptVersion' and let people set that before calling importScripts

[17:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
If people are setting the script version, presumably they are using features of the new language version, so their scripts won't work in old language versions, so their scripts won't work in any other browsers anyway, so the API doesn't need to be compatible with other browsers

[17:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it could just be a function like mozImportScriptsWithVersion(version, uris...) instead of calling importScripts

[17:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: use the same technique as is used for javascript: URLs, or onfoo="" event handlers, or scripts sent over FTP

[17:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: which is to say, fix JS so that it is forwards and backwards compatible like HTML and CSS and you don't need a specific out-of-band indicator

[17:24:01.0000] <erlehmann>
js 5, yay \o/

[17:55:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, true. I don't think we have a way to use other version in onfoo attributes right now

[17:55:01.0000] <sicking>
Philip`, exactly, that's why i suggested the mozilla.importScriptVersion syntax. Your syntax would also work

[17:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me has been telling the JS group this for some time now

[17:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
but they keep pushing back

[17:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is sad, since lack of versioning being the way to go has been proven over and over again to be the only sane way to design web-resistent languages

[18:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
versions don't work when you have unsynchronised widely-buggy implementations and widely varied content providers that work together without collaborating

[18:02:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, at the same time, HTML5 has <DOCTYPE HTML>

[18:02:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i mostly agree though

[18:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
<!DOCTYPE HTML> is not versioning. it's explicitly no versioning, in fact.

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i would have removed it altogether (we did in XHTML5) but then we wouldn't be triggering standards mode

[18:03:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, exactly, so the web needs at least two versions

[18:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
quirks mode was a huge mistake

[18:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
we should never have done it

[18:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
we only "need" four versions (xml, quirks, limited quirks, no quirks) because of historical inertia

[18:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
we should make as sure as possible that we never add another version again

[18:05:01.0000] <sicking>
agreed, though there is a 'as possible' there

[18:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's possible with JS

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. using special syntax for new keywords, or whatever

[18:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
or instrumenting browsers to find out what keywords are safe to add, the same way we scanned the web to determine safety for new html5 element names

[18:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
or importing new symbols using a page-wide "opt-in" syntax

[18:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, I disagree with that markup for tag clouds: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081007#l-372

[18:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, it makes the content desperately verbose and sighted users don't have a convenient way of getting the actual frequencies

[18:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, I'd put the values in the title attribute and it seems "ampz" had the same idea in the final comment to that 24 ways article: http://24ways.org/2006/marking-up-a-tag-cloud#c001139

[18:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, the 24 ways markup also puts the link at the end of the item, so it's painful to use linearly

[18:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Geez, what is it with people thinking that just because something is in some order, it has to be an ordered list

[18:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
the spec is clear that that is not what <ol> means. :-)

[18:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/

[18:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Where's my spec?

[18:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's there

[18:27:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, there it is. I must've hit the page just before the index.html was generated

[18:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
looks like

[18:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Dashiva, "I put my list items in order, therefore it's an ordered list."

[18:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Sounds like a job for intelligent sort

[18:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I'd blame Hixie for that - the actual generation (currently performed by me) happens on a different server and it just uploads a .tar.something with the output, so it's Hixie's fault if that doesn't get uncompressed and linked into place atomically :-)

[18:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Hmm

[18:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You could uncompress on the side, but is it possible to redirect a symlink atomically?

[18:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
How could it possibly be impossible?

[18:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
Have directories called "001" and "002", symlink multipage to 001, uncompress into 002, replace the symlink, delete directory 001

[18:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
then repeat next time with 002 and 003

[18:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But replacing the symlink might mean delete + create unatomically

[18:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
The symlink can't really be doing anything other than pointing at either one of the directories, so it's got to be pretty much atomic

[18:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Replace" is just a renaming operation, and I'd assume all sane filesystems do atomic renaming

[18:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's what you think

[18:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
Indeed it is :-)

[18:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
But anyway, delete+create would still be, uh, molecular even if it's not atomic, and you'd never manage to make an HTTP request in that tiny time period, so it's much better than deleting everything and then letting bunzip2 crunch some megabytes for a few seconds

[18:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But if we leave it at that, Hixie won't have an excuse for not making it work

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
I'm getting there. Only <textarea>, <output>, common attributes, validity, and form submission formats to go.

[18:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Poor type=email-list, never to see the light of day

[18:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh well once i've done all this i have 500+ e-mails to reply to with new feature requests

[18:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just talking about the wf2->html5 integration

[18:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me decides to drop <textarea pattern="">

[18:56:00.0000] <blooberry>
hixie: why so?

[19:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, now 1,002 entries in my 2008 collection as the "To Do" entries often have several interesting uses of markup in them

[19:14:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, maybe we can fit a few sessions to run through it? We can do both planned and impromptu meetings, depending how it goes.

[19:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
blooberry: what's the use case?

[19:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: sure

[19:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: not too long, but i can do an hour or so

[19:15:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, my feeling exactly :)

[19:15:02.0000] <BenMillard>
I don't want to spend all day looking at collected web pages when I'm in the south of France

[20:09:00.0000] <blooberry>
hixie: Sorry, was away. Bad word filtering in blog or forum system?

[23:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
gah

[23:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
i missed "textarea" when fixing the parser last time

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
/me sees the financial crisis comes to the damowmow portal

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, why do people watch that page all the time :-)

[01:24:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: ?

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
click on the <h1> to go to the idn url

[01:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
but seriously? you people use that page?

[01:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's with that! :-P

[01:41:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
Hixie: it has useful links and interesting charts

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough :-)

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
i encourage you to make your own though, it'll be more useful :-)

[02:00:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
Hixie: I meant the electoral vote charts--not your portfolio.

[02:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
krijnh, you fail on  http://☺.damowmow.com/

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
oops, hsivonen_ said that already

[02:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
krijnh: Thank you for not linkifying http://☺.damowmow.com/, since we don't want to encourage the use of untypeable domain names

[02:13:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, new Option() takes an optional fourth argument as well

[02:13:02.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, it sets the selectedness

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
can async scripts or defer scripts do document.write?

[02:18:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
so the first level of document.write is atomic if it doesn't write "<script>"

[02:18:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
if it does write "<script>", is it supposed to return early and leave the rest of its data in the inputstream?

[02:35:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
Hixie: can "script that will execute as soon as possible" execute when parsing document.written data?

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
"If the tree construction stage is being called reentrantly, say from a call to document.write():" Can it be called re-entrantly except from document.write?

[03:45:00.0000] <hendry>
has anyone studied how mail should be marked up on the Web? http://natalian.org/archives/2008/10/07/marking-up-mail/

[07:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
"IE8 also supports an event named storagecommit that is not part of HTML5 which tells you when the data has been written to an XML backend format IE8 uses." - hmm, XML? I wonder if you can store values that make that XML ill-formed...

[07:28:00.0000] <jcranmer>
see if storing '; DROP DATABASE; &-) <!-- fails...

[07:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me was not planning on booting back into Windows anytime soon, but would be interested in results of such tests :)

[07:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wishes he had a VM with IE8, that worked in Linux and didn't cause kernel panics, since that'd make it much easier to test

[08:31:00.0000] <erlehmann>
how can i style an element that it doesn't disturb the flow of other block elements ?

[08:36:00.0000] <annevk2>
that sounds confused :)

[08:36:01.0000] <erlehmann>
okay, i want a layout like

[08:36:02.0000] <erlehmann>
xxxxxxxx yy

[08:36:03.0000] <erlehmann>
zzzzzzzz yy

[08:36:04.0000] <erlehmann>
zzzzzzzz yy

[08:36:05.0000] <erlehmann>
zzzzzzzz yy

[08:37:00.0000] <erlehmann>
and in the source, elements are in order <x> <y> <z>

[08:37:01.0000] <erlehmann>
y has fixed width and floats left

[08:37:02.0000] <erlehmann>
err, right

[08:37:03.0000] <annevk2>
use position:absolute for y instead?

[08:37:04.0000] <erlehmann>
x and z are dynamic

[08:39:00.0000] <erlehmann>
annevk2: how could that help if i have several <y> class elements ?

[08:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
you didn't say that

[08:41:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hihi, but i have

[08:41:01.0000] <erlehmann>
like <x> <y> <y> <y> <y> <z>

[08:41:02.0000] <annevk2>
well, group them?

[08:41:03.0000] <erlehmann>
and i dont want to make a semantic mess of it ?

[08:41:04.0000] <erlehmann>
group ?

[08:41:05.0000] <erlehmann>
like, enclosing it in a div ?

[08:42:00.0000] <erlehmann>
that would mako the layout way too inflexible

[08:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
how do you define CharacterData.data?

[08:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"The data attribute must, on getting, return the data of the node, and on setting, must change the node's data to the new value. "

[08:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe you should have a "data-concept" just like Hixie has a concept for value

[08:44:01.0000] <annevk2>
erlehmann, then I don't know, good luck! :)

[08:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk2: and how do i define that?

[08:55:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan, each "1" object has a "2". member "3" of "1" modifies "2"

[08:55:01.0000] <annevk2>
or something in that direction

[08:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
I notice Hixie hasn't actually defined "2" yet :)

[08:56:01.0000] <annevk2>
(but it's referenced all over the place)

[09:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
when is a node read-only as defined in dom3core?

[09:49:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/glossary.html#dt-readonly-node

[09:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
"As for Entity nodes, EntityReference nodes and all their descendants are readonly."

[09:53:01.0000] <annevk2>
couldn't find anything else

[09:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
(though potentially there are other specs that allow you to obtain a readonly DOM node/fragment or some such, but I can't think of any)

[09:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[09:58:00.0000] <annevk2>
you didn't fix textContent btw, it has setting and getting reversed

[09:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
fixed

[10:25:00.0000] <krijnh>
hsivonen_, annevk2, Philip`: fixed

[10:26:00.0000] <annevk2>
ta

[10:26:01.0000] <krijnh>
(only that case btw :)

[10:27:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
krijnh: thanks

[10:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
krijnh: I didn't want you to fix it :-(

[10:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Fix what?

[10:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
krijnh: What he just fixed

[10:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[10:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/krijnh/gsnedders/

[10:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Which was?

[10:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
linking http://☺.damowmow.com/?

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I think so

[10:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: it's easy to type ☺

[10:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: You were saying anolis cut off <http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core>?

[10:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: You find what caused that? You got the source file?

[10:48:02.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: yeah, it did, twice, at different places

[10:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core.src

[10:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: But it works now?  You know why?

[10:50:01.0000] <zcorpan>
once after the <!-- TypeInfo dropped --> comment and once before the <!-- Notation dropped --> comment, iirc

[10:50:02.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan, shouldn't isEqualNode consider many other attributes as well?

[10:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Odd.

[10:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk2: dunno

[10:52:00.0000] <annevk2>
might be an idea to define the various properties of a node and an element, etc. as definitions first and then "implement" the members of the interfaces using those terms

[10:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk2: can you give an example of what you mean?

[10:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
e.g., define an element as having a namespace, name, prefix, list of attributes, list of children

[10:57:00.0000] <annevk2>
then for Node.namespaceURI you say it returns null unless it is an element or attr object in which case it returns namespace-concept

[10:57:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[10:58:00.0000] <annevk2>
but maybe that's not needed, not sure

[11:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gotta go now anyway

[11:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hendry, the markup for mail archives is something I've thought about but not looked into closely.

[11:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the way Google turns them into somewhat natural web pages seems general approach, although the specific markup they use could be improved a lot. Such as using heading elements around heading-like text: http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Maps-API/browse_thread/thread/c81a00da42bd64d9

[11:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
s/seems general approach/seems like the best general approach/

[11:55:00.0000] <ehird>
Is profile="" still removed from <head>?

[11:59:00.0000] <smedero>
ehird: it is not present in the current draft, no: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#the-head-element

[12:00:00.0000] <ehird>
smedero: :|

[12:07:00.0000] <smedero>
Microformat folks recommend using <a> or <link> + @rel=profile with HTML 5: http://microformats.org/wiki/profile-uris#.3Chead_profile.3E

[12:07:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hendry, here's a fascinating UI for mailng lists: http://zesty.ca/zest/out/

[12:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hendry, putting the most important phrase from a message in the left panel turns skimming a thread into something really usable and convenient.

[12:10:01.0000] <BenMillard>
/me bookmarks it for future reference.

[12:13:00.0000] <hallvors>
In the HTML5 draft we're planning to re-use "drop" events for pasting data. Has anyone investigated or tried to standardise what should happen if you paste formatted content that contains images into an online rich text editor?

[12:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: here's one for you: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081008#l-18

[12:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, I don't understand that :P

[12:14:01.0000] <BenMillard>
was it plain text?

[12:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: a checkbox with the label "I accept the terms*" where "terms" is a link and "*" indicates required

[12:15:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, ah

[12:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, maybe something like this: <input type="checkbox" name id> <label for>I accept the <a href>terms</a> (required)</label>

[12:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(with sensible values for the attributes)

[12:17:01.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: <label><a href> is not allowed in html5 and clicking the link would check the checkbox

[12:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, that isn't how I expect it to work as an author...hmm

[12:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
<a href> doesn't stop the event from bubbling up

[12:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, could you prevent that from script (or capture it and make it a no-op?)

[12:19:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah you could

[12:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ok, well as an author and a user I expect clicking a link to only click the link :)

[12:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
if that's not what happens natively, scripting that to be the behaviour seems OK

[12:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder if it's possible to make the default action for <label> have knowledge about whether a descendant link was clicked

[12:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, there might be a more general rule there for making nested interactivity work

[12:22:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I imagine there are sites which rely on what's currently implemented in this area, though?

[12:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
changing the default action of <label> to do nothing if a descendant interactive element was clicked seems like a safe change

[12:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
whilch probably improves the usability of pages that do the above

[12:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, yeah that sounds good, even when implicit label association is being used

[12:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, <label><input type=checkbox ...> I accept the <a href>terms</a> (Required)</label>

[12:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
clicking <a hreF> shouldn't click the <label>. Clicking <input> shouldn't click <label> since that would only click the <input> again.

[12:28:01.0000] <BenMillard>
cool :)

[12:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm that's a good point

[12:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me feels good when zcorpan agrees with him.

[12:31:01.0000] <BenMillard>
19:30 and I haven't eaten lunch...I need to offset my sleep cycle before the TPAC

[12:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
actually this is how it works in opera

[12:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and webkit

[12:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and ie

[12:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
well then i don't see a reason for <label> to not accept interactive descendants in html5

[12:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and actually when reading the spec it seems it allows <label><a href>

[12:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i found a bug in v.nu

[12:51:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, because the content model permits "phrasing content" and that includes <a href>? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#the-label-element

[12:51:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(and <a href> isn't a "labelable form-associated element" afaict)

[12:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it talks about "the platform's label behaviour" being matched, though

[12:52:01.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: yeah. i thought there was an implicit rule that interactive content can't contain interactive descendants, but that doesn't seem to be the case

[12:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, I thought I read that in HTML5 as well, in a different section...

[12:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the content model for <a> is Transparent, but there must be no interactive content descendant.

[12:55:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, the definition for <a> says it mustn't have interactive descendents

[12:55:02.0000] <BenMillard>
ah, we spotted that at the same time :)

[12:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
localStorage["foo"] = "\ud800"

[12:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
IE stores that in an XML file saying <root><item name="foo" value=" /></root> (sic)

[12:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you have multiple items, the XML serialiser just stops after the first \ud800 and outputs the ' /></root>' immediately

[12:58:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, HTML4 also allows <label><a href> since <a> is part of %special; which is part of %inline; here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#edef-LABEL

[12:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Same for \ufffe etc)

[12:59:01.0000] <BenMillard>
and an exception isn't made for it in the prose, that I've seen

[13:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
html4 also allows <a href><label>

[13:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(annevk2: ^ )

[13:01:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, I wonder if there's a use-case for that...

[13:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I can't think of one off-hand and my 2008 collection hasn't found <a href><label>

[13:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, using part or all of a link's text to label a form control seems very confusing to use

[13:07:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, things like <a href>Google <label for=q>Search</label></a>: <input name=q id=q> could be written <label for=q><a href>Google</a> Search:</label> <input name=q id=q> or <label><a href>Google</a> Search: <input name=q></label> and seem more usable for it

[13:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: i agree

[13:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm html5 doesn't allow <label for=a><input id=a></label>

[13:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: I appear to be unable to comment on your blog

[13:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: It keeps saying "What did you do? You tried to pass the comment system with an invalid comment! Note that Opera has a submission bug; it converts entities on submit...", even when I use Firefox

[13:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, you have to write <p> elements and everything last time I used it.

[13:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: I did, and the preview thing was happy to accept it

[13:13:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, in that case I'm no help to you. :)

[13:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: I'll just blame anne, then :-)

[13:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly XML is hard

[13:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: you need to break your habit to include invalid byte streams

[13:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I wasn't including invalid byte streams at all!

[13:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: at least, not in the attempted blog comment itself

[13:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Argh

[13:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
IE8's XSS 'protection' breaks the Live DOM Viewer

[13:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you try a permalink to anything containing <script>, then it complains about XSS and replaces the page's own <script> tags with <sc#ipt>

[13:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Admittedly it's true that the Live DOM Viewer is one giant XSS vulnerability, but that's the whole point of it

[13:35:00.0000] <csarven>
http://unicodesnowmanforyou.com/

[13:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
IE8 seems to calculate remainingSpace based on the sum of all key and value string lengths, measured in UTF-16 code units

[13:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is pretty silly since it takes 61+len(key)+len(value) to store each item, so you can store maybe three hundred thousand items with zero-length value and minimal-length key, taking up about 20MB of file space and maybe 2MB of post-compression disk space, which is much more than the notional 5e5-byte quota

[13:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Today's challenge: Describe me in one to three sentences.

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Are expletives allowed?

[13:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: yes

[13:51:00.0000] <hallvors>
hm, so there is actually a use case for the "do not use XSS protection on this page" HTTP header? ;-)

[13:51:01.0000] <hallvors>
Ian has to add one for the live DOM viewer.. 

[13:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
hallvors: Ooh, good idea

[13:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I wonder what you're planning now :)

[13:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Please add X-XSS-Protection: 0 to http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/ so that it works correctly in broken browsers like IE8

[14:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
the lastweekinhtml5 blog's quality went up a little bit in the last post

[14:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
if it goes up in quality much more, it'll be good enough for the blog

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
you know with all the attention on this channel, you'd have thought we'd have been quoted on bash.org by now

[14:32:00.0000] <smedero>
http://bash.org/?913

[14:32:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
I guess those who'd quote use http://quotes.burntelectrons.org/search?query=tag%3A%23whatwg instead

[14:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would be surprised if anything said on this channel had sufficiently widespread appeal and quality to be suitable for bash.org

[14:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me falls down a hole and gets trapped under quotes.burntelectrons.org

[14:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: have you _read_ bash.org quotes?!

[14:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Yes :-)

[14:49:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Far too many :-/ )

[14:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
and you think we'll have an appeal and quality problem? :-)

[15:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Yes.

[15:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
We're a horrible bunch.

[15:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, <http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/> proves it.

[15:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>

oh well, ours not to question the mind of a troll

[16:42:01.0000] <olliej>
or a trolls troll as the case may be

[16:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's kind of weird that the guy is doing it anonymously, it seems like a perfectly legitimate thing to actually do

[16:45:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: yes, it would be, however his behaviour indicates that he's a troll, and trolls don't want to actually be answerable to anyone

[16:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe he's a performance artist

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: if he's trying to troll, he's not doing it right :-)

[16:46:02.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: hehe

[16:46:03.0000] <olliej>
Dashiva: heheheh :D

[16:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: trolls aren't supposed to be useful and fun :-)

[16:47:00.0000] <olliej>
Hixie: if he felt he were legitimately critiquing the whatwg (reasonable) he would not have felt the need to be anonymous

[16:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think I know know who the lastweek troll is

[16:49:01.0000] <olliej>
oh?

[16:49:02.0000] <olliej>
i was suspecting one of the people i passed the url to

[16:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
just a guess

[16:50:01.0000] <olliej>
(who is also an avid penny arcade fan :D )

[16:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
no, I mean I think I know who is the author of the last week in html5 blog

[16:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Is it Fake Steve Jobs?

[16:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
not the comment that Mr Last Week mistakenly attributed to me

[16:55:03.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders if there will be a Fake Ian Hickson blog one day

[16:55:04.0000] <olliej>
hehehe


2008-10-09
[17:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
olliej: as far as i can tell he's not critiquing it, just quoting funny things, like bash.org or quotes.burntelectrons.org

[17:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, the quotes focus on particular focus and the parts which express particular themes are emphasised

[17:04:01.0000] <BenMillard>
s/particular focus/subjects/

[17:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: so do bash.org or quotes.burntelectrons.org

[17:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I didn't notice much focus or attention to particular themes in the selection of quotes those places have...

[17:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i guess

[17:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
well, whatever. _i_ find it funny. :-P

[17:30:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I guess it takes all sorts to make a world. :)

[17:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok time to work out when the value of a textarea changes

[17:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok this is ridiculous

[17:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
who was in charge of forms before me?

[17:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i need to have a word with them

[17:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
in private

[17:37:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I think you need to talk to Adam Smith then :)

[17:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
behind a building that happens to back onto a large river

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
good lord almighty. IE is disqualified from this race.

[17:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to find SOME interoperability amongst the other UAs

[17:41:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, you need some exclamations which are more atheistic. :)

[17:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like opera and mozilla win the interop competition.

[17:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: yeah, but athetistic exclamantions sound too flat

[17:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, such as "Great Scot!" "Good grief!" "Crikey!"

[17:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
see, they all sound so lame

[17:43:02.0000] <BenMillard>
it's true :(

[17:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway i'm secure enough in my atheism to happily blaspheme in other faiths

[17:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
(appologies to anyone it might be offending)

[17:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
apologies, even

[17:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i always mistype that work, which is funny, given how much i use it

[17:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
it looks wrong without any duplicate letters

[17:44:04.0000] <BenMillard>
word?

[17:44:05.0000] <Hixie>
word.

[17:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
:P

[17:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
BenMillard: I always thought it was "Great Scott"

[17:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
it is

[17:45:03.0000] <Dashiva>
oh.

[17:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
I was going to suggest "Gadzooks!" but that's probably of theistic origin

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: and lame. :-P

[18:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: you should probably let jules know that i just obliterated his changes and that the html5 spec is autogenerated so if he wants things in it changed he should talk to me

[18:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yeah, I'm reading mail now.. TimBL is the one who pointed out the link problem. Can you please change http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080609/ to http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-200806010/ ?

[18:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
already done

[18:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
not quite sure how that mistake happened, i assume the date of that draft changed from what we'd agreed or something

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not like i type those urls in by hand :-)

[18:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen_: would be useful for the validator to give warnings when in-document links are broken (href="#foo" with no id="foo")

[18:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: thanks

[18:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/stdout.txt already warns about that ("warning: can't find target for #repetition" etc)

[18:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That page would be much more useful without text/html content-type

[18:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
I blame Hixie :-)

[18:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: ah, interesting

[18:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i should, like, use that somehow

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh nevermind

[18:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
this will have far too many false positives

[18:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
because of all the #refsXXX

[18:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen_: nevermind

[18:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe if he put the ones starting with #refs in a separate section

[18:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think the validator's warning output should be specifically tailored to the warnings produced by the HTML5 spec...

[18:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Think of it was a plugin

[18:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
*as

[18:21:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Dashiva, yeah text/plain for stdout.txt would avoid the <h2> and so forth creating unclosed heading elements which make the text grow to dramatic sizes.

[18:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: seriously though, if you could let tim know that if there are broken links in the html5 spec he should talk to me instead of having the systeam just inplace edit the draft, that would be great. having a conflict broke my script and wasted at least 10 minutes of my time.

[18:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I'm not in the habit of telling Tim what to do. I'll ask Jules to check with me first if/when anybody reports problems to him about the editor's draft.

[18:27:00.0000] <Hixie>

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2008Oct/0010.html

[18:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok now that that is fixed, let's go back to <textarea>...

[18:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, the 4-links-in-a-heading totally seems like it should work, to me: http://www.rnib.org.uk/wacblog/articles/hidden-barriers/hidden-barriers-multiple-links-in-headings/

[18:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused

[18:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Why does AT software do things like that?

[18:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
isn't that just an AT bug?

[18:44:03.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, that's what it seems like to me.

[18:44:04.0000] <BenMillard>
item 3 in the numbered list also seems like it should work if correct punctuation is present, such as: <h1>News (<a href>RSS Feed</a>)</h1>

[18:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
<h1>News (<a href="">RSS feed</a>)</h1> seems a bit more dubious

[18:48:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, yes that specific use-case is hard to justifiy; I meant that <h1>Foo (<a href>Bar</a>)</h1> should read sensible and not sound like a link to "Foo Bar"

[18:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
agreed

[18:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie, the diffing on google sites kinda sucks, fix it

[18:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[18:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It keeps telling me I deleted the entire page, then added the exact same content back with the new stuff at the end :)

[18:51:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Dashiva, the description in item 3 makes me think the screen reader announces everything in the heading when a link inside that heading gets focus

[18:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: i've no idea what you're talking about :-)

[18:51:03.0000] <BenMillard>
Dashiva, maybe that's helpful much of the time but it does seem doomed to fail in fairly straightforward circumstances.

[18:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I know, you're just the closest google guy to pour my annoyances upon :P

[18:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
BenMillard: That makes sense, somewhat

[18:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: if you can give me steps to reproduce the bug from scratch, i can file the bug

[19:04:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: I'm not sure if you are the right one to bug, but http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/ is failing with a 500 error

[19:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me predicts broken .htaccess

[19:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: thanks, should be fixed in a few minutes

[19:12:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Thanks!

[19:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok dinner time

[19:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[19:17:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie & Dashiva, I left a comment: http://www.rnib.org.uk/wacblog/articles/hidden-barriers/hidden-barriers-multiple-links-in-headings/#comment-106532

[19:17:03.0000] <BenMillard>
(actually 2 because I forgot a link the 1st time)

[19:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
cool, it turned by straight punctuation into curly punctuation :)

[19:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
s/by/my/

[19:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: If I were you, I wouldn't be able to resist trying to post a comment using punctuation such that its curlification process gets everything wrong...

[19:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, you're a big meanie!

[19:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: I knew that already ;-)

[19:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why does anything exist, if not for people to break it?

[19:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm wondering if we have documented somewhere the cases in which the existing parsing behavior in IE differs from what parsing algorithm in HTML5.

[19:54:00.0000] <takkaria>
nope

[19:54:01.0000] <takkaria>
but there's a lot of them

[19:58:00.0000] <takkaria>
the main one is that HTML5 already results in trees, and IE doesn't

[19:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
takkaria: OK, I knew about that main one.

[20:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
When I was at Web Directions in Sydney, I was asked why the spec doesn't just document the IE parsing behavior.

[20:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean, in the cases where there are specific differences between parsing behavior in browsers.

[20:02:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
(and outside of the problem that IE doesn't actually use a tree)

[20:03:00.0000] <takkaria>
I got the impression that generally the spec was written to be as close to IE as possible but no closer

[20:03:01.0000] <takkaria>
some things it does are just weird, and other browsers have better behaviour

[20:03:02.0000] <takkaria>
some things will have been changed for better future extension, I would imagine

[20:05:00.0000] <takkaria>
but obviously, keeping a list of all IE's behaviour vs. HTML5 behaviour would be prohibitively expensive

[20:05:01.0000] <takkaria>
because you'd have to be able to reverse IE's algorithm exactly to do that

[20:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
takkaria: I see

[20:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
What I said to the person who asked me is pretty much the same as "some things it does are just weird, and other browsers have better behaviour"

[20:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I couldn't think of any specific cases

[20:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm sure I'll get asked again some time, so I want to educate myself about at least what some of the known cases are.

[20:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
<select> parsing I believe is weird in IE

[20:21:01.0000] <takkaria>
I'm sure Hixie will be able to mention a few

[20:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[20:28:00.0000] <takkaria>
Hixie called HTML5 "mostly complete" at the beginning of 2007

[20:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
some of the differences will also be in how document.write() interacts with parsing

[20:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1155195074&count=1

[20:34:00.0000] <takkaria>
MikeSmith: also http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1138169545&order=-1&count=5 and other posts with titles starting "Tag Soup"

[20:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
takkaria: thanks

[23:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
takkaria: thanks again very much for that pointer -- that's pretty much exactly what I was looking for

[23:32:00.0000] <krijnh>
Philip`: I know, sorry :)

[23:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria: mostly complete was right, it still had some features missing but most of the stuff was in.

[00:57:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
are there visualizations and/or test cases for crazy multilevel document.write() cases?

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me does his weekly read though w3c lists to keep up to date

[01:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's amazing how much time some groups spend talking about talking

[01:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
setting up meetings, etc

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
probably because nobody makes a decision beforehand

[01:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so aiui the svg 1.2 tiny spec is supposed to be proving two interoperable implementations with about 500 test cases

[01:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i didn't understand that "tiny" also referred to the test suite

[01:55:01.0000] <annevk2>
hahaha

[02:16:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me can't find longdesc on http://juicystudio.com/article/examining-wai-aria-roles.php

[02:17:00.0000] <annevk2>
and alt is useless "List of ARIA roles with the parent nodes and markup fragment in a table."

[02:17:01.0000] <annevk2>
sounds more like a title or summary

[02:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hi everyone, I'm back in Oslo

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, newValue of the StorageEvent interface is not properly linked

[03:47:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me will e-mail

[03:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: Did you see my complaint about your blog?

[04:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh yeah, I read that yesterday evening, not sure what happened

[04:01:01.0000] <annevk2>
when that happens it means there's a difference between submitting from a textarea and a hidden input

[04:01:02.0000] <annevk2>
which either means spambot or error in the browser...

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk2>
or something I'm missing, of course :)

[04:04:00.0000] <annevk2>
ah wait, it also happens when you use some entities

[04:05:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
wow i think this is the first time i've come across wf2 being used in the wild

[04:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: I claim I'm not a spambot, and it failed in three independent browsers so I guess it's not an error in the browsers :-)

[04:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I did have some &lt;s and things in the comment)

[04:07:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
saw a type="email" when requesting automatic payment, can't link to it unfortunately

[04:08:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, updated the message

[04:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe I should use a regular expression though then the chance of error will increase :)

[04:09:01.0000] <annevk2>
for some reason stray & just got passed through and were not found in error by the XML parser

[04:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
so a comment that contains & after normalizing most entities will not go through

[04:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: So how do I write a '<' character if I'm not allowed to use entities?

[04:10:02.0000] <annevk2>
not?

[04:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
?

[04:11:01.0000] <annevk2>
I had this plan of making better software at some point, but it never happened

[04:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
CDATA sections don't work either

[04:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
All I want to do is give an example of some XML code :-/

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
make your comment, omit & and I'll fix it for you

[04:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, posted it with full-width less-than/greater-than characters now

[04:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
which looks ugly but worked

[04:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
pretty hilarious that localStorage in IE is such a hack

[04:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is localStorage[""] meant to work?

[04:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I think that breaks in IE)

[04:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is anyone writing test cases for this storage stuff?

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe Firefox has some?

[04:28:01.0000] <annevk2>
seems that empty string should work

[04:28:02.0000] <annevk2>
undefined and null should stringify as Hixie didn't define other behavior

[04:30:00.0000] <annevk2>
heh, in another channel svl had a funny idea, start a "next week in HTML5" blog

[04:46:00.0000] <billyjackass>
"next week in HTML5" would be great

[05:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
wilhelm, yay!

[05:24:00.0000] <wilhelm>
annevk2: I'm not sure if that work should be done in the HTML WG or the Webapps WG, though. Opinions? (c:

[05:26:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
to me it seems to fall under Webapps mandate, but technically, it needs to be defined in terms of the event loop, which is in the HTML5 spec

[05:33:00.0000] <billyjackass>
wilhelm: what particular work are you referring to?

[05:34:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Timers (setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval). See my mail on public-html.

[05:36:00.0000] <billyjackass>
OK

[05:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
wilhelm, WebApps

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
wilhelm, references to HTML5 should be ok, though there will be some political arguments over it :)

[05:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[05:57:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
hi guys

[05:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
wilhelm: WebApps is the new W3C

[05:57:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I shoulda gotten into this quite a while ago

[05:58:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I was reading through the differences doc, and I thought about a few things

[05:58:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
first off, I heard rumors years ago that href was going to be a global attribute

[05:58:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
why hasn't that happened?

[05:58:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
tiglionabbit: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#HTML5_should_support_href_on_any_element.21

[06:00:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
hm

[06:01:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I still think it should, but oh well.

[06:02:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
have you read eric meyer's blog on this?

[06:02:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
when I was reading the form differences, I thought -- you know, people often use this pattern where they insert some grey placeholder text in a text input / textarea and then remove it when you focus it.  If that was added as an attribute, that would save me from a lot of terrible implementations of this

[06:02:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
zcorpan_: link?+

[06:03:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://meyerweb.com/eric/html-xhtml/html5-linking.html

[06:03:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
that would be placeholder='', implemented in webkit

[06:03:02.0000] <annevk2>
we'll likely add a placeholder attribute at some point

[06:03:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
cool

[06:16:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
one thing I was surprised about reading the differences doc was this phrase: "The new content model concepts (replacing HTML 4's block and inline concepts)."  -- now, this doesn't mean 'display:block' is going to be dropped from css, does it?

[06:19:00.0000] <virtuelv>
no

[06:19:01.0000] <virtuelv>
it doesn't

[06:19:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
so those concepts still exist

[06:20:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
tiglionabbit: html4's block and inline concepts have nothing to do with css

[06:20:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
by that you mean just the rules, like blocks can't go inside inlines?

[06:20:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
yeah

[06:21:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the content model concerns how you can nest elements

[06:21:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
css concerns how things are rendered

[06:21:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
they are orthogonal

[06:21:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
so you'd consider the default styles for various elements to still be in the domain of css

[06:21:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes

[06:22:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
man I wish IE would support inline-block, btw

[06:22:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
ie8 should support it in its ie8 mode

[06:22:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
what is ie8 mode

[06:22:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
what they call "standards mode"

[06:23:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
is it still triggered by using a doctype, any doctype?

[06:24:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it depends on whether you're in an intranet or on the web, and on meta tags, and http headers, and doctypes, and the phase of the moon

[06:25:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
just like encountering werewolves in nethack

[06:30:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
*skims*  aww, no years outside the 0-9999 limit.  Reminds me when I was showing my friend scaffolding in rails and he wanted to make an application about dinosaurs, and their extinction dates

[06:32:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
also, the <ruby> element -- that's existed for years, hasn't it?  I know it's been in all sorts of books, but I don't think it did anything

[06:32:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
tiglionabbit: <ruby> is supported in IE5.5+

[06:33:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
tiglionabbit: the Gregorian calendar wasn't around for dinosaurs

[06:34:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
hsivonen_: I know, but this format supports the julian calendar too (not that any calendar existed back then)

[06:34:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I was just chuckling, not making a suggestion

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
tiglionabbit: actually, HTML5 does *not* support the Julian calendar

[06:36:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
(definitely on the wrong side of the 80/20 rule)

[06:38:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
oops, misread that comment on converting julian to gregorian

[06:40:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
btw, the form attribute -- does that mean you can now pull things like <form id="form" action="stuff" /> <input type="text" form="form" /> ?

[06:40:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
that would be handy in situations where you want to have a different form on each table row, since you wouldn't be allowed to wrap <tr>s with <form>s

[06:41:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
speaking of which, will it become legal to wrap <tr>s and <li>s with meta elements like <form> and <a> and such?

[06:41:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
tiglionabbit: yes (except in text/html, you need <form ...></form> instead of <form .../>)

[06:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and no, it's not allowed to wrap <tr>s and <li>s in <form> or <a>

[06:42:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
hm

[06:42:02.0000] <hsivonen_>
(and won't be for legacy compat reasons)

[06:43:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
can we follow this pattern a little further and dissociate <a>s from their hrefs?  Like, <link id="google" href="http://google.com" /> <a link="google">search</a>

[06:43:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
would help to not repeat yourself, kinda like the way datalist helps

[06:44:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
also, it would be kinda like markdown

[06:44:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
i pushed for <form><tr> to be allowed back in ... 2005/2006, i think, making it parsed and styled like <tbody>, but it was rejected. form='' covers the use-case anyway

[06:46:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
you know, [whatwg][5] and then later on [5]:"www.whatwg.org"

[06:46:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
if you don't like typing html, you can type markdown and convert it to html

[06:47:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
:P I suppose

[06:47:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
but I'm not voicing against html here, but repetition of the same url within a document

[06:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
your suggested solution isn't backwards compatible

[06:49:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
you can use the internal subset with xhtml5

[06:49:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
use what?

[06:50:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
<!DOCTYPE html [ <!ENTITY google "http://google.com"> ]> ... <a href="&google;">

[06:51:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
what's that?

[06:51:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
where can I read about this stuff

[06:52:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the xml spec i guess

[06:52:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
specifiers of XML5 won't be happy with you if you use the internal subset

[06:52:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen_: anne has already specced the internal subset

[06:52:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I had never heard of the eclectic sgml they mentioned like <em/content/

[06:53:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
zcorpan_: perhaps it's too late to zap the internal subset :-(

[06:53:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
but now I want to know

[06:53:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen_: yes. it needs to be supported for compat with svg images output by some popular tool at least

[06:54:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
is inkscape that popular tool or no

[06:54:01.0000] <hsivonen_>
tiglionabbit: Illustrator

[06:54:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
oh...

[06:54:03.0000] <hsivonen_>
zcorpan_: or alternatively, the illustrator entities could be predefined

[06:54:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen_: heh

[06:55:00.0000] <ROBOd>
guys, sorry for interrupting: what's the problem with http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/ ?

[06:55:01.0000] <ROBOd>
i get internal server error

[06:59:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
oh hey, it's now legal to have attributes with no value, like <video controls> ?  What does that look like to javascript?

[07:01:00.0000] <jcranmer>
that's been legal since, oh, forever (or somehting close to that)!

[07:02:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
stuff like input checked?

[07:02:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
hm

[07:02:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I never did experiment with that -- would always be pedantic and say checked="true"

[07:02:03.0000] <annevk2>
which would be wrong

[07:02:04.0000] <tiglionabbit>
damn

[07:03:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
how do you interact with those attributes with javascript then?

[07:03:01.0000] <jcranmer>
the correct value would be checked="checked"

[07:04:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
oh..

[07:04:01.0000] <annevk2>
the W3C validator doesn't check for correct values

[07:04:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
tiglionabbit: <video controls> is exactly equivalent to <video controls="">

[07:04:03.0000] <annevk2>
validator.nu does

[07:05:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: it checks for enumerated and boolean attributes

[07:05:01.0000] <annevk2>
oh

[07:06:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and NUMBER attributes in html4

[07:06:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
e.g. tabindex

[07:07:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
though XML DTDs don't have NUMBER and so tabindex is CDATA in xhtml

[07:07:01.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, I think I would've been happy if I remained ignorant of that :)

[07:07:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
is id="5" still illegal?

[07:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it wasn't in html4 but is in html5

[07:08:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
er

[07:08:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
i got that backwards

[07:08:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
:B

[07:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ids in html5 can be anything but the emty string and can't contain whitespace

[07:09:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
Since there are no DTDs, does that mean we can't go wild and stick arbitrary tag names in?

[07:09:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
right

[07:09:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I noticed in quirksmode in firefox css will work on arbitrary tag names

[07:10:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
which made me want that to work in IE, but I never researched it enough

[07:10:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
works in standards mode too

[07:10:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
works in ie if you do createElement('foobar') first

[07:10:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
for every occurence or just once?

[07:11:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
just once

[07:11:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
interesting

[07:11:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
it makes ie treat such tags the same as it does for tags with colons in them

[07:12:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
do you guys consider it bad to make up one's own tags?

[07:12:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I suppose that's allowed in xml mode?

[07:12:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#HTML5_should_support_a_way_for_anyone_to_invent_new_elements.21

[07:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me wonders what the bookkeeping class is for in the spec source

[07:19:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
so that says data-* elements are safe -- is this true in earlier html versions?

[07:19:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
*attributes

[07:19:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes... but they aren't valid in earlier versions

[07:21:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
yeah but that whole 'validity' thing never really mattered, right :P

[07:21:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
why not?

[07:22:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
nothing bad happens?

[07:23:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
something bad happens when html n+1 introduces a new attribute with the same name as the one you invented

[07:23:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
some pages broke in opera when we implemented wf2

[07:24:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
wf2?

[07:25:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
though, to be fair, many of the problems were with dom attributes clashing with author's custom properties, and those are not checked in a validator (and authors are allowed to make up their own properties)

[07:25:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
web forms 2

[07:26:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
properties != attributes?

[07:26:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
and <input name>, <foo id> etc clutter the dom

[07:27:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
properties are attributes without values?

[07:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
no

[07:28:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
you have properties on objects in javascript

[07:28:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
ohh

[07:29:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
those properties

[07:30:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
btw, does anyone ever use the tbody tag?

[07:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: afaict, clicking a label fires a click event at the associated form control, which might bubble up to the label again (but the second click event won't fire a third click event)

[07:58:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: when clicking a link (or any other interactive element) in a label, the click event when bubbling through the label doesn't (or shouldn't) fire a click event on the associated form control

[07:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
though i haven't tested all form controls

[08:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
tiglionabbit: Loads of people use <tbody>, though maybe just because their tool emits it automatically

[08:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
tiglionabbit: e.g. http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/survey/2007-07-17/analyse.cgi/tag/tbody says 647 pages out of 7739 contain at least one <tbody>

zcorpan_, I think he knows that, we figured out activation behavior some time ago

[08:38:02.0000] <hsivonen_>
annevk2: you need 100 experience to gain a level :-)

[08:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan_, I think the idea was that it would be defined in DOM3Events, but you know...

[08:39:01.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen_, I got 3 upvotes today but I'm still 41

[08:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
not that it would make me 100, but still

[09:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>

[09:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan_, seems fine now

[14:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
csarven: :)

[14:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
csarven: I've actually managed to not have an OpenID.

[14:19:01.0000] <csarven>

/me mumbles something about URIs as identifiers of Web resources vs. URIs as identifiers of people

[15:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, yeah...I wonder why <blockquote><table> wasn't used: http://juicystudio.com/article/examining-wai-aria-roles.php

[15:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
maybe the way it looks is important and creating a <style> block to override the site's author stylesheet was too much work

[16:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
that "Horrifically bad technology" has moments which remind me of getting fiddly CSS layouts to rendering correctly cross-browser

[16:01:01.0000] <BenMillard>
difference being the implementations are what make CSS hard while it's the standards which make XML hard

[16:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, 2 links in a heading separated by a comma in the <h2> which starts “Social network portability”: http://alastairc.ac/2008/09/dconstruct-2008-notes/

[16:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, on that page, before scripts execute, with attribute values trimmed: <h2 id><a href>Social network portability</a>, <a href=""><cite>Tantek Çelik</cite></a></h2>

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess that makes sense, except for the misuse of cite (per html5)

[16:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me notices the link to OE-QuoteFix right at the end of the WHATWG FAQ and downloads it.

[16:40:00.0000] <hober>
BenMillard: it's pretty nice--I've been using it for a few months and it manages to do the right thing most of the time

[16:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hober, it isn't as integrated into OE as I was hoping.

[16:44:00.0000] <BenMillard>
and it doesn't untangle quotes which have been tangled by colleagues and companies

[16:44:01.0000] <BenMillard>
removing the big lump of header data and moving the insertion point below the message is already proving useful, though

[16:45:00.0000] <hober>
*nod*

[16:45:01.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, actually it doesn't move the insertion point

[16:47:00.0000] <hober>
It's not as good as `gnus-article-outlook-deuglify-article', but then again, what is? :)

[16:47:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hober, is that an actual thing or a joke?

[16:47:02.0000] <hober>
it's an actual Gnus command, bound to W Y f

[16:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Treat dumbquotes, unwrap lines, repair attribution and rearrange citation." -- http://quimby.gnus.org/gnus/manual/big-gnus.html

[16:51:00.0000] <hober>
It does a *remarkably* good job of it, too.

[16:51:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hober, the manual is giving me that impression as well :)

[16:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
an Outlook Express that untangles things in a seamless way would be awesome...I'll nose around what's available after the TPAC

[17:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
can i drop <textarea accept="">?

[17:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
or is anyone actually going to implement anything useful with it?

[18:49:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
Hixie: i'd use it as a complement for server side validating of (X)HTML content.

[18:49:01.0000] <erlehmann_>
Hixie: many blogs accept (X)HTML, but to not advertise it.

[18:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[18:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
still to do: form submission, validity constraints api, encoding form data, data templates

[18:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
getting there!

[18:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
form submission attributes, rather, form submission itself is done

[19:06:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
Hixie: "hm?" what type of comment is that ?

[19:09:00.0000] <BenMillard>
erlehmann_, it probably meant "Hmm? How would that work?"

[19:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann_: why would accept="" be relevant for that?

[19:27:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
can't i specify accept="application/xhtml+xml" and the browser would hint that to the user ?

[19:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure, but is any browser going to implement it?

[19:29:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
dunno. i'd probably rely on @pattern, with horrendous results

[19:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
<textarea pattern=""> is gone too actually :-)

[19:30:01.0000] <erlehmann_>
wat

no wai

[19:31:02.0000] <erlehmann_>

[19:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i dropped it in the transfer to html5

[19:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
couldn't find a good use case for it

validating BBcode ?

[19:33:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
that's the most obvious thing

[19:34:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
willyoubutitbackplease ?

[19:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
can that even be done using regexps?

[19:34:02.0000] <erlehmann_>
lemme think.

[19:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
don't ask for things before you even know if they'll work for the reason you ask for them :-)

[19:35:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
well, i think it can work

[19:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can't see a pretty way to do it

[19:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'd imagine that custom JS with the setValidity() method would be much more effective

[19:35:03.0000] <erlehmann_>
[list of bbcodes] + [list of other characters] combined with wildcard = win ?

[19:36:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
like (let me build it)

[19:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
show me what the value of pattern="" would be. :-)

[19:44:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
wait. regexes are only capable of describing a chomsky type-3 language. what i want, is to correctly parse a type-2 language.

[19:45:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
therefore, i can absolutely not count opening and corresponding closing brackets with regular expressions, right ?

[19:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
erlehmann_, that problem is something of a classic, although Philip` might have some ideas.

[19:46:01.0000] <erlehmann_>
:(

[19:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
like i said, not sure pattern="" is useful for <textarea>. :-)

[19:46:03.0000] <erlehmann_>
Hixie: you win. and again, i'm no match for the masters of the internet.

[19:47:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
BenMillard: nesting is the problem, i think. without nesting, no counting ...

[19:48:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
but what's with stuff like "enter a list of $stuff"

[19:49:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
though some of it becomes obsolete through the "add input" buttons, simply copying and pasting dozens of URLs into a textarea is easy at times

[19:49:01.0000] <erlehmann_>
gmail uses it

[19:50:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
and i recently encountered a guy who basically made trac tickets from CSV data

[19:51:00.0000] <BenMillard>
CSV is teh pwn

[19:51:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I much prefer it to XML

[19:51:02.0000] <erlehmann_>
(gmail uses it for mail adresses, of course)

[19:51:03.0000] <erlehmann_>
lol

[19:51:04.0000] <erlehmann_>
say, do you also prefer .INI over JSON ?

[19:52:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
:D

[19:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
well crap

[19:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
<form action=""> has nutty resolution semanics

[19:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
erlehmann_, I prefer .ini over the Windows registry. Haven't used JSON.

[20:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
still to do: validity constraints api, encoding form data

[20:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
nearly done!

[20:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, what do you think of the alt text for the two images in main content here: http://calthorpepark.hants.sch.uk/news/2008/points.htm

[20:37:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(and anyone else who's interested)

[20:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
the alt text is ok, but the paragraph before the first image isn't

[20:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
for non-visual users it reads:

[20:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
The first chart shows Marie Currie in the lead at the moment, but only just!

[20:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
Marie Curie lead with nearly 1,000 points. They are followed by Sommerville, Kilby and Da Vinci.

[20:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
At the start of the term all Houses started from zero points.

[20:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, hmm...the alt text was written by me, the surrounding text comes from staff

[20:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
is it the repetition you don't like?

[20:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
well there's no graph

[20:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, I see

[20:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
or chart rather

[20:42:02.0000] <BenMillard>
what if I remove "The first chart shows"?

[20:42:03.0000] <BenMillard>
(and adjust grammar to suit)

[20:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Marie Currie are in the lead at the moment, but only just!

[20:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
sounds good to me :-)

[20:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
the alt text could also give the number for the others, e.g. They are followed by Sommerville (300), Kilby (200) and Da Vinci (100).

[20:44:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I wasn't given the exact values yet but when I get them, I can add them.

[20:44:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I agree with putting parenthese around them, too :)

[22:30:00.0000] <Hixie>

Hixie, isn't it your bedtime? or are you offsetting your sleep cycle for TPAC?

[23:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: my bedtime? it's not even 11 yet. i normally go to bed around 4am.

[23:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, oh I forgot which timezone you're inj

[03:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann_: You can't do /(x*)y\1/ with theoretical regular expressions either (for the same reason you can't test for matching brackets), but practical implementations don't care about that theory :-)

[03:21:01.0000] <erlehmann_>
Philip`: tell me more.

[03:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but most practical implementations still don't support testing for matching brackets)

[03:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann_: What kind of more?

[03:23:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
practical implementations don't care ?

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Regular expression theory doesn't contain backreferences like \1, but they're (relatively) easy to implement and useful so everyone implements them anyway

[04:15:00.0000] <takkaria>
though implementations without them can run way way faster

Re: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2008/09/23-minutes : I wonder what "Losses of engineering quality" refers to

[05:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
"<timbl> I think it is important that the cases which don't meet the IRI spec are referred to as errors, even if the errors are ignored in HTML5 browser handling" - isn't that what http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#valid-url is about?

[05:56:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
I'm not sure what this clean/not-clean concern is about. I wonder if I should ask.

[05:57:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
html5: halal or haram?!?

[05:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen_: I assumed it was the usual distinction of valid HTML which authors should be told about / error handling of invalid HTML which browsers should be told about and should be hidden from authors

[05:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Apparently they want to split HTML5 into XHTML5 and HTML5-Tidy

[06:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: That sounds quite like how HTML5 works already, if you read "XHTML5" as "DOM" and "HTML5-Tidy" as "the HTML5 parsing algorithm"

[06:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
at least in the sense of converting into a form that is guaranteed to be free from syntax errors

[06:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Except the parsing algorithm also parses the clean markup

[06:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
(because it has no syntax)

[06:01:03.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: HTML5-Tidy processes clean markup too

[06:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But it's not needed for it

[06:02:01.0000] <Dashiva>
DOM alone is pretty useless :)

[06:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
You can generate the DOM from scripts, without involving the parser much at all :-)

[06:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Anyway, I'm wrong and I see your point :-)

[06:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But, but... then we can't continue

[06:03:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If I wanted to see a conspiracy, I'd say the tag wants to split the clean and non-clean so they can later deprecate the non-clean, or say people should only implement the clean :)

[06:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd guess it's just because uncleanliness offends their sensibilities, and they want the W3C to be producing nice technologies, not HTML5

[06:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Mr Last Week: Could you change your visited-link and date-line colour? It's very hard to read against the background, at least on my monitor with the sun shining on it

[06:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jar: Balance of power is different. In C the language had no power relative to the "browsers" (CPUs), so new CPUs could dictate language changes

[06:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't see how it's so very different now

[06:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't think of any examples of how C changed because of CPUs

[06:11:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
Philip`: CPU development has caused non-standard vectorization extensions to C, AFAIK

[06:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose that's true, but C specifically allows compilers to do that kind of thing

[06:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's just distributed extensibility, using the __ prefix to avoid collisions with future versions of the standard language

[06:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
And those extensions are just adding datatypes and things that look like library functions, and aren't really changing the language

[06:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, there's OpenMP which I guess is a more significant change to the language

[06:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
but that's got Open in its name so it must be a nice non-proprietary standard, and it isn't CPU-specific at all

[06:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and it's even backward-compatible)

[06:22:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
I guess Objective-C is just distributed extensibility, too, then?

[06:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's just a new language

[06:26:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
but every valid C program is a valid Objective-C program, right?

[06:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Quite possibly

[06:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
but the difference is that it's called Objective-C, not C

[06:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
and nobody release software they claim is a C compiler, when actually it's an Objective-C compiler

[06:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
*releases

[06:33:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me prefers "Subjective C"

[06:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"Objective C" would be a good name for a rapper

[06:34:01.0000] <jcranmer>
Surjective?

[06:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
so it's very different to releasing a C compiler, which happens to have been extended with some new features

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Objective C is the bunker on the left which we'll clear out once enemy resistance at the first two objectives has been suppressed

[06:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: heh

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well. I sent email asking what was meant with separation of clean and not-clean

[08:36:00.0000] <annevk2>
from DreamHost: "A suggestion you voted against has been marked completed!" yay, I'm all excited

[08:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
lol, the e-mail even suggests to re-submit the idea in case it was not completed to my satisfaction

what was the suggestion?

Hi, all. I am new to WHATWG and interested in Mobile Device API. Can someone tell me where to find out current WHATWG's efforts on Mobile Device API? Are there any cooperation between WHATWG and OpenAjax on Deviec API? Thanks.

[09:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
we're currently not working on such a thing and there are no plans afaik

[09:13:00.0000] <gfan>
annevk2: thanks. does WHATWG have some work on geolocation?

[09:14:00.0000] <Lachy_>
gfan, I'm fairly sure that the geolocation work is within the W3C, not the WHATWG

/me hates it when adding a single line to his LaTeX document makes it suddenly become ten lines larger than the page limit

[11:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
(But yesterday it was 1.5 pages over the limit, so it's not doing too badly)

[12:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it typical for French books to have the text on their spine the opposite way around to English books?

[12:45:00.0000] <john_fallows>
i see in the Server-sent Events section that servers are expected to send a "keep-alive" comment to prevent intermediate proxy servers from closing an otherwise dormant connection

[12:47:00.0000] <john_fallows>
how do we ensure that event latency is not adversely affected by intermediate proxy buffering?

[12:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
john_fallows: i am not aware of any way to avoid intermediate proxies from screwing everything up

[12:50:00.0000] <john_fallows>
would it help to specify that the browser should setup a tunnel with HTTP CONNECT first?

[12:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
so... who wants to be on the TPAC panel talking about the webarch document

[12:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
john_fallows: you can do that with WebSockets

[12:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
john_fallows: having them be different allows you to pick the one that works the best for a particular situation

[12:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
john_fallows: (dynamically)

[12:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
though frankly i've been tempted to just drop server-sent events altogether

[12:53:00.0000] <john_fallows>
i think Server-sent Events has a number of compelling features, and a clean integration with the browser event model

[12:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
so does WebSocket

[12:55:00.0000] <john_fallows>
yeah, but the events in WebSocket are not driven by the content, and can never be because it doesn't standardize the protocol (beyond framing), nor would it make sense to do so

[12:57:00.0000] <john_fallows>
also, Server-sent Events can recover from a broken TCP connection, making it very useful for broadcast failover

[12:59:00.0000] <john_fallows>
btw, we just released our WebSocket server on kaazing.org in case you are interested

[13:01:00.0000] <john_fallows>
there are clearly benefits to having Server-sent Events with a standard protocol syntax targeted at broadcast scenarios

[13:01:01.0000] <john_fallows>
and WebSockets with no standard payload syntax, targeted at bidirectional communication

[13:01:02.0000] <john_fallows>
almost like having UDP and TCP :-)

[13:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough :-)

[13:05:01.0000] <franksalim>
Hixie, john_fallows: i think the most compelling reason to keep SSE in addition to WS is that SSE is still HTTP and can be driven by current web servers

[13:06:00.0000] <john_fallows>
true - whereas WebSocket just uses HTTP-compatible bytes for the handshake

[13:09:00.0000] <john_fallows>
specifying HTTP CONNECT for Server-sent Events would seem to address the potential buffering issue though

[13:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
please send e-mail to the list to remind me to look into it

[13:11:01.0000] <john_fallows>
ok, sounds good - will do.

[13:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i'm not sure if we'll be able to do that -- if that worked, why wouldn't browsers just do that for all connections?

[13:15:00.0000] <john_fallows>
i suppose not all connections have a requirement to minimize latency of incremental parts of the response

[13:15:01.0000] <john_fallows>
i'll organize my thoughts and send an email to the list

[13:22:00.0000] <john_fallows>
btw, i'll also send a separate email regarding server-initiated flush to force a client acknowledgment and immediate reconnect, without affecting recovery timeout in network or server failure scenario

[15:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Is it possible to set up wildcard domains on html5.org, like to make *.philip.html5.org equivalent to philip.html5.org?

[15:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Need I bring any PS2 stuff? You have two controllers?

[15:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was gonna ask you the same question

[15:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't plan to bring anything

[15:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
unless you want me to

[15:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i have to go through the US customs so the less i bring the better)

[15:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Do you have GT4?

[15:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
um

[15:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe

[15:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
not sure

[15:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
if i do i haven't unlocked anything

[15:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Heh.

[15:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
There's only really any point in you bringing PS2 if we have two copies of GT4 so we can have it running over LAN and not split-screen

[15:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
As for not unlocking anything, I can bring memory card (my disk of it is screwed, and I can't bring my PS2 with me, mainly because it's old-style bulk)

[15:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd really rather not bring my ps2

[15:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
but we'll see

[15:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
On the whole, I'd say don't bother

[15:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[15:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, still here?

[15:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: yea

[15:42:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, just saw you pinged me in the logs

[15:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: and dropped email

[15:42:03.0000] <BenMillard>
I only have 1 bonafide PS controller

[15:42:04.0000] <BenMillard>
and no LAN cable

[15:42:05.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: So should I bring another?

[15:42:06.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: LAN cable is no issue, we will only have 1 PS2

[15:42:07.0000] <BenMillard>
ah, ok

[15:42:08.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, yes, do please bring 1 controller

[15:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: OK. Maybe I'll bring a game or two too :)

[15:43:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, sure...and your memory card if it's got anything useful on it

[15:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: It might, might not

[15:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Maybe I'll bring GT3…

[15:43:04.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I can bring that

[15:43:05.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: So can I. I'm in the middle of a race on it atm :P

[15:44:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the way GT3 models oversteer and drifting is my favourite of any game

[15:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I started GT3 from scratch on Monday to practice with slower cars :P

[15:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, you don't need to bring anything PS2-related unless it's an extra game (like GTA: foo?)

[15:48:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, easier if I bring both GT games, since my discs are probably in better condition than yours

[15:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: My GT3 works fine, that's why I'm playing that and not GT4 now :)

[15:48:02.0000] <BenMillard>
ok, if you really want to bring your copy then we'll use that

[15:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I have plenty to bring already :)

[15:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And I have to lug it around for a week first

[15:49:02.0000] <BenMillard>
GRR! so are you bringing it or am I? make your mind up!

[15:49:03.0000] <gsnedders>
You are

[15:49:04.0000] <BenMillard>
ok

[15:49:05.0000] <gsnedders>
That's the implication of that comment :P

[15:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ooo… I could bring NFS:HP2 (the best NFS game IMO), F1:05, and Tokyo Xtreme Racer

[15:50:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I remmber the first Hot Pursuit on PC, was great in 2P

[15:50:02.0000] <BenMillard>
F1 games can be hilariously unrealistic, so that might be intertaining

[15:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, the AI is lovely. You can easily lap them several times on hard.

[15:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(NFS as always has a rubber-band AI, so you never really thrash it)

[15:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(unless you turn the rubber-band off, and do an eight lap race)

[16:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, can't you be on the panel?

[16:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'll be editing html5.

[16:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, what if I edit it an hour for you (preferably a different hour, so I can watch the show :) )

[16:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see the point in participating. what difference does it make if the webarch document changes, even if we do convince people to change it?

[16:34:00.0000] <annevk2>
i was mostly concerned with the entertainment value

[16:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you want entertainment... the meeting is in a casino.

[16:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
and gsnedders and BenMillard will have a PS2

[16:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
i think i'd have more of a laugh during that panel, but we'll see :)

[16:41:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, dunno

[16:41:01.0000] <annevk2>
(re wildcard domains)

[16:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is trying to write some quick tests, but forgot how buggy browsers are

[16:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
(My current problem is that I can add a certain key into Firefox's globalStorage, which is impossible to remove again)

[16:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: Is there a thing where you can type in subdomain names and IPs, so you could put something like "*.philip" in the subdomain thing and point it at my server?

[16:44:01.0000] <annevk2>
I can make a custom DNS record

[16:44:02.0000] <annevk2>
I'm not sure if it does wildcards

[16:44:03.0000] <annevk2>
but give me an IP and I'll try

[16:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
92.243.11.39 would be nice

[16:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
"We have now added the A record for *.philip.html5.org with value 92.243.11.39. Our DNS servers will start serving this record within a couple of minutes."

[16:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
if that works i'll be impressed

[16:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
$ hostx foo.philip.html5.org ns1.dreamhost.com

[16:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
foo.philip.html5.org    A       92.243.11.39

[16:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like that does work - thanks!

[16:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[16:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
i am shocked

[16:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's awesome

[16:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
time to set up wildcard domains everywhere!

[16:48:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what to do now that he has control of an infinite number of origins

[16:48:06.0000] <Hixie>
not infinite

[16:48:07.0000] <Hixie>
just very very large

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
(dns names are length-limited and character-set limited)

[16:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Close enough to infinite for all practical purposes :-)

[16:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
and for many impractical purposes too

[16:49:03.0000] <annevk2>
btw, DreamHost still claims www.philip and ftp.philip, fwiw

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me turned off ftp

[16:50:01.0000] <annevk2>
ok, both btw and fwiw is a bit too much

[16:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
and you can turn off www, iirc

[16:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
dunno if that affects dns though

[16:50:04.0000] <annevk2>
I thought you could only make it redirect

[16:50:05.0000] <annevk2>
(which I do for all sites)

[16:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm maybe

[16:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i thought you could disable it

[16:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
i forget


2008-10-11
[17:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there a way to clear globalStorage in Firefox?

[17:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
(via the UI)

[17:05:00.0000] <annevk2>
btw, I can probably make *.philip.html5.org point back to the same server as philip.html5.org if you want

[17:05:01.0000] <annevk2>
why are you testing something that's removed from the specification?

[17:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: that won't work

[17:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: because philip.html5.org, if it's dreamhost, is a virtual server

[17:06:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm yeah, I suppose it would be a bit unclear where the requests go

[17:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's apparently possible to set ServerAlias *.example.com in Apache, but I don't know if Dreamhost supports that

[17:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
you might be able to ask them for it

[17:07:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, though actually, it seems all my domains have a unique value for the A record, so maybe it's possible

[17:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: it's not a dns problem, it's an apache problem

[17:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: Because it's kind of close to localStorage, which makes it easier to attempt to write tests for localStorage and to discover likely bugs

[17:11:00.0000] <gavin>
Philip`: at the bottom of Options->Advanced->Network, perhaps?

[17:12:00.0000] <gavin>
Philip`: there's also "Offline Website data" in Tools->Clear Private Data

[17:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
gavin: That Network -> Offline Storage thing seems different, since the list is empty and 'clear now' doesn't clear globalStorage

[17:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
gavin: Clear Private Data doesn't seem to clear it, either

[17:13:01.0000] <annevk2>
oops

[17:13:02.0000] <gavin>
uh, that sounds like a bug

[17:13:03.0000] <gavin>
I'm not really familiar with the various *storages

[17:13:04.0000] <gavin>
file a bug, cc dcamp?

[17:18:00.0000] <annevk2>
does anyone have a bot hitting html5.org a lot?

[17:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
not to my knowledge

[17:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, looks like clearing cookies works, as long as you restart the browser

[17:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
which pages?

[17:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: Google might have one

[17:19:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me keeps getting a x\uFFFDy key which he seems unable to delete

[17:19:05.0000] <annevk2>
it's not really a problem, but there is this thing that hits its 170000 times a month and probably more and identifies itself as "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)"

[17:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
and one that does it 20000+ and says "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0) Fetch API Request"

[17:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
From the same IP?

[17:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
neither of those are google

[17:20:03.0000] <annevk2>
no

[17:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
unless we have a rogue server

[17:20:05.0000] <Hixie>
(which is possible)

[17:20:06.0000] <Hixie>
which IPs?

[17:20:07.0000] <annevk2>
Google respects robots.txt no?

[17:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
unless we have a bug

[17:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
(which is possible)

[17:21:02.0000] <annevk2>
it's hitting /tools/web-apps-tracker which is not allowed to be indexed

[17:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
which IPs?

[17:21:04.0000] <annevk2>
nr1 IP is 203.162.3.165 but that's only 6000

[17:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
maybe that's why i was feeling the pain from html5.org :-)

[17:21:06.0000] <annevk2>
nr 2 is 203.160.1.70 with 4000

[17:21:07.0000] <Hixie>
203.162.3.165 is in vietnam, of all places

[17:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
203.162.3.165 appears to be a spam harvester

[17:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
203.160.1.70 looks like it's related

[17:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe a simple solution for now would be to just ban IE 5.5 :)

[17:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
so does any browser support <form accept-charset> ?

[17:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought they all did

[17:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
making some UTF-8 page, declare windows-1252 in that attribute, and see what happens?

[17:31:01.0000] <annevk2>
s/making/make/

[17:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
since I'm fairly sure I've had to use it to make forms always submit UTF-8

[17:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
i can't get forms to submit as anything but utf-8

[17:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://twitter.com/waka/statuses/953993561

[17:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me has not tried charsets+forms, but thinks that what Hixie says is weird

[17:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
fixed

[17:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/misc/form.html

[17:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
First goes to http://philip.html5.org/misc/form.html?foo=t%E9st, second goes to http://philip.html5.org/misc/form.html?foo=t%C3%A9st

[17:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
in Opera 9.5 and Firefox 3

[17:35:02.0000] <annevk2>
confirmed

[17:35:03.0000] <Philip`>
...but not IE8

[17:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
add <input type=hidden name=_charset_> to those forms?

[17:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Done

[17:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
they all send back C3 A9 when i paste it into the live dom viewer

[17:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
Opera is consistent, IE6 does iso always for Philip`'s example

[17:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
What if you do accept-charset=iso-8859-1 explicitly?

[17:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
same

[17:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
always utf-8

[17:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder why

[17:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
so for a UTF-8 page accept-charset is ignored?

[17:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
could be

[17:39:02.0000] <annevk2>
it makes some sense

[17:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, IE8 is a bit buggy - now that I have three identical forms on that page, it puts inconsistent spacing between them :-/

[17:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: can you make a copy of that page for utf-8?

[17:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
and utf-16 pretty please?

[17:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
also if you could cook me dinner that'd be awesome

[17:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/demos/charset/form/

[17:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
the utf-16 page is utf-8

[17:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's because I haven't finished writing it :-)

[17:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ahh, help!

[17:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
I pressed alt+right in IE8, and now the menu bar and toolbar and everything has slid off the top of the screen

[17:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
and I can't work out how to get it back

[17:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
the UTF-8 one works identical to the ISO encoded one in Opera/Firefox

[17:44:01.0000] <annevk2>
that is, accept-charset is acknowledged

[17:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: If you don't have it, get my phone number from http://stuff.gsnedders.com/http-parsing.html

[17:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: probably the only safe way to contact me until TPAC now

[17:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: (UTF-16 is there now)

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand what IE is doing

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
IE8b2

[17:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't work at all half the time

[17:47:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I've got your dinner ready here, you'd better come now or it'll get cold

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[17:48:01.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, in Opera default will say _charset_ UTF-8

[17:48:02.0000] <annevk2>
in Firefox it says UTF-16LE but seems to submit UTF-8

[17:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me adds POST to those pages

[17:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh i know what's confusing me

[17:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
<meta charset> is ignored if you're document.write()ing

[17:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
so all these docs are utf-8 when i put them in the dom viewer

[18:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[18:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me learns of a security vulnerability caused by flash allowing Content-Type to be set cross-domain

[18:11:00.0000] <olliej>
yay flash!

[18:50:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: really?!

[18:52:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, "set cross-domain"?

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
as in, for a cross-domain request

[18:56:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, ah

[18:56:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i thought they only allowed that when there was a crossdomain.xml file there?

[18:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently not, though even if that was that was the case, given how easy it is to trick a server into serving a crossdomain.xml file...

[19:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
WF2 integration status:  100%  [#############]  Please Stand By...

[19:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
WF2 integration status:  Complete.

[19:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, mostly. i still need to go through and copy examples over and do a thorough review of the material in wf2 to make sure it's all moved over.

[19:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
but next week i'll start focusing on the feedback that built up over the last 6 weeks

[20:17:00.0000] <wakaba>
Hixie: accept-charset DOM attribute -> acceptCharset?

[21:21:00.0000] <dglazkov>
ping annevk2

[01:07:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
sometimes, old people are awesome - "man, the last time I had to throw together some HTML, I was constantly doing things like \begin{center}."

[01:26:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, not WF2 feedback from the last few years? :)

[02:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
it's a bit sad that external data providers for <select> and <datalist> are gone

[02:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
no one-liner google suggest? :(

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
indeed

[02:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
though hopefully now that it's somewhat simpler other browsers will implement the new form controls

[02:38:01.0000] <annevk2>
can always be added back in in forms v3

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk2>
Web Forms 2.0 had a five year anniversary since the first official draft September 5

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`__: yes, it it typical for French books to have the spine text upside-down when the cover of the book faces up

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what caused the differing conventions

[06:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
French book spine text is one of the great mysteries of local customs

[06:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Are their bookshelves RTL?

[07:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/search/webcrawler/slurp-14.html

[07:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems nicer than Google's approach of using magic comments to indicate regions of the page that should be processed differently

[07:51:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe we should host Anolis on Google App Engine?

[07:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
That won't work, since the CPU quota per request is tiny

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, where is that stated?

[07:57:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me only sees a daily limit

[07:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: Not sure, but I've seen people on blogs complaining that it doesn't like them spending more than fractions of a second on a request

[07:58:01.0000] <annevk2>
pointers?

[08:00:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm

[08:00:01.0000] <annevk2>
"Google App Engine does not support any data structure that is larger than 1MB in size."

[08:00:02.0000] <annevk2>
and "Not only are your calls limited to returning in 10 seconds but if you actually try to do anything too stressful within those calls, you will quickly hit the short-term high CPU quota limit."

[08:00:03.0000] <annevk2>
from http://aralbalkan.com/1504

[08:04:00.0000] <annevk2>
there's http://www.10gen.com/ which seems to be competing with GAE

[08:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
What's wrong with where it's currently hoste?

[08:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
s//d/

[08:05:02.0000] <annevk2>
my version is too slow :)

[08:05:03.0000] <annevk2>
but yeah, prolly not much

[08:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Parallelised scalable hosting things won't help when the problem is that a single serial Python script is too slow

[08:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how didn't this issue surface during the long ARIA naming debate: http://annevankesteren.nl/2008/10/ie8-bad-update#comment-6641

[08:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
in retrospect ariavaluenow etc. would've been better

[08:45:00.0000] <annevk2>
also more consistent with on*

[08:50:00.0000] <takkaria>
you wonder why IE can't special-case aria attributes, really, in pre-IE8 mode

[08:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I also wonder why people from MS were silent on this

[08:50:02.0000] <annevk2>
that should be doable too, yes

[08:51:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, yeah, see my comment further down, no idea :/

[08:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and if non-MS people would have caught this had ARIA been specced in a more open way

[08:51:02.0000] <annevk2>
they're still silent on it

[08:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that IE8 returns undefined, not null, when getting nonexistent keys

[09:04:00.0000] <takkaria>
I wonder if the IE team ever tries to run other people's testsuites

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not aware that any other people have made testsuites for all this stuff

[09:25:00.0000] <takkaria>
I thought firefox had tests for localStorage, I may be wrong though

[10:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
Firefox does not support it...

[10:14:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh wait, maybe it did land like a week ago

[15:46:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
oh I just thought of something.  Of the new form fields that are included for the sake of client-side validation, we have url, but we don't have phone number.  Quite often I see the annoying pattern of 3 text fields with javascript jumps between them.  It would be great to see a standard phone number field that eliminated this bad practice

[15:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
tiglionabbit: How would you validate a phone number?

[15:49:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
start with the country code, or intuit it from the user's locale if you can't, then check if it follows the correct pattern

[15:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Could the pattern be anything more complex than /\d+/?

[15:49:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
what would be really nice would be to see a form field that behaves like a cell phone does when you start entering a number

[15:50:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
formatting it with hyphons and parenthesis as you type

[15:50:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
that are not actually part of the text

[15:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd assume that's a huge amount of work to cover every locale, and would be out of date quite quickly

[15:51:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
do cell phones have this problem?

[15:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
They're phones, so they're designed to dial numbers, so I guess they have the motivation and resources to do all that work :-)

[15:55:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
hm.  I know you have to type the hyphons in Japan, but..  what other countries don't follow the 3-3-4 pattern

[15:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
What if I want to enter a phone number like 999?

[15:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me (in the UK) usually formats phone numbers like 01234 567890

[16:01:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
true, there are local numbers like 411

[16:02:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
what I mean to say though is, regardless of how complicated it is, it has been done -- cel phones are a reference implementation

[16:03:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
and it can just fall back to a text field otherwise

[17:59:00.0000] <BenMillard>
tiglionabbit, my phone doesn't insert punctuation and I'm glad about that

[17:59:01.0000] <BenMillard>
it converts any 00 at the start into + and that's it

[18:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
in my area of the UK, we use (01234) 567 891

[18:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
on TV, I see 0800 12 34 56 or 0800 123 456 or 0800 123 4567 and so forth

[18:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the (01234) is optional if your own number starts with the 01234 "area code", hence the parentheses

[18:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
as such, <input type="tel"> would need to permit the digits 0-9, parentheses (), hyphen-minus -, and space

[18:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
in the USA I know companies often use the letters which appear on the corresponding number instead of the number...

[18:07:00.0000] <svl>
tiglionabbit: I'd suspect the US is one of the few countries to follow that 3-3-4 pattern. The Netherlands has 06-23456789 (mobile) or 012-3456789 or 0123-456789 (landlines). Australia has 0423-456789 for cell, new zealand has 01-23456789 for landlines, etc.

[18:07:01.0000] <BenMillard>
svl, and W3C puts dots in international numbers :)

[05:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL. I wonder what made him thing XFrames is part of the HTML5 work

[06:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay. a new standards suck episode

[08:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=993341&cid=25353353

[08:20:00.0000] <ehird>
Lachy: That's slightly ridiculous.

[08:20:01.0000] <ehird>
Just about -nothing- supports <video> presently.

[08:20:02.0000] <ehird>
(Also, google have a vested interest in adding petty, easily-breakable barriers to downloading: because the big megacorps want to feel safe.)

[08:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
ehird, yeah, right now, the suggestion isn't realistic. But give it a few years, when browsers have actually shipped with support for <video> and the codec issue has settled a bit, they could begin migrating to it

[08:24:01.0000] <ehird>
Lachy: You're forgetting about IE.

[08:25:00.0000] <ehird>
(Which I commend you for - I wish I could.)

[08:25:01.0000] <ehird>
Lachy: Even so, see my last line.

[08:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's interesting to see the lengths the BBC iPlayer has gone to to prevent people downloading the iPhone-compatible MPEG4 versions of programmes on anything other than an iPhone, with strict checks on the exact sequence of HTTP requests made

[08:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
ehird, which "last line" are you referring to?

[08:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
but then they seem to have given up months ago

[08:29:01.0000] <ehird>
<ehird> (Also, google have a vested interest in adding petty, easily-breakable barriers to downloading: because the big megacorps want to feel safe.)

[08:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
and you can find plenty of simple scripts that you can give a URL and it'll download the MPEG4 onto your PC

[08:29:03.0000] <ehird>
Of course.

[08:29:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder what the YouTube attitude towards old versions of Flash Player is

[08:29:05.0000] <Philip`>
so their protection has totally failed

[08:29:06.0000] <ehird>
But as long as they have stupid checks that mean nothing, the feeling of safety is given to those who request it.

[08:29:07.0000] <ehird>
If you see what I mean.

[08:29:08.0000] <Lachy>
ehird, since the megacorps don't own most of the content on YouTube, despite what some of them might like to claim, I find that difficult to believe

[08:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, do they feel that they need to support old versions that have security holes

[08:30:01.0000] <ehird>
Lachy: I'm talking about the recent collaborations with them.

[08:30:02.0000] <gpy>
is <br/> underestimated?

[08:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder where I can find those CBS videos on YouTube, and if they're available outside the USA?

[08:33:00.0000] <ehird>
Lachy: As for the latter half: unlikely.

[08:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.youtube.com/blog?entry=F1xABdzKby4

[08:33:02.0000] <Lachy>
nope, they're not available in Norway at least

[08:33:03.0000] <ehird>
*shrug* Media sucks. I'm sure we all know this...

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
which sucks, especially given that the shows they've started with are really old

[08:34:01.0000] <ehird>
Not accessible in the UK, either.

[08:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
it's not like they're shows which have yet to air in other countries

[08:34:03.0000] <ehird>
Lachy: YouTube probably couldn't afford the extra cash for extra country licenses or whatever other rubbish CBS forced on them

[08:35:00.0000] <ehird>

Ha. Ha. Ads! Wonderful!

[08:35:03.0000] <ehird>
Lachy: Hulu is easily bypassable, iirc, so I imagine this is too.

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
CBS might have exclusive distribution licences with people in other countries, and be unable to let YouTube distribute things worldwide

[08:36:01.0000] <ehird>
Ahhh. That seems most likely.

[08:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me noticed a while ago that Comedy Central seems to block access from the UK specifically, rather than permitting specific countries, which seems slightly odd

[08:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, right, that's just because Channel 4 now shows their shows in the UK

[08:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
territory-scoped media distribution deals are so last century

[08:40:00.0000] <Lachy>

/me is still wondering if the iTunes Movie Rental "international later this year" ends up meaning a couple of English-language countries

<Lachy> hsivonen, pretty much all deals made by large media companies these days are using last centuries business models

[08:43:01.0000] <ehird>
Truth!

[08:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Doesn't that mean they're this century's business models too?

[08:43:03.0000] <ehird>
Philip`: No, because people are starting to get a clue and evolving them. 

[08:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, I mean they're business models designed for last century's technology and distribution networks, being brutally applied to this century's

[08:46:00.0000] <annevk3>

/me updates <http://stuff.gsnedders.com/http-parsing.html> for the first time in ages

(Only section 3 and the to-do list has been touched)

[09:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Interestingly, behaviour varies a lot for one or two things

[09:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
HTTP/1.1 12 Foobar

[09:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
How should that be treated?

[09:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Saf/Leopard treats it as an invalid HTTP/1.1 response, and treats it as HTTP/0.9 (i.e., it is all data, no headers)

[09:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Firefox treats it as 12

[09:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So does Opera

[09:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Even more varied over HTTP/1.1 1234 Foobar

[09:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Saf/Leopard again invalid

[09:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Firefox status-code: 1234 reason-phrase: "Foobar"

[09:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Op: status-code: "123", reason-phrase: "4 Foobar"

[09:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
IE follows Fx

[09:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(or, more likely, Fx follows IE)

[09:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(and both probably follow NN)

[09:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
IE, Op and Fx all use null-terminated strings for header values

[09:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
With no reason-phrase given, IE defaults to "Close"

[09:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Which I guess it uses as the next thing after any *LWS

[09:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
IE uses a list of headers that can be concatenated with ", ", everything else uses a list of headers to only use the first of

The photograph should:

[13:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
be in portrait orientation (with a height to width ratio of 6:5)

[13:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
be in colour

[13:11:04.0000] <gsnedders>
have a plain light coloured background

[13:11:05.0000] <gsnedders>
show your head and the top of your shoulders only, with your face central on the picture

[13:11:06.0000] <gsnedders>
be of good colour definition, not too dark or light

[13:11:07.0000] <gsnedders>
be in focus

[13:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
show your face un-obscured (no sunglasses, hat or scarf) unless you wear glasses or cover your hair for religious reasons

[13:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
show you acting naturally, not smoking, not with other people or in a 'holiday snap'

[13:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't think I have any that meet that description

I need to get a real macro lens

[14:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It's not just you, since it says "Plug-in content" to me, but that's not surprising since I don't have any working plugins

[14:48:00.0000] <erlehmann>
had they used <video>

Just link to an MPEG4 download - it's really not that hard :-p

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/CoreText_Programming/Overview/chapter_2_section_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005533-CH3-DontLinkElementID_14

[15:09:01.0000] <onitunes>
that's basically the API I'm using on the desktop

[15:09:02.0000] <onitunes>
I'm building an in-browser IDE with SproutCore

[15:09:03.0000] <onitunes>
but I have to do all of the text manipulation on the server, because the client-side APIs aren't there yet

[15:10:00.0000] <onitunes>
I basically have a grip of span tags with one character each

[15:10:01.0000] <onitunes>
that fill up the visible area in a scrollable div

[15:10:02.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: are you sure this is really a task that is suitable to canvas?

[15:10:03.0000] <onitunes>
and as the user scrolls, I update the innerText and span classes to syntax highlight correctly

[15:11:00.0000] <onitunes>
to handle text selection, I have a <canvas> tag overlayed and I forward the mouse down to the server, get the results back, and update drawing

[15:11:01.0000] <roc>
if you're building a text editor, we probably want to find a way to make contenteditable do what you need

[15:11:02.0000] <onitunes>
sorry, this is not HTML

[15:11:03.0000] <onitunes>
that whole API sucks

[15:11:04.0000] <onitunes>
it's like FrontPage for the browser

[15:11:05.0000] <onitunes>
:P

[15:11:06.0000] <onitunes>
which is the real problem

[15:12:00.0000] <onitunes>
you guys are writing for HTML people

[15:12:01.0000] <onitunes>
I just want to display text

[15:12:02.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: so your solution is to complain about a bitmap api rather than make suggestions for improving contenteditable?

[15:12:03.0000] <onitunes>
and basically, I'm working around the browser to get it to do that

[15:12:04.0000] <roc>
you really want the browser to understand that you're editing text

[15:12:05.0000] <onitunes>
who's complaining?

[15:12:06.0000] <roc>
otherwise stuff like IMEs won't work

[15:13:00.0000] <onitunes>
I just think it's incredible that text layout metrics are not available in the browser

[15:13:01.0000] <roc>
I would like to make them available in the browser, but it's complicated because of issues like font selection

[15:13:02.0000] <onitunes>
not anyone's fault, and I'm happy to patch <canvas> to add support for the 5 Core Text objects-

[15:13:03.0000] <onitunes>
really, this is not a big API

[15:14:00.0000] <onitunes>
anyway, I can do what I'm doing now, because I always have a server

[15:14:01.0000] <roc>
Core Text is much more than exposing text layout metrics

[15:14:02.0000] <onitunes>
agreed

[15:14:03.0000] <onitunes>
but it's pretty fundamental

[15:14:04.0000] <onitunes>
stuff

[15:15:00.0000] <onitunes>
I would expect JavaScript library authors to wrap it and provide a higher-level API

[15:15:01.0000] <onitunes>
but today, we have to wrap even higher-level APIs

[15:15:02.0000] <onitunes>
to do things they were never meant to do

[15:16:00.0000] <onitunes>
and do inefficiently at that

[15:16:01.0000] <roc>
that approach will never work with IMEs so it's simply not the right way to go

[15:16:02.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: your approach will not work with IME's.  It just won't be possible

[15:16:03.0000] <onitunes>
?

[15:16:04.0000] <olliej>
roc: :P

[15:16:05.0000] <onitunes>
what does IME have to do with this?

[15:16:06.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: international input

[15:16:07.0000] <onitunes>
yes, I know what it is

[15:16:08.0000] <Hixie>
if you're writing a text editor, you're going to have to use contenteditable or textarea or input type=text, otherwise you won't be accessible to things like voice browsers or other non-graphical user agents

[15:16:09.0000] <onitunes>
this has *nothing* to do with text input

[15:17:00.0000] <roc>
you said you were writing an IDE, I assumed this was about text editing

[15:17:01.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: I already do the textarea thing

[15:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[15:17:03.0000] <onitunes>
but it's dumb

[15:17:04.0000] <onitunes>
just there to grab keystrokes

[15:17:05.0000] <roc>
maybe you should explain your requirements instead of just telling us what we shoud do

[15:17:06.0000] <onitunes>
which I forward on to a server

[15:17:07.0000] <Hixie>
so what is it you are trying to do?

[15:17:08.0000] <onitunes>
roc: I never said anyone should do aynthing

[15:17:09.0000] <onitunes>
I asked about submitting a patch

[15:18:00.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: I want to be able to render an attributed string inside a <canvas> like tag, with functionality equivalent to that exposed by Core Text on Mac OS X

[15:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me would hope browser developers wouldn't accept patches if they didn't know what you were trying to do which needed that patch

[15:18:02.0000] <roc>
tell us what you're trying to achieve, not how you think you should do it

[15:18:03.0000] <olliej>
Philip`: we wouldn't

[15:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: why?

[15:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: what are you trying to do?

[15:19:01.0000] <onitunes>
:/

[15:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
note that even if you wrote a patch for mozilla and webkit, you can't do that for microsoft and opera, so at some level you're asking for the spec to change and for the browsers to implement something, so we need to understand what you want and why :-)

[15:19:03.0000] <onitunes>
let me turn this around then

[15:20:00.0000] <onitunes>
why does Apple provide developers with Core Text?

[15:20:01.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: just tell us what you want

[15:20:02.0000] <olliej>
to do

[15:20:03.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: why is that so hard

[15:20:04.0000] <onitunes>
what am I, some Noob who just needs to learn the API?

[15:20:05.0000] <onitunes>
I already did that

[15:20:06.0000] <onitunes>
"I want to be able to render an attributed string inside a <canvas> like tag, with functionality equivalent to that exposed by Core Text on Mac OS X"

[15:20:07.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[15:20:08.0000] <onitunes>
why does that matter

[15:20:09.0000] <onitunes>
seriously

[15:20:10.0000] <roc>
even if he wrote a patch for Mozilla, we aren't just going to take it unless we agree it's a necessary and good API. Taking patches is not free

[15:20:11.0000] <Hixie>
because we design APIs to address use cases

[15:21:00.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: because there might be a better way to do it

[15:21:01.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: supporting hacks is not the task of a standard -- we want sensible solutions to general problems

[15:21:02.0000] <onitunes>
that's exactly what Core Text is

[15:21:03.0000] <olliej>
/me face palms

[15:22:00.0000] <olliej>
/me goes off to do something productive

[15:22:01.0000] <onitunes>
"The Core Text framework is an advanced, low-level technology for laying out text and handling fonts."

[15:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
CSS is an advanced, low-level technology for laying out text and handling fonts.

[15:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe you should use CSS?

[15:22:04.0000] <onitunes>
jeez

[15:22:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's hard to know what you actually need if you won't tell us :-)

[15:22:06.0000] <onitunes>
I do, it sucks

[15:22:07.0000] <roc>
onitunes: you've got key people for three different projects all giving you attention, and you've squandered it

[15:22:08.0000] <onitunes>
I don't understand why you guys get to decide what I "need"

[15:23:00.0000] <onitunes>
I fail to see how

[15:23:01.0000] <onitunes>
I said *exactly* what I wanted, and why

[15:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
onitunes: We're asking what you need, not telling you what you need

[15:23:03.0000] <onitunes>
I need to be able to lay out styled text within a <canvas> like tag

[15:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[15:23:05.0000] <onitunes>
using a programmatic, not DOM-oriented API

[15:24:00.0000] <onitunes>
because that's what text layout applications do

[15:24:01.0000] <onitunes>
and text editors are, in part, text layout applications

[15:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
what is a "text layout application"?

[15:24:03.0000] <onitunes>
TextMate

[15:24:04.0000] <onitunes>
Emacs

[15:24:05.0000] <onitunes>
vi

[15:24:06.0000] <onitunes>
terminals

[15:24:07.0000] <onitunes>
Adobe InDesign

[15:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
text editors are intended to be addressed by contentEditable and CSS; what is it about contentEditable and CSS that can't replicate the functionality of TextMate, Emacs, vi, terminals, InDesign, etc?

[15:25:01.0000] <onitunes>
they are DOM-oriented

[15:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
right, that's a feature

[15:25:03.0000] <onitunes>
for me, it's a bug

[15:25:04.0000] <onitunes>
I'm not creating HTML

[15:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[15:25:06.0000] <onitunes>
so I have to extract out the text from the HTML

[15:25:07.0000] <Hixie>
what are you creating?

[15:25:08.0000] <onitunes>
text

[15:26:00.0000] <onitunes>
have you seen the madness people have gone through trying to implement syntax highlighting in the browser?

[15:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
so what's wrong with using HTML? It's a text markup languae.

[15:26:02.0000] <onitunes>
exactly

[15:26:03.0000] <onitunes>
MARKUP

[15:26:04.0000] <onitunes>
I'm not creating HTML

[15:26:05.0000] <onitunes>
or any other kind of markup

[15:26:06.0000] <onitunes>
I'm creating raw text, and styling it

[15:26:07.0000] <olliej>
eg. marking it up

[15:27:00.0000] <onitunes>
/me palms in hands

[15:27:01.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: have you tried node.innerText ?

[15:27:02.0000] <onitunes>
seriously?

[15:27:03.0000] <onitunes>
of course I have

[15:27:04.0000] <roc>
Daniel Glazman has implemented a general syntax highlighting package that works with the DOM and HTML

[15:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
i'm afraid i am not understanding your request. I encourage you to read our FAQ and post your feedback straight to the mailing list where I can give it a longer and more considered response when I have more time available. FAQ: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ Mailing list: http://whatwg.org/mailing-list#specs

[15:28:00.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: you want to display styled content -- that means markup

[15:28:01.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: you don't have to save markup

[15:28:02.0000] <roc>
sure, contenteditable etc could be improved, and we'd welcome suggestions on how to do that, but without contenteditable you won't get IME support or accessibility, so your approach of reimplementing text editing from scratch is not the right way to go.

[15:28:03.0000] <onitunes>
hmm, styled text != markup

[15:29:00.0000] <onitunes>
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree there

[15:29:01.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: yes it does, NSAttributedString (of which you seem so enamoured) is a string with markup

[15:29:02.0000] <roc>
(you also won't get the right platform-specific editor UI)

[15:29:03.0000] <onitunes>
of course it is

[15:29:04.0000] <onitunes>
but it's not DOM nodes

[15:29:05.0000] <onitunes>
which is what you're suggesting I use

[15:29:06.0000] <onitunes>
along with CSS

[15:29:07.0000] <Hixie>
do DOM nodes have cooties or something?

[15:30:00.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: yes, because you're in a browser

[15:30:01.0000] <onitunes>
then tell me this: why does <canvas> exist?

[15:30:02.0000] <onitunes>
why not SVG?

[15:30:03.0000] <olliej>
onitunes: you're asking for a non browser technology so that you can create an in browser ide -- do you not see the problem with this?

[15:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: mostly to allow people to render platform games and fractals

[15:30:05.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: then why not SVG?

[15:30:06.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: or to draw graphs

[15:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: you can't do fractals with SVG

[15:31:01.0000] <onitunes>
because retained-mode APIs are high-level

[15:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
no

[15:31:03.0000] <onitunes>
sometimes, you just want to paint

[15:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
canvas is as high-level as svg

[15:31:05.0000] <onitunes>
why we can't paint text is beyond me

[15:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
it's just for a different set of use cases

[15:31:07.0000] <Hixie>
you can paint text

[15:31:08.0000] <Hixie>
you just can't measure it very well :-)

[15:31:09.0000] <Hixie>
or paint it along a path or to a path

[15:32:00.0000] <onitunes>
why is there resistance to this?

[15:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
to what?

[15:32:02.0000] <onitunes>
low-level text rendering in a canvas tag

[15:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
canvas already has low-level text rendering

[15:33:00.0000] <onitunes>
without layout, it's not worth much

[15:33:01.0000] <Dashiva>
/me has bad memories of having to make a bitmap font for text rendering in canvas back in 2006

[15:33:02.0000] <roc>
I explained clearly why your approach is not the right direction for text editing.

[15:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't have metrics because it is as yet still early days and nobody has given a convincing problem they're trying to solve for which we need to expose text metrics

[15:33:04.0000] <onitunes>
roc: it's not for text editing

[15:33:05.0000] <Hixie>
so what is it for?

[15:33:06.0000] <onitunes>
text rendering

[15:33:07.0000] <onitunes>
Core Text has nothing to do with editing

[15:33:08.0000] <Hixie>
that's what CSS is for

[15:33:09.0000] <Hixie>
Core Text has nothing to do with the Web either :-)

[15:34:00.0000] <roc>
you have refused to tell us what it actually is for, so we have to guess

[15:34:01.0000] <onitunes>
the browser != the web

[15:34:02.0000] <onitunes>
and it does have something to do with the browser

[15:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not really sure what that means

[15:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
Core Text is a Mac OS specific technology

[15:34:05.0000] <Hixie>
it has little to do with browsers in general

[15:35:00.0000] <onitunes>
if you say so

[15:35:01.0000] <onitunes>
you could say the same about video and audio, but low and behold, there are <video> and <audio> tags

[15:35:02.0000] <onitunes>
my original question was: could we make a <text> tag

[15:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
video is not a Mac OS specific technology either :-)

[15:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
we have one

[15:35:05.0000] <onitunes>
that worked like <canvas>, but let you control layout

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
we have two, in fact

[15:36:01.0000] <roc>
why don't you just tell us why HTML and CSS don't satisfy your needs

[15:36:02.0000] <roc>
if you can't do that, you're just wasting our time

[15:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
(namely, one in SVG (<text>), and one in HTML (<span>), both of which are styled with CSS)

[15:36:04.0000] <onitunes>
roc: incremental rendering

[15:37:00.0000] <onitunes>
with the DOM, you have to include everything in the DOM for it to lay things out for you

[15:37:01.0000] <roc>
good, be more specific

[15:37:02.0000] <onitunes>
a 1MB file cannot have the full DOM created and updated, with correct syntax highlighting, in realtime, on each key press

[15:38:00.0000] <onitunes>
to work around that, programmers cheat:

[15:38:01.0000] <onitunes>
they take a grid, say 400 characters wide by 400 characters tall

[15:38:02.0000] <onitunes>
and make each cell in the grid a <span> tag

[15:38:03.0000] <onitunes>
then the use node.innerText to update the character

[15:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
um, that is patently untrue. load the HTML5 spec in a browser and type javascript:document.body.contentEditable=true into the location bar

[15:38:05.0000] <onitunes>
and set the correct class on each tag

[15:38:06.0000] <Hixie>
pronto, a 2MB+ document editing in realtime

[15:39:00.0000] <onitunes>
contentEditible is for HTML

[15:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[15:39:02.0000] <onitunes>
I'm not editing HTMl

[15:39:03.0000] <onitunes>
I'm editing text

[15:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
why not?

[15:39:05.0000] <Hixie>
so mark your text up in HTML

[15:39:06.0000] <onitunes>
just raw, plain old syntax-highlight texd

[15:39:07.0000] <Hixie>
raw, plain old syntax-highlighted text is exactly what HTML is

[15:40:00.0000] <onitunes>
nonsense

[15:40:01.0000] <onitunes>
HTML is semantic

[15:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
what do you think syntax highlighting is if not semantics?

[15:40:03.0000] <onitunes>
and basically, to get interactive performance, I have to completely blow away those semanticns

[15:40:04.0000] <onitunes>
its identical to using tables for layout

[15:41:00.0000] <onitunes>
what I have to do with the DOM to syntax highlight source code

[15:41:01.0000] <onitunes>
I can do it, and I *do do it

[15:41:02.0000] <onitunes>
as in, it works

[15:41:03.0000] <roc>
if you're not using contenteditable, you're doing it wrong.

[15:41:04.0000] <onitunes>
but I would be much better off without the workaround, using DOM nodes for layout, when something like Core Text is what I would use on the desktop

[15:42:00.0000] <onitunes>
roc: okay

[15:42:01.0000] <onitunes>
contenteditable does not do incremental layout

[15:42:02.0000] <onitunes>
I need that

[15:42:03.0000] <roc>
yes it does

[15:42:04.0000] <onitunes>
well, it sounds like there's no interest in a low-level text API

[15:42:05.0000] <roc>
what it doesn't do is incremental recomputation of syntax highlighting

[15:42:06.0000] <onitunes>
I'll move on, we all have better things to do

[15:43:00.0000] <roc>
so there's this: http://www.disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/diavolo/diavolo.html

[15:43:01.0000] <onitunes>
yeah, it's DOM-centric

[15:43:02.0000] <annevk3>
onitunes, what do you mean with "incremental layout"?

[15:43:03.0000] <roc>
which does pure-JS syntax highlighting. it's a Firefox extension, but the approach could be ported to regular HTML, I think

[15:43:04.0000] <onitunes>
annevk3: not creating DOM nodes for content that is not currently visible

[15:43:05.0000] <roc>
you don't really need that

[15:43:06.0000] <onitunes>
roc: you may be right

[15:44:00.0000] <roc>
you just need contenteditable and the syntax highlighter to be fast

[15:44:01.0000] <annevk3>
onitunes, why shouldn't that optimization be up to the browser?

[15:44:02.0000] <onitunes>
because they're too slow

[15:44:03.0000] <onitunes>
we have lists with 10,000 rows that we can scroll in realtime with incremental rendering

[15:45:00.0000] <onitunes>
if only 30 rows are visibile, we create 30 DOM nodes and re-use them as the user scrolls, swapping their contents

[15:45:01.0000] <annevk3>
onitunes, so why not implement the "incremental layout" yourself? ah, you're doing that

[15:45:02.0000] <onitunes>
right, I do that now

[15:45:03.0000] <onitunes>
with <span> cells

[15:45:04.0000] <onitunes>
look, I can make this work today

[15:46:00.0000] <roc>
"I'm doing this and it's slow" is much more useful information than "you must support a Core Text API"

[15:46:01.0000] <onitunes>
but it would be much nicer not to have to trick the browser

[15:46:02.0000] <onitunes>
and to instead have a nice, low-level text rendering API like Core TExt

[15:46:03.0000] <onitunes>
roc: okay, sorry I didn't mention that earlier

[15:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
if what you want is a fast syntax-highlighted plain text editor, it seems like it would be much better to provide an API for <textarea> that allows that than doing anything with canvas.

[15:47:00.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: that could be

[15:47:01.0000] <roc>
as we've repeatedly explained, writing your own text editing throws away a lot of important features, so it's not the right way to go.

[15:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: that's why we were asking for what you were doing

[15:47:03.0000] <roc>
what Hixie said

[15:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
there has been some interest in providing <textarea> syntax-highlighting, maybe backed in a way similar to <datagrid> JS datasource mechanism

[15:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
I'm waiting for <datagrid> implementations before going there though

[15:48:00.0000] <roc>
right now I'm not sure whether the problems you have are because you have too much text for the browser to handle efficiently, or whether it's because a pure-JS syntax highlighter isn't fast enough for you

[15:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: writing a text editor using an API at the level of CoreText would not be a wise idea, even in a native app

[15:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(reading some scrollback)

[15:49:00.0000] <onitunes>
it's not a real problem, I'm just certain it would render faster if I didn't have to do 1600 node.innerText updates to render the text view

[15:49:01.0000] <roc>
so you're not using contenteditable

[15:49:02.0000] <roc>
?

[15:49:03.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: nearly all apps developed by Apple that display text use either NSTextView or WebView

[15:49:04.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: of course they do

[15:49:05.0000] <othermaciej>
not CoreText directly

[15:49:06.0000] <othermaciej>
even Xcode

[15:49:07.0000] <onitunes>
that's what I would build on top of it

[15:49:08.0000] <onitunes>
:-)

[15:49:09.0000] <othermaciej>
and Dashcode

[15:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so I do not see why an IDE would specifically want a low-level text drawing API instead of a rich text editing API

[15:50:01.0000] <onitunes>
but asking browser vendors to implement NSTextView is asking too much

[15:50:02.0000] <onitunes>
Core Text is much easier to provide, and allows innovation on top of it

[15:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I would advise start with contentEditable and point out what is missing that you need

[15:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
browser vendors are much more likely to implement NSTextView than CoreText at this point, frankly

[15:50:05.0000] <onitunes>
I've already said the problem with it: you have to construct the entire DOM tree

[15:50:06.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: that's too bad

[15:50:07.0000] <othermaciej>
and is that technologically infeasible?

[15:51:00.0000] <annevk3>
it's slow

[15:51:01.0000] <onitunes>
performance-wise, it's a non-starter

[15:51:02.0000] <roc>
why? How much text do you have?

[15:51:03.0000] <onitunes>
look guys, if this is not critical and patches will be rejected, we should move on

[15:51:04.0000] <othermaciej>
have you tried it, or is that a guess?

[15:51:05.0000] <onitunes>
I can already git it to work

[15:51:06.0000] <onitunes>
with the approach I have now

[15:51:07.0000] <annevk3>
I've heard from a similar project that also split up the text and only parsed the displayed bit

[15:52:00.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: I've tried it

[15:52:01.0000] <annevk3>
because of slowness

[15:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I would like to solve your use case, but drawing manually on a <canvas> is a really poor approach to text editing

[15:52:03.0000] <onitunes>
text *rendering*

[15:52:04.0000] <roc>
onitunes: we genuinely want to understand your needs and figure out how to meet them

[15:52:05.0000] <onitunes>
you guys keep forgetting that

[15:52:06.0000] <onitunes>
I'm not asking about editing

[15:52:07.0000] <onitunes>
I don't use any of your editing stuff now

[15:52:08.0000] <Hixie>
if you're not doing editing, then why is performance slow?

[15:52:09.0000] <onitunes>
and I won't be starting anytime soon

[15:52:10.0000] <Hixie>
it's just a one-off thing if you're not editing

[15:52:11.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: if you post an example of it done that way, I would be glad to profile

[15:52:12.0000] <onitunes>
ah, I *am* doing editing

[15:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you're doing editing, then you should be doing contentEditable.

[15:53:01.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: okay, will add todo list

[15:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: and figure out whether there are things that can be optimized, or if there is some way to come up with a design that lets you dynamically provide data for only the visible area, or something

[15:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: we want to solve your whole use case, not just the part you want us to solve, because we think we can solve the problem better than you :-)

[15:53:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I would not expect the DOM approach to be that bad

[15:54:00.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: *that* much I get

[15:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit's own Web Inspector uses HTML markup for syntax highlighting

[15:54:02.0000] <onitunes>
well, this is easily confirmed with tests

[15:55:00.0000] <onitunes>
and you can see how I "fix" the problem

[15:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
indeed

[15:55:02.0000] <onitunes>
thanks everyone, it looks like the ball is in my court moving forward

[15:55:03.0000] <othermaciej>
tests = good

[15:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess in general, when the normal browser way of doing something is too slow or otherwise unsuitable for some use case, we are generally more interested in enhancing the built-in functinality, than in providing an alternate super low-level way to build it yourself

[15:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not always, but I think that is usually the bias of browser vendors and standards folks

[15:58:00.0000] <onitunes>
I agree with that approach in general, until programmers start implementing low-level APIs _on top of_ the high-level APIs that are provided, which is what I've done

[15:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would look at such incidents as an opportunity to find out why we did not serve that programmer's use case well with existing API

[15:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I would probably not assume "add low-level API" is the solution

[16:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think that drawing one's own text to a bitmap, in particular, is a very bad thing

[16:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so I'd like to make sure people don't feel they need to go to such extreme measures

[16:00:02.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: that's an *amesome* quotable

[16:00:03.0000] <onitunes>
awesome

[16:01:00.0000] <onitunes>
"I think that drawing one's own text to a bitmap, in particular, is a very bad thing"

[16:01:01.0000] <onitunes>
:)

[16:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
/me fails to see why his remark was remarkable, but ok...

[16:03:00.0000] <onitunes>
so, othermaciej, how do you feel about sIFR?

[16:03:01.0000] <onitunes>
just kidding...

[16:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if I need to explain, then I'll just say that if you draw your own text, you don't get support for the browser features of screen reader integration, copy/paste, find in page, correct bidi layout of text across, line breaks, and history search through text indexing; or the general Web feature of documents being searchable through search engines (granted, some of these don't necessarily apply in the text editing context), and probably m

[16:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
even if the right low-level APIs existed to do all these things "by hand", it would be very hard to get them right

[16:04:02.0000] <roc>
or IMEs

[16:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so my inclination is to find out why the current rich text editing support of Web browsers is unsuitable, and try to make it suitable

[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
not to mention selection and drag and drop

[16:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
rather than assuming people will write their own text editing/display logic by hand

[16:05:02.0000] <onitunes>
I can already do that stuff with the low-level API I've build on top of your high-level APIs

[16:05:03.0000] <onitunes>
including selection and drag and drop

[16:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
that i'd like to see :-)

[16:05:05.0000] <onitunes>
I'm a programmer, just like you guys

[16:05:06.0000] <onitunes>
nothings impossible

[16:05:07.0000] <onitunes>
just potentially slowv

[16:05:08.0000] <othermaciej>
since few would even be willing to try the latter, and most who do will fail to get it right

[16:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: got a demo page up?

[16:06:01.0000] <roc>
onitunes: you won't get the right per-platform selection behaviour, that's for sure, since you have no way to know what the platform selection behaviour actually is

[16:06:02.0000] <onitunes>
it's an IDE

[16:06:03.0000] <onitunes>
the selection behavior is IDE-specific

[16:06:04.0000] <onitunes>
and language specific, for that matter

[16:06:05.0000] <roc>
what color should the selection be?

[16:07:00.0000] <onitunes>
it's an IDE, user configure that stuff

[16:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
should the selection extend to the edge of the window or not?

[16:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
should right-clicking on the selection should a "Look up in Dictionary" item, and does it work?

[16:07:03.0000] <onitunes>
edge of the text areaL

[16:07:04.0000] <onitunes>
?

[16:07:05.0000] <onitunes>
yes, I draw the selection with a <canvas> overlay

[16:07:06.0000] <Hixie>
(i'd love to see your bidi implementation, too)

[16:07:07.0000] <roc>
what should the default color be, for the 99% of users who won't configure the color?

[16:07:08.0000] <onitunes>
I use the browsers

[16:07:09.0000] <othermaciej>
we do not want to encourage Web developers in general to ignore platform text editing conventions, even if you think it is the right choice for you

[16:08:00.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: it's an application

[16:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me would love to see a demo of this

[16:08:02.0000] <onitunes>
it's coming

[16:08:03.0000] <onitunes>
it's an IDE for SproutCore

[16:08:04.0000] <onitunes>
none of this is rocket science

[16:08:05.0000] <onitunes>
and I'm almost certain the feedback I'll get is "your cheating"

[16:08:06.0000] <onitunes>
you're

[16:08:07.0000] <onitunes>
because I am

[16:08:08.0000] <onitunes>
I have full parsers for handling the text

[16:09:00.0000] <onitunes>
syntaxt highlighting is trival

[16:09:01.0000] <onitunes>
selection handling is done against the AST, again, trivial

[16:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
i expect our feedback will be "this doesn't actually work like it should", not "you're cheating" :-)

[16:09:03.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: haha, could be

[16:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
but i'd love to be proved wrong :-)

[16:09:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't really know what "cheating" would be, I am more curious whether the features I listed do in fact work correctly

[16:09:06.0000] <onitunes>
you guys are tough to convince

[16:09:07.0000] <othermaciej>
I would think getting Safari's "Find in Page" to work right with such an editing scheme is probably impossible

[16:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but the proof is in the pudding

[16:10:01.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: of course

[16:10:02.0000] <onitunes>
I don't support that, but I do have a solid find dialog

[16:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
well then

[16:10:04.0000] <onitunes>
it's not a web page, it's a web app

[16:10:05.0000] <Hixie>
you don't support find in page :-)

[16:10:06.0000] <onitunes>
of course

[16:10:07.0000] <onitunes>
not

[16:10:08.0000] <onitunes>
but I do support "find"

[16:10:09.0000] <othermaciej>
then clearly you don't support all the features I listed

[16:11:00.0000] <onitunes>
and it's much more comprehensive than Safari's "find in page" feature

[16:11:01.0000] <onitunes>
e.g. Find and Replace :)

[16:11:02.0000] <onitunes>
regex find

[16:11:03.0000] <onitunes>
(and since the text is backed by git, find in history)

[16:12:00.0000] <onitunes>
well, next month will be fun

[16:12:01.0000] <onitunes>
the IDE will be released as an alpha in the next few weeks

[16:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it sounds like you are sufficiently invested in your idea that you are perhaps past caring whether normal browser text editing could be made to work well enough for your use case

[16:14:01.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: I bet I could support Find in Page too

[16:14:02.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: right, I'm not interested at all in browser text editing

[16:14:03.0000] <onitunes>
I think it's impossible for you guys to implement text editing in a way that makes sense for an IDE

[16:14:04.0000] <onitunes>
and it's not your mandate, anyway

[16:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would like the browser's native text editing support to be good enough for a word processor, an IDE, a mail client, or a desktop publishing type app

[16:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think many people involved with browser development would agree

[16:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure why you conclude that it's impossible, because people do in fact build IDEs on top of other general-purpose text editing APIs, so all I conclude is that we are missing some essential features of those APIs

[16:17:00.0000] <onitunes>
attribute strings, perhaps?

[16:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(or some approach that makes things fast even when style changes are dense, or something like that)

[16:17:02.0000] <onitunes>
hehe

[16:17:03.0000] <onitunes>
Core Text and you're done

[16:17:04.0000] <onitunes>
let us JavaScript guys do the heavy lifting

[16:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
why not just provide a low-level bitmap object and let you do the font rasterising too?

[16:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
surely that would be even more low level

[16:18:02.0000] <onitunes>
if you did a <text> node, where the raw source text was in the node, but the drawing was done like <canvas>, that would work

[16:18:03.0000] <onitunes>
then you could search for the text, etc.

[16:18:04.0000] <onitunes>
but still render it programmatically

[16:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
like i said, we have <text> already in SVG, and in HTML it's spelt <span>. Both are stylable with CSS.

[16:19:01.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: I may go there

[16:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: why should we provide a high-level API like CoreText if you're going to ignore it anyway?

[16:19:03.0000] <onitunes>
I'm going to build on it

[16:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: since you are convinced that you already know the right answer, it is hard to have a productive discussion

[16:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
most people do not assume that the right answer to an insufficiently powerful text editing API is to providing an API to do your own text measuring and drawing

[16:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: why do you want to build on a high-level API like CoreText instead of a low-level API like pixel-level manipulation?

[16:21:00.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: I wish JavaScript could manipulate bytes efficiently

[16:21:01.0000] <onitunes>
oh well

[16:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
that we'll be adding

[16:21:03.0000] <onitunes>
I'll do whatever I have to do to make my application work properly

[16:21:04.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: I already pointed out that Daniel Glazman is building an IDE based on browser text editing, but that didn't seem to register

[16:22:00.0000] <onitunes>
if it gets down to rendering text on the server and drawing bitmaps with canvas, well, I would be willing to go there

[16:22:01.0000] <onitunes>
roc: I looked at it

[16:22:02.0000] <onitunes>
it's XUL based

[16:22:03.0000] <onitunes>
but may be ported

[16:22:04.0000] <roc>
XUL doesn't offer anything particularly special here, trust me

[16:22:05.0000] <onitunes>
anyway, that's not really my problem space, though it may look similar

[16:23:00.0000] <onitunes>
still, I hadn't seen that link, thanks

[16:23:01.0000] <roc>
you can't even render styled text spans in XUL without dropping into HTML

[16:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: I think you are proud that you did things in such a hardcore low-level way, and I am tentatively (not having seen the actual demo) impressed

[16:23:03.0000] <roc>
or the equivalent plain-vanilla XML

[16:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: but I still don't think that is a good design approach in general for text editing in the Web technology stack

[16:24:01.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: the big thing is I don't like bugs

[16:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
onitunes: based on what you've said, it sounds exactly like your problem space, though certainly it's not the way you solved the problem space

[16:24:03.0000] <onitunes>
I keep dropping down layers until I hit something solid

[16:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me loves bugs, obviously :-P

[16:24:05.0000] <onitunes>
that's true on every platform I work on

[16:24:06.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: oh, well I just love bugs, I think they are awesome, so we'll just have to agree to disagree!

[16:24:07.0000] <Hixie>
i think we should have more bugs!

[16:25:00.0000] <wilhelm>
You can have some of mine.

[16:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in fact, lemme go check in to the WebKit tree so I can add more bugs

[16:25:02.0000] <onitunes>
okay, leaky abstractions

[16:25:03.0000] <onitunes>
contenteditable is a leaky abstraction

[16:25:04.0000] <onitunes>
(ignoring for a second the performance problems with updating large DOM trees)

[16:25:05.0000] <onitunes>
it's meant for editing "rich text"

[16:26:00.0000] <onitunes>
so when you want to edit plain text, you get pain

[16:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
how can contentEditable be a leaky abstraction? It has multiple different implementations :-)

[16:26:02.0000] <onitunes>
and the pain is different on each browser

[16:26:03.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: see previous line

[16:26:04.0000] <onitunes>
whereas <span> + CSS class is basically solid everywhere

[16:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh well like i said, if you want to edit plain text, we should do that by offering an API on <textarea> for formatting the text on the fly

[16:27:01.0000] <onitunes>
Hixie: yeah, that'd be cool

[16:27:02.0000] <roc>
if you've got specific contenteditable bugs that you want fixed, that is also very useful information

[16:27:03.0000] <onitunes>
"if you did a <text> node, where the raw source text was in the node, but the drawing was done like <canvas>, that would work"

[16:27:04.0000] <onitunes>
switch <text> to <textarea> and we agree, essentially, Hixie 

[16:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh i don't in any way think we should do anything like <canvas>

[16:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
it would be UA-pull, like <datagrid>

[16:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would be inclined to say the browser layout engine still draws the text, but perhaps with dynamic styles

[16:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
not author-push like <canvas>

[16:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[16:28:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(that's assuming this can be shown to be meaningfully more efficient than adding <span>s)

[16:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
that's not something i plan to design today

[16:28:06.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: I'll do a write-up of the DOM approach on the RedBull wiki

[16:29:00.0000] <onitunes>
it's really simple (probably why its also fast)

[16:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah just recreating the DOM nodes on the fly seems like it would probably work about as well

[16:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
you could do some pretty good optimisations too

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
keeping track of state so that if you hit a point where you're back in the same state as before you just stop restyling

[16:31:00.0000] <onitunes>
the way I do it, given a character, I can tell you the style (== CSS class) to apply

[16:31:01.0000] <onitunes>
it's pretty hard to screw that up :)

[16:31:02.0000] <onitunes>
innerText is also pretty fast on FF

[16:31:03.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: so you scan back or forward from the character to figure out the style?

[16:31:04.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: I have a full parse tree

[16:32:00.0000] <onitunes>
given a character, I can identify the AST ned

[16:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
onitunes: I see

[16:32:02.0000] <onitunes>
node

[16:32:03.0000] <othermaciej>
at the JS level or in native code?

[16:32:04.0000] <onitunes>
native

[16:32:05.0000] <onitunes>
I'd like to move it to CSS

[16:32:06.0000] <onitunes>
but it comes from the server now

[16:32:07.0000] <onitunes>
CSS?

[16:32:08.0000] <onitunes>
I meant JavaScript

[16:32:09.0000] <othermaciej>
what code is responsible for updating the AST in response to edits?

[16:32:10.0000] <onitunes>
we talked about this over on #jsc a week or so ago

[16:33:00.0000] <onitunes>
othermaciej: the server

[16:33:01.0000] <onitunes>
I forward key presses and mouse movement to the server

[16:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
does it do it in some incremental way or just full reparse?

[16:33:03.0000] <onitunes>
incremental

[16:34:00.0000] <onitunes>
though the parser is very fast

[16:34:01.0000] <onitunes>
it's not a bottleneck right now (it's C++)

[16:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be cool if even that part could practically be done with JS

[16:35:01.0000] <onitunes>
totally agree

[16:35:02.0000] <onitunes>
I want to move that to JavaScript

[16:35:03.0000] <onitunes>
but I'm using libraries from other projects right now, so it'd be a lot of work to do that

[16:36:00.0000] <onitunes>
JavaScript also doesn't have mutable strings :(

[16:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would not expect parsing to an AST to need mutable strings

[16:38:00.0000] <onitunes>
right, but the editing is all server-side now too

[16:38:01.0000] <onitunes>
I'm not sure how to do that efficiently on the client yet

[16:38:02.0000] <onitunes>
that's what I mean by cheating

[16:38:03.0000] <onitunes>
I have a really smart server and a really dumb browser client

[16:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
props for bucking the trend

[16:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I do not think mutable strings are required for editing either; there are some specialized buffer structures for efficiently inserting into or deleting from the middle of a text buffer (like Emacs uses) but I don't think a general-pupose mutable string would help much

[16:41:00.0000] <onitunes>
I could use arrays, but there's not AFAICT an easy way to go from an integer to a character in a string

[16:41:01.0000] <onitunes>
that would be helpful

[16:41:02.0000] <onitunes>
:-)

[16:41:03.0000] <onitunes>
I've used a switch statement in the past, but it's not fast

[16:41:04.0000] <onitunes>
or at least, it wasn't

[16:41:05.0000] <onitunes>
I think you guys have some improvements there now

[16:42:00.0000] <gavin>
fromCharCode?

[16:42:01.0000] <onitunes>
gavin: you're my hero

[16:43:00.0000] <gavin>
I'm not sure that using arrays for strings is going to win you anything

[16:43:01.0000] <jcranmer>
charCodeAt and fromCharCode

[16:43:02.0000] <onitunes>
I need a better JavaScript reference :/

[16:43:03.0000] <jcranmer>
I have some JS code that does btoa and atob

[16:44:00.0000] <gavin>
why would you do btoa/atob in js?

[16:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
modern JS implementations are pretty efficient at handling cases where you split and recombine strings

[16:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
ad particularly incremental append

[16:44:03.0000] <gavin>
does IE not have it as a global on the Window?

[16:44:04.0000] <jcranmer>
gavin: because a) I don't have a window object lying around and b) I'm doing protocol I/O

[16:45:00.0000] <gavin>
jcranmer: what do you have, then?

[16:45:01.0000] <jcranmer>
gavin: whatever xpcshell has

[16:45:02.0000] <gavin>
jcranmer: atob/btoa were recently added for xpcom components, adding them to xpcshell shouldn't be very hard if it's not already done

[16:46:00.0000] <gavin>
I'd be interested in seeing your version though

jcranmer, what sort of protocol I/O are you doing in browsers?

[17:59:00.0000] <jcranmer>
mcarter: it's not something in a browser

[17:59:01.0000] <jcranmer>
it's something in JS

[17:59:02.0000] <jcranmer>
IMAP, NNTP, SMTP, POP, managesieve, probably IRC in the future as well

[17:59:03.0000] <mcarter>
jcranmer, are these clients?

[17:59:04.0000] <jcranmer>
mcarter: servers, actually

[18:00:00.0000] <mcarter>
jcranmer, I don't suppose your'e doing any client work at all?

[18:00:01.0000] <jcranmer>
mcarter: I am

[18:00:02.0000] <mcarter>
jcranmer, is any of this open source by any chance?

[18:00:03.0000] <jcranmer>

hsivonen: you around?

[19:26:00.0000] <roc>
anyone know where to get stats on which % of documents have standards-mode doctypes?

[19:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
as of january, in a scan of about three billion documents biased against spam sites and towards more frequently visited and modified sites, full standards was 10%, almost standards was 40%, and quirks was 50%.

[19:32:01.0000] <roc>
thanks

[19:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's the most recent data i've collected, but if you want updated numbers i can set another scan up

[19:34:00.0000] <roc>
no, that's fine thanks

[19:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[19:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
i once tried to do a scan that bucketed sites on a per-year basis based on last-modified headers, which showed an increase in standards mode doctype and a much more significant increase in almost standards mode doctypes

[19:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
but the data is so noisy that it's hard to do good studies based on that

[19:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
the year data, that is

[19:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
(e.g. there as many pages from 2009 today as from 1994)

[19:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and far more from 2050 and 1970 than from 1998, iirc)

[02:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: around?

[02:30:00.0000] <annevk3>
sort of

[02:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: How many entities do you intend to define in XML5?

[02:32:00.0000] <annevk3>
I was planning on having the exact same list as HTML5 (though always require a semicolon)

[02:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: k

[02:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(I realized that behaviour of non-validating XML processors when finding unknown entities in undefined in XML 1.0 in cases)

[03:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: the XML processor behavior is defined: report to application

[03:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: it's even part of the main SAX interface

[04:37:00.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, it's not clear whether it's a fatal error though

[04:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's not fatal.

[04:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me checks the spec

[04:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk3: the spec doesn't make it an error of any kind, so it is not a fatal error

[04:40:01.0000] <annevk3>
yet it's fatal in some implementations

[04:40:02.0000] <annevk3>
e.g. Gecko

[04:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the reason why it is fatal in Gecko is that Gecko's entity resolver tricks expat into thinking that expat has seen all external entities

[04:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if the entity resolver weren't tricking expat, it wouldn't be fatal

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
even if Gecko weren't tricking expat like this and expat reported the skipped entity to the application, the application could opt to do fatal stuff with that information

[04:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why is Gecko tricking expat like this?

[04:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'm not trying to say that Gecko's behavior here is good. Just that it's not an XML processor bug and that the behavior taken as a whole is not non-conforming)

[04:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: expat doesn't have a mode where it would read certain DTDs

[04:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it either wants to read all or none

[04:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: Gecko wants it to read some

[04:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: so when Gecko doesn't want it to read a DTD, the entity resolver resolves unwanted DTDs to a zero-length stream

[04:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
which from the point of view of the XML spec is different from not trying to resolve at all

[04:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, right

[04:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
one might argue that a better fix would have been extending the entity resolver interface to have an "I don't want to resolve this" return value

[05:22:00.0000] <annevk3>
I don't particularly care what browsers do there for now

[06:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Meh. No way to get a Lenovo in any non-standard config. in the UK :(

[06:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
No way to get a 64-bit OS :(

[06:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hahahaha

[06:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The latest last week in html5 post is _awesome_.

[06:46:00.0000] <doublec>
hehe. true

[06:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe we should add a link in the topic

[06:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Apparently I'm a novitiate. Is that like a novice and initiate in one?

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Why not just reinstall the OS?

[06:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Don't Vista 32-bit and 64-bit have different license keys?

[06:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Oh, I thought you were thinking of running a proper OS

[06:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't really want to run two OSes, and he needs either OS X or Windows

[06:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: do you prefer Lenovo's hardware over Apple's

[06:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[06:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't know how the license/bitness things work, since he just downloaded "Microsoft Windows Vista Business DVD" and a licence key from MSDNAA and then installed it and it seemed to be the 32-bit version

[06:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I have little to choose between the two, but I'd rather the 10 hour battery life of the T400

[06:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Does standardssuck have transcripts yet?

[07:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I would on the whole prefer to be on a native *nix OS, but when I need long battery life, I start to have little choice

[07:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: doesn't Ubuntu on Lenovo do the right battery thing?

[07:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: There are one or two issues on it, but nothing major. My real problem is good photo editing/management software

[07:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I have seen nothing good on GNU/Linux at all

[07:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
You should write some web-based platform-independent photo editing/management software and then it wouldn't be a problem

[07:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No.

[07:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I'll use an OS with good software all ready.

[07:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's much easier if you simply relax your definition of "good"

[07:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't really want to dual-boot either, because then I have eternal fun debating size of partitions

[07:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
and then you could use Gimp or Krita or whatever

[07:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Resizing partitions isn't really that hard

[07:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
at least on Linux (using LVM), and probably on Windows (using magical features of NTFS that must surely exist though I have no idea how to enable them)

[07:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's annoying, though

[07:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I have no idea how partitioning works in OS X; I just drag the slidey bar and pray that it's not going to clobber all my data)

[07:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a slidey bar in OS X these days?

[07:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It won't let me drag it here :(

[07:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Yes, in the Disk Utility or whatever it's called

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.creativetechs.com/iq/tip_images/DiskUtility-Resize.gif

[07:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: oh. I hadn't noticed.

[07:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I can't grow one partition (HFS+) and shrink another (NTFS) in there :(

[07:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://forum.notebookreview.com/showpost.php?p=4003347&postcount=30 — that doesn't make me want to use Ubuntu

[07:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That's probably because OS X doesn't understand how to shrink NTFS - I guess you'd have to do it via Windows (or a third-party tool) instead

[07:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: (I've only used it once, to shrink an HFS+ partition and create a new NTFS one (alongside the existing NTFS one created by Boot Camp))

[07:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Ah, I just used the CLI to do that :)

[07:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Then I used the magic of Vista's NTFS symlinks to move my Steam games folder onto the new partition without having to modify or move or reinstall anything else, and it actually worked, which was nice)

[07:40:00.0000] <annevk3>
gsnedders, use Flickr + whatever software they recommend

[07:40:01.0000] <annevk3>
Flickr uses some other app for editing which does all the basics :)

[08:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Fx currently fails one test for HTTP parsing

[08:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm not sure if I really want it doing one of the things that makes it pass one of them

[08:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(the one failure currently is due to using null-terminated strings)

[08:55:00.0000] <takkaria>
the TAG minutes show once again that the TAG just don't understand HTML5

[08:56:00.0000] <annevk3>
takkaria, hoping to get on lastweekinhtml5?

[08:57:00.0000] <takkaria>
heh

[08:57:01.0000] <takkaria>
not thought of that :)

[08:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: URL?

[08:57:03.0000] <takkaria>
hsivonen: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2008/09/23-minutes#item06

[08:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I thought there was a detailed review of the HTML5 sectioning and heading elements linked to from this channel recently, but I can't find it in the logs or my history

[08:58:01.0000] <BenMillard>
any ideas?

[08:58:02.0000] <BenMillard>
it was on a blog

[08:58:03.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, it's linked from the latest this week in HTML5

[08:59:00.0000] <annevk3>
iirc

[08:59:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, you're a genius!

[09:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me pats annevk3 on the back.

[09:00:01.0000] <BenMillard>
/me bookmarks the page.

[09:01:00.0000] <annevk3>
takkaria, I have the feeling "we"'re quite aligned with the TAG actually; it seems that sometimes they misunderstand HTML5 and value a different approach to spec writing

[09:01:01.0000] <annevk3>
but that is mostly an editorial issue and should therefore not cause much conflict

[09:02:00.0000] <takkaria>
the idea that, e.g. you can split the parsing section into "clean" and "not clean" and have them in seperate specs is mad, though

[09:03:00.0000] <annevk3>
it kind of depends on what they mean with "clean", "not clean", and "parsing" :)

[09:03:01.0000] <takkaria>
because processors will have to implement "not clean", and having them in seperate specs will only create duplication, confusion, and faulty implementation

[09:03:02.0000] <annevk3>
if by "clean" they mean writing and by "not clean" whatever browsers have to do, we'd be nearly there

[09:04:00.0000] <annevk3>
except that currently it's two separate sections rather than two separate specifications

[09:04:01.0000] <takkaria>
I guess.  I get the impression they wouldn't be satisfied with an authoring guide and a specification though

[09:04:02.0000] <annevk3>
I wasn't talking about an authoring guide, I was talking about section 8.1

[09:04:03.0000] <takkaria>
they don't like the language specification including enough detail to write a browser with, afaict

[09:05:00.0000] <takkaria>
mm

[09:06:00.0000] <annevk3>
seems kind of weird for the W3C to encourage specs that browsers can't interoperably implement :)

[09:06:01.0000] <annevk3>
maybe the F2F next week with the TAG will help

[09:07:00.0000] <takkaria>
I guess some of this comes down to my philosophy of language... the meaning of a language found in how the language is used.  to try and specify the meaning of something whilst ignoring how it's used seems about the most futile and unrewarding task one can set oneself

[09:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: ah. old minutes. I wondered if there were new ones

[09:08:00.0000] <takkaria>
/me hasn't been around much since the end of September, so they're new to me :)

[09:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: my story is that the "Writing" section is the clean section for parsing

[09:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Every time I search for things about java, I find articles from 2004 or older

[09:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: the "clean" parsing spec could be a view of the spec proper with the steps after any parse error instead says "Abort."

[09:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: everything has already been said about Java :-)

[09:11:02.0000] <annevk3>
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2008/10/09-minutes.html are the latest minutes

[09:12:00.0000] <annevk3>
next telcon is Oct 16

[09:13:00.0000] <annevk3>
zcorpan, like I said, it's unclear what is meant with "parsing" and "clean"

[09:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: I'm a bit hesitant to take advice about String vs StringBuffer from before StringBuilder even existed :)

[09:14:01.0000] <takkaria>
I like this bit from the minutes on the 24th:

[09:14:02.0000] <takkaria>
TVR: There is a lot of broken stuff out there, and that has to be acknowledged, but the market share argument is spurious.

[09:14:03.0000] <takkaria>
[scribe didn't understand why] 

[09:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I like how irc.cgi mentioned in the TAG minutes actually depends on browser behavior that intertwines previously unspecified things.

[09:16:00.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, quite often documents produced by the TAG rely on some kind of error recovery :)

[09:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Says there's no reason to manually use stringbuffer since the JVM will automatically make one for most simple cases, makes sense. But on the other hand, stringbuffer is synced so has overhead compared to stringbuilder in single-threaded uses.

[09:16:02.0000] <annevk3>
especially character encoding

[09:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: actually, it's javac that makes one

[09:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm new to the terminology. Some magic part of the system that isn't me does it :)

[09:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and nowadays javac should make a StringBuilder

[09:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, I'm delving into the byte code of a test class now, and it says stringbuilder. But I notice it creates new temporary stringbuilders for every if statement and other branches...

[09:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"AM: I'm new to this area... the WHATWG is new on my radar. Looking at the landscape, I wonder if the chances of having impact are so low that... well... should we use our time for other things?"

[09:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I started packing clothes for TPAC 2008 today

[09:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Heh. I'm in France! :P

[09:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, yeah I read! the PS2 is already wrapped up in 2 jumpers and packed, btw ;)

[09:33:01.0000] <annevk3>
today? that's early :)

[09:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I have, beside me, F1: '05, NFS:HP2, a controller, and a memory card. And no PS2.

[09:33:03.0000] <annevk3>
/me usually packs half an hour before he leaves

[09:33:04.0000] <BenMillard>
gnsedders, perfect.

[09:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, this way gives me about a week of "oh shit I REALLY should pack that!" which, otherwise, would be occuring while at the actual event :D

[09:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
LOL, my blog says I've made 2528 entries! http://projectcerbera.com/blog/archive

[09:36:01.0000] <BenMillard>
/me makes a beeline for his build scripts...

[09:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
HTTP is odd.

[09:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me noticed he wasn't resetting a counter when running the script repeatedly...d'oh

[09:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: heh

[09:43:00.0000] <mcarter>
has anyone seen this panel on html5 and websocket? http://www.svwebbuilder.com/page/10%2F29%2F2008+The+Chronicles+of+Web+Standard:+the+HTML+5,+the+Comet+and+the+WebSocket?t=anon

[09:43:01.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, you're not using some blog software?

[09:43:02.0000] <mcarter>
I saw it a week ago and emailed them and asked to be put on

[09:46:00.0000] <annevk3>
it hasn't happened yet it seems?

[09:46:01.0000] <annevk3>
slightly out of date though, "Dion Almaer, Open Web Advocate at Google"

[09:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: I don't support you know of a resource with information about how expensive the various bytecode instructions are?

[09:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, that's correct but it might change at some point

[09:51:00.0000] <annevk3>
mcarter, "Official Contributor for W3C HTML5" :)

[09:52:00.0000] <mcarter>
annevk3, =)

[09:52:01.0000] <mcarter>
annevk3, i am in the acknowledgments, after all

[09:53:00.0000] <mcarter>
and no one knows what whatwg is...

[09:53:01.0000] <BenMillard>
mcarter, so am I...it's a neat feeling :)

[10:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I'm going to split my 2008 collection into several pages...but where should I make those splits? http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2008/collection

[10:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I considered turning each heading into a page and using heading levels to produce URL depth, but /web/study/2008/list/navigation seems a bit longwinded...

[10:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
if I split on <h2> and let the result pages have all their <h3> sections, a couple of pages will still have 200+ entries

[10:04:01.0000] <BenMillard>
s/result pages/resulting pages/

[10:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, what manner of splitting would you find most useful? ^^^

[10:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I'll e-mail my mentors at Mozilla, see if they have a preference

[10:09:00.0000] <mcarter>
annevk3, oh, for the record, I didn't use that phrasing. I used "He is an officially recognized contributor to the W3C HTML5 specification, particularly for his work with the WebSocket proposal. "

[10:10:00.0000] <mcarter>
annevk3, the panel organizers couldn't even get my name right; much less hope that they'd describe my relationship to the spec properly =)

[10:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I do like how Opera fails all of my HTTP tests.

[10:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, at the moment I think splitting the collection on <h2> will give the best balance but I'd still like your POV.

[10:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, Nominet won't let me register ben.uk as a replacement for projectcerbera.com :(

[10:18:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, so maybe I'll get http://b.co.uk/ to show how stupid it is to dissallow registrations in the 2nd level of the .uk ccTLD

[10:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: :P

[10:18:03.0000] <annevk3>
mcarter, heh

[10:18:04.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Why not http://be.a.co.uk?

[10:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I'd like my protest registration to still be usable

[10:20:00.0000] <annevk3>
prolly can't have a label of one character at that position

[10:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, ah that's indeed what the WHOIS says...but there are ccTLDs which let you do that, it's just a bit more expensive.

[10:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(http://webwhois.nic.uk/cgi-bin/whois.cgi?query=b.co.uk&WHOIS+Submit.x=37&WHOIS+Submit.y=13)

[10:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I've actually been having a good but very slow conversation with someone who works there, so there's always hope for ben.uk

[10:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what has just eaten over 1GB

[10:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Planning on doing my AH Computing project and procrastinating and working on http-parsing instead… Not good.

[11:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Expensive in terms of execution time? That can vary by several orders of magnitude in a single run of the program, so it's kind of impossible to give an answer

[11:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The relative costs, not absolute

[11:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
The relative costs can vary by several orders of magnitude

[11:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. I guess a program would spend relatively more time doing arithmetic when it starts up, but that'll all get JITted to be really fast and it'll end up spending more time chasing pointers and getting cache misses or whatever

[11:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You're getting closer

[11:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you have to worry about e.g. garbage collection, where allocating memory has approximately zero immediate cost (since it might just be incrementing a pointer) but can have a much more significant longer-term cost

[11:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I'm not sure what kind of information exists that would be helpful for what you're asking for, and I'm not even sure what you're asking for :-)

[11:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Sure the information exists, that's how you optimize compilers :)

[11:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you're targetting JVM bytecode, you don't optimise your compiler, since that's the JVM's job :-)

[11:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Pushing an immediate operand and calling a virtual function aren't exactly on the same complexity level

[11:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
The JVM might inline that virtual function call so it has no cost at all

[11:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not very virtual then

[11:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
The JVM can be sure that it's exactly equivalent to if it were virtual

[11:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. if it knows the object is of type T and no class exists that extends T, then it could directly call T's method without the virtual indirection

[11:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
And pushing an operand onto the stack doesn't have a well-defined cost either, because it'll all get translated into register-based code

[11:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Now suppose I know what kind of code I'm writing, and I know that virtual call is very virtual indeed

[11:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose so

[11:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Now what? :-)

[11:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm proposing that it will be more expensive than a push :)

[11:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
But a push doesn't have a well-defined cost :-p

[11:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Sure, but good job doing a function call without at least one push :P

[11:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's easy - you just specialise the function which does that function call, on the type of the object you're calling virtually, and then the function call itself is no longer virtual and can be inlined quite happily and maybe won't have any cost at all :-)

[11:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
whereas maybe that one push will force the JITter to spill registers and it'll slow the whole method horribly

[11:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You'd rather abuse the poor cache with duplicate code, shame on you

[11:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe most of the duplicates almost never get executed

[11:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Anyway, I've got way more cache than I used to have RAM just a few years ago ;-)

[11:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I would say that's more than I used to have disk space a few years before that, but I think I'd be lying

[11:24:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I do have more RAM than I had disk space

[11:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
I have that, I just don't have more cache :-(

[11:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I suppose it depends on what level cahce you count

[11:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
I count the bigger one because it sounds more impressive

[11:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Those are like 4-8 MB now, aren't they?

[11:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
I have 4MB, presumably shared between all the cores

[11:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Then again, I have memories of an apple II which I'm not even sure had a harddisk

[11:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, looks like it's 4MB shared between two cores, so my quad-core one must have 8MB total

[11:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
So, plenty of space to store duplicated code!

[16:18:00.0000] <hyuuu2>
what is the size of whatwg_db? I tried googling and could not find it?

[16:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
hyuuu2: whatwg_db?

[16:30:00.0000] <hyuuu2>
Hixie: the client side storage

[16:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
what about it?

[16:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe there's a hidden message in the seemingly unrelated tags mr last week is using


2008-10-15
[17:21:00.0000] <hyuuu2>
Hixie: what is the limit size per domain on that

[18:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
hyuuu2: depends on the browser, but spec says ~5MB

[18:13:00.0000] <olliej>
hyuuu2: In Safari it starts out at 5mb per domain, but if more is needed the users is asked if more should be allowed

[18:48:00.0000] <hyuuu2>
Hixie, olliej : thanks

[19:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
blooberry: you around?

[20:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama/

[20:25:00.0000] <roc>
"Approximately 85% of all of MAMA's pages would be rendered in browsers using their "Quirks" modes."

[20:25:01.0000] <roc>
does that mean "Quirks and Almost-Standards modes"?

[20:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: does Opera have an Almost-Standards mode?

[20:35:01.0000] <roc>
I expect so

[20:35:02.0000] <roc>
those Transitional doctypes better be triggering some kind of mostly-standards-mode rendering

[20:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: so about whether it includes both modes, blooberry would be the guy to ask, I guess

[22:35:00.0000] <blooberry>
roc: that only includes quirks mode. The rest (15%) are in almost standards or standards.

[22:35:01.0000] <roc>
that's strange, because a couple of days ago Hixie told me 50% of the Google index was standards or almost-standadrs

[22:36:00.0000] <blooberry>
roc: I used this chart to judge and built up the counts of the doctypes in the URLs encountered: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/ 

[22:37:00.0000] <blooberry>
roc: Google's URL set will differ from the URL set I used...it definitely has more deep-URL representation

[22:37:01.0000] <blooberry>
that could make a difference.

[22:38:00.0000] <roc>
surprisingly large difference though

[22:38:01.0000] <blooberry>
yes. 8-}

[22:38:02.0000] <roc>
I don't know who's right, it's just interesting

[22:39:00.0000] <blooberry>
I think so too on both counts. The DMoz URL set has its known issues. I'd love to hear more about some statistics regarding google's set (do they publish such things?)

[22:40:00.0000] <blooberry>
I guess I should have expected people might see those articles already...those weren't supposed to "officially" be released until a few hours from now. Guess my blog post will have to wait until after my nap.

[22:43:00.0000] <blooberry>
/me hopes the couple of remaining issues are resolved before I wake up again

[22:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
blooberry: my page doesn't document thesniffing algorithm. it just has data to show to authors

[22:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
blooberry: it might be more accurate to apply the algorithm from the HTML5 spec

[22:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(which is a fusion of what Opera, Gecko and WebKit do)

[22:47:00.0000] <blooberry>
hsivonen: I thought it was a good guide at the time I made the comparison...I was looking for some way to judge adherence to the spirit of the whole standards/almost/quirks debate.

[22:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
blooberry: as far as the timing, the problem with dev.opera.com is that the feed often gets updated before any announcement gets posted to the dev.opera.com home page

[22:48:00.0000] <blooberry>
our dev.opera gatekeep was up until about 3 in the morning his time fixing a bunch of bugs that were propagated with the posting, so fixing the couple validation errors on the validation article (oops!) will have to wait until morning. ;-}

[22:48:01.0000] <blooberry>
s/gatekeep/gatekeeper/

[22:49:00.0000] <blooberry>
mikesmith: I was surprised at the limitations of the dev.opera site, but I guess timeliness is not one of its problems. 8-D

[22:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[22:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
blooberry: anyway, congratulations on putting this stuff together.. it looks great so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing the other specific reports (e.g., the markup on)

[22:50:01.0000] <blooberry>
there are 16 chapters/sections to the markup topic. (hold on to your hat)

[22:51:00.0000] <blooberry>
I'll start small next week covering HTTP headers, and then move on to markup, I think

[22:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wow

[22:52:01.0000] <blooberry>
In some ways it was a lot of fun to gather this data, because I was able to poke into a lot of areas that I hadn't seen poked before.

[22:52:02.0000] <blooberry>
being able to correlate and compare different factors just adds to the festivities. 8-}

[22:55:00.0000] <blooberry>
/me heads for the pillow

[23:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: I don't know about the cost of bytecodes except that the 8001st bytecode in a method has a severe cost and makes the execution speed of the method drop to a tenth of what it otherwise would be

[23:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry looks like someone I should talk to a lot, reading back the logs.

[23:33:01.0000] <BenMillard>
/me is reading the MAMA articles with breakfast.

[23:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"a structural search engine is much smaller, [...] there have been no obvious efforts to address this shortcoming ... until now." surely the studies Hixie has done at Google and the DMOZ crawls Philip` has done use software which is in this category and predate the MAMA one?

[23:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
what's with first-letter capitals on CSS property names and HTML attribute names, with uppercase HTML element names? that's a very rare authoring style, in my experience...indeed, the MAMA pages just use lowercase in their HTML and CSS

[23:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"it is difficult to know if such tests truly represent how those things are actually used in the real world of the live, evolving Web." indeed!

[23:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"markup elements with the lowest MAMA representation are generally phrase elements with defined semantics" cool, this correlates with my 2008 collection :)

[23:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I like how the full numbers are present for everything, like Philip` does

[23:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the sentence preceeding each of the 2 tables in this section could be omitted (along with the style attribute for inline CSS) if the <caption> of each <table> was positioned above it: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-key-findings/#structsize

[23:59:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it's weird how the tables have 2 entries per row...not quite enough space to transpose the table to have 1 entry per column but they could have 1 entry per row

[00:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"of the number of sites proudly displaying "W3C validation badges", only ~50% of them actually validate" I'm surprised it's that high

[00:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
bold red for positive numbers confuses me a little

[00:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ok, making this table (and the one below it) have 2 entries per row is crazy: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-key-findings/#flash

[00:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Control of font characteristics are the dominant use of CSS" nice to see numbers on that, and encouraging to see width and height in the top 10

[00:11:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it's interesting that the validation error is from omitting a </li> tag, which would be completely fine if they were using an HTML doctype: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-markup-validation-report/

[00:11:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(since the documents are text/html they should be using an HTML doctype anyway)

[00:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Many authors "speak" pidgin markup" indeed, in my 2008 collection there seem to be a strata or authoring ability for each general area of HTML

[00:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
s/strata or/strata of/

[00:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"just over 20% of the [W3C Member] companies' URL top pages pass validation" ouch

[00:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, using Generator to figure out the authoring tool is clever

[00:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I hadn't heard of iWeb before

[00:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Strict Doctype flavors pass validation at much higher rates (17.5%) than Transitional (8.4%) or Frameset (7.2%)." heh, even though Strict is more difficult to pass :)

[00:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"The most frequent fatal validation error: characters are used that aren't allowed by the detected character set (8.6%)." wow, didn't expect that these days

[00:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
"Required attribute X not specified" is probably <img alt>, I'd guess

[00:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"We all make mistakes, even the experts." this very much correlates with my collection

[00:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the pagination links at the bottom are better than those at the top: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-w3c-validator-research-2/

[00:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"domains can and do die on a distressingly regular basis" indeed, the history of GTA modding is slowly being wiped out because modders' sites are dying out

[00:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the sentence opening "Sticking rigorously to a standard does not necessarily spell success" is used twice in close succession here: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-w3c-validator-research-2/#whatuse

[00:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"people are BAD at this 'HTML thing'" haha, I'll testify to that!

[00:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
this heading has no id so people can't link directly to it: "Validation rates where select Web-page authoring features are also involved"

[00:34:01.0000] <BenMillard>
surprisingly little increase in validation among authors who use CSS

[00:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the difference in validation between IIS an Apache makes sense to me

[00:35:01.0000] <BenMillard>
having audited several sites using each one professionally

[00:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Put simply, a pessimist might say that a company on [the W3C Member Company] list is just about as likely to drop out of the W3C as it is to achieve a successful validation."

[00:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"even though MAMA might be comparing apples to oranges, at least it compares a fairly equal number of apples and oranges" made me giggle, from http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-w3c-validator-research-2/?page=2

[00:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
iWeb has a high validation rate but also a low rate of non-div/span elements

[00:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: does that imply its abusing div and span?

[00:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the results about validation on "badged" websites are repeated in several places of the MAMA series, each with slightly different text

[00:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: from what I recall about iWeb output, yes

[00:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
why is the example of a "typical Doctype statement" an XHTML doctype when HTML was measured as being twice as common? Re: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-w3c-validator-research-2/?page=2#doctype & http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-key-findings/#structsize

[00:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ooh. I have iWeb on my hard drive. Looks like my Mac came bundled with it.

[01:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"MAMA looked anywhere in the document for a Doctype, but the validator only looks near the beginning of the document. A rather large set of URLs unfortunately fit this description." Philip` found something similar, IIRC

[01:01:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(quoted from http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-w3c-validator-research-2/?page=2#doctype)

[01:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
BenMillard: lot of good questions -- here's hoping blooberry will have some time to spend scrolling back through his IRC client buffer (or krijnh's logs)

[01:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but you might want to e-mail him some selected questions

[01:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me unfortunately finds no iWeb on his Mac

[01:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>

[01:21:01.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, that should be "never\n  reach"

[01:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"What IS of concern is how a page that is less than 250KB in size generates over 26MB from the validator's SOAP output mode." I've seen hsivonen and Hixie talk about combining multiple instances of certain errors and warnings into one entry for with the number of instances.

[02:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't do any search/replace :-)

[02:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
made all the changes manually :-/

[02:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
in an attempt to reduce the mistakes

[02:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: part of the size problem may be SOAP :-)

ooo… new XKCD comic!

[02:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You say that as if it's unexpected for a new one to be released on the constant thrice-weekly schedule :-p

[02:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Oh, sure. :P

[02:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But I'm on holiday, and thus have no perception of time beyond the releasing of XKCD comics :)

[02:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: There are more precise web sites for keeping of track of time, like http://www.whattimeisit.com/

[02:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But I don't look at that normally

[02:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>

[03:31:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, what you advocate for <video> with respect to accessibility seems at odds with what YouTube is doing, but maybe I'm missing something

[03:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
what youtube is doing doesn't allow the video to be moved around

[03:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
without losing subtitles

[03:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
(and can be done with <video> without any UA-level support)

[03:32:00.0000] <annevk3>
and easily without a Flash backend?

[03:33:00.0000] <annevk3>
given e.g. Wikipedia, it seems much easier to have a video file and a separate subtitle file from an editing perspective than have them both in the same file requiring some backend to repackage the whole thing

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's flash got to do with it?

[03:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you want to do subtitles manually with <video>, it's easy

[03:33:03.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, dunno, depends on how subtitles in YouTube are implemented

[03:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: without UA support, do you mean script triggering on time-based callback?

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[03:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
with overlapped spans or whatever

[03:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
not native subtitles

[03:34:04.0000] <annevk3>
ah ok

[03:34:05.0000] <Hixie>
what you want is real subtitles

[03:34:06.0000] <Hixie>
which survive when you save the video file externally

[03:34:07.0000] <hsivonen>
/me has no idea how video playback integrates with the event loop

[03:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: nothing really special there

[03:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
do browsers render video and audio on the UI thread?

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
i hope not

[03:36:01.0000] <annevk3>
ok, that solution does work, but requires script

[03:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
if not, it would seem "special" to me :-)

[03:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: ?

[03:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't see what the actual playback has to do with the event loop really

[03:36:05.0000] <annevk3>
if that's expected to be the common case of subtitles on the Web, and that seems plausible, we might want to do better

[03:36:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: otherwise, painting is on the UI thread, isn't it?

[03:36:07.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: the common case should be subtitles in the video file

[03:37:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, that requires advanced editing software

[03:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: sure

[03:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: so does making video

[03:37:03.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, shooting a video is trivial with a phone, camera, etc.

[03:37:04.0000] <annevk3>
see YouTube

[03:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[03:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
no reason youtube couldn't embed the subtitles in the video files as far as i can see

[03:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what does YouTube do for iPhone and AppleTV when it comes to captions/subtitles?

[03:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
exactly

[03:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
(no idea what they do, but that kind of reuse is exactly why you need to have a single video file)

[03:42:03.0000] <annevk3>
I don't see why that is needed for such reuse

[03:42:04.0000] <annevk3>
also, again, if YouTube were to do that, that would require complex software on the server, which seems out of reach if people want to upload videos to their own site, etc.

[03:42:05.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if the 3GPP-oriented video player shipping on S60r3.1 supports 3GPP Timed Text

[03:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
merging subtitles into an MPEG stream on the fly is trivial as i understand it

[03:53:00.0000] <blooberry>
philip`: yt?

/me thinks BenMillard had a lot of great comments on MAMA and wishes he was still on

[04:01:00.0000] <blooberry>
/me is doing the same in reverse: "BenMillard: blooberry looks like someone I should talk to a lot, reading back the logs." :)

[04:04:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Any interesting responses to the MAMA publication yet? (c:

[04:05:00.0000] <annevk3>
see logs for comments from Ben

[04:08:00.0000] <blooberry>
wilhelm: yeah, Ben's comments were great...lots of excellent commentary and I agree with many parts and have many responses. I don't know whether to reply with him in absentia due to the logs ability or wait.8-}

[04:12:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Yeah, read through the backlog now.

[04:15:00.0000] <mpt>
Wow, is that the same blooberry that taught me HTML 4?

[04:18:00.0000] <blooberry>

[04:18:01.0000] <mpt>
indeed :-)

Many thanks sir

[04:18:03.0000] <annevk3>
gotta love http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2008/10/tpac-what-wg-teamster.html :D

[04:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if there's a page that matches the criteria at http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-the-average-web-page/ (except for mutually contradictory criteria)

[04:19:01.0000] <blooberry>
many welcomes 8-} *wishes I had time lately to update that site for all the latest browsers)

[04:20:00.0000] <blooberry>
hsivonen: I don't know. That was mostly an intellectual exercise that doesn't (of course) hold a lot of water in aggregate

[04:20:01.0000] <mpt>
blooberry, yes, I would have thought Google would have hired you to work on Doctype

[04:22:00.0000] <blooberry>
They grabbed hixie from Opera to work on html5. Good hire. ;-}

[04:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I heard it was more like Hixie threw himself at them to get into their pants (i.e. search index) ;)

[04:24:00.0000] <blooberry>
dashiva: Well, one can't argue with "size" envy. 8-} MAMA was much, MUCH smaller at the time and couldn't answer many of his then-pressing questions.

[04:24:01.0000] <blooberry>
/me daydreams of billion-page indices

[04:24:02.0000] <mpt>
ooo

[04:25:00.0000] <mpt>
So there are now at least two people here who can answer a question I've had for the past seven-ish years:

[04:25:01.0000] <mpt>
What is the average number of resources that need to be loaded, in total, to display any HTML page?

[04:25:02.0000] <blooberry>
you mean "just HOW rabid is hixie about stargate?"

[04:26:00.0000] <mpt>
average number of unique resources, that is

[04:27:00.0000] <blooberry>
We can look at some of those things in isolation first, before combining them

[04:29:00.0000] <blooberry>
like inline images were used in over 90% of pages. average total image usage was ~20, with unique references averaging about 12.

[04:30:00.0000] <blooberry>
I didn't look at image file size this time because I was worried about the performance hit, but I'll probably include that in the future

[04:31:00.0000] <blooberry>
but now we'd also have to look at plug-ins, frames/iframes, external scripts, external css as well. 

[04:32:00.0000] <blooberry>
In the writeup I've tried to address each of these areas in isolation...hopefully an aggregate picture arises from that

[04:33:00.0000] <mpt>
The reason I ask is that it's a clue to giving browsers a page-loading progress bar that is, on average, smooth

[04:37:00.0000] <blooberry>
you mean perhaps giving an indication of the typical state of affairs for the "average" user encountering a web page and their browsing experience?

[04:39:00.0000] <annevk3>
/me would expect that number to increase over time

[04:39:01.0000] <mpt>
I mean the browser giving a better guess of how much of the overall page has loaded, when it doesn't yet know the sizes of all the resources involved, and may not yet even bet at the point where it knows how many there will be.

[04:39:02.0000] <blooberry>
annevk3: me too. 8-/

[04:40:00.0000] <mpt>
As opposed to the Internet Explorer progress bar behavior of starting out as if the page will have no images etc at all and therefore slowing to a crawl, or the Safari behavior of (as best I can tell) treating the last resource as if it's going to be much bigger than all the others.

[04:41:00.0000] <mpt>
bet -> be

[04:41:01.0000] <annevk3>
Opera isn't great at all with that either

[04:48:00.0000] <mpt>
afaict Opera doesn't even try to show a progress bar for non-HTML stuff

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk3>
it does

[05:00:00.0000] <blooberry>
/me is sometimes annoyed by Opera's behavior with some pages where the overall download object count in the progress bar just keeps slowly increasing. It feels like Monty Python and the Spanish Inquisition.

[05:00:01.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, hi glad they went down well. :)

[05:00:02.0000] <blooberry>
benmillard: hi!

[05:02:00.0000] <blooberry>
benmillard: I have lots of comments to your comments. 8-}

[05:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, fire away :)

[05:04:00.0000] <blooberry>
I've seen some of Philip`s results here, but I hadn't (especially at the time of the write up) seen anything "official"...not that that matters much. I'd be happy to list his work but I think when I asked him before he didn't have something over-arching or permanent to give.

[05:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, here's one I remember: http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/survey/2007-07-17/analyse.cgi/index

[05:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.google.fi/search?q=http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/stats/&filter=0

[05:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(with English UI: http://www.google.com/search?q=http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/stats/&filter=0)

[05:07:01.0000] <blooberry>
Cool. I will ask him if he wants to be included and will definitely do so.

[05:11:00.0000] <blooberry>
As for pre-dating MAMA, Ian's published work is similar but was more stats-centric and not so focused on individual cases. Plus when he was with Opera I had worked with him and others in brainstorming ideas for new features. He was just able to leverage Google's set much more quickly than I was (it was a part time project for me back then)

[05:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I've seen Ian give specific stats after doing specific crawls, but these were within the past year or two

[05:13:01.0000] <BenMillard>
my understanding of "now" is "at the time these words were published" :)

[05:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
like, searching for how often headers+id is used and how much of that isn't bogus

[05:14:01.0000] <blooberry>
Regarding the ELEMENT Attribute style, I wanted each to stand out from each other, especially as I'd be mentioning elements and attributes ALL over the place. 8-} and I didn't know the eventual publishing environment. This was a good move now that I know the dev.opera environment a little better (it is terrible, btw 8-/)

[05:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, FWIW I tend to write <element> and either "the foo attribute" or <element attribute>

[05:15:01.0000] <BenMillard>
other people working on HTML5 use attribute=""

[05:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
<code>title</code> is different enough from <code>&lt;code></code> for me, but that might just be me :P

[05:16:01.0000] <blooberry>
I know he's done more recent incremental studies with (I think) smaller URL sets. Evidently arranging for using/analyzing a bulk of Google's set takes some finagling

[05:18:00.0000] <blooberry>
It was really just a convention I started using early on to distinguish elements and attributes though. No specific agenda. 8-D

[05:20:00.0000] <blooberry>
<BenMillard> it's weird how the tables have 2 entries per row...not quite enough space to transpose the table to have 1 entry per column but they could have 1 entry per row

[05:22:00.0000] <blooberry>
ok, THAT one pissed me off yesterday...I originally wrote such tables with a cheesy gutter in the middle to create a 2-column group. Mostly to present enough data in as short a vertical space as possible for larger tables. So when the dev.opera gatekeep tells me yesterday that dev.opera somehow STRIPS OUT rowspans...*shakes head* I don't get it. I guess it isn't allowed. Apparently I'm stuck. But I will pursue a solution because as i

[05:22:01.0000] <blooberry>
hard to read. In some cases in later documents I have *3* groups side by side.

[05:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I see...

[05:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I think squishing more data into less vertical space is unhelpful for data tables, especially those which are ranked in a specific order

[05:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
one entry per row would keep the order straight up-and-down

[05:25:01.0000] <blooberry>
bold/red for positive numbers: again, I didn't know the environment the data would live in. I had to choose between keeping a class that actually specified some metadata on the contents...that they were numbers. Or, I could choose appearance. Another dev.opera limitation is that you can't specify your own external stylesheets. So I had to leverage on existing stock classes. Much to my chagrine. ;-}

[05:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, I guess this feedback should be passed on to those gatekeepers then, as the same editorial choices are likely to be present in other documents they maintain?

[05:27:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Bruce Lawson's message here makes me think changes for the better can happen: http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=10824#62695

[05:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(I'm registered as Cerbera on that forum and was giving feedback on the Web Curriculum in that thread.)

[05:28:01.0000] <blooberry>
oh, and the validation errors on the articles were fixed. That was just some 3AM sloppiness on my part. 8-} On the main validation document, since day 1 I had a prominent H1 comment emblazoned at the very type "MAKE SURE THIS DOCUMENT VALIDATES!!!" heheh.

[05:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hehe, happens to everyone -- as your research found! :)

[05:31:00.0000] <blooberry>
Totally. The incidental validating evidence I list about reasons for failing to validate actually happened to me yesterday.

[05:32:00.0000] <blooberry>
"Strict Doctype flavors pass validation at much higher rates (17.5%) than Transitional (8.4%) or Frameset (7.2%)."

[05:33:00.0000] <blooberry>
I really like that the people who "do" Strict or "move to" strict really seem to put forth more effort in making things validate. It is like, they've gone THIS far, so they might as well take that long, last big step.

[05:34:00.0000] <blooberry>
""Required attribute X not specified" is probably <img alt>, I'd guess": I actually wish I could have done more here.

[05:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, there seem to be phases of authoring ability in which the step from Transitional to Strict is like a rite of passage. :)

[05:35:01.0000] <blooberry>
That validation pass was really my first big experiment with the validator...I wasn't at all sure how big the result set would be.

[05:35:02.0000] <blooberry>
So I was ambitious yet conservative. 

[05:36:00.0000] <blooberry>
If I had unlimited storage, I would have stored each error, with each error's argument type separately, aggregating the data by those variables.

[05:37:00.0000] <blooberry>
Instead of aggregating by error code, it would be by error code AND the error's variable arguments

[05:37:01.0000] <blooberry>
but that would blossom the error storage requirements. Plus the SOAP output doesn't make that easy. 8-}

[05:39:00.0000] <blooberry>
"the pagination links at the bottom are better than those at the top: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-w3c-validator-research-2/ ": I agree. This was originally 1 long article, but due to more dev.opera constraints it had to be broken up. I actually requested the text links between parts at the top to help top-down random access. So...mostly my fault. ;-}

[05:41:00.0000] <annevk3>
oops

[05:41:01.0000] <annevk3>
netsplit?

[05:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, if the top links were in the style of the bottom links, I think it would be fine

[05:43:00.0000] <blooberry>
"Sticking rigorously to a standard..." on http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-w3c-validator-research-2/#whatuse : Hmm. You are right. I'll get that taken care of.

[05:43:01.0000] <BenMillard>
btw, I think it's very cool how receptive you are to feedback :)

[05:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the word "astronauts" has disappeared from the title and description of session 2 on TPAC day

[05:43:03.0000] <BenMillard>
I want you to know that I appreciate that it's a huge piece of work

[05:43:04.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, pointer?

[05:43:05.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk3: http://www.w3.org/2008/10/TPAC/TPDay-Agenda.html

[05:44:00.0000] <blooberry>
well, the top links were added statically, the bottom navigation thing is produced automatically, I'm told.

[05:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, producing both automatically would be best, imho, as it would improve all paginated articles

[05:47:00.0000] <blooberry>
thanks. 8-} I'm really glad it is finally seeing the light of day. 

[05:49:00.0000] <blooberry>
Totally agreed. But Chris (Mills) conveyed that dev.opera just can't do it that way right now/yet. 8-{

[05:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it would have interesting to see Hixie on the architecture panel

[05:49:02.0000] <blooberry>
I think my articles are stressing the boundaries of the dev.opera system too much. 8-D

[05:51:00.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, that seems to be the case for some Curriculum articles as well...the popularity of these publications should encourage improvements to the system over time?

[05:52:00.0000] <blooberry>
"results about validation on "badged" websites are repeated in several places of the MAMA series, each with slightly different text": I tried not to repeat or rehash too much.

[05:52:01.0000] <BenMillard>
blooberry, it felt like 3 different places covered it...I may have got confused and re-read earlier instances though

[05:52:02.0000] <blooberry>
re: curriculum articles. I hope so. Chris already seems as much an advocate for change as I am just now becoming (are the tenses in that sentence even close to being correct??)

[05:53:00.0000] <blooberry>
The "key findings" document was added recently, and the badges info has repeatedly stood out as being an "interesting" finding of all this and worthy of repeat. But I prefer not to repeat myself repeat myself too much

[05:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
lol :D

[05:55:00.0000] <blooberry>
/me takes a small break to work on a blog post about MAMA that is overdue

[05:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. annoying. the doctype name is an interned string in Gecko, but the spec requires a case-insenstive compare

[05:58:00.0000] <Dashiva>
split, split

[06:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
argh. the damowmow portal doesn't work in IE8

[06:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>

blooberry: I'm here now

[06:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
blooberry: http://philip.html5.org/data.html is the closest thing to a summary of my stuff that's spread all over the place, so it'd probably be the best place to link

[06:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
though maybe I should make it more comprehensive, and/or organise it better so it's easier to find the less rubbish things

[06:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
mpt: If by average you mean mean, then the concept of averages doesn't really make sense - e.g. I could make one page with an infinite number of external resources, and then the average per page will be infinite. So you need a more complex view of the distribution of values, else it'll be silly :-)

[06:34:00.0000] <blooberry>
philip`: Yeah, I found I had to discard some values due to out of control conditions

[06:35:00.0000] <blooberry>
I occasionally ran into pages fed by databases that were caught in infinite loops. Those were fun and crashy before I instituted a max page size. 8-}

[06:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
I had that problem with a radio station, which was streaming MP3 over HTTP and was linked from dmoz.org

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
and I couldn't quite work out how to make the HttpClient library stop downloading after a certain point, so I just had to ctrl-c it and remove that URL from the list :-/

[06:37:00.0000] <blooberry>
philip`: Do you want me to wait or should I use that link then?

[06:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
blooberry: You might have to wait an unbounded amount of time, since I don't plan to actually update that page in the near future; so if you want to link to anything, it'd probably be best to just link to the current version of that page

[06:39:01.0000] <mpt>
Philip`, the mean of all reasonably-measurably-finite pages :-)

[06:39:02.0000] <blooberry>
I'm ok with waiting until you have something you like better/want to put out there...ah, ok.

[06:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
mpt: Then I'll just make a site with an infinite number of reasonably-measurable finite pages, to force the mean to whatever value I want :-)

[06:39:04.0000] <mpt>
Philip`, and weighting pages by popularity would make it even more accurate (but would be correspondingly more difficult)

[06:40:00.0000] <mpt>
Philip`, there are already sites like that, honeypots for spammers

[06:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
Averages destroy almost all of the information anyway, and even if you measured stuff like standard deviation then you'd e.g. be losing the interesting bumps in http://code.google.com/webstats/2005-12/charts/unique-elements-per-page.svg

[06:46:00.0000] <blooberry>
I had done a bunch of standard deviation calculations for the validation study in MAMA, but a co-worker persuaded me that it was mostly superfluous noise to do so in those cases.

[06:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's probably nice to indicate the difference between e.g. an error which lots of pages have several times, and an error which most pages don't have (or almost never have) but a few pages have thousands of times

[06:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I don't know how you can concisely indicate that kind of information to a reader

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I suppose for most readers it won't make any difference anyway because they're just reading it for entertainment and you could have made up all the numbers; I'm not sure exactly who would care about the actual data or what they'd want to do with it, so I have no idea how to present it to them)

[06:53:01.0000] <blooberry>
/me is NOT an expert or even anything like an afficionado of graphing... (but would a 2 plane graph be interesting to present that sort of thing?)

[06:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not quite sure what you mean by "a 2 plane graph"

[06:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess you could use a histogram, but they're not very concise

[06:55:00.0000] <blooberry>
me neither 8-} ...trying to find a visualization to describe it

[06:57:00.0000] <mpt>
Philip`, my original question was for progress bars, not error reports

[06:57:01.0000] <mpt>
oh neat, that's just what I was looking for, thanks :-)

[06:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
mpt: Uh, I don't think that's anything like what you said you were looking for

[06:58:01.0000] <blooberry>
hmm.not finding one based on my searches. What I meant was, you have an ordinary 2d graph of error type versus URL frequency. right angle to that plane you have 2d graph of error type versus quantity, with error type being the common intersection line between the planes. (have no idea if that is clear at all...or if it would even be a helpful visualization)

[06:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
(http://code.google.com/webstats/2005-12/pages.html is the context)

[06:58:03.0000] <mpt>
oh, *HTML* elements

[06:58:04.0000] <mpt>
bother

[06:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
mpt: You want to count the total number of distinct images, scripts, iframes, etc, and transitively count all the contents of iframes, etc?

[07:00:00.0000] <mpt>
Philip`, if by transitively you mean recursively, yes

[07:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the Adobe guy on the Open Web Podcast says Adobe would love to be a part of the HTML5 video story

[07:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, some changes in Flash Player licensing

[07:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
blooberry: I think I see what you're saying, but it sounds kind of like it'd turn into a confusing mess of lines when it's rendered on a 2D screen :-(

[07:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
mpt: I do mean recursively

[07:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is thinking too mathsishly

[07:02:01.0000] <mpt>
I know that value would be in the formula somewhere, but I don't know enough maths to know what the formula would be anyway

[07:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, am I being confused?

[07:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
I thought the only relevant formula is like "a + b + c + ...", where a is the number of distinct images on the page or whatever, etc

[07:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Anyway I expect it'd be pretty hard to count because you want to include all the ads, which are probably commonly document.written in crazy ways, so it's hard to statically determine how much stuff you'll have to load

[07:06:01.0000] <mpt>
hm, true

[07:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and the range would be large enough that the average would be pretty useless, and there isn't really any information you can know in advance to do a better prediction for a given page)

[07:08:00.0000] <mpt>
And since waiting for server response is a non-trivial part of the overall time for 3rd-party ads etc, maybe it's best measured by just throwing thousands of pages at a browser rather than throwing millions of pages at a script

[07:08:01.0000] <blooberry>
philip`: yeah, it would probably be pretty visually confusing.

[07:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is happy if the progress bar just animates prettily while it's actively doing work, and stops animating if it's lost the network connection or everything has stalled, and he doesn't care much about knowing the actual progress percentage :-)

[07:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me goes away for an hour or so

[08:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hiho

[08:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2008/10/tpac-what-wg-teamster.html — :D

[08:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I do like how he failed to find a horrible photo of me

[08:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Though I guess most horrid ones are on private bebo pages :P

[08:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on the TPAC panel, I have a position statement that takes 15 sentences.

[08:31:00.0000] <annevk3>
you're on a panel?

[08:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the only way I know how to make slides for those is to make put each sentence on a slide and change slides at sentence pace...

[08:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk3: yes

[08:32:00.0000] <annevk3>
what other people are on that panel?

[08:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk3: T.V. Raman, Charles Wiecha and Erik Dahlström

[08:33:00.0000] <annevk3>
topic?

[08:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Future of XML ecosystem in W3C client-side work

[08:33:02.0000] <annevk3>
that could be fun :)

[08:33:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: can't you have playcount='-1' to represent loop forever?

[08:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. John Boyer is on the panel, too.

[08:34:01.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, maybe just provide pointers in your slides or have no slides at all?

[08:34:02.0000] <annevk3>
nice, I hope nobody holds back :)

[08:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: That's not exactly intuitive

[08:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: and nobody reads the documentation

[08:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: so if they read a page containing playcount=-1 they won't know what it means, and if they want to write an infinitely looping video then they won't be able to guess what they have to type

[08:36:00.0000] <annevk3>
/me is in favor of dropping loop attributes

[08:36:01.0000] <annevk3>
would still allow configuration of your UA to stop looping

[08:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would have thought infinite looping was much more common than finite looping, so it's odd that the latter is supported while the former isn't

[08:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Shows your thought ability.

[08:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
what are the use cases for looping video at all?

[08:38:00.0000] <annevk3>
presentational effects I assume

[08:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Incredibly annoying ads

[08:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
which would want to loop infinitely, to be as annoying as possible

[08:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
but the kind of ads that are produced as videos generally don't loop infinitely.

[08:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. the Ads inserted by YouTube into their full length TV shows, or the Get a Mac ads published by Apple on their website

[08:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Those ads aren't intended to be annoying, so they're atypical

[08:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, the YouTube ones are reportedly unskippable, so they're a little annoying

[08:41:01.0000] <hendry>
what has happened to clientinformation ? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2007-10-26/multipage/section-browser.html#clientinformation

[08:41:02.0000] <hendry>
it's dissapeared from the current spec or renamed?

[08:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm thinking of the ones where you visit a web page, and a little box in the corner of the screen starts downloading and displaying ugly low-quality video and probably plays sound effects, to advertise some kind of irrelevant product that you don't care about

[08:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
so you think people will start using <video> as a replacement for Flash?

[08:43:01.0000] <annevk3>
hendry, renamed

[08:43:02.0000] <annevk3>
/me looks

[08:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: Merged into Navigator in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-commits/2008Aug/0110.html

[08:44:01.0000] <annevk3>
ah, seems gsnedders was already looking :)

[08:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: :)

[08:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: authors read other authors' code

[08:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what will manage to cope with blockquote:only-child *:first-child::before

[08:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Those authors will see playcount=-1 and not know what it means

[08:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hah.

[08:49:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: html5 used to case-fold doctype name before the big quirks revamp. iirc, mozilla used to never uppercase, but started to do so at some point (because html5 said to uppercase)

[08:49:02.0000] <gsnedders>
MSN for OS X copes!

[08:49:03.0000] <gsnedders>
No, it doesn't

[08:49:04.0000] <gsnedders>
It falls down on the ::before

[08:49:05.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: no they will se a looping video and go "hmm wonder how they did that" and then copy the <video> tag

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: And then they'll change the -1 to -2 because that's like twice as good

[08:50:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: so the spec could say that any negative number means infinate

[08:50:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: compare with tabindex :)

[08:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i haven't seen tabindex=-2

[08:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: do you recall if there was a reason to stop case folding as part of the quirks revamp?

[08:51:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i guess Hixie looked at mozilla source code and did what mozilla did

[08:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: but i don't know

[08:52:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i also don't know why mozilla started to uppercase it, i'm just guessing :)

[08:52:02.0000] <annevk3>
they did that because of html5lib tests

[08:53:00.0000] <annevk3>
sayrer implemented that

[08:53:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[08:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I must have missed the bugzilla trail

[08:54:00.0000] <hendry>
are plugins and JS allow to set values on navigator?

[08:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: There's http://www.nhstateparks.org/state-parks/alphabetical-order/annett-wayside-park/ with <iframe tabindex="-32768" ...> :-)

[08:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, there was some months ago)

[08:59:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: nice :)

[08:59:03.0000] <Philip`>
(<iframe tabindex="-32768" src="/content/state-parks/alphabetical-order/weather/annett-wayside-park.htm" frameborder="0" height="300" scrolling="auto" width="200"></iframe>)

[09:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders whether that's conforming html5 or if just -1 is conforming

[09:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or should be...

[09:04:00.0000] <annevk3>
in any case, doing what hsivonen suggests makes sense

[09:04:01.0000] <annevk3>
it simplifies code, is more consistent, and he'll fix it for the one correct impl :)

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: ...but that's the only case I can find with (?i)tabindex=.?-[^1] so I'd have to agree that setting it to -2 is quite rare :-)

[09:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does <source pixelratio> actually do anything?

[09:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is wondering whether it would end up get rounded to integers, so 0.909090909 would be identical to 10/11 as long as your video was smaller than five billion pixels

[09:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://gsnedders.com/about-the-author — anyone able to come up with anything good for that?

[09:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: The topic in this channel should probably be changed at some point :-)

[09:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
minibios are hard to write

[09:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I should also probably upload it at some point :)

[09:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders why Hixie changed OS to "other" to mark a bug as delayed

[10:04:00.0000] <annevk3>
http://twitter.com/motleyceo/statuses/960778535

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
For security reasons, I think the 'required' attribute should be renamed to 'required-(but-validate-this-on-the-server-side-too)'

[10:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
At least for the next several years it'll be obvious that you can't rely on WF2's client-side validation, since most client-sides won't implement it and so anyone writing tutorials will include a note to say that; the problems are likely to come much further in the future, when everyone supports client-side validation

[10:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Apart from 1337 hack0r browser

[10:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Oops, I spoke too soon about tabindex

[10:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/ had <a href="http://fastcounter.bcentral.com/fc-join" target="_top" TABINDEX="-2">

[10:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
and http://web.jaes.tpc.edu.tw/ had lots of <a tabIndex="-32768" href="http://epaper.edu.tw" target="_blank">

[10:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You should fix about-the-author to not include </br>

[10:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Habari's autop has far bigger bugs. meh.

[10:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: And don't distract me from my work!

[10:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Autop?

[10:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
automagically adds p and br tags, but does it too much

[10:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[10:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
It messes up the layout of the page quite badly

[10:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
not in Safari :P

[10:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
nor in Fx 3

[10:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
It does in Opera - that blockquote gets indented a lot

[10:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, that's right per HTML 5, I think

[10:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(blockquote:only-child stops it from being)

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why is it different in the other browsers?

[10:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dunno

[10:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
(But you should use class instead of fancy selectors :-p )

[10:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Saf has no <br> in the DOM

[10:29:03.0000] <gsnedders>
so it only has one child

[10:29:04.0000] <gsnedders>
it just ignores the /br

[12:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me extends his position to 18 sentences

[12:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like quite a complex position

[12:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the short version is "Let's make the text/html parser insert SVG DOM nodes."

[12:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the rest is explaining why

[13:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: why do you think it would be interesting to see me on the arch panel?

[13:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you clearly have opinions about architecture, and those opinions presumably differ from the opinions of TAG members

[13:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so it would be interesting to hear how they respond to your opinions and you to theirs

[13:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
we know how they'll respond

[13:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
"sending passwords in the clear is always wrong."

[13:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
They don't seem to be able to agree that it's always wrong

[13:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
which is ridiculous, because it _is_ always wrong, it's just that correctness isn't the only constraint

[13:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
sometimes one has to compromise on ideals

[13:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: do you or your colleagues have a position on whether we should keep the looping attributes on <video>?

[13:59:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: I was just going to reply to the thread

[13:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool, great

[14:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
But if you're writing a normative document with MUSTs and SHOULDs and PROBABLY OUGHT TOs and so on then you shouldn't write down MUST requirements that might have to be compromised on, which seems like it might be their problem

[14:01:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: I do think that looping can be useful, and it can be very difficult to make it seamless in script 

[14:02:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie:  "loopstart" and "loopend" aren't essential

[14:02:01.0000] <KrocCamen>
Javascript shouldn't be assumed, it's for joining actions together. One example of a loop might be for a complex animated background of sorts. Ancillary uses of "video".

[14:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: there are lots of things that fall into that category, the question is are they common enough to warrant supporting in version 1, really

[14:03:00.0000] <KrocCamen>
Also, if you think of a DVD menu. It has looping animated video buttons / background. (S5+Video õ_o)

[14:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
dvd menus are pretty much the pinacle of what i want to avoid us ever doing :-P

[14:05:00.0000] <KrocCamen>
I'm just thinking broadly, I could cringe too :)

[14:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that dvd menus have looping

[14:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
does anyone on the web want to do looping of video in that way?

[14:06:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: I think a valid use-case for looping is background audio.

[14:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm, very good point

[14:07:01.0000] <KrocCamen>
With the HTML5 changes, I'm thinking of the content / design issues of my site, where I have no classes and no javascript. HTML5 not being Javascript or CSS, should ensure that my site is fully functional without replicating document-structure in Javascript/CSS. (My main complaint-example is the removal of  the "type" attribute on OL/UL)

[14:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
so the current features we have totally fail at looping background audio

[14:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
seems like if that's our use case, we should replace the whole set of features with a single boolean attribute, "loop when you get to the end"

[14:07:04.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: agreed

[14:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok that would be nice and easy to do

[14:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
and would get out of our way on the issue of picking the start point

[14:08:02.0000] <KrocCamen>
What about ads? They loop. Would beat using Flash.

[14:09:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
While we are simplifying things, I don't think that "loopstart" and "loopend" are common enough to keep.

[14:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
i would be dropping all five attributes -- start, end, loopstart, loopend, and playcount -- and replacing them with a single attribute, loop, that is either on or off

[14:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
at least, that's what i'd like to do

[14:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
leaving just two DOM attributes, one to reflect loop, and one to report the current loop number

[14:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
which starts at zero and increments on end

[14:12:00.0000] <KrocCamen>
What if they were one and the same. 0 = false, >1 = true, count.

[14:12:01.0000] <KrocCamen>
correction >=1

[14:13:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: "start" and "end" *can* be very useful

[14:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: oh i agree, but i think we should use a better story for "start", and it's unclear that "end" really has enough of a solid story and enough use cases for us to really do it in version 1

[14:15:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: wasn't it you that was just arguing that addCueRange() needs the pauseOnExit parameter because it is too difficult to stop precisely from script :)

[14:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: sure, but you can use addCueRange() to implement end="" for that case. :-)

[14:21:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: true, but you won't be able to loop a portion of file.

[14:21:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: or limit playback to just a portion, eg one chapter.

[14:22:00.0000] <KrocCamen>
What about a game 

[14:22:01.0000] <KrocCamen>
^ What about the SFX for a game. To reduce HTTP requests, put the soundbank in one audio file

[14:23:00.0000] <KrocCamen>
(I'm writing a Javascript/Canvas game, and sound is an unknown atm)

[14:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: is that needed much?

[14:23:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: good question

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
KrocCamen: there has been talk of doing that using archive files

[14:24:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: and it is possible if you also don't use the native controls

[14:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
KrocCamen: so you download a zip file of audio files and play them

[14:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: yeah

[14:25:00.0000] <KrocCamen>
Hixie: Excellent, so good. It'd be nice to support JARs too, so you can include 10 js files all in one or something. Or a whole file structure of js/audio/images in a jar file, all inserted into a virtual file system as if the files were in the website's normal file structure. That sort of thing would be good for web apps / games.

[14:25:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: OK, I agree that it is not a common usage, and it is possible to do with a custom controller.

[14:26:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: still not possible to do seamless looping of a portion of a file, but I am not sure that is a common need.

[14:27:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, also, it provides a way to get feedback from W3C Members in a way they like giving feedback

[14:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
KrocCamen: yeah, jar=zip

[14:28:01.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, since you're around anyway losing an hour of HTML editing time doesn't seem much of a loss and there's potential gain

[14:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: well there's always going to be things we can't do, the key is to make sure we can do the important ones, and do the others later

[14:29:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: Agreed

[14:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: i see no potential gain (there was no gain from the panels i was in last year, or the year before, or the year before that) and an hour is a lot of time.

[14:30:00.0000] <annevk3>
but it probably has benefited other people

[14:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm unclear on that

[14:31:00.0000] <annevk3>
more mutual understanding helps communication going forward

[14:31:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie:  while we are on the subject of "is that needed much", I am not sure that "pixelRatio" passes the smell test

[14:31:02.0000] <annevk3>
if you're wasting two weeks for that one week (as you mentioned) you might as well lose another hour imo

[14:31:03.0000] <annevk3>
I for one thought the panels were worth listening to

[14:32:00.0000] <blooberry>
eric_carlson: heheh. "passes the smell test" is one of the kindest euphemisms I've heard in quite some time. 8-}

[14:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: pixelratio came out of feedback from the youtube guys, iirc, apparently there is a lot of misencoded video out there and having a way to fix it would really help such sites

[14:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: note that it is intentionally done in an obtuse way so as to discourage authors from setting it (e.g. that's why height/width don't override the aspect ratio)

[14:37:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: having width/height only set the canvas size is absolutely the right thing to do.

[14:37:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: but aspect ratio is much harder to get right.

[14:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
you'd be surprised how many people beg for width/height to control the aspect ratio

[14:37:03.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: for example, a DV NTSC movie has a Rec.601 pixel aspect ratios (10:11)

[14:38:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: but you can't take the 720x480 and multiply by 10:11

[14:38:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: you need to crop to clean aperture (CLASP) to 704x480, then multiply by 10:11 and you get the proper 640x480

[14:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
don't think we really want to expose the clean aperture as well

[14:39:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: exactly!

[14:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
i mean the main use case here is crappily-encoded videos anyway

[14:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
YouTube has proved that people are perfectly able to put up with 320x240, so we might as well just standardise on that so we don't have to worry about sizes and aspect ratios and all that junk

[14:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
YouTube has shown that people will upload all kinds of anamorphic content without correctly setting the metadata in the files they upload

[14:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
hence youtube's desire to be able to correct it on the fly later

[14:42:00.0000] <annevk3>
arguably we could have two ints separated by an "x"

[14:43:00.0000] <annevk3>
gives the precision that's not really needed, is already required for <link sizes> and is more compatible with how aspect ratios are usually provided

[14:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why does YouTube want to fix anything on the client rather than on the server?

[14:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk3: I don't think I've ever seen aspect ratios with an 'x' - it's always written like "16:9", as far as I'm aware

[14:44:01.0000] <annevk3>
Philip`, true, if the : is really needed it would be slightly more verbose

[14:45:00.0000] <KrocCamen>
Be wary of copy-paste web-developers too. They'll spoil all your plans.

[14:45:01.0000] <annevk3>
though still doable using mostly the same algorithm as <link sizes>, you'd just have the separator as variable

[14:45:02.0000] <annevk3>
KrocCamen, HTML5 is designed for them :)

[14:45:03.0000] <KrocCamen>
:D

[14:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i believe it's so that they can change things on the fly

[14:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
but if there is pushback on pixelratio, please e-mail the list so that i can point them to the pushback

[14:52:00.0000] <nessy>
how does YouTube notice the wrong pixel aspect ratio anyway?

[14:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
right now they don't

[14:53:00.0000] <roc>
surely there's a great machine learning algorithm for that

[14:53:01.0000] <nessy>
if they don't notice it, how can an attribute fix it?

[14:53:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
hixie: do you object to installing analytics on the whatwg blog?

[14:54:00.0000] <nessy>
are they expecting users to fix it in their embed (uhh video) tags?

[14:54:01.0000] <KrocCamen>
Interesting side note. The CSS @media queries use a slash—16/9.

[14:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
mpilgrim: go ahead

[14:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
mpilgrim: Some of the Atom Autodiscovery tests are broken

[14:58:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
really?

[14:58:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
which ones?

[14:58:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me checks

[14:58:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Some on remote domain

[14:59:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, why not let <video> be like <img> for .height/.width?

[15:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
mpilgrim: 47–50

[15:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: i don't really care either way, feel free to send feedback on it

[15:00:02.0000] <gsnedders>
mpilgrim: They fail on both my impl. and your impl, and it really does appear to be broken looking at it

[15:01:00.0000] <annevk3>
I guess I don't either, it just seems that the string behavior is less desirable

[15:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just changed it to be consistent with the things it was already consistent with

[15:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have no opinion

[15:03:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
annevk3: what do you mean by "be like <img> for .height/.width"?

[15:03:01.0000] <annevk3>
eric_carlson, see http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=2332&to=2333

[15:04:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
annevk3: ah, thanks

[15:11:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
hixie: i don't have access to the design section of blog.whatwg.org

[15:11:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
perhaps lachy could give me access?

[15:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
lachy is your man, yes

[15:12:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
gsnedders: i'll try to look into it tonight

[15:12:02.0000] <annevk3>
do you need admin access?

[15:12:03.0000] <annevk3>
or something else?

[15:12:04.0000] <gsnedders>
mpilgrim: Much thanks

[15:12:05.0000] <mpilgrim>
i need access to the design section so i can change the template to include the tracking code

[15:13:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
i don't know much about the different levels of wordpress privileges

[15:13:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
but i need more than i have right now :)

[15:13:02.0000] <annevk3>
you're an admin now

[15:13:03.0000] <annevk3>
feel free to abuse your new power

[15:13:04.0000] <annevk3>
oh, wait!

[15:14:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
mwahahahaha

[15:14:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
that did it, thanks

[15:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
jesus christ, i got about 50 e-mails on video overnight

[15:18:00.0000] <annevk3>
seems that "issues" have gained some ground again http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html

[15:18:01.0000] <annevk3>
guess that was mostly due to WF2

[15:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
the uptick was when i took the huge mess of notes at the bottom of the html5 spec as well as the list of notes at the bottom of the wf2 spec and merged them into one clean list of notes with XXX markers for each issue

[15:20:00.0000] <annevk3>
yeah, I meant e-mail issues though

[15:20:01.0000] <annevk3>
the green line

[15:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[15:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[15:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
six weeks without replying to mail will do that

[15:24:00.0000] <annevk3>
sigh

/me considers whether to not bother supporting the multipage apps like flickr and bugzilla in the offline cache mode

[17:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
or rather, not support having a fallback page if you follow a link to a page that isn't cached yet

[19:06:00.0000] <kingryan>
Hixie: you around?

[19:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
kingryan: yo

[19:50:01.0000] <kingryan>
i have parsing question,if you have a minute

[19:51:00.0000] <kingryan>
so, i'm under the impression that a <title> found in a <body> should get moved to the <head>, is that right?

[19:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me checks

[19:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't seem that way, no

[19:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
what makes you think that?

[19:53:02.0000] <kingryan>
some test cases in html5lib

[19:53:03.0000] <kingryan>
and vague memories of hearing that before

[19:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
i recommend basing your understanding of the spec on the spec itself

[19:53:05.0000] <kingryan>
of course

[19:54:00.0000] <kingryan>
but I sometimes i have trouble understanding and following the spec, so its useful to look at other sources

[19:55:00.0000] <WulfTheSaxon>
Heh. Reminds me of how 90% of questions my channel ( #webdev ) on DALnet can be resolved with a single link the HTML or CSS specs :P

[19:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
kingryan: if you have trouble with any part of the spec, let us know so i can make it clearer :-)

[19:56:01.0000] <kingryan>
sure

[19:56:02.0000] <WulfTheSaxon>
/me reads what he just wrote, notices there are entire words missing, and decides to go grab a coffee >.>

[20:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wow -- no opportunistic caching in offline-apps any more

[20:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
is that because nobody implemented opportunistic caching, or because it wasn't a good idea?

[20:54:00.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: hixie knows all

[20:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
olliej: yeah, was just wondering if there might have been discussion here before I rejoined this morning

[20:56:00.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: yeah, i just looked through the scrollback and couldn't immediately see anything

[20:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[20:56:02.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: except a brief comment by Hixie on multipage apps like flickr

[20:56:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[20:57:00.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: but i'm not sure if it was relevant to this

[20:58:00.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: i only really follow the canvas stuff

[20:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I know you guys hadn't implemented opportunistic caching and Mozilla hadn't either, so I'd reckon that probably had some influence over the decision about it

[20:58:02.0000] <olliej>
not necessarily

[20:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
olliej: about canvas, is that because you're responsible for canvas code in Webkit?

[20:59:01.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: generally things only seem to be pulled when multiple engines say "no"

[20:59:02.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: yup

[20:59:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[20:59:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
did you do the original implementation?

[20:59:05.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: no

[21:00:00.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: if i had there would have been a distinct Path object

[21:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[21:00:02.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: that was not attached to the context

[21:00:03.0000] <olliej>
stab stab stab

[21:00:04.0000] <olliej>
;D

[21:00:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
:)

[21:00:06.0000] <olliej>
canvas path behaviour is hideous it's the result of a poor design in the original implementation that was then misinterpreted by mozilla

[21:01:00.0000] <olliej>
leading to the current excitement wherein a Path retains its visible screen location across context save/restore points

[21:01:01.0000] <olliej>
yo othermaciej 

[21:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hi olliej 

[21:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i will be sending a long mail about caching stuff

[21:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: Ok

[21:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
olliej: I suppose there's general agreement that the way canvas ended up being standardized is not the ideal way, and would be nice to not have been stuck with some of what it ended up with. But I guess some might say the end result is not much worse that other things -- parts of the DOM, whatever -- that we're also stuck with now

[21:06:00.0000] <olliej>
MikeSmith: alas it came into existence (afaict) prior to the "standardisation" of vendor prefixes, etc

[21:25:00.0000] <roc>
we have implemented opportunistic caching on trunk

[21:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: was that a pretty recent change? last I had heard (a couple months back, I guess), you hadn't yet

[00:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>

[00:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk3: I can probably do it later tonight or tomorrow, but you should feel free to do it instead if you want

[00:58:00.0000] <annevk3>
k, I think I'll just do it and then you can jump in :)

[01:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. kingryan is here only when I am asleep

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is it intentional that the issues graph no longer reacts to hover?

[02:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Would you say this is an accurate statement: "The HTML5 work on the other hand uses a centralized extensibility mechanism based on formalized tagsoup parsing."

[02:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
not really

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
and yes, i removed the hover effect

[02:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: how would you fix the statement?

[02:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. (re: hover)

[02:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(I prefer the term "text/html" over "tagsoup".)

[02:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
"The HTML5 language has a variety of extension mechanisms." for the first part; I've no idea what the second part is trying to say

[02:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
do we have a wiki page enumerating all the extension mechanisms? meta[name], [rel], [class], data-* off the top of my head

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
the faq lists them iirc

[02:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so it does

[02:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as far as I can tell, the sentence is trying to make the point that a random group can't add a feature like SVG or MathML to text/html unilaterally

[02:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[02:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
well

[02:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's mostly up the browser vendors

[02:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, you can't add any feature to the web platform cross-browser unilaterally

[02:57:04.0000] <hsivonen>
in XML, they can syntactically, but they still need the buy-in of people who can commit code to Gecko, WebKit, Trident and Presto in order to get their stuff in the hands of users

[02:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think people sometimes think making their own tags that browsers don't do anything special with is somehow really useful and important

[02:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and other people just don't understand how browsers work and imagine defining their own extension with rendering and behavior and such will magically work

[02:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
the whatwg "unilaterally" (i.e. without w3c approval) invented a whole bunch of new tags

[02:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
so clearly it is possible even in text/html

[02:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in WebKit we invented some new tags and attributes

[02:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
similarly, microsoft invented <marquee>, apple invented <canvas>, netscape invented <blink> and <keygen>, etc

[03:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
in general, the web platform is better off without unilateral browser-implemented extensions, though

[03:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think people want to be able to invent tags and have a validator call it correct

[03:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
which reminds me that keygen is still missing from the spec

[03:00:03.0000] <othermaciej>
keygen is such a ridiculous feature

[03:00:04.0000] <hsivonen>
surely it has to be "specified" somewhere in the bowels of mxr.mozilla.org

[03:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
keygen feedback is pending

[03:00:06.0000] <Hixie>
along with all of wf2 feedback

[03:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think othermaciej is right, people want to be able to be told that making up their own thing is ok

[03:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it's not clear why their desire is valid

[03:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
(for lack of a better term)

[03:01:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: it's really simple to make a validator that calls stuff correct... function isInputValid(input) { return true; }

[03:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: yes, but it should still tell the bad people who don't use double quotes or make syntax errors or invent tags in an unapproved way that they are bad

[03:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders what hsivonen is responding to

[03:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Can we not have a similar vendor prefix thing to CSS?

[03:02:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: otherwise, the good people who make unilateral extensions in the Official Approved way cannot feel better than other people

[03:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: doesn't really work for elements. for attributes we somewhat could, though it doesn't really work very well there either.

[03:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Doesn't work why?

[03:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: html has different characteristics than css

[03:03:03.0000] <othermaciej>
for attributes it might be plausible

[03:03:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I think I might have just noticed :)

[03:03:05.0000] <othermaciej>
for elements I don't think it works

[03:03:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Lack of fallback, etc.?

[03:03:07.0000] <othermaciej>
for attributes it is a pain since desire to dynamically change attribute values is likely to be much higher

[03:03:08.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: e.g. even in css it doesn't make sense for some things; e.g. you couldn't really make up an alternative to 'display' and call it '-foo-display', because then you'd have unclear precedence models, etc

[03:03:09.0000] <gsnedders>
Anything else will still notice iit?

[03:03:10.0000] <othermaciej>
also vendor prefix doesn't work very well for scripting interfaces

[03:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I find it interesting that often people tend to care more about validator passing their stuff than about validator informing them about their mistakes

[03:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it works ok for scripting stuff

[03:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think othermaciej's observation is correct, though

[03:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i think it's actually a very small group of people to be honest

[03:04:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well, it's not completely untenable, just painful; I guess you could check for every vendor prefixed version as prologue and rename them to a common name

[03:04:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: relative to the total html authoring population

[03:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: That entire group is minute though

[03:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ooo… nice weather when I get to Cannes!

[03:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: but that doesn't really work for IDL attributes (i.e. JS properties) as opposed to methods

[03:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: typically since the features will be different in each implementation, you'd do something like  if (window.fooBar) { } else if (window.bazBar) { } else { }

[03:05:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: see, even you can't code it right

[03:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: e.g. attachEvent vs addEventListener

[03:05:06.0000] <othermaciej>
what you wrote fails if fooBar happens to have a false value

[03:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i'm assuming it's a function in this case

[03:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
but sure, it depends on what you're doing

[03:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
for functions it is easier since you can make a common wrapper or copy to a common name

[03:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
depends on the function

[03:06:04.0000] <othermaciej>
for attributes (in the IDL sense) it doesn't really work

[03:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
but sure

[03:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean, it doesn't fail quite as hard as vendor prefix on elements but it is IMO pretty bad

[03:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it's a bit worse than css, sure

[03:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not like it's that awesome in css either

[03:08:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well, you don't need control structures to repeat yourself without breakage in CSS

[03:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
"Adobe will allow over-the-air updates of the Flash player. Providers and carriers can push out new player versions to their users." Huh? Has Adobe previously forbidden updates??

[03:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(and fairly obscure ones to be correct)

[03:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
at the end of the day, it's better for vendor-specific extensions to be prefixed wherever they are, but it's even better for the vendor-specific extensions to be discussed before shipping in public so that a multilateral agreement can be formed first

[03:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the normal pre-iPhone model for mobile phone software is that you essentially never update it

[03:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in theory you can for some "smartphones" when tethered but afaict hardly anyone does

[03:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
we have done some prefixing and try to form agreement when we can

[03:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but I do think that multiple prefixed versions of a method or attribute would be a greater lose than multiple prefixed versions of a CSS property

[03:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
fortunately, coordination around HTML and around miscellaneous APIs seems easier than for new CSS stuff

[03:11:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: "the normal pre-iPhone model for mobile phone software is that you essentially never update it" is patently untrue at least as far as Japan is concerned

[03:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: it's certainly true in the US - I am not really familiar with Japan

[03:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the US is the last place in the world to be looking at for precedents around mobile data services

[03:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
my impression is that the major handset vendors in Europe don't exactly push updates too widely either - for many phones the only way to update the firmware would be at the carrier's brick and mortar store

[03:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know of any phone that will update system software over the air

[03:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
also as far as mobile software in Japan, the App Store is also not particularly novel in any way 

[03:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I do

[03:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: seriously?

[03:13:04.0000] <othermaciej>
because that is kind of terrifying even to me

[03:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: anyway I am sure Japan is cool and technologically superior and everything but I think most US-based companies still have a US-centric point of view

[03:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I don't think Japan is all that technologically superior as far as mobile technologies go. it's just that we have more real use cases for the technology here and a thriving market.

[03:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
apparently over-the-air mobile firmware updates are not all that uncommon now (as far as I can tell from googling), so I guess my impression of how things work was slightly out of date

[03:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"User agents that cannot render the video may instead make the element represent a link to an external video playback utility or to the video data itself." -- this makes me wonder if someone's working on a text-based browser that follows the html5 spec

[03:19:01.0000] <hendry>
MikeSmith: what mobiles update? I thought the Japanese market pushed new series phones every 6 months 8x 9x with new APIs

[03:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I have heard many times that Japan (and Europe) have broader deployment than the US of relatively high-bandwidth wireless service and higher market penetration of "smartphones" relative to "feature phones"

[03:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
we basically don7t have anything but smartphones and features phones in Japan

[03:19:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
there is nothing else

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's a "feature phone"?

[03:20:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: what's a mobile? :)

[03:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
my impression is that Japan has various kinds of interesting software innovation going on but as far as I can tell, most of it doesn't really make it out of Japan other than console games and Ruby

[03:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
a "feature phone" is what is currently a low-end phone

[03:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the category below "smartphone"

[03:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[03:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
they are called that because (as I just learned recently) they used to be high end

[03:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ok. New term to me.

[03:21:04.0000] <othermaciej>
they tend to have things like a camera, a primitive browser, etc

[03:21:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I take back what I said then -- we don't have "feature phones" -- we have only one class of handset

[03:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but not, typically, fancy installable software, a large screen, major league internet capabilites, etc

[03:22:01.0000] <hendry>
MikeSmith: what's a popular Web site for Japanese mobile users?

[03:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
apparently they used to be the high end relative to phones that just made calls and that's it

[03:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: new handsets for KDDI/Au and DoCoMo and Softbank Mobile get released here every 3 months -- and no, they do not deploy new APIs every time the release new devices. The APIs are quite stable.

[03:24:00.0000] <hendry>
i was under the impression they launch new APIs and new services and hence drive sales that way

[03:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
even though I am biased, I will say anyway that regardless how innovative it is or not, I find the App Store really impressive

[03:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hendry: mobile version the Mixi social-networking service, mobile versions of restaurant-information sites, mobile versions of map sites that rely on location-awareness in browsers and markup extensions that expose location information to Web apps, ...

[03:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
because normally I hate everything about obtaining new software

[03:24:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but not with the App Store

[03:24:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
hendry: they do, but not at the kind of rate

[03:24:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I want an App Store for the Mac now

[03:25:00.0000] <hendry>
MikeSmith: there is even a series number across sharp, nec phones if i remember correctly that correspond the api/service generation

[03:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: four major features missing on the app store that kill it for me: it's not an open market place, it doesn't support open source software, i can't filter by price, and i can't try before paying.

[03:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I would like to try before I buy, though with the free apps it is not a problem, and with commercial apps that's not the norm in any case

[03:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
with commercial apps one can find the app on bittorrent and try it before buying

[03:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I can try the apps from Omni, etc. before I buy. Even iWork from Apple.

[03:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
(not that i've actually used a "commercial" app that didn't have a demo or that i hadn't tried in some other legitimate way in years)

[03:29:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I have heard the App Store terms make it impossible to publish open source software, but I am not sure what aspect of the terms makes that impossible

[03:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hendry: there are consistent series numbers or prefixes across all devices that are deployed for a particular carrier's service

[03:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
some iPhone apps do have both free and pay versions (often with ads in the free version though)

[03:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., for DoCoMo, current series is "906"

[03:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: LGPL requires that the redistributor allow the user to link with another library. There's no way to do that on the iPhone platform.

[03:30:04.0000] <othermaciej>
personally I decide what software to get by word of mouth, if it costs money

[03:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I would think posting the full source of your app in an alternate online location would be sufficient

[03:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
(which e.g. means that certain parts of safari can't ship on the iphone, but don't tell your lawyers)

[03:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hendry: previous one was 706

[03:31:03.0000] <BenMillard>
othermaciej, my mum and dad's phone can be updated by installing the vendor's update software onto your PC, using that to download the phone's updates to your PC, then transferring the updates to your phone, then rebooting the phone

[03:31:04.0000] <BenMillard>
*phones

[03:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: no, because i can't recompile the app and put it on the device. at least, that's the problem as i understand it.

[03:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I don't believe the LGPL requires the developer to provide the user with the relevant dev tools

[03:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: at Au, it's 60 series, 50 series before that, etc.

[03:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: otherwise, how could open source GUI software for Windows exist (since afaik only proprietary compilers can build such)?

[03:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are a number of free software compilers for windows.

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
but the problem is that given the iphone platform, one can't change the software.

[03:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
since it is a closed platform.

[03:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the only free software compilers I know of for Windows can only build command-line tools

[03:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think the LGPL has any requirements about enabling you to run the software on any particular platform once you change and build it

[03:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the problem before was that the NDA made it effectively illegal to distribute the source of anything that used iPhone OS APIs

[03:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because that would ispo facto violate the NDA on said APIs

[03:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe that problem is now solved

[03:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I will say for the record that I would much prefer if the iPhone let me put any software I want without having to be approved as a developer by Apple and paying them extra money for the privilege

[03:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so I am not going to defend the policy

[03:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
"For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't believe that the $79 i have to pay apple to run code on the iphone can be said to be "normally distributed with the major components of the operating system on which the executable runs"

[03:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
well under that interpretation Safari for Windows and Chrome are equally in violation

[03:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
like i said

[03:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
since they require Visual Studio to build

[03:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[03:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
indeed Mac OS X does not come with dev tools, you need a separate DVD

[03:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'll let the lawyers worry about this one

[03:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(which you can download or get for free, but ok)

[03:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
at the end of the day, the practical problems with the iphone and the app store being locked down are real problems for me regardless of whether the issue is technically legally ok or not

[03:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the fact that "compiler" counts as a "major component of the OS" means it is ok to rely on anything distribtued with the compiler, even if the compiler and the kernel areobtained separately

[03:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
the compiler for the iphone is separate from the $79 i have to pay to actually get code onto my device

[03:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"reproducing the executable" is also separate from getting it onto your device

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
well like i said, at the end of the day, the practical problems with the iphone and the app store being locked down are real problems for me regardless of whether the issue is technically legally ok or not

[03:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I agree in principle that it is bogus that you have to pay extra to get code on the device, whether it is open source or not though

[03:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in practice, I like my iPhone more since the App Store came out than before

[03:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I could imagine liking it even more

[03:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I continue to feel that the process of obtaining sofware for my iPhone feels more convenient than getting software for my Mac, even though the process in other ways is restricted in ways I think are wrong

[03:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that the actual process of getting software on the iphone is nice

[03:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's quite similar to the process of getting software on a linux distro

[03:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
though with a nicer ui, to be sure

[03:43:04.0000] <roc>
for the record, free compilers for Windows are quite capable; you can build Firefox with mingw-gcc

[03:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I can only hope that Apple continues to reduce the restrictions on the iPhone over time, and in the meantime I will continue to contribute to the one fully open platform that the iPhone supports

[03:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I have heard from multiple sources that mingw can't generate code that can successfully link to windows system DLLs

[03:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe that is wrong

[03:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or maybe it is limited to C++ or COM interfaces

[03:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or maybe it is not really a problem

[03:46:01.0000] <roc>
http://gemal.dk/mozilla/build.html

[03:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: IANAL, but I believe the canonical interpretation of "kernel" and "compiler" in GPLv2 series is that you don't need to distribute the compiler--even if it's non-Free

[03:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me votes MIT license ftw

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think the status of the portability layer under Apple's WebKit is a more interesting case than the compiler

[03:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: interesting

[03:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: you mean the proprietary libraries that the Apple Windows port of WebKit link to as DLLs?

[03:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: those and the thin layer on Mac if it's still there

[03:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I do not believe that dynamically linking to anything can be an LGPL violation regardless of license terms

[03:51:02.0000] <roc>
as for LGPL2, all you're required to do in section 6 is ensure that the user can relink your executable against their own version of the LGPL'ed library.

[03:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the Mac non-open-source .a is linked by a purely BSD-licensed dylib

[03:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(it is also shrinking)

[03:52:01.0000] <roc>
AFAIK you're not required to make sure that that executable can be run on a specific device, so signing and/or other restrictions do not violate LGPL2

[03:52:02.0000] <roc>
which is one reason why GPL3 (and LGPL3) were created

[03:52:03.0000] <roc>
(which are anathema to Apple)

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if Apple is going to implement a C++ compiler, too, in addition to clang

[03:55:00.0000] <roc>
clang is intended to be a C++ compiler eventually

[03:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I think the aim is for clang to be C++ too

[03:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[03:55:03.0000] <othermaciej>
having looked a fair bit at LLVM internals, I expect it to become a genuinely better compiler than GCC

[03:55:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but anything could happen

[03:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: Is there any reason why LLVM wasn't used for SF?

[03:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: we think the way we did it is a good approach

[03:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I can give you a slightly less vague answer on #squirrelfish where it is less off-topic, if you really care to know

[03:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
which reminds me that I should go and learn why stack-based VMs are the common VM design

[03:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
probably because most people thought of it as the obvious way to do it back in the day

[03:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it is now uncontroversial that register-based is better, to anyone who has studied the topic

[03:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though with a strong JIT it does not matter as much

[03:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I've always had a hard time understanding why it would be the obvious way when CPUs are register-based

[03:59:03.0000] <othermaciej>
unless your JIT kicks in only part of the time

[03:59:04.0000] <roc>
stack-based VMs are the common VM design because VM designers are silly

[03:59:05.0000] <othermaciej>
CPUs having lots of registers is a fairly recent development in the history of VMs

[04:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray for Parrot

[04:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and a register-based VM doesn't really work like a register-based CPU anyway; it has infinite virtual registers

[04:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
(What other register-based VMs exist now?)

[04:00:03.0000] <Philip`>
Parrot had finite (32) registers for quite a while, and that was still a register-based VM back then

[04:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but then they realised that limit was silly since they could easily make it unbounded)

[04:01:01.0000] <roc>
this was obvious in 1996 if not earlier. The remarkable thing was the .NET designers didn't learn the lesson

[04:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know why you would make a register VM with finite registers

[04:03:01.0000] <roc>
/me spent a lot of time wrestling with Java (stack based) bytecode over the years

[04:03:02.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I am a bit curious why both SpiderMonkey and Tamarin are stack-based

[04:03:03.0000] <roc>
because Spidermonkey was designed before 1996 :-)

[04:03:04.0000] <roc>
Tamarin, I dunno

[04:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I will also reveal that the architect of LLVM advised us to go stack-based instead of register-based for SquirrelFish

[04:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(fortunately we didn't listen)

[04:04:02.0000] <roc>
wow

[04:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: so spidermonkey was never really rearchitected from the original JavaScript implementation?

[04:05:00.0000] <roc>
not from scratch, no

[04:05:01.0000] <roc>
AFAIK

[04:05:02.0000] <roc>
I'm no expert

[04:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
JavaScript was creaed in 1995 according to wikipedia

[04:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
*created

[04:06:02.0000] <roc>
sounds right

[04:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think wide, quantified knowledge of the superiority of register machines may be more recent than 1996

[04:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
all the papers I have saved on the topic date to the 2000's

[04:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: s/'// plz. :P

[04:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(oddly, v8 even though it has no bytecode and so could be argued not to be a VM, appears to have implicit stack machine semantics in the code it generates)

[04:11:01.0000] <roc>
well

[04:11:02.0000] <doublec>
regarding bufferedBytes, totalBytes, etc on the list. For Ogg files, it's easier to get values for those than buffered/duration

[04:11:03.0000] <doublec>
since duration requires multiple seeks

[04:12:00.0000] <doublec>
and getting the ranges of the buffered data requires having decoded that data

[04:12:01.0000] <roc>
OmniVM appeared in 1995, and it was a register VM ... e.g. http://www.w3.org/Conferences/WWW4/Papers/165/

[04:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I do like how I get on lastweekinhtml5 despite not posting to whatwg since July and public-html since September

[04:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess lurking here causing chaos is enough :)

[04:13:01.0000] <roc>
OK, it was obscure, and I mostly know about it because Steve Lucco joined the CMU faculty the same year I arrived as a grad student, and some of my friends worked on it for him

[04:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I see, it is a virtual RISC architecture

[04:14:01.0000] <roc>
we thought the uniform ISA was better than Java bytecodes

[04:14:02.0000] <roc>
registers were part of that uniformity

[04:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess there would have been many other hypothetical simulator-only RISC architectures though intended for pedagogy rather than deployment

[04:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
indeed I recall using one in college

[04:15:02.0000] <roc>
it's true that there was no work done to quantify ISA design choices. Steve probably designed it that way because it was easier to target with existing C compilers

[04:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(would have been around 96 or so but I think they'd been using it a while)

[04:16:01.0000] <roc>
the funny thing is that Microsoft bought his company and either buried the technology, or according to some sources, put some of it in .NET

[04:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
wow, I realize now that I once actually vaguely knew something about how a CPU works internally

[04:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
enough that I could explain what a "pipeline hazard" was

[04:17:01.0000] <roc>
too bad the register design didn't make it

[04:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the only excuses I can think of for .NET to be a stack machine would be (a) to copy JVM more thoroughly and (b) if you JIT, it doesn't matter as much

[04:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it is interesting that the existince of JavaScript in the browser has beaten down nearly every add-on execution environment for the Web

[04:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
other than Flash

yeah

othermaciej, our downstairs PC has the Java thing from Sun for a couple of the online word games my mum plays in IE7

gsnedders, what would you do?

[04:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: index.html?

[04:24:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, hang on I'll give you actual links

[04:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: re v8 having stack-based semantics... don't all c++ compilers also have stack-based semantics in that sense? or am i mixing up different concepts called "stack" here

[04:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you are mixing up two different concepts of "stack"

[04:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[04:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's the stack in a stack vm used for then?

[04:25:03.0000] <othermaciej>
C/C++ compilers have a stack but access things that live on the stack by reading an offset from the stack pointer rather than with push/pop semantics, most of the time

[04:25:04.0000] <roc>
one thing Steve realized, and published in 1997 ( http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=349307 ), is that general-purpose compressors, plus intelligent stream splitting, applied to a nice regular data format, get much better compression than trying to design a nice "compact" format (which blows away a big chunk of the "rationale" for stack-based bytecodes)

[04:25:05.0000] <othermaciej>
in a stack VM, you're almost always operating on the top few items on the stack

[04:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's like forth

[04:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if you know forth at all

[04:26:02.0000] <doublec>
/me is a forth fan

[04:26:03.0000] <roc>
doublec is evil

[04:26:04.0000] <doublec>
:-)

[04:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: in-memory compactness might still be valuable in some cases, and you would not want to use general-purpose compression there

[04:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh you mean like if you want to add two numbers you push push add and have the result on the stack, as opposed to anything to do with recursion?

[04:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but a register bytecode can be made fairly compact too

[04:27:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: yeah, basically

[04:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
weird that v8 would do things using a stack-like approach

[04:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems counterintuitive

[04:28:02.0000] <roc>
Hixie: a stack-based add looks like "push 77; push 33; add; print;". Register based add looks more like 'load r0,77; load r1,33; add r2,r0,r1; print r2;"

[04:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
right

[04:28:04.0000] <othermaciej>
the SquirrelFish virtual register file is in a sense a stack too, but it's always accessed with random access rather than with push/pop/dup/etc

[04:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but it does push new frames for calls and such

[04:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
register generally wins when your local variables are in registers and you operate on vars

[04:30:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: yeah, in-memory compactness might be valuable in some cases, but it's not clear what those cases are :-)

[04:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
since instead of loadvar 1; loadvar2; add; print; you can just say add r3, r1, r2; print r3;

[04:30:02.0000] <BenMillard>
(Off-topic) Apparently this is "by design" for SmartFTP: http://www.smartftp.com/forums/UI-Preferences-Clobbered-by-Upgrade-t15546.html

[04:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Nothing is off-topic. Expecting anything on-topic would be logical.

[04:31:01.0000] <roc>
if your programs are big, you probably win by caching decompressed instruction blocks. If your programs are small, none of it matters. The sweet spot for tricky "compact" formats is somewhere in between, if indeed it exists at all

[04:32:00.0000] <roc>
this lesson actually applies to more than just instruction formats. I have seen far too many complex tricky "compact" data formats

[04:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
clearly the Android folks did not think any compactness win from a stack VM was worth it

[04:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
despite being driven so much by memory constraints

[04:32:03.0000] <doublec>
i got rickrolled via <video> earlier today. someone sent a link to an ogg file they said was crashing. You can guess what it was.

[04:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah designing a data format for compactness is almost certain to be wrong

[04:33:01.0000] <roc>
well

[04:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(unless it is for truly gargantuan data sets)

[04:33:03.0000] <gsnedders>
doublec: Don't fix video bugs :)

[04:34:00.0000] <roc>
another funny thing ... the RISC designers always touted their regular instruction sets as a great thing

[04:35:00.0000] <roc>
turns out they were wrong, and the bizarre irregular tricky "compact" x86 instruction set actually wins

[04:35:01.0000] <roc>
because code cache footprint matters and the horrible decode logic, in the end, doesn't matter

[04:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think x86 might win mainly because of volume and therefore ability to apply extreme engineering resources

[04:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not because anything about the instruction set is good

[04:37:00.0000] <roc>
oh, absolutely

[04:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though I think the worst thing is not the tricky encoding but rather the paucity of general-purpose registers

[04:37:02.0000] <roc>
I just mean that the instruction set """design""" in the end turned out to be an advantage, not a disadvantage

[04:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
you can just as easily devote more silicon to cache instead of decode logic

[04:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and x86_64 can often be faster just on the back of extra registers despite torturing at least your dcache (dunno enough about it to say as to icache)

[04:38:01.0000] <roc>
I don't think the silicon devoted to decode logic is comparable to cache

[04:39:00.0000] <roc>
I remember some architect talking about this. One of the pain points for x86 is decoding multiple instructions per cycle. It's hard when you don't even know where the second instruction *starts*

[04:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
heh

[04:40:01.0000] <roc>
so they just have several decoders, which decode starting at PC, PC+1, PC+2, etc

[04:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so anyway I think ARM goes further towards compactness and yet is quite RISCy

[04:40:03.0000] <roc>
and they throw away the results that they don't need

[04:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
wonder how fast code would go on an ARM CPU that was designed more for speed than power consumption

[04:41:00.0000] <roc>
oh, and only the first decoder is capable of decoding the "rare" instructions

[04:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but yes, Intel has proven that orthogonality and regularity are way overrated in an instruction set

[04:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok I know this is even more wildly off-topic but these mccain tongue pictures are freaking me right out

[04:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>

"designing a data format for compactness is almost certain to be wrong" - that's something that XML has usefully demonstrated, e.g. it's apparent you can store 3D meshes in ASCII XML files and it won't actually be totally insane, and then you can benefit from the readability and extensibility and whatnot without having to constantly worry about file size

[05:02:00.0000] <roc>
well

[05:02:01.0000] <roc>
XML would have demonstrated that, had XML not been poorly designed in other ways

[05:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
It demonstrates it despite being poorly designed in other ways, because people (who usually care greatly about performance) do use it for that

[05:05:00.0000] <roc>
in many situations, people who care about performance avoid XML and are right to do so

[05:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is thinking of COLLADA in particular, which it seems real people do really use (and are relatively happy to do so, compared to all the other obscure proprietary binary formats and the very feature-limited sort-of-open formats)

how is Australian Internet censorship implmented?

[05:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>

that page says that it's only a plan and that the minister has not released details and that "local" experts have all said it was technically not feasible

[05:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm continuously baffled by people who post to lists like ac-forum or tag saying things like "we should design our standards carefully to be technically sound and architecturally solid"

[05:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, does anyone think we should design our standards slap dash and haphazardly without any thought given to technical design?

[05:30:00.0000] <annevk3>
no, but they might have the feeling that e.g. HTML5 does not meet those requirements

[05:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>

[05:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
back in the day when he was working at Apple in the System 7 days

[05:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
he was arguing with someone else over some fine point of UI design

[05:31:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and the other person said:

[05:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk3: and i might think that technologies like xmlns or xlink don't either, but that doesn't make me say "we should design specs well!" it makes me give specific technical feedback

[05:31:05.0000] <othermaciej>
"I don't care what you say. I'll always take the side of the user!"

[05:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
who else's side are you going to take?! it's the _user interface_!

[05:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(as if anyone at Apple would think - "no, I'm against the user")

[05:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
seriously

[05:32:03.0000] <othermaciej>
he calls this form of argumentation "wrapping yourself in the flag"

[05:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's quite apt

[05:33:01.0000] <mpt>
Happens a lot in Free Software too

[05:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's a lot of argumentation of that method in us politics

[05:33:03.0000] <mpt>
"It would be better usability if..."

[05:33:04.0000] <othermaciej>
sometimes literally, e.g. the flag pin controversy

[05:33:05.0000] <mpt>
or, even more tellingly, "It would be better useability if..."

[05:33:06.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[05:33:07.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. bed time.

[05:33:08.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:34:00.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, I guess they're not like you then :p

[05:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
mpt: that kind of thing could be the prelude to a valid argument

[05:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or a wrong one

[05:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but at least it is an argument

[05:34:04.0000] <othermaciej>
rather than a claim to believe in some universal principle, implying anyone who disagrees with you does not

[05:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
which is meant to shut down argument rather than further it

[05:35:01.0000] <annevk3>
Hixie, just trying to find some sort of explanation for what they're doing, not encouraging it; anyway, nn

[05:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so "you don't like this change? why are you against better usability?" would be a better example

right

[05:36:03.0000] <mpt>
It's a vague bludgeon of an argument

[05:40:00.0000] <annevk3>
zcorpan, 4 and 5 are in the correct order?

zcorpan: nice spec

[05:46:01.0000] <takkaria>
zcorpan: though honestly it's a bit scary if that's what browsers do

[06:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
takkaria: it is what browsers do... except IE doesn't support the three-digit syntax and firefox does different things in standards mode and quirks mode

[06:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: they are

[06:11:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: and i think you have :)

[06:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: see topic :P

[06:15:00.0000] <annevk3>
i wonder why they picked this algorithm

[06:15:01.0000] <annevk3>
isn't there some algorithm that does the same thing but makes more sense?

[06:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting. Adobe ships Speex instead of AMR

[06:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: if you come up with such an algorithm, let me know :)

[06:22:00.0000] <jmb>
zcorpan: thanks, I now have a headache :P

[06:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jmb: sorry :(

o_O

[07:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it seems to me that the pixelratio attribute is the same as html-level accessibility features for video

[07:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
although pixelratio is a lot simpler to fix than accessibility

[07:34:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and maybe more likely to be fixed

[07:34:02.0000] <zcorpan>
but perhaps it would be better to force them to be fixed in the video itself

[07:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
a service to fix pixelratio of videos could also provide adding accessibility features

[07:37:00.0000] <annevk3>
something about tools will save us

[07:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>

Ask the XHTML2 WG to do something? That's funny

[08:00:01.0000] <annevk3>
zcorpan, yeah, I argued against that position yesterday

[08:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk3: ok. (sorry if i don't read accessibility discussions carefully :P)

[08:01:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(or at all)

[08:01:02.0000] <annevk3>
it was just on IRC, but fair enough

[08:02:00.0000] <annevk3>
otoh, Hixie said that without tools including e.g. subtitles in an MPEG stream on the fly was easy

[08:02:01.0000] <annevk3>
I don't really know enough about it myself to judge

[08:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i presume fixing pixelratio is easier

[08:04:01.0000] <zcorpan>
than writing and including subtitles

adding bolt-on accessibility to HTML is not an easy task, no

[08:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i mean, i presume fixing the pixelratio in the video resource is easier (or just as easy) as adding subtitles

[08:06:01.0000] <annevk3>
no idea

[08:07:00.0000] <annevk3>
I don't really see why HTML needs to provide the accessibility features though

[08:07:01.0000] <annevk3>
people could use SMIL

[08:08:00.0000] <annevk3>
otoh, SMIL is fugly

[08:09:00.0000] <onitunes>
SMIL: from a time when XML was cool

[08:09:01.0000] <onitunes>
c.f. SVG

[08:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"Use SMIL" is a good solution only if browsers support it.

[08:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not convinced that supporting it outside SVG would be a good use of developer time.

[08:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so how about "use SVG"?

[08:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or "use scripting and css"

[08:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does an SVG file map reasonably to a timeline? with scripts and all

[08:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know if SVG has an easy mechanism for overlaying captions

[08:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a comprehensive list of W3C working groups, incubators, etc.?

[08:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess an SVG file would map equally well as SMIL would

[08:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: can SMIL have JS?

[08:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: dunno

[08:22:01.0000] <annevk3>
I think so

Didn't Hixie have a far lower percentage?

[14:05:00.0000] <blooberry>
gsnedders: For validation? He didn't run validation in his main study though right? (http://code.google.com/webstats/)

[14:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
blooberry: I don't think it was in his main study, but it was if anything over a bigger number of docs, and it was only looking for basic syntax errors

[14:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
blooberry: But I think it was < 1% without any

[14:07:00.0000] <blooberry>
so, basically a well-formedness check?

[14:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, well-formedness doesn't exist for HTML :P

he scanned deep URLs as well as surface and there are a loooot of deep URLs. MAMA's URL set for this report was primarily DMoz and it is heavily skewed to surface URLs.

Hixie: hey, I was wondering if you had decided what to do with multifile input type=file

[14:24:01.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: ie. use multiple attribute perhaps

[14:24:02.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: min/max as per WF2

[14:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'll probably use multiple=""

[14:25:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: cool

[14:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you want to implement something, go with that, and send feedback to the list reminding me

[14:25:02.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: will do

[14:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[14:25:04.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: do think it is reasonable for the UA to change the look (probably the height being the big issue) of the input when you have multiple set for file?

[14:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[14:26:01.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: great to know

[14:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
we'll have to standardise on something though

[14:26:03.0000] <weinig>
/me nods

[14:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
might help to see what opera does

[14:26:05.0000] <Hixie>
they might have implemented type=file min/max already

[14:26:06.0000] <weinig>
opera uses min/max

[14:26:07.0000] <weinig>
and it looks just like the old control for the most part

[14:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[14:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
how do they show what's selected?

[14:28:00.0000] <weinig>
in a quoted list (I think comma separated) where the file name would go in the single file case

[14:28:01.0000] <weinig>
I don't think we would implement it like that

[14:28:02.0000] <weinig>
as it hides a lot of data

[14:29:00.0000] <Hixie>

yes

[17:05:00.0000] <kingryan>
i'm working on implementing the foreign content insertion mode

[17:05:01.0000] <kingryan>
and i find it to be hard to understand

[17:05:02.0000] <kingryan>
i think i can figure it out, but its structured differently than other modes

[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
anything in particular i can help with?

[17:07:00.0000] <kingryan>
the hard part is the section like 'A start tag whose tag name is neither "mglyph" nor "malignmark"...'

[17:08:00.0000] <kingryan>
it seems like that be easier if it were merged with the 'Any other start tag' section

[17:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
easier to understand, or implement? I don't think it would change the implementation at all, right?

[17:08:02.0000] <kingryan>
right

[17:08:03.0000] <kingryan>
easier to understand

[17:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is it has to go before the |A start tag whose tag name is one of: "b" ... | section

[17:09:01.0000] <kingryan>
hmm, i didn't think of that

[17:10:00.0000] <kingryan>
is it not possible to enumerate the possible elements?

[17:10:01.0000] <kingryan>
or would that be unwieldy?

[17:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
'A start tag whose tag name is neither "mglyph" nor "malignmark"' is an infinite number of elements, so I'm going to go with unwieldy

[17:12:00.0000] <kingryan>
yeah, i guess i didn't consider the fact that we're talking about more than just mathml and svg

[17:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
life would be easy were it not for all those pesky non-standard inputs :-)

/me ponders what to do if during an appcache update the server sends back a 500 for a dynamically added entry

[22:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, some time in the evening, possibly quite late AFAICT

[23:00:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: perusing the logs from last night I see you commented that "merging subtitles into an MPEG stream on the fly is trivial as i understand it"

[23:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
is my understanding mistaken? :-(

[23:01:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: well, it depends on *which* MPEG you mean.

[23:01:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: it is quite possible for MPEG program streams, but not for MPEG4 files

[23:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, that's sad

[23:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
what makes it hard for MPEG4?

[23:02:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: MPEG-4 family files - 3gp, etc

[23:02:03.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: Yes, they are quite different.

[23:03:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie; MPEG-4 files (ISO files) are like IFF files - a sequence of chunks with a type and length.

[23:05:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
The "table of contents" chunk has byte offsets to every media frame, each chunk of meta data, etc

[23:06:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
This makes it possible to do random access within the downloaded portions of the file, but it also means that if you add extra data to the file you have to rewrite the sample table since it has byte offsets.

[23:07:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
An MPEG-1 stream isn't a chunked file, it is just a stream of bits with patterns that allow you to figure out where a frame starts on the fly.

[23:08:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
This makes it possible to insert data on the fly, but it also make is *much* harder to seek within the file since you don't know where the  frame boundaries are.

[23:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah interesting, didn't realise about the table of contents

[23:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
well that makes the issue of streaming subtitles much harder

[23:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
is it possible to just stick a stack of subtitles at the front of the video or something?

[23:11:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Also true of QuickTime files (ISO files are based on the QuickTime file format) and some ogg files as well.

[23:12:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
it is really tough to edit a chunk-based file on the fly since every chunk has a length, and offsets within one chunk can refer to data in another chunk.

[23:13:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
it is *possible* to edit a chunk-base file on the fly, but it is really difficult

[23:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's sad

[23:14:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
I agree. Chunk-based files are highly optimized for efficient playback.

[23:14:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
For example - reverse playback isn't *so* hard because you know the offset of every sample :)

[23:14:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
About subtitles - do you think that a media engines should be responsible for rendering built-in subtitles/closed captions?

[23:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think the <video> element should support (render) the subtitles in the video resource, yes (under the user's control)

[23:19:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
I am not sure what you mean. In practice the <video> element will be implemented by the "browser engine", which will call on the services of a "media engine" to deal with decoding and synchronizing media.

[23:19:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Which part do you see as responsible for rendering the subtitles

[23:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
from the spec's point of view they are one and the same (the user agent) so it doesn't matter to me

[23:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
so long as one of them can do it :-)

[23:20:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
Easy for you to say :)

[23:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
yup :-)

[23:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
on Mac OS X I would say there should be a setting somewhere for whether you get optional subtitles in your video

[23:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
whether system setting or browser setting is not that important

[23:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for browsers that do not ship with an OS, and target an OS that doesn't have an appropriate system setting for this, I guess a setting in the browser UI is the only option

[23:22:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Agreed, though it gets  more complicated when the media file has alternate tracks

[23:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
true

[23:22:03.0000] <eric_carlson>
For different languages, for different accessibility options, etc

[23:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd expect the ua to at least expose a context menu on the video that has the subtitle, audio, angle tracks (etc)

[23:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
as, e.g., the mac os x dvd player does

[23:23:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
if only it was that simple

[23:25:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
eg. the DVD spec says how alternates should be advertised, and the player says what region the user is in

[23:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
eric_carlson, the OS will say what region the user is in? Or at least what language they prefer.

[23:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
browsers with an Accept-Language list also give clues about which languages the user is interested in

[23:29:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
True. 

[23:30:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Should the spec say which wins? 

[23:30:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I don't know, just trying to inspire hope. :)

[23:30:02.0000] <BenMillard>
if all else fails, ultimate fallback could be the language of the browser's UI

[23:36:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
For subtitles and captions, it seems to me that it would be *extremely* useful if the page author was able to control rendering

[23:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
certainly on the long run that is what we will want

[23:37:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Obviously that is possible now if they are external to the media file - set up a cue point for every caption and render when they fire

[23:37:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
Built-in subtitles are not so easy

[23:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, though that would be very suboptimal from an accessibility point of view

[23:39:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
because the script would also have to choose the right one among alternates?

[23:39:01.0000] <BenMillard>
eric_carlson, are you an implementor from somewhere?

[23:39:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
BenMillard: yes, I am one of the apple crowd

[23:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
cool :)

[23:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
no, because if the user copies the video onto their desktop, the subtitles get lost in the process

[23:40:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
BenMillard: worked on QuickTime and related media technologies for along time, now working in WebKit

[23:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
(similarly if the video is embedded on another site with another player, etc)

[23:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
the best experience for the user seems to me to be a single self-contained file with all the metadata, alternate tracks, etc

[23:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
(could be SMIL or some such, too)

[23:43:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: I agree, but given that the current spec doesn't allow any track leel configuration (eg. selection among alternates) I wonder if developers won't resort to external files for more control.

[23:44:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
the point someone made on the list today about the difficulty of adding caption/titles to media files because of the time it takes to generate good transcriptions is a valid one too.

[23:44:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
it is really quick and easy to get a video online, generating captions and metadata can take significantly longer.

[23:45:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
and merging the two can be a PITA

[23:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[23:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what to do about this

[23:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, we can expose track selection

[23:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
but that doesn't solve the wider problem

[23:48:04.0000] <eric_carlson>
indeed

[01:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's sad about the EOT debate is that the pro-EOT stance is so much like the attitude that Hollywood has to able to spec what Vista can do with HD video

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so the old players get to handcuff the new technology to suit their fears and business

[01:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
instead of new technology creating a new market

[01:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[01:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>

I wish it were public

[02:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me replied to the EOT thread

[02:14:00.0000] <roc>
uh oh

[02:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I accidentally said something totally wrong

[02:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but at least I corrected myself!

[02:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I do think Bert's report sounded extremely biased

[02:15:03.0000] <othermaciej>
like I said in my email, he attributed all arguments against EOT to others, but wrote the rebuttals to those arguments in authorial voice as facts

[02:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so either he is openly stating that he's pro-EOT, or he is a really bad writer

[02:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's ignoring anything about the quality of arguments on either side

[02:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the compactness of the notes in my 2008 collection are really helping me count up the trends

[02:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
yay for notepad, pen and remembering how to tally from primary school :)

[02:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hmm I wonder if David Orchard is it

[02:26:00.0000] <annevk3>
looking forward to Sunday!

[02:26:01.0000] <annevk3>
first day of the CSS WG meeting...

[02:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, just had a thought: would I be useful to CSS WG meetings? I'm not a "designer" but I do work with them and implement their designs as actual CSS and HTML professionally on the public web.

[02:30:00.0000] <annevk3>
BenMillard, depending on the subject, it might be entertaining :)

[02:31:00.0000] <annevk3>
though if vertical text is discussed you really want to be somewhere else :p

[02:32:00.0000] <annevk3>
did our chroniqueur just reveal he has W3C Member access?

[02:33:00.0000] <annevk3>
doesn't really help narrowing it down, of course

[02:33:01.0000] <BenMillard>
http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2008/10/bijan-plumber.html

[02:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ok i so got the algorithm wrong :(

[02:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
in webkit, <body bgcolor=999> results in rgb(0, 9, 153) while <body bgcolor=aaa> results in rgb(170, 170, 170)

[02:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and <body bgcolor=aax> results in rgb(0, 0, 0)

[02:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and #999 results in rgb(153, 153, 153)

[02:36:02.0000] <zcorpan>
#aax -> rgb(0, 0, 0)

[02:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, do I contact Bert Bos about observing CSSWG meetings?

[02:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"W3C Style Activity Lead" & "CSS contact" are the roles in the footer of different parts of the public CSS pages

[02:38:01.0000] <annevk3>
I think you need to contact the chairs

[02:38:02.0000] <annevk3>
plinss and glazou

[02:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think i'll just make valid #rgb notation return and anything else continue the algorithm

[02:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, ah I just found http://www.w3.org/Style/2008/css-charter but and I have Daniel Glazman's e-mail from Public-HTML, but I can't find e-mail address for Peter Linss. Should I keep looking or just contact Daniel?

[02:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
BenMillard: wow, he works fast

[02:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
that member-only thread has missed some relevant points, like the way that I (we) are actively working with the SVGWG on the SVG-in-text/html thing

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
and the way that html5 was originally outside the w3c, and it was only the w3c asking for it to be brought into the w3c that changed that

[02:55:00.0000] <annevk3>
http://blog.whatwg.org/october-2008-meetups

[02:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I think some people involved in that discussion aren't really aware of the history.

[02:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
so it seems a bit weird to be demanding that html5 use w3c culture as opposed to the other way around

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
(though as Bijan points out, in practice the culture is the same, it's just a different focus)

[02:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i'd say the whatwg culture is probably a bit more honest about what it means, whereas the w3c one is put in a more politically correct fashion, but that's about it)

[02:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: clearly

[02:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
I hope Bijan will be at the TPAC. I've no idea who he is, but I should thank him for his kind words.

[03:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ah, got Peter Linss's e-mail from here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Sep/0216.html

[03:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: What time do you arrive at Cannes?

[03:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, somewhen in the evening of Sunday, possibly quite late

[03:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: k. I'll be around before you then.

[03:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(I get in at 15:03 or something like that)

[03:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I can you when I arrive at Cannes railway station, or as I arrive at the hotel, or whatever :)

[03:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: You can what me?

[03:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, lol, I can call you :P

[03:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or txt me, or whatever

[03:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[03:24:03.0000] <BenMillard>
as I'll be on a train, probably best that you don't call me, although a text would be OK when you reach the hotel

[03:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
othermaciej, I don't quite understand your comment?

[03:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
BenMillard: your troll link

[03:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2008/10/tpac-what-wg-teamster.html — does anyone want to outdo that and get a photo with us in it?

[03:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
aha

[04:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
who are the people in the 5th and 6th photos on that autograph sheet?

[04:01:01.0000] <annevk3>
henri and james

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk3>
though james is not coming, so you can't get bingo it seems

[04:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: No, it's BenMillard, not James

[04:02:02.0000] <annevk3>
oops

[04:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: Completely different face, even if they do both have long hair

[04:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
will BenMillard be at TPAC?

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk3>
yes

[04:07:01.0000] <annevk3>
gsnedders, hmm yeah, in my defense, the photo is vague

[04:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: Just look at it more closely :P

[04:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmmm

[04:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
IIS is odd.

[04:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
HTTP/1.x style requests with method = "get" result in 404; HTTP/0.9 style requests result in invalid request

[04:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It seems to return 404 and not 501 for any unknown method, get included

[04:25:01.0000] <annevk3>
but GET passes?

[04:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[04:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Case-sensitive for requests, case-insensitive for responses

[04:26:01.0000] <annevk3>
for responses?

[04:26:02.0000] <annevk3>
how can you be case-insensitive there?

[04:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
good question.

[04:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm too tired :)

[04:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Unusually, Apache is just as strict as IIS

[04:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(IIS tends to be stricter)

[04:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I ought to write some way to test stuff automagically

[04:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(like, for requests)

[04:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
lachy & annevk3, the "o rly" picture is from a really long time ago, it was modified by someone from my passport photo :)

[04:55:01.0000] <BenMillard>
last summer I got this one: http://projectcerbera.com/me/me.jpg

[04:55:02.0000] <BenMillard>
today I'm updating it, same scene

[04:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
as the weather is lovely

[04:59:00.0000] <BenMillard>
incidentally, I made a sheet like that last year because I hadn't met anyone previously, so maybe the blogger saw that at the event

[05:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if anyone will be turning up in gear like this? http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2008/10/what-working-gear.html

[05:10:00.0000] <wilhelm>
I'd like the pink one.

[05:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hmm... it's like the latest posts are losing the sting

[05:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe he's become a Hixie fanboy too?

[05:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, I guess we need to say a lot more controversial stuff in here for him to quote

[05:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think he's lacking material

[05:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, I just commented here but it hasn't shown up after a couple of refreshes: http://blog.whatwg.org/october-2008-meetups#comment-28038

[06:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: I approved your comment.

[06:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, was that your first comment on the blog?

[06:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
future comments should now go through without moderation. But if that wasn't your first, then I don't know why it would have been held

[06:04:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, thanks

[06:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, it was my 2nd comment on the WHATWG blog. My 1st was here: http://blog.whatwg.org/this-week-in-html-5-episode-3#comment-26873

[06:09:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, my name ended up with slashes inside it but apart from that, it was same e-mail and so on

[06:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder why it got the slashes this time

[06:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll see if I can fix that

[06:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
done

[06:23:00.0000] <annevk3>
I might have fixed it last time

[06:23:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk3, I think they got added when I Preview and last time I deleted them before Post

[06:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
but this time I forgot

[06:24:01.0000] <annevk3>
PHP sucks

[06:24:02.0000] <annevk3>
and WordPress sucks for not working around it well enough

[06:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I remember hsivonen saying something like magic slashes are in the worst ideas ever category :)

[06:25:01.0000] <BenMillard>
you can turn them off, not sure if it breaks stuff though

[06:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ah, http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20080822#l-224

[06:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
indeed, PHP magic quotes suck. I should turn them off in the .htaccess

[06:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/magic quotes//

[06:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm fairly sure WordPress doesnt depend on them

[06:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
I turned off magic quotes in .htaccess, but the Preview feature still inserts the slashes

[07:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, how hard you try fixing it is up to you. :)

[07:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx

[07:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if he should use the term "abuse case", to mean a use case that we specifically want to forbid (because it's inherently insecure or uninteroperable or whatever)

[08:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
It's interesting how they say "Because they expose a script execution context, CSS expressions constitute a possible script injection attack vector.", yet they're still forced to keep the security hole in IE7 mode

[08:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why IE's CSS expression() used JScript instead of VBScript, since the latter would have been much better for lock-in

[08:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
probably because more authors were familiar with JScript than they were with VBScript

[08:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
new photos of me are up; haircut is different and, shockingly, I seem to look fractionally older as well: http://projectcerbera.com/me/

[08:36:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so hopefully this is more useful for you teamster sheets than a bad passport photo from 2004 (I checked the date)

[08:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me has now implemented his spec in js

[08:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm confused. Is JF using the term "burned" to include subtitles and content muxed into a single container file?

[08:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: parseInt(x) will gladly treat numbers as octal as well

[08:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, which mail from JF are you referring to?

[08:56:01.0000] <Dashiva>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Oct/0054.html

[09:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Oh, I only read the ECMA spec and missed the note at the end

[09:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
"When radix is 0 or undefined and the string's number begins with a 0 digit not followed by an x or X, then the implementation may, at its discretion, interpret the number either as being octal or as being decimal. Implementations are encouraged to interpret numbers in this case as being decimal."

[11:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me guesses it's bad to take an email from public-html-comments + whatwg, and respond to it onto public-html instead, but he can't respond onto whatwg using his mail client and he doesn't want to spend so much time writing a response and then send it to public-html-comments which nobody reads

[11:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'll read it

[11:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
why can't you respond to whatwg?

[11:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
You read everything, so that doesn't count :-p

[11:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Because I'm subscribed to whatwg with a GMail address (because that's a convenient way to read the mail), but I haven't set up my mail client to be able to send from that address (and the list won't accept any other address)

[11:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
just tell me when you get the moderator message and i'll whitelist that address

[11:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, that could perhaps be handy

[13:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there something that makes timeouts set in bookmarklets run only once?

[13:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
timeouts only run once in general

[13:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[13:23:02.0000] <Dashiva>
What he said

[13:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa! how did I manage to confuse timeouts and intervals?

[14:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. so RDFa is a REC. http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/

[14:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
wasn't it a rec before?

[14:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it had been a rec for years

[14:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like it's been a REC since Tuesday only

[14:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[14:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder why it took so long to get to rec

[14:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
i really did think they'd been in rec for years

[14:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I suppose the spec dependencies aren't such a hard REC track problem after all, since RDFa became a REC before CURIE

[14:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or CURIE is still at Last Call

[14:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, RDFa proceeded despite pending TAG concerns about CURIEs

[14:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay. the C++ version of the Validator.nu HTML parser compiles

[14:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(long way from running still...)

[14:41:00.0000] <roc>
mmmm

[14:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me just wants a Perl version of the parser

[14:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: have you tried wakaba's?

[14:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Bonus points if the whole thing is a single regular expression)

[14:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Hmm, no, since I never heard of it before now

[14:50:00.0000] <smedero>
Philip: http://suika.fam.cx/www/markup/html/whatpm/readme

[14:51:00.0000] <smedero>
i think that's a current pointer...

[15:13:00.0000] <annevk3>
via karl: http://www.w3.org/2002/Talks/0206-python/

[15:14:00.0000] <annevk3>
seems we're not the first to disagree with TBL (that is, afaict Python has not adopted this nor is it planning to do so)

[15:16:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: how is it coming with the wf2 stuff?  will you have time/energy to context-switch into a meeting about SVG-in-text/html at TPAC?

[15:16:01.0000] <annevk3>
WF2 is done

[15:16:02.0000] <shepazu>
cool

[15:16:03.0000] <annevk3>
that is, integrating it is, addressing feedback isn't

[15:16:04.0000] <shepazu>
I don't expect that addressing the feedback will ever be done

[15:17:00.0000] <shepazu>
which is to say, there will always be someone who wants something done differently

[15:18:00.0000] <shepazu>
(which, fwiw, is fair... sometimes there are conflicting use cases, it's a balance)

[15:19:00.0000] <annevk3>
well yes, but in this case no attempt has yet been made

[15:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: what anne said. i'd be happy to talk about parsing.

[15:27:00.0000] <shepazu>
ok, any particular day best for you?

[15:28:00.0000] <shepazu>
maybe I should send round an email...

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
any day is fine by me

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm there monday-friday

[15:29:02.0000] <shepazu>
ok, I'll send an email and see if we can get some sort of schedule

[15:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[15:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
it would be helpful to have some sort of summary about what the topic will be, and what the intended goal of the meeting would be (and how to evaluate if we've completed that goal)

[15:31:01.0000] <shepazu>
yup

[15:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Is the only draft agenda for the HTML WG meetings the one mike sent out ages ago?

[15:31:03.0000] <shepazu>
/me hopes part of the goal will be ice cream

[15:32:00.0000] <smedero>
mikesmith's agenda + TAG morning meeting on thursday... that's the only agenda passed around in public-html or telecons

[15:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
shepazu: I'm not against that

[15:33:00.0000] <smedero>
shepazu: have there been any updates to the SVG-in-HTML proposal from the SVG WG? I think the last updated proposal I saw was from early July~ish.

[15:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i hope i don't have to be present for the part of hte meeting intending to ice cream :-)

[15:33:02.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: you are against ice cream??

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
as part of my work day, yes :-)

[15:34:01.0000] <shepazu>
smedero: we have talked more about it loosely, but been too busy to change that doc

[15:34:02.0000] <smedero>
alright, just checking... try to keep my pointers up-to-date. :-)

[15:35:00.0000] <smedero>
/me is happy when the ice cream selection includes a sorbet or soy option

[15:35:01.0000] <shepazu>
it may be that the meeting will not result in an immediate solution, but more getting on the same general page

[15:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: booo!

[15:35:03.0000] <shepazu>
though I'd hope we can get to a solution

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: the last e-mail i sent pretty much lays out the requirements i'm aware of... i wouldn't want to spend an hour repeating that e-mail :-)

[15:37:00.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: I don't agree with every point on your email... some of your requirements seemed like the tail wagging the dog... but other parts I agreed with

[15:39:00.0000] <annevk3>
mcarter, yo, yt?

[15:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
speaking of email, I haven't gotten a reply from the SVG WG to the points I made about the SVG WG's proposal

[15:39:02.0000] <annevk3>
mcarter, Thursday and 10/28 is not a match :)

[15:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: sure, nobody agrees with all the requirements; coming up with the compromise requirements is my job :-) and is what that e-mail basically consists of

[15:39:04.0000] <annevk3>
mcarter, so is it 10/30 or Tuesday?

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
anne: i can't make 10/30, so i assumed he meant tuesday

[15:40:01.0000] <annevk3>
alright

[15:40:02.0000] <annevk3>
makes sense

[15:40:03.0000] <hsivonen>
bed time. nn

[15:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
When are people arriving in Mandelieu?

[15:41:01.0000] <smedero>
late (6pm) Tuesday... sadly.

[15:41:02.0000] <annevk3>
4PM

[15:41:03.0000] <annevk3>
tomorrow

[15:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm gonna be around from 3PM or so Sunday

[15:42:01.0000] <annevk3>
landing in mandelieu 14:15, so maybe earlier

[15:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
You're actually flying to there? Where from?

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
landing in _mandelieu_?

[15:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Aeroport de Mandelieu/Cannes

[15:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(I arrive at Gare de Cannes at 15:03)

[15:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't even know there was such an airport

[15:43:04.0000] <annevk3>
oops, nice

[15:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[15:43:06.0000] <Hixie>
that's not the same! :-)

[15:43:07.0000] <annevk3>
true

[15:43:08.0000] <Hixie>
i need to work out how to get from the airport to mandelieu

[15:44:00.0000] <annevk3>
meant landing in France

[15:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: Ah :)

[15:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
so far i've used a bus and a taxi, a bus and walking, and a taxi.

[15:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
this time i think i might try for the train.

[15:44:04.0000] <annevk3>
I was hoping to take the train

[15:44:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: No, a bus, a train, and a taxi?

[15:44:06.0000] <smedero>
Anyone have a decent link to a timetable for the regional trains that way?

[15:44:07.0000] <Hixie>
if you use a train, then it seems silly to use a taxi, the station is walking distance to the hotel

[15:44:08.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, the Gare de Mandelieu

[15:44:09.0000] <gsnedders>
?

[15:44:10.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[15:44:11.0000] <gsnedders>
Or the Gare de Cannes?

[15:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
cannes is far away

[15:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, I'm on a TGV to the Gare de Cannes

[15:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[15:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's where the bus terminates too

[15:45:04.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.exe/en?newrequest=yes&protocol=http:& :)

[15:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
until you try to use the regional buses

[15:45:06.0000] <Hixie>
which is more of a pain

[15:45:07.0000] <Hixie>
oh wait, i think i did that once

[15:45:08.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: DB has _the_ best railway timetable for all of Europe

[15:45:09.0000] <Hixie>
bus and bus, bus and walking, bus and taxi, and just taxi

[15:45:10.0000] <smedero>
ahh, great. thank you.

[15:45:11.0000] <Hixie>
or maybe not just taxi

[15:45:12.0000] <Hixie>
man i don't know

[15:45:13.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess taxi is the best way to get from Gare de Cannes?

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's a long walk

[15:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it is walkable

[15:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
and you can take regional busses

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
but frankly i'd recommend taxi

[15:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or would it be sensible to get a SNCF Ten train?

[15:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
or train

[15:47:03.0000] <smedero>
That's like an hour walk, right?

[15:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'm going to try train this year i think

[15:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
smedero: something like that

[15:47:06.0000] <gsnedders>
The trains that stop at Mandelieu aren't that common

[15:47:07.0000] <shepazu>
there is a bus, as I recall it takes about half an hour

[15:47:08.0000] <gsnedders>
And my ticket is for Cannes, so I'd have to buy one

[15:47:09.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[15:47:10.0000] <shepazu>
it goes the long way around

[15:47:11.0000] <gsnedders>
I've been in France a week, hopefully I can speak French again! :P

[15:47:12.0000] <shepazu>
but it passes by the castle :)

[15:47:13.0000] <gsnedders>
(I can speak French fine when in practice, I still don't think I am)

[15:49:00.0000] <smedero>
looks like the train runs every hour

[15:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone got any idea what to do next Saturday? My flight only leaves at 20:10 (from Nice)

[15:49:02.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: On Sunday at least it's not that regular

[15:49:03.0000] <smedero>
true

[15:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
15:31, 17:16, 17:33, 18:24, 18:46, 20:34

[15:50:01.0000] <smedero>
l'm looking at off-peak weekdays

[15:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(dep. times from Gare de Cannes)

[15:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Haha

[15:50:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me comes across http://kittalicio.us/post/3026078/wordpress-support

[15:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like the train has the same schedule every day

[15:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway i'll figure that out on the day

[15:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
i arrive conveniently in the afternoon

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the train stations in france tend to be quite helpful

[15:52:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I plan on getting a taxi, unless anyone will murder me for doing so

[15:53:00.0000] <annevk3>
my flight is at a similar time that Saturday gsnedders

[15:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: Well, I just arrive on TGV from Lyon

[15:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(I am currently in Lyon, FWIW)

[15:55:00.0000] <annevk3>
I thought you meant Oct 25

[15:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, then.

[15:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: I thought you meant tomorrrow :)

[16:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk3: Want to do anything together next Sat then? :P

[16:04:00.0000] <annevk3>
dunno

[16:21:00.0000] <pingveno>
Is there a way for users to write their own treebuilder in html5lib?

[16:22:00.0000] <pingveno>
I dug around in the documentation but I couldn't find anything.

[16:50:00.0000] <mcarter>
annevk3, Hixie: i meant 10/28, tuesday -- don't know how/why I wrote thursday. Thanks; i'll send another email out


2008-10-18
[17:31:00.0000] <kingryan>
pingveno: its possible, but not easy

[17:31:01.0000] <kingryan>
pingveno: which language are yo using?

[17:31:02.0000] <pingveno>
Python

[17:32:00.0000] <pingveno>
Well, the tree is written in Cython but I'll use Python for the treebuilder

[17:32:01.0000] <kingryan>
ok, i mostly only know about the ruby port

[17:34:00.0000] <pingveno>
Ah, I see.

[17:34:01.0000] <pingveno>
Is html5lib designed so that it is *possible* to write a custom treebuilder?

[17:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
pingveno: How would a custom treebuilder be any different to the treebuilders that are currently implemented?

[17:37:01.0000] <pingveno>
It would work with a tree implementation that I'm writing.

[17:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me notices that his sentence didn't quite make sense

[17:37:03.0000] <pingveno>
/me has seen much worse.

[17:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think I meant "How would a custom treebuilder be implemented any differently to the treebuilders that are currently implemented?"

[17:38:01.0000] <pingveno>
Ah

[17:38:02.0000] <pingveno>
I'm not sure where to start. I can't find any documentation.

[17:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
like, there are currently n (standard) treebuilders, so I'd assume that adding a new one would just mean there's now n+1 treebuilders with no fundamental differences

[17:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, lack of documentation sounds like a significant problem with that :-(

[17:39:01.0000] <pingveno>
Yeah, it can be somewhat of a showstopper ;)

[17:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has only ever looked at specific details of the treebuilders, and has no idea how it works from a high-level perspective

[17:42:00.0000] <pingveno>
Time to pull out da ol' text editor.

[17:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
As far as I'm aware, looking at the existing treebuilder code is probably all you can do, until someone who knows what they're talking about is present in this channel :-)

[17:43:01.0000] <pingveno>
It doesn't look terribly difficult to implement.

[17:45:00.0000] <pingveno>
I'm not sure how to go about doing inheritance though.

[17:45:01.0000] <pingveno>
from html5lib.treebuilders._base import ...

[17:45:02.0000] <pingveno>
Then inherit from that?

[17:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Might be easier with 'from html5lib.treebuilders import _base' and then refer to _base.Node etc, to avoid name collisions

[17:47:00.0000] <pingveno>
Oh, true

[17:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose you'd then need to do something hacky to make html5lib/treebuilders/__init__.py's getTreeBuilder give you your own treebuilder - doesn't look like it's designed to be externally extensible

[17:51:00.0000] <pingveno>
Are you sure? It looks like it just initializes the TreeBuilder class.

[17:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I'm not sure at all

[17:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
I thought it was called automatically when you created an HTMLParser, but that seems to not be the case, so you can just pass in a treebuilder object directly

[17:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's definitely true that I don't know what I'm talking about, so I should probably just go to bed :-)

[17:53:01.0000] <pingveno>
East coast by chance?

[18:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, England

[18:07:00.0000] <pingveno>
Ah, quite a bit further.

[18:07:01.0000] <pingveno>
I'm on the US's west coast

[19:07:00.0000] <kingryan>
anyone here know of any good tools for evaluating the accessibility of web pages?

[00:51:00.0000] <annevk3>
http://www.w3.org/2008/10/16-tagmem-minutes.html

[00:51:01.0000] <annevk3>
TVR: '... But one more "old guy" that the 20 year olds won't listen to'

[01:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't think the age is the key differentiator of way of thinking. I think exposure to the bug database of a browser engine is it.

[01:08:00.0000] <annevk3>
sounds plausible

[01:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not sure what to think about being the person mentioned as the potential Hixie surrogate

[01:17:00.0000] <annevk3>
If they don't get someopposition that panel will be boring

[01:19:00.0000] <annevk3>
it has three proponents so far and no "opponent"

[01:19:01.0000] <annevk3>
but then "none of us" is really opposed either, it's just that reality is sometimes different

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's the thing

[01:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
someone in the tag said they were surprised that i knew what the tag would say

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
but it's pretty easy -- on any topic, they answer the same as i would answer, if i wasn't constrained by practical concerns

[02:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. with the passwords-in-the-clear thing -- obviously, you should never send passwords in the clear

[02:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
except, of course, when you can't afford to do otherwise and have to work with legacy UAs

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
but the latter concerns seem to be given very little weight in tag discussions

[02:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
same with defining error handling -- obviously it would be better to not have to worry about that and just require everyone to write valid documents

[02:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
except, of course, that in reality people uniformly write non-conforming output

[02:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
same with content sniffing -- i'd love to have a labelling mechanism that was completely authoritative

[02:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
except, of course, that in reality people mislabel their content and the users want it to work anyway

[02:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
until the tag as a whole is willing to put the realities of the web ahead of theoretical purity, they'll never write finding and architecture documents that are applicable to specs that get wide deployment

[02:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i'm packing. i'm bringing my ps2 games, do i need to bring anything else? e.g. controller?

[02:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: memory card?

[02:06:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: If it has anything useful for those games

[02:06:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: No controller needed, we have two.

[02:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I'm bringing GT4 and GT3, gsnedders is bringing a couple as well

[02:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
F1:05 and NFS:HP2

[02:07:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, bringing any GTAs? I've not played them much/at all on console

[02:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
GTA rather sucks with > 1 person, though

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have vice city and san andreas that i'll bring

[02:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
along with memory cards for save games

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok bed time

[02:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm… My memory card my have a save for SA too

[02:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I think there are "rampages" in GTA SA can be 2P on PS2

[02:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I never liked them

[02:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It just seemed clumsily done

[02:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ok

[02:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what to do about supper tomorrow

[02:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't wanna be a loner!

[02:45:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[02:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I'll want something to eat when I arrive at the hotel

[02:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: When do you arrive?

[02:47:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, in the evening, possibly quite late...let me see if I can narrow that down

[02:47:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I arrive in Cannes railway station around 7pm

[02:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, that's plenty early enough

[02:48:00.0000] <BenMillard>
taxi from there to hotel, most likely

[02:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, we could probably head out somewhere at 8ish

[02:48:02.0000] <BenMillard>
cool :)

[02:48:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(reasonable time for French supper :))

[02:48:04.0000] <gsnedders>
meet you in lobby at 20:00?

[02:48:05.0000] <BenMillard>
sure, sounds like a plan :)

[02:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Whatever lobby there is :)

[02:49:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I like quite plain food...spicy stuff and weird stuff I generally can't eat

[02:49:02.0000] <BenMillard>
steak ftw

[02:49:03.0000] <gsnedders>
me too.

[02:49:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Not French steak though.

[02:49:05.0000] <gsnedders>
(which is cook very hot and very quickly, basically just sealing in all the blood and other juices)

[02:49:06.0000] <BenMillard>
ah, that's a good point

[02:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I'll bring my web research on USB as well as having it online, as a failsafe

[02:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I could bring GTA2 with some custom levels which can be fun in 1P and spectating but it's for Windows PC and sometimes dislikes modern hardware

[02:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: If it can live with a MBP for hardware, then you could bring it

[02:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, what's MBP in that context?

[02:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: MacBook Pro

[02:54:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, well it's only 1 CD so we may as well try :)

[02:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[02:54:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(this is a mid '07 17" model, FWIW)

[02:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, oh wait is the screen's aspect ratio about 4:3? GTA2 does have a "windowed" mode but I've not had much success using it...

[02:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: No, it isn't

[02:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh well, we can try it once and forget it if it seems difficult :)

[02:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me should probably install a security update or 40 for windows :P

[02:57:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, these are the levels, to whet your appetite: http://projectcerbera.com/gta/2/multislayer/

[03:19:00.0000] <annevk3>
/me is almost there :)

[03:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Heh. Each one of the major four browsers parses the response-line in a different way.

[03:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm. Opera uses ISO-8859-1 for this, IE uses Windows-1252

[03:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Fx just stops at U+007F

[03:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And Saf does something bizarre

[03:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ooo… I can get a bug fixed in IE7 probably!

[03:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Because I have accidently found a security hole)

[04:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Got "x-foo" header "h~U:geoffrey sneddon", expected "h

[04:09:00.0000] <Hemebond>
That's quite a security hole. I don't know about anyone else but it certainly makes ME want to give you the keys to my house.

[04:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[04:16:00.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, yt?

[04:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, Requiem 1.8 for Mac is available now

[04:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
works with iTunes 8

[04:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>

I imagine France has open areas where you can play non-destructive games, like UK?

[08:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me assumes GTA counts as a destructive game

[08:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, it does if you get so frustrated that you wreck the controller :P

[08:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me has heard of some people who play GTA non-destructively, and are careful to stop at red lights and follow the road markings carefully

[08:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: We're on the south coast, so there'll be beaches, somewhere.

[08:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh yeah, I want to touch the Mediterranean Sea at some point during the TPAC

[08:57:01.0000] <BenMillard>
just as one of those things

[08:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[08:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
If you bring swimming things, you should be able to swim

[09:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I won't be swimming, I'll touch it with a hand

[09:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I won't be cold :P

[09:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/5day.shtml?world=4164

[09:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I don't have any swimming things that fit...I could buy some beach shorts but it's a bit late now

[09:05:01.0000] <BenMillard>
and I haven't swam in, erm, several years

[09:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Nor have I :P

[09:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
well, maybe we can figure something out while there

[09:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
like not swimming? :P

[09:08:01.0000] <BenMillard>
who knows :)

[09:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
oh shit.

[09:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
gsnedders.com is about to expire

[09:08:04.0000] <BenMillard>
"about" as in "tomorrow" or "about" as in "1 month from now"?

[09:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: next week

[09:09:01.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, looks like it's already expired to me

[09:09:02.0000] <BenMillard>
http://gsnedders.com/ yeah?

[09:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah

[09:09:04.0000] <gsnedders>
WTF?

[09:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it's just a load of adverts and promo links to me

[09:10:01.0000] <BenMillard>
which isn't what used to be there

[09:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess trying to renew that caused that

[09:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
But I have no credit card, so I can't

[09:11:00.0000] <BenMillard>
good luck with it

[09:11:01.0000] <BenMillard>
renew it the same way you bought it originally, perhaps?

[09:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It should start working again in a few minutes. meh.

[09:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's stupid.

[09:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Right, should be working again

[09:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, first Firefox gave me a message "This page isn't redirecting properly"

[09:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blames DNS caching

[09:39:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, tried again and I'm at a page of adds for Go Daddy.com, as before

[09:39:03.0000] <BenMillard>
I guess it might take a few more minutes? :)

[09:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Or change to something like OpenDNS where you can force a refresh of the cache ;P

[09:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I won't be able to count everything I wanted to count to give you summary statistics before TPAC, but when we meet you can point out anything you want me to count and I'll do that during November.

[10:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if it's really possible to register a domain like xn--electroencephalography.net, or if there's going to be some annoying IDN restrictions to prevent such things

[10:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
At least one domain registrar seems happy with that for .net and .com (but no other TLD)

[10:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
cool, all of this fits in 1 suitcase! http://projectcerbera.com/blog/2008/10/packed-1.jpg

[10:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: got it

[10:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
cool

[11:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, any days work well for you working through my collection with me?

[11:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: no idea off hand yet

[11:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, okies. I expect to be in HTMLWG all Thursday and Friday, so we could split off from there if it gets boring, or meet randomly on an earlier day

[11:10:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders is probably the best person to ping if you want to contact me while at TPAC

[11:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: But then think of what will be on lastweekinhtml5 if Hixie isn't in the meeting :P

[11:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Are you assuming you'll be with me 24/7?

[11:11:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, no but you have my phone number :)

[11:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
c'est vrai

[11:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: i'm in meetings all week in theory

[11:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: When do you arrive?

[11:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: but earlier in the week is probably best

[11:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: sunday night

[11:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
i leave in 45 minutes

[11:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, earlier works for me; I've got PFWG on Monday afternoon so maybe before that?

[11:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: what time?

[11:18:00.0000] <timbl_>
 looking over logs ... sees # [10:08] <Hixie> "but it's pretty easy -- on any topic, they [the TAG] answer the same as i would answer, if i wasn't constrained by practical concerns  " 

[11:19:00.0000] <timbl_>
Well, easy to say .. One could say "Yeah, always know what the WHATWG would say .. just what I would say if i were just thinking of the past and present and not the future" .

[11:19:01.0000] <timbl_>
But I don't say that for one thing the WHATWG like the TAG is a bunch of people .. and they would dsy different hings

[11:20:00.0000] <timbl_>
/me has flakey connection

[11:20:01.0000] <timbl_>
and anyway it would be disrespectful and impolite.

[11:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
timbl, nice to see you here :)

[11:26:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I think Hixie is close to setting off for TPAC, so he might not be available to reply right away

[11:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that Punycode "xn--blind" decodes into Braille characters ("⡑⡒⡊"), which is a strange coincidence

[11:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
timbl_: when i say "the tag would say" i'm just referring to what publications from the tag would say, not to the opinions of individuals in the tag

[11:38:00.0000] <timbl_>
Well,  the publications of the TAG are fairly few and far between.. but the discussion here is often about the minutes of the last meeting.

[11:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure, but the two sweeping statements i made were only meant to refer to the publications

[11:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
and i stand by them -- i think the tag's publications are theoretically sound

[11:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is fine, for a set of architectural principles

[11:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
to strive for

[11:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
but they're not achievable in specs that have to be actuall widely implemented

[11:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
for example, even the w3c sends passwords in the clear

[11:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
and not sniffing for video content in resources sent as text/plain simply isn't a marketable option

[11:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think hsivonen's comments earlier were spot on -- one's point of view starts to change when one has to deal with browser bugs

[11:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
(from the point of view of the implementors)

[11:44:01.0000] <timbl_>
The tag and the whatwg are sets of well-meaning smart people -- with similar goals but different emphasis.

[11:44:02.0000] <timbl_>
Beware the Second System Effect.

[11:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[11:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
or rather, why do you think the second system effect may be a problem here?

[11:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm assuming you're referring to the idea that when designing a system the second time from scratch, one tends to overengineer it. but the whatwg work is explicitly not designing anything from scratch.)

[11:46:00.0000] <timbl_>
It is easy when redesigning or doing a second run on the design to take into account the clear bugs in system 1 -- but in designing system 2 to fail to meet the design goals of system 1 which et system 1 designers toiled for in their time

[11:46:01.0000] <timbl_>
It may not be totally good match with Fred Vrroks experience.

[11:47:00.0000] <timbl_>
The WHATWG is concerned wit practical life building for a world with leacy web pages and legacy web browsers.  The TAG is concerned about building a world of modular orthognal specs which ill support future developmesnt by otehrs to come

[11:48:00.0000] <timbl_>
/me scuse my typing

[11:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i would posit that the second system effect is far far more likely with the xhtml2 work than with html5 :-) i mean, with html5, we're explicitly not redesigning anything. that's one of our core goals and requirements.

[11:48:02.0000] <timbl_>
These are different concens -- they are both important.

[11:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
the whatwg/html5 work is about extending the legacy system to support future developments

[11:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
it bridges both of the concerns you list

[11:49:02.0000] <timbl_>
Sometimes they seem to conflict but I think we have to try to be smart and get both

[11:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
the tag only seems to focus on the second of these two concerns, which is why its publications repeatedly make what the whatwgers consider elementary mistakes (not taking into account the legacy)

[11:49:04.0000] <timbl_>
Well, I would like ther to be a path by which browsers work with logacy markup, but don't encourage you to make it.

[11:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's the whatwg path :-)

[11:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
we make legacy markup invalid

[11:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
just like with html4 and before

[11:50:03.0000] <timbl_>
Well, I don't see browsers helping me tidy my pages.

[11:51:00.0000] <timbl_>
Or letting me (for what I declare to be my own web site) see the warnings of things which my CMS has generated

[11:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
you never will -- the vendors aren't willing to do that. that's not a whatwg problem, we (whatwg/html5) are just working with what constraints they give us

[11:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
warnings are shown in firefox and safari

[11:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's orthogonal to the specs

[11:52:00.0000] <timbl_>
Well, it isn't.

[11:52:01.0000] <timbl_>
In a way.

[11:52:02.0000] <timbl_>
You are dsigning a system.

[11:52:03.0000] <timbl_>
In a way, a system of servers and browsers and readers and publishers.

[11:52:04.0000] <timbl_>
You think about what readers and publishers will and won't be prepared to do  a lot.

[11:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
right, otherwise we'll get ignored

[11:53:01.0000] <timbl_>
The people working on HTML5 largely ARE the bowser vendors.

[11:54:00.0000] <timbl_>
"- the vendors aren't willing to do that. that's not a whatwg problem,"  uggests they are not connected.

[11:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Then why aren't the browser vendors interested enough to work on other specs?

[11:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
of the 500 people in the htmlwg list and the 900 people in the whatwg list, at most 10% are browser vendors

[11:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
probably far, far less

[11:54:04.0000] <gsnedders>
How many browser vendors are working on XHTML2? Why is there not more interest there?

[11:55:00.0000] <timbl_>
gsnedders, we wre not talking about XHTML2, but about browses showing warnings when they have had to use error correction

[11:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
timbl_: i gotta go catch a train. shall we continue this conversation monday at lunch?

[11:56:00.0000] <timbl_>
Monday lunch alas I can't do

[11:56:01.0000] <timbl_>
ummmm unless i can move things around

[11:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok well ping me on irc, let me know what works for you -- i'm mostly free except monday dinner

[11:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
ttyl

[11:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
gotta go now

[11:56:05.0000] <timbl_>
Ok, bon voyage

[11:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
timbl_: I'm just speaking more generally about future development

[11:57:01.0000] <timbl_>
I'll see if we I can do lunch

[11:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, I wonder what I'm doing about lunch tomorrow

[11:57:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm on TGV from Lyon :\

[11:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
timbl_: I think the main point is there is no point in requiring UAs to show warnings in a spec if the requirement is just going to be ignored

[11:58:01.0000] <timbl_>
there are worse places to be than the tgv

[11:59:00.0000] <timbl_>
It should not be in the language spec at all, but a good practcie note

[11:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
timbl_: Oh, sure, far worse. :)

[11:59:02.0000] <gsnedders>
timbl_: What use is even a good practice note if nobody is going to follow it?

[12:00:00.0000] <timbl_>
I know you folks like to put just everything in a big document ;-) ... but a good pracftce note about how to encourage good behavior 

[12:00:01.0000] <timbl_>
If there is a concerted message that the web would get better if browser manufacturers implemenetd it, it could well.

[12:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't think we like having such a big document, I think we just think that editing one large monolithic document is easier (insofar as less time consuming) than editing several inter-linked documents

[12:01:01.0000] <timbl_>
It IS possible to make things better ... when you are enmired in describing the current mess, importnt also to set a long term course out of it

[12:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me ought to go and get food now :)

[12:01:03.0000] <timbl_>
Trouble with big doc -- dif for peopl eto read & implement the bit they want .. 

[12:02:00.0000] <timbl_>
Ok, i have a plane soon

[12:02:01.0000] <timbl_>
maybe see you in fr

[12:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess I might see you around

[12:02:03.0000] <timbl_>
yup

[12:02:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(I the guy who looks far too young)

[12:02:05.0000] <gsnedders>
*I'm

[12:02:06.0000] <gsnedders>
:D

[12:02:07.0000] <timbl_>
(through being young or lookingit?)

[12:02:08.0000] <gsnedders>
the former

[12:03:00.0000] <timbl_>
/me thinks youngest TP attendee was 12

[12:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is 16

[12:04:00.0000] <timbl_>
well, welcome to the TPAC ...  we don't discriminate on gender, race, color, sexual preference, religion, and *certainly* not age :) 

[12:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has only been discriminated on three of them :)

[12:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[12:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(which is rather sad)

[12:05:03.0000] <Philip`>
You only discriminate on ability to spend the time and money to attend ;-)

[12:06:00.0000] <timbl_>
That is a trciky one, as I know from experience that face-face meetings are so much more efefcive often and build trsut .. esp. in cases like this

[12:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me almost made it to the TPAC last year, but not on his own money :P

[12:06:02.0000] <timbl_>
I wish we could have a scolarship system fro people who don't ahev company /institute tavel

[12:06:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(as it happened, I am in France this week anyway, so it makes it cheaper to get there)

[12:07:00.0000] <timbl_>
someone whould bring it up at the plenary

[12:07:01.0000] <timbl_>
web foundation maybe could make that a goal

[12:07:02.0000] <timbl_>
/me in airport, gtg

[12:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
adios

[13:12:00.0000] <jcranmer>
does IE 8 have support for <video> ?

[13:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jcranmer: AFAIK, no

[13:17:01.0000] <jcranmer>
:-(

[13:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
regarding error reporting in a browser:

[13:17:03.0000] <jcranmer>
guess that means youtube won't be using <video> anytime soon

[13:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I want to make the Java to C++ translator for the parser I'm working on to support code generation with error reporting and without

[13:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that should give us data about perf

[13:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I think perf would be the main motivation for not reporting parse errors

[13:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
jcranmer, YouTube could begin using <video> even without support from IE, since they'll need to supply Flash fallback anyway

[13:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
also, it probably isn't worthwhile to track the error location column in a browser

[13:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I should write a pluggable code path that only does line numbers

[13:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh, and the other thing next to perf is that reporting errors brings along with it all the message localization issues

[13:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(In fact, the reason why I'm doing it without errors first on the C++ side is the trouble with hooking into the Firefox localization infrastructure properly)

[14:19:00.0000] <annevk3>
yo

[14:20:00.0000] <annevk3>
the weather is indeed nice

[14:20:01.0000] <annevk3>
/me forgot to bring shorts

[14:25:00.0000] <jcranmer>
annevk3: selling shorts is illegal in some places now, didn't you know?

[14:25:01.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk3: so, mandelieu is shorts nice

[14:25:02.0000] <virtuelv>
good to know

[14:26:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I was wondering whether I should bring some or not

[14:27:00.0000] <annevk3>
it's slightly colder in the evening

[14:27:01.0000] <annevk3>
but dean had shorts, so it should be ok

[14:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't like shorts

[14:29:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I don't like pants

[14:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blinks

[14:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
oh, yeah, pants means that in en-us

[14:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is there any web version of blame for HTML 5?

[14:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me expects Hixie is to blame

[14:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, but I want to know when to blame him

[14:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Why do you want a web version?

[14:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Because I don't have a co on my laptop

[14:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It's not hard to get one :-p

[14:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: but it wouldn't help at all with blame anyway

[14:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
(since that has to all be computed on the server)

[14:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
(which takes forever)

[14:44:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: git svn!

[14:44:05.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[14:44:06.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Oh, okay

[14:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I have such a copy at home

[14:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Why I don't have it on the laptop's HD is a good question

[14:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
anyhow, g'nite

[15:04:00.0000] <annevk3>
anyone going to CSS tomorrow?

[15:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk3: tomorrow is secret, isn't it

[15:09:01.0000] <Hemebond>
http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/10/reader_confessions.jpg

[15:19:00.0000] <annevk3>
hsivonen, I think you can come, sicking and dbaron will prolly be there

[15:26:00.0000] <virtuelv>
/me is pondering bringing running shoes


2008-10-19
[18:02:00.0000] <famicom>
does anyone here know of a single one true way to create a html form that can be properly aligned by css

[18:03:00.0000] <famicom>
theres fieldsets, labels, floats, linebreaks, paragraphgs, divs

clearing and tables

[02:07:00.0000] <annevk3>
did http://www.w3.org/2008/10/TPAC/TPDay-Agenda.html always say "formalized tagsoup parsing"

[02:08:00.0000] <annevk3>
seems derogatory to me

[02:10:00.0000] <annevk3>
the next sentence sounds weird

[09:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Heh

[09:04:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Reply to håkon's mail does the exact opposite of what was wanted

[10:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm in Mandelieu

[10:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
any dinner plans for tonight?

[21:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm in the lobby if anyone's around

[00:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm in Isles B now.

[00:58:00.0000] <annevk4>
/me will be there later

[00:58:01.0000] <annevk4>
/me needs food

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me peers unhappily at 800ms pings to norway and california

[01:13:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: if you're in mandelieu, everyone else are seeing slow connections

[01:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is in Mandelieu

[01:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(and has slow connection)

[01:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm downstairs by the registration, with BenMillard

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[01:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen and i are in isles b

[01:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
let's make sure we meet up at the break

[01:14:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: What's there?

[01:14:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(and where?)

[01:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
web apps

[01:14:06.0000] <gsnedders>
ah

[01:14:07.0000] <Hixie>
anne's here too

[01:14:08.0000] <Hixie>
and jonas

[01:14:09.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, we just saw anne

[01:15:00.0000] <annevk4>
/me just saw green hair on a photo

[01:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess if we go where anne went we'll find it

[01:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess if I come in you'll all want to see :P

[01:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm assuming he's the one who looked confused when i said hi

[01:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
or rather, when i waved

[01:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me waits for him to get back online

[01:19:00.0000] <virtuelv>
/me is in the other web apps meeting

[03:10:00.0000] <timbl>
Hixie?

[03:11:00.0000] <annevk4>
we're in the Web Apps WG meeting

[03:11:01.0000] <annevk4>
that is, most of the WHATWG people who are here are there, including Hixie :)

[03:13:00.0000] <timbl>
I wondered about having a continuation of the discussion we had this morning about moving html users toward cleaner web pages (etc etc)  on the panel slot at 9:10 tomorrow 

[03:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
timbl: yo wassup

[03:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[03:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
though really any discussion on that should have hsivonen and some browser vendors

[03:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
(i can give my opinions but i'm not the one who can make changes on this)

[03:17:00.0000] <timbl_>
Yes .. I thought that too

[03:17:01.0000] <timbl_>
This machine keeps swicthing access points

[03:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
timbl_: Could we not have a joint TAG/HTML WG meeting Thurs/Fri? Wouldn't that be better allowing more to be around?

[03:21:00.0000] <timbl_>
We do have one set up

[03:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
We do? Oh.

[03:21:02.0000] <timbl_>
But it Thursday 11-12

[03:21:03.0000] <annevk4>
having some informal discussion as well seems good though

[03:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The only think I ever saw was the draft agenda MikeSmith sent out early Sept.

[03:23:00.0000] <annevk4>
especially since the meeting with the TAG is only an hour

[03:23:01.0000] <annevk4>
not a lot really given the amount of people that will be around

[03:23:02.0000] <timbl>
/me looks for logs as he missed a bit

[03:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm definitely in favour of discussing this earlier rather than in the htmlwg meeting

[03:23:04.0000] <annevk4>
timbl, http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg gives you logs

[03:23:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I think we could certainly talk for longer

[03:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But there's also the point that only a tiny fraction of the HTML WG is around

[03:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is lunch going to at Pullman?

[03:25:01.0000] <annevk4>
yeah, same level as most meetings

[03:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Is that this level?

[03:25:03.0000] <annevk4>
yes :)

[03:25:04.0000] <annevk4>
other side of the staircase

[03:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ah

[03:30:00.0000] <timbl_>
Ok Hixie, if you can get Henri to join that would be great

[03:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will attempt to get a revised HTML WG agenda out later today

[03:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me changes topic to 'WHATWG (HTML5) -- http://www.whatwg.org/ -- Logs: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/ -- Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks! -- gsnedders had green hair, photos coming soon. :-) Anyone around at TPAC find him if you want to see them first.'

[03:30:03.0000] <annevk4>
sweet

[03:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: k

[03:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: It seems to have changed a bit

[03:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[03:31:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
timbl_: was planning on having TAG from 11 to 12:30, so 1.5 hr instead of just one hour

[03:32:00.0000] <timbl>
Ok 

[03:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That still on the whole probably isn't really long enough

[03:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Having a meeting outwith the meeting probably wouldn't be a bad idea

[03:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(apologies for using Scottish English to confuse everyone)

[03:35:00.0000] <timbl>
you mean what used to be a meeting without a meeting in the sense of a farm without the city wall

[03:35:01.0000] <timbl>
?

[03:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah

[03:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
not without, outside of

[03:35:04.0000] <gsnedders>
outwith is the opposite of within

[03:37:00.0000] <timbl>
oe:without  = scot:outwith  != en:without

[03:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yt?

[03:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yes

[03:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
timbl: 9am tomorrow in the tag meeting?

[03:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: are you booked tomorrow morning yet?

[03:39:00.0000] <timbl>
did i say tomorrow .. no wednesday .. 9am in the panel slot

[03:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I've been asked to be in the PF room

[03:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
webarch?

[03:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's not clear if my interest topic fit the agenda tomorrow morning

[03:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in the PF room, that is

[03:40:03.0000] <timbl>
well, with more a focus on HTML5

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
timbl: oh i dunno if a panel would really be a good forum for this dicussion

[03:41:01.0000] <timbl>
Why would a pnel be worse than breakfast?

[03:42:00.0000] <timbl>
It is useful for other folks in both camps to see t earguments.

[03:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
because you won't get browser vendors to be honest with you in front of 1000 people

[03:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
if we want to actually get somewhere, we need an informal meeting

[03:43:00.0000] <timbl>
Well, if a group has one public posture and a different private one then they can't expect symapthy for their public one

[03:43:01.0000] <timbl>
I actually think (a) a lot can be achieved in public and (b) puhing the bounds a bit on accountability of brwser vendors doesn't hurt

[03:44:00.0000] <timbl>
There are always things which vendors need to keep to themselves.  

[03:44:01.0000] <timbl>
We were talking about what sorts of scenario could work.

[03:45:00.0000] <timbl>
The motivatins of page authors etc 

[03:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i'm interested in making actual progress on the topic, but i don't think i'm the person to be on a panel on the topic

[03:46:01.0000] <timbl>
Maybe a panel isn't the place for getting people to change their points of view or think outside the box

[03:46:02.0000] <annevk4>
/me wonders what the topic is

[03:46:03.0000] <timbl>
If you aren't on the panel, Hixie, people would be constntly saying "well, in that case Hixie would say x"

[03:47:00.0000] <timbl>
Anne, possible panel on HTML5 and on Wed am at 9:10

[03:49:00.0000] <annevk4>
that's early :)

[03:49:01.0000] <annevk4>
I suppose I'm ok with it, but if it's the TAG versus me I'm not so sure ;)

[03:49:02.0000] <timbl>
On whether it is possible to make browsers and validators encourage people to make their code cleaner rather than just put out anything which meets the HTML5 parsing rules, etc

[03:50:00.0000] <timbl>
Well, it would be useful to actually not have a a vs. b

[03:50:01.0000] <timbl>
The TAG is a set of peopl.

[03:50:02.0000] <timbl>
The WHATWH is too.

[03:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
timbl: i think we all agree with each other on the goals -- certainly you and i agreed with each other this morning. The problem is that the proposals that have been put forward so far are UI proposals that the vendors aren't convinced by.

[03:51:01.0000] <annevk4>
true, though I think it's fair to say that both groups have a shared mindset

[03:51:02.0000] <annevk4>
to some extent

[03:51:03.0000] <timbl>
We are suggesting Hixie and me and Henri and  ... 

[03:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
timbl: if you put these ideas to the browser vendors in a public forum like a panel, you'll get intuitive push back and then people will remember that panel when they consider the idea later

[03:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
timbl: which will make them negatively predisposed

[03:52:01.0000] <timbl>
Maybe

[03:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
timbl: i think if you want to make actual progress on this you need to speak 1:1 with ui developers that work for browser vendors and ask them directly to help you

[03:52:03.0000] <timbl>
So you think a side meeting somewhere earlier rather than later... 

[03:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[03:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd be happy to help faciliate that

[03:53:02.0000] <annevk4>
I don't think browsers will do more than error consoles and such; that is, won't implement end user visible UI for conformance errors

[03:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
On a totally different note than that, has anyone actually looked at the t-shirt yet? What does it say after the W3C?

[03:53:04.0000] <annevk4>
there's a t-shirt?

[03:53:05.0000] <timbl>
An optional one?  And one you can set to operate for certain web sites (like ones you are involved in generating)

[03:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk4: Got given one a registration

[03:54:01.0000] <timbl>
There is a shirt which says "W3C thanks the chairs"

[03:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
timbl: ah.

[03:55:00.0000] <timbl>
(DHL lost a bunch of them so I didn't take one yet till the lost boxes arrive)

[03:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That sucks.

[03:56:00.0000] <timbl>
slife

[03:57:00.0000] <annevk4>
timbl, that might work, I guess browsers with extensions have that possibility already

[03:57:01.0000] <annevk4>
that is, Firefox

[03:57:02.0000] <timbl>
So who could we get in a browser vendors side discussion?

[03:57:03.0000] <annevk4>
I haven't investigated e.g. Firebug and others closely though for that functionality

[03:57:04.0000] <annevk4>
/me is not a UI guy

[03:58:00.0000] <annevk4>
though I'm pretty sure our UI guys wouldn't like to add default UI for that :)

[03:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me used a validator extension in Firefox for a while, which showed a little green tick / red cross icon in the bottom-right of the screen for every page

[03:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
timbl: It'd be good to get the iCab guy in, but he's not here

[03:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
sicking from mozilla is around, he'd be a good person to talk to

[03:58:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(iCab had a smily depending on conformance)

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does any CSS agent support multiple concurrent views of one DOM?

[04:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what effect an HTML4 validator built into web browsers would have on HTML5 adoptance

[04:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
(because presumably it'd mark all HTML5 pages as invalid)

[04:00:02.0000] <annevk4>
hsivonen, not properly afaik

[04:00:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk4: thanks

[04:00:04.0000] <timbl>
A smiley is a 1-bit verdict ..  1-bit verdicts don't motivate you unless you are near the boundary between failure and success

[04:00:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: very good point

[04:01:00.0000] <timbl>
If it were to give you a 56/100 then you might be interested in how to get 57

[04:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
timbl: Sure, but iCab at least had _some_ UI by default, and I know of no other browser that even had that

[04:01:02.0000] <timbl>
Oh, Arena did 

[04:01:03.0000] <timbl>
prob others

[04:01:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Arena? I've not even heard of that :)

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(my IRC bandwidth sucks with laptop keyboards)

[04:02:01.0000] <timbl>
Dave Raggett's browser .. that was a while ago :)   

[04:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess before I had ever used this internet thing :)

[04:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I always use my laptop, so I'm kinda used to it

[04:06:00.0000] <timbl>
"Raggett also used the Arena browser to show text flow around images, forms and other aspects of HTML at the First WWW Conference in Geneva in 1994. Arena was later used for development work at CERN."  Arena demoed that one could do tables in HTML and that it was useful, and Dave R led a push to agree on table tags.

[04:06:01.0000] <timbl>
()

[04:06:02.0000] <gsnedders>
1994? When I was 2, then.

[04:06:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't really remember that.

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
(...Adoptance? That's not a word. I think I meant adoption.)

[04:11:00.0000] <timbl>
(Well, it was fun. (Still is.)  There was a big drop in interoperability when everyone did different tables, and then a push to get a standard as the web was filling up with ... but anyway .. strange that time sips by so fast that anyone was a  young as 2 then. )

[04:11:01.0000] <timbl>
Well i have a keynote before that ... i could use it to talk about this

[04:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wakaba: are you there?

[05:17:00.0000] <roc>
If you install Firebug, and enable it globally (or for particular web sites, both are easy), it shows an error count in the bottom right of the window. Clicking on that count gives you the JS error console

[05:21:00.0000] <roc>
Maybe we should give non-validating sites a performance penalty

[05:22:00.0000] <roc>
for some definition of "validating"

[05:52:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: did you say 2pm for tag?

[06:00:00.0000] <smedero>
/me waves to gsnedders

[06:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me waves at smedero 

[06:01:00.0000] <smedero>
gsnedders: how'd you end up getting from the train station at Cannes to Mandelieu?

[06:01:01.0000] <smedero>
taxi?

[06:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: taxi, 25 euro

[06:01:03.0000] <smedero>
k-o, thanks

[06:11:00.0000] <wakaba>
MikeSmith: hi

[06:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wakaba: hey

[06:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: where are you?

[06:12:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: in Widgets joint meeting with TAG

[06:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: Ah. I was kinda tempted by that. I'm just waiting for the other web apps WG

[06:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: discussion with the TAG is about the proposed uri:// schema

[06:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: discussion with the TAG is about the proposed uri:// scheme

[06:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah, I know

[06:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wakaba: see my private message

[06:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
(uri:// scheme? Is that implying that all other schemes are not URIs?)

[06:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: sorry, I meant widget://

[06:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Ah, that makes more sense :-)

[06:18:00.0000] <roc>
I just had a brilliant idea!

[06:20:00.0000] <roc>
Web fonts for IE: Extend Dean Edwards' old IE7 script to parse @font-face, load TTF data with XHR, package it into EOT format, and stick it back in the @font-face as a data: URI

[06:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Seems easier to do the download-TTF-then-convert-to-EOT stages via a (caching) remote server, rather than in JS

[06:22:01.0000] <roc>
nah

[06:22:02.0000] <roc>
this way you just need one script that anyone can pull in with one line of code

[06:23:00.0000] <roc>
and IE does all the work

[06:24:00.0000] <roc>
I wonder how much of the CSSOM spec IE8 implements

[06:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
You can do it my way with just one script that anyone can pull in with one line of code, since somebody else is worrying about maintaining the server so that's not a concern, and it'll be much faster :-)

[06:29:00.0000] <roc>
Maybe I shouldn't tell anyone, so that Microsoft doesn't disable data: in @font-face src until it's too late

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: yeah, widgets/TAG happening now

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Isn't there something like a 32KB limit on data: URIs in IE8?

[06:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
That'd make it pretty useless for fonts

[06:36:02.0000] <roc>
yeah

[06:36:03.0000] <roc>
apparently :-(

[06:36:04.0000] <roc>
blah

[06:37:00.0000] <jcranmer>
MS @font-face + EOT evangelism leave something to be desired

[06:37:01.0000] <jcranmer>
although ++ on roc's comment about MS probably not being willing to break compatibility

[06:38:00.0000] <roc>
well, I guess the reverse thing still works for Gecko and Webkit --- you can use script and the CSSOM to XHR-fetch an EOT font, unpack it, and put it back as a data: URL

[06:38:01.0000] <roc>
although i guess I shouldn't talk too much about that

[06:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Can't someone just write a TTF-to-EOT conversion tool that ignores the licensing bits?

[06:39:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I'm quite sure someone would complain about that

[06:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: non-conforming sites could get a perf penalty if reporting errors to console has non-trivial cost

[06:40:00.0000] <roc>
it actuall does

[06:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: People complain about lots of things, but that doesn't stop those things from getting done :-)

[06:40:02.0000] <jcranmer>
it seems to me that the EOT proponents are trying to eat their cake and have it too

[06:41:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I think I recall one of them pointing out that it wasn't difficult to ignore the license bit

[06:42:00.0000] <roc>
Bert's summary talked about how an EOT recorded its domain binding and also how trivial it is for someone to change that information

[06:42:01.0000] <jcranmer>
okay, that's where it was

[06:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm it seems something's gone wrong, either in the spec or in my impl, because it's not matching ie :(

[06:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(html color attributes)

[06:45:00.0000] <annevk4>
so per the latest argument, if you insert @font-face through script things are ok?

[06:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
roc: But they have a checksum, to prevent tampering!

[06:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
which is clearly foolproof

[06:47:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: that's where it gets really silly. Bert's saying EOT is no problem w.r.t. DRM since it's so easily modified. In which case the checksum and XORing really are completely pointless complexity.

[06:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It's the sum of all bytes in the RootString, XORred with 0x50475342)

[06:47:02.0000] <karlcow>
[11:55]  <timbl> There is a shirt which says "W3C thanks the chairs"

[06:47:03.0000] <karlcow>
http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/10/w3c-chairs-tshirt

[06:47:04.0000] <Philip`>
The file format description says RootString is a "list of URLs" - does that actually mean URLs, or is it URL prefixes, or is it domains, or what?

[06:47:05.0000] <roc>
it doesn't say

[06:48:00.0000] <roc>
IE interprets it as a list of URL prefixes

[06:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
Okay

[06:49:00.0000] <roc>
which is important, because a) it really needs to be URL prefixes to be useful for any dynamic site and b) EOT proponents recommend using it to scope to domains except when c) they need to talk about how EOT binds fonts to "particular documents" or "full URLs"

[06:50:00.0000] <roc>
annevk4: that's more or less what I asked in my latest message

[06:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
aha. i should be trimming all but the right-most 8 chars

[08:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/test/html/rendering/color-attributes/

[08:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
"#123": got #010203, expected #112233

[08:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
says IE6, in all modes

[08:52:00.0000] <annevk4>
zcorpan, yo, see krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs for CSS logs

[09:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk4: did anyone actually raise the "null" issue in an e-mail anywhere?

[09:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
nm found it

[09:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
any dinner plans?

[09:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've got plans for tonight already

[09:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i'll be up for stuff the rest of the week

[09:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me was planning on following someone

[09:17:01.0000] <annevk4>
/me has no real plans yet

[09:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
I have no plans yet either

[09:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the session I'm in is ending in a minute

[09:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen, Lachy : I'd be up for eating dinner somewhere close by

[09:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
coming down in a moment

[09:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
k

[09:31:02.0000] <annevk4>
i'll join!

[09:31:03.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, ok

[09:31:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I'll join too

[09:31:05.0000] <Lachy>
/me votes McDonalds :-)

[09:31:06.0000] <gsnedders>
/me takes out knife, and shows Lachy it

[09:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
that will be useful for cutting up my chips. Thanks

[09:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
does McDonalds have wine and/or beer?

[09:32:02.0000] <Lachy>
only in Germany, I think

[09:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
nein!

[09:32:04.0000] <annevk4>
Lachy can go out on his own

[09:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh well, I'll lurk around with you guys :P

[09:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so let's plan to meet at 7 in the lobby

[09:54:00.0000] <annevk4>
k

[09:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: dinner group leaving the lobby at 19:00?

[10:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'll go to my hotel and come back for 19:00

[10:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yeah

[11:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
The page navigation on the BBC iPlayer is rather odd if you don't have CSS

[11:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
It uses an <ol> so it looks like "1. Previous" / "2. 1" / "3. 2" / "4. 3" / "5. 4" / "6. Next"

[12:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i just learned that <!doctype html> doesn't work with asp.net 3.5

[12:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but the xslt-compat doctype works

[12:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: here authors have to choose between the xslt-compat doctype and violating a "should not", and using something else (e.g. xhtml transitional)

[15:25:00.0000] <jcranmer>
g'morning, roc

[15:25:01.0000] <roc>
hi

[16:51:00.0000] <roc>
this game is fun

[16:52:00.0000] <roc>
Microsoft pretends to have a coherent position on Web fonts, and we pretend to be finding out what it is

[16:52:01.0000] <jcranmer>
more changes?

[16:57:00.0000] <olliej>
roc: did you see this thread https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2008-October/005442.html ?


2008-10-21
[17:00:00.0000] <ojan>
https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2008-October/005442.html

[17:00:01.0000] <ojan>
oops. sorry.

[17:01:00.0000] <ojan>
stupid focus issues.

[17:37:00.0000] <takkaria>
I love the latest lastweek post

[17:50:00.0000] <roc>
olliej: yes, thanks

[01:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
good lord

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've had better network connectivity on aircraft over the pacific

[01:09:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: is it that bad today?

[01:10:00.0000] <virtuelv>
uhm, yeah, 2.4 second lag on IRC says so

[01:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
8% packet loss, round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 240.488/710.241/1033.070/166.841 ms

[01:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
>500ms pings to the router in the hotel, let alone anywhere useful

[01:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't get a ping to/from router

[01:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
so next year's meeting might be at the scmariott.com hotel

[01:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
i notice on their front page:

[01:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
that they are a TAG approved hotel

[01:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we should start approving hotels too!

[01:19:00.0000] <annevk4>
do we really want to get in the endorsing hotel business? :p

[01:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[01:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess we need sane bed, sane breakfast, and good free wifi

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
not the order i would have put them in, but yes

[01:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: What do you want to know if we're discussing?

[01:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm following the minutes on irc

[01:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, which meeting are you in today?

[01:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
css right now

[02:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What colour should we paint the bikeshed?

[02:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
multicoloured

[02:06:00.0000] <virtuelv>
it should have no colour

[02:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
transparent?

[02:07:00.0000] <virtuelv>
or it can absorb all colors equally in the spectrum of visible (and invisible) light

[02:07:01.0000] <virtuelv>
s/equally/completely/

[02:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. When we can get totally non-reflective black paint, sure

[02:10:00.0000] <roc>
black body bikeshed

[02:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
anyone know of a CLI browser with Javascript support?

[02:49:00.0000] <doublec>
gsnedders, elinks?

[02:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
doublec: Copy in Debian doesn't support it, and I can't be bothered compiling a browser from scratch just to do one bloody thing

[02:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Facebook doesn't work either, seemingly

[02:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is trying IE

[02:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The progress bar is moving, at least

[02:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
If it has any meaning :P

[02:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
And now stuck, waiting for server to never respond

[05:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yt?

[05:46:00.0000] <annevk4>
network...

[05:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk4: is Henri around?

[05:46:02.0000] <annevk4>
yes

[05:46:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
where?

[05:46:04.0000] <annevk4>
should I summon him elsewhere?

[05:46:05.0000] <annevk4>
webapps

[05:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[05:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm here now

[05:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: can you come to room 135? knock on the door

[05:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm supposed to be in the PF room at 14

[05:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is room 135 a meeting rrom or a hotel room?

[05:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looking for the rom now

[07:07:00.0000] <annevk4>
so is anything interesting happening over there?

[07:07:01.0000] <annevk4>
my meeting is basically over

[07:08:00.0000] <annevk4>
Hixie, ^^

[08:15:00.0000] <annevk4>
Hixie, you might want to check http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/10/normative-references-conformance.html#c167608

[08:18:00.0000] <annevk4>
/me thought Hixie said CSSWG was discussing HTML5

[08:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk4: i said counters. :-) which might affect html5

[08:28:00.0000] <annevk4>
I understood headers/sections too

[08:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah they said something about html5 headers in the minutes

[08:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm guessing they'll get to that

[08:29:02.0000] <annevk4>
ok, cool

[08:29:03.0000] <annevk4>
I'll continue reading chairs and Member-only lists meanwhile

[08:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
anything interesting?

[08:30:00.0000] <annevk4>
chairs continues to be interesting

[08:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm reading that

[08:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me loves the internet

[08:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sitting in a room with a device that has no wires coming off it

[08:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm in france

[08:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
yet i'm copying files from my girlfriend's laptop to our mac mini in our living room in the us

[08:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
(there's a firewall on both sides, which is even cooler, since it means i have to tunnel things between a third machine over ssh)

[08:48:00.0000] <wilhelm>
(c:

[08:49:00.0000] <smedero>
anyone @tpac know where gsnedders or BenMillard might be?

[08:49:01.0000] <annevk4>
/me notes Hixie is not unique in that :)

[08:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
smedero: CSS room for Ben

[08:49:03.0000] <smedero>
hsivonen: thanks!

[08:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thinks it would be cooler if you didn't have to involve four separate machines just so that you (can watch videos from your living room | have backups | remove incriminating evidence | whatever you're doing)

[08:52:00.0000] <annevk4>
smedero, gsnedders should be at your hotel

[08:53:00.0000] <annevk4>
smedero, he was a bit sick

[08:53:01.0000] <smedero>
annevk4: ahh, bummer. thanks for the info.

[08:54:00.0000] <annevk4>
smedero, you around now?

[08:54:01.0000] <smedero>
yep, in the lobby

[08:55:00.0000] <smedero>
(of the pullman)

[08:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
The "security image" anti-phishing technique would be much more effective if it wasn't possible for phishing sites to say "Recent update: We have listened to our customers, and to streamline our login process we have removed the need for the security image. Please just enter your username and password: [____] [____] [OK!]"

[08:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Or just proxy the image in the case of openID ;)

[08:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: moving videos from carey's laptop to our mac mini so that she has spare room on her hard drive :-)

[08:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Ah, so the problem is just that the internet is rubbish, so you're still reliant on legacy concepts like local data storage

[08:59:01.0000] <annevk4>
smedero, ok, CSS is discussing paged media

[08:59:02.0000] <annevk4>
smedero, I've the feeling I made a mistake going in :)

[08:59:03.0000] <smedero>
heh.

[09:00:00.0000] <annevk4>
especially since Ben was suggesting to play frisbee

[09:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: hmmmmmm i guess!

[09:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Paged media? Is that when it's too large to all fit in RAM at once?)

[09:00:03.0000] <smedero>
I figured at this late in the day, there isn't much point in me observing CSS or anything else

[09:00:04.0000] <smedero>
lol

[09:01:00.0000] <annevk4>
Philip`, it's about killing trees

[09:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
and slideshows

[09:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, good, I don't like trees

[09:03:00.0000] <smedero_>
oh the wifi here is lovely.

[09:03:01.0000] <smedero_>
:-(

[09:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk4: Can't you just ask 'please sir can I go to the toilet?' and then run off and play frisbee?

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
I always found that was a quite effective tactic

[09:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's so... british

[09:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
smedero, are you still in the lobby?

[09:12:01.0000] <annevk4>
timbl, good you're here, I was wondering if I'm still signed up for a panel or not and whether I should prepare something other than being around

[09:13:00.0000] <smedero>
Lachy: yep, going through 24+ hours of missed email

[09:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
smedero, ok. This css stuff is boring me. I'm going to come out shortly

[09:13:02.0000] <timbl>
annek4, I don't think unless whoever is moderating it has said otherwise you need to prepare a talk.

[09:14:00.0000] <timbl>
annek4,..  might be a good idea to find others on teh panel beforehand and get to know them a bit

[09:14:01.0000] <annevk4>
timbl, so you were basically nominating me yesterday, I wasn't sure whether that was serious

[09:14:02.0000] <annevk4>
sorry, seems it was

[09:14:03.0000] <annevk4>
I should have checked the agenda first

[09:15:00.0000] <timbl>
If you don't want to do it don't.  But you have been vocal about philosophy of html5.  So have hixie and henri d

[09:15:01.0000] <timbl>
s/ s/ d

[09:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
smedero, are you upstairs or downstairs?

[09:15:03.0000] <annevk4>
timbl, ok

[09:16:00.0000] <smedero>
Lachy: I'm downstairs, next to the casino entrance... wearing a black long sleeved shirt.

[09:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
This sounds like a spy movie

[09:18:00.0000] <annevk4>
we're in casino royale

[09:18:01.0000] <annevk4>
well, royale casino to be fair, but that's less fun

[09:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Could make for some exciting (completely fictional) reports afterwards

[09:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
is chaals onlien anywhere?

[09:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
many of his "must"s in progress events make little sense to me

[14:15:00.0000] <csarven>
Are there any known UA issues for creating an element inside <img> in HTML4

[14:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
not to my knowledge but i doubt it is widely tested


2008-10-22
[00:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me replies to an e-mail from 2004

[00:32:00.0000] <phroggy>
Hixie: what are the legacy reasons why we can't allow arbitrary markup in <option>?  And did you mean to say we can't allow additional elements to be nested inside an <option> element, or also that we can't allow the <option> element to have a new property, which was the suggestion?

[00:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
<option> parse rules are pretty much set in stone now. And the former.

[00:34:00.0000] <phroggy>
I kinda like the idea of <option value="foo" icon="foo.png">

[00:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
is it something OS UIs do?

[00:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
(show me)

[00:35:00.0000] <phroggy>
not generally.

[00:35:01.0000] <phroggy>
hmm..

[00:35:02.0000] <phroggy>
I'm pretty sure I've seen icons in menus on Gnome and KDE...

[00:35:03.0000] <phroggy>
not necessarily for option lists.

[00:36:00.0000] <phroggy>
these are the kinds of icons that immediately come to mind:  http://www.linuxine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/gnome-delete.jpg

[00:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
<option> is the wrong element for that, you want <menu><command>, which has an icon="" attribute.

[00:37:01.0000] <phroggy>
ah, sweet.

[00:38:00.0000] <phroggy>
but while this example is obviously from a menu, I can definitely imagine situations where icons on options would be nice.

[00:39:00.0000] <phroggy>
I'm a big fan of little icons like those, helping the user to more quickly recognize what they're looking at.

[00:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
if it was common UI, then sure

[00:40:00.0000] <phroggy>
maybe something for HTML 6, when OS UIs have caught up to my imagination...

[00:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[00:42:00.0000] <phroggy>
/me wonders how long it will take Microsoft to post the transcript of last week's IE chat

[00:43:00.0000] <phroggy>
I think they ignored my questions about <input type="search"> and placeholder.

[00:43:01.0000] <phroggy>
but it's possible I just missed their response.

[00:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me replies to yet more 2004 e-mail

[00:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hiho

[00:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
morning

[00:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is five rows behind you

[00:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero is beside me

[00:46:02.0000] <smedero>
/me needs coffee

[00:46:03.0000] <gsnedders>
drugs--

[00:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
aren't the coffee machines set up outside yet?

[00:47:01.0000] <smedero>
lachy: when I walked by they weren't up quite yet

[00:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is HTML broken?

[00:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes?

[00:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
if it wasn't broken we wouldn't be fixing it!

[00:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[00:53:00.0000] <phroggy>
/me breaks off another little piece of it

[00:57:00.0000] <annevk4>
wow, network fails

[01:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
where did anne go

[01:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
someone near anne poke him online again

[01:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparentl "near anne" is me. ok then.

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
this network is horrible

[03:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
this hotel holds this conference every two years, you'd think they'd have worked out capacity by now

[03:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Why do we come back?

[03:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[03:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not having any problems with the network today. I only find it inconvenient because of the login process

[03:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
we're geting ~25% packet loss and >1000ms pings

[03:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
pinging to what host?

[03:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
`any

[03:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
the second hop is the problem

[03:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
pinging google.com a few times, I get packet loss raning from 0% to 100%

[03:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
right, we're averaging about 25%

[03:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
and about 800ms average ping, stddev 500ms

[03:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
502.225ms average, stddev 188.816ms here

[03:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
only 10% loss

[03:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
which is about as bad as you can get before it doesn't count as a network anymore

[03:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
how many pings are you testing over?

[03:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
make sure to test over a long sample

[03:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
10

[03:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
with such a high variance, you have to wait a while

the hotel is not in charge of the network. Orange is. The worse thing is that it is exactly the same engineers from two years ago. And the issues have been clearly introduced with the bad previous experiences

Mr Last Week seems to really dig the name I assigned him

[03:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but I don't seem to have made his blog since he adopted said sobriquet as his own

[03:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"scathing comment about w3c management"

[03:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"disdainful scorn towards standards prescriptivists"

[03:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
doing a traceroute, there seems to be abour 4 problematic hops spread between here and google.colm

[03:21:02.0000] <Lachy>

[03:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
once you hit one problematic hop, you can't tell if the others are problematic

[03:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"self-important statement of trivial truth"

[03:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, right

[03:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
apparently i shouldn't complain about the network

[03:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
i just got disconnected altogether :-)

[03:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, did you decide to skip this session, or are you sitting elsewhere in here?

[03:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm in the hall

[03:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was going to work

[03:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
but that plan backfired

[03:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
since the network is unusable

[03:24:04.0000] <gsnedders>

I was really looking forward to the plenary, but have been rather disappointed so far :(

[03:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh?

[03:26:02.0000] <Lachy>
I was looking forward to it only because it's the first one I've been to

[03:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i can't work on this network. bbl.

If people are going to insist on putting annoying video adverts on the web, I wish they at least knew how to do it without horrible interlacing effects

[06:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk4: so is the the case where both a parent and a child element of that parent element have the tabindex attribute set unclear?

[06:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, here's the documentations for opera's implementation of showNotification() in widgets that we were talking about last night. http://dev.opera.com/libraries/widgetobject/docs/widget.dml#showNotification

[06:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
it seems quite different from the one in HTML5

[06:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[06:56:00.0000] <annevk4>
Hixie, I probably should have checked :/

[06:56:01.0000] <Hixie>

I can't upload my slides due to TCP connections not finishing properly :-(

[08:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Tunnel through SSH, so the connection never needs to finish

[09:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: tunneling scp over ssh isn't making my scp connection end

short, sweet, to the point

[17:27:00.0000] <onitunes>
hsivonen: nice

[17:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(the slides weren't projected due to last minute changes in logistics. instead, I read them out)

[00:01:00.0000] <phroggy>
Microsoft: 'The WHATWG is not a "standards" organization we can work with, since it has no patent policy.'

[00:02:00.0000] <phroggy>
what exactly do they mean?

[00:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
they mean that if apple has a patent on something, and they ask for it to be put in the spec, then when microsoft implements canvas, they run the risk of being sued by apple

[00:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is a valid concern

[00:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
and is the main reason we are working with the w3c now

[00:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
of course, the w3c doesn't protect from "random third-party patent troll who is not interested in the standard as such coincidentally has an old patent that could be read to apply to the spec"

[00:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which is the patent problem that tends to actually come up and affect Microsoft

[00:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but you do what you can

[00:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah that's the real problem

[00:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
patent reform is what we really need

[00:06:00.0000] <phroggy>
indeed.

[00:08:00.0000] <phroggy>
the whole concept of patents was, in exchange for describing your invention to the public, the government grants you a monopoly for a limited time; the alternative was to protect it yourself as a trade secret, but if the secret dies with you, the public loses.

[00:09:00.0000] <phroggy>
but software patens typically don't describe anything that could be protected as a trade secret.  They don't protect HOW it was done, they protect the whole concept of anybody doing anything like it.

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[00:11:00.0000] <phroggy>
any web developer with half a brain could develop an online shopping system that lets you buy stuff with one click, although they'll probably give you a list of reasons why it would be a bad idea.  Nobody was doing it before Amazon.com because nobody thought it was a good idea, not because nobody could figure out how to make it work.

[00:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm in the lobby

[00:15:00.0000] <phroggy>
so where will be the benefit to the public when Amazon's One-Click patent expires?  What will the public have gained, that we wouldn't have gained if Amazon had never been granted the One-Click patent?

[00:15:01.0000] <phroggy>
rather, if Amazon had never applied for the One-Click patent?

[00:17:00.0000] <phroggy>
absolutely nothing.  The original concept was of a two-way exchange:  you publish your secrets, and we grant you exclusive rights for awhile.

[00:17:01.0000] <phroggy>
but if what you're publishing isn't of any value to the public whatsoever, then we gain nothing in exchange for granting you exclusive rights.  It's not fair.

[00:18:00.0000] <phroggy>

Hixie: Hey!

[01:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Can you stop your laptop beeping?

[02:17:00.0000] <phroggy>
I believe this is a typo:  "and the rules that apply to authors for produce conforming documents."

phroggy, in the future, feel free to fix it yourself :)

[02:24:01.0000] <phroggy>
:-)

[02:24:02.0000] <phroggy>
heh, you know, it didn't even occur to me that that was a wiki page.

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
phroggy: you have to be careful about raising issues here, last time someone complained about spam on the forums, for example, they became a forum admin.

[02:29:00.0000] <hsivonen_>
look like my screen server dropped off the net..

[02:30:00.0000] <phroggy>

[02:30:01.0000] <phroggy>
/me hides

[02:36:00.0000] <phroggy>
so the mailing list chatter about <input type="search"> has died down; it sounds like there's support for the basic idea but not necessarily for all the details of Apple's implementation (onsearch, incremental, results, autosave).

[02:37:00.0000] <phroggy>
I like Safari's features and I'd like to see something standardized, but I must admit, Apple's implementation is...  weird.

[02:42:00.0000] <phroggy>
so, is it worth fixing, and getting Apple on board with changes?  Or should Safari's behavior be standardized, for other browsers to implement as-is?

[02:42:01.0000] <phroggy>
does Apple care?

[03:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if Kristof's repeated use of Visual Basic is just trolling

[08:31:02.0000] <Hixie>

Hixie: if you tell me its important to look at soon i'll slate it for next week

[08:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was gonna tell you the same thing

[08:32:02.0000] <aaronlev_>
i can do that

[08:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm happier hooking my schedule to yours than vice versa :-)

[08:33:00.0000] <aaronlev_>
i was just going to do what you guys tell me :)

[08:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
okie dokie

[08:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'll get back to you when i start looking at it, should be relatively soon

[08:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
like, weeks

[10:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk5, daniel glazman has time to do an interview tonight if you want to do it, or marcos

[10:35:00.0000] <annevk5>
sounds cool

[10:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
he told me that he'll have time as soon as his meeting finishes, which should be in about 5 to 10 min

[10:35:02.0000] <annevk5>
oh, that fast?

[10:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
when would you like to do it?

[10:36:01.0000] <annevk5>
i suppose in 5min would work

[10:36:02.0000] <annevk5>
although finding a suitable location might be tricky

[10:36:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[10:36:04.0000] <annevk5>
we can do it in the hotel, but I believe the room marcos and I stay in is also used by the people swimming

[10:36:05.0000] <Lachy>
we could probably go into one of the meeting rooms, or outside on the balcony

[10:37:00.0000] <annevk5>
or at least a subset of them

[10:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm in the main foyer now with Daniel, come down and we can find a place

[10:37:02.0000] <annevk5>
is that level 0 or 1?

[10:37:03.0000] <Lachy>
1

[10:37:04.0000] <annevk5>
be there in a few secs

/me wonders why Opera is the only browser without any blue in its logo

[10:57:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: Netscape's isn't really blue

[10:57:01.0000] <jcranmer>
it's more green than blue

[10:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether to jump on Hixie 

[10:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, he's just standing there talking

[10:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
it's kinda tempting

[10:58:03.0000] <jcranmer>
and you're typing on a computer (PDA?)

[10:58:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: laptop

[10:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: Dude, I'm at TPAC, we have laptops everywhere

[10:59:01.0000] <jcranmer>
even when I was at the summit, I only had my laptop on during the sessions

[10:59:02.0000] <jcranmer>
(Mozilla Summit)

[11:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: I'd say it's more like teal

[11:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is blue :-)

[11:00:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: You so aren't geek enough.

[11:00:03.0000] <jcranmer>
it's blue-green

[11:00:04.0000] <jcranmer>
gsnedders: I bring my laptop with me nearly everywhere...

[11:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: :P

[11:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: This is one of the few times I've seen, apart from during meals, Hixie without a laptop open

[11:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: I'm actually basically ignoring hsivonen and annevk5 who are currently talking next to me

[11:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>

[11:03:00.0000] <jcranmer>
/me heads off to class

[14:55:00.0000] <onitunes>
can someone explain what this means: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#canvaspixelarray

[14:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What part of it?

[14:55:02.0000] <onitunes>
if I have a CanvasPixelArray, I do obj[0] and that returns...what?

[14:55:03.0000] <onitunes>
octet?

[14:55:04.0000] <onitunes>
what's that

[14:55:05.0000] <onitunes>
is that a number in the range 0-255?

[14:55:06.0000] <Dashiva>
octet is a byte

[14:55:07.0000] <onitunes>
yes, I realize that

[14:55:08.0000] <onitunes>
but JavaScript has no "byte" type

[14:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#es-octet

[14:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That document also explains indexgetter and indexsetter

[14:58:00.0000] <onitunes>
where? I looked everywhere IndexGetter is listed, and it's all spec, not definition

[15:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"If the [IndexGetter] extended attribute appears on an operation with a single unsigned long argument, it indicates that an object that implements the interface can be indexed with an unsigned long, resulting in the same effect as calling the operation with the given index (for languages that support such object indexing)."

[15:05:00.0000] <onitunes>
Dashiva: thanks, that was on a different page: http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/

[15:08:00.0000] <onitunes>
Dashiva: my apoligies, you linked to that page! not sure how I missed it

[15:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a long and messy toc, that's probably how :)

[01:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: but i hope never escaping < and > is good enough for web compat... should be since it matches ie :)

[01:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I guess I should email you about no note section 1,3 being non-normative 

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
already fixed 1.3

[01:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
_damn_ you're good.

[01:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[01:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: can you still not log in?

[01:42:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I can now

[01:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I realized it was username and not email :P

[01:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[01:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
1.4.2 has a funny status box

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
funny how?

[01:45:02.0000] <zcorpan>
it says "undefined"

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
reload

[01:46:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ah

[01:46:02.0000] <zcorpan>
damn cache

[01:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and here i thought you had a bug in your script :(

[01:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: perhaps the spec should drop the "5" and only talk about "HTML", "XHTML", "DOM HTML"

[04:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I could think of how to do a section updated with a streaming parser

[04:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me fails to parse that sentence

[04:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes it would probably make sense if Philip` were in the room when talking about it

[04:10:00.0000] <smedero>
gsnedders, of course few here may understands what room you are referring to

[04:11:00.0000] <smedero>
(HTML WG face-to-face meeting)

[04:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[06:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie, annevk5: Are we going to go to the airport together? If so, how?

[06:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm taking the train

[06:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
when i wake up

[06:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
whenever that is

[06:00:04.0000] <annevk5>
hmm

[06:01:00.0000] <annevk5>
ok, so I'm not travelling with Hixie then :)

[06:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hixie: Ah. And spending the day in Nice, or going straight to the airport?

[06:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[06:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
probably airport

[06:01:04.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk5: I guess we can go later :)

[06:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll be spending most of the day in Nice

[06:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
My flight leaves at 17:15, so I need to be at the airport around 16:00

[06:03:00.0000] <annevk5>
gsnedders, when is your plane leaving?

[06:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk5: 20:10

[06:05:00.0000] <annevk5>
ah, similar to mine

[06:06:00.0000] <annevk5>
mine is at 20:40

[06:06:01.0000] <annevk5>
I think Hixie is on the same plane, no idea why he'd go straight to the airport...

[06:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
cos i plan to sleep til like 4

[06:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: The paragraph beginning with "The default" has @id, "The scoped" does not (scoped itself does as a dfn)

[06:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
it would be nice to sleep that long, but I thought checkout time for the hotel would have been earlier

[06:16:00.0000] <annevk5>
what is there to do in Nice?

[06:16:01.0000] <annevk5>
i heard there is some cool train going into the mountains

[06:16:02.0000] <annevk5>
that might be something i want to do

[06:16:03.0000] <Lachy>
it depends how long it takes and when it gets back

[06:16:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I need to do school work, somewhere

[06:16:05.0000] <Lachy>
but it could be fun

[06:16:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Heck, I could do that at the airport

[06:16:07.0000] <Lachy>
do it on sunday

[06:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I have too much :)

[06:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
not my problem :-)

[06:20:00.0000] <annevk5>
yeah, your flight leaves early

[06:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is one supposed to buy train tickets on the train station or on the train?

[06:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, ask when you get to the train station

[06:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
I would assume you buy them at the station, cause that's the way it works in all countries I've been to

[06:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
(though that's not many)

[06:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: well, it affects the scheduling of getting to the station in the first place

[06:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
why? It only takes a few minutes to get a ticket, and I guess they would have ticket machines that make it quite quick

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
One can't count on a b&m transaction taking a few minutes

[06:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: There's a ticket machine

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: thanks

[06:32:00.0000] <hendry>
anyone flying around 21:55 from Nice tonight?

[06:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
did Mr. Last Week delete his blog?

[06:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
not as far as i can tell

[06:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/

[06:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. it's back now

[06:33:03.0000] <hsivonen>
blogspot was broken I guess

[06:33:04.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly it's a Google conspiracy to suppress free speech that is critical of its employees

[06:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How did I manage to miss the "complete tool" comment previously? 

[06:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Where?

[06:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2008/10/moneyshots.html

[06:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's worrying that he's "slightly turned on by Hixie[...]"

[06:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You just caused myself and Lachy to just burst out laughing in the F2F meeting

[06:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: My humble apologies

[06:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, no worries. Though I would like you to try harder to get MikeSmith or ChrisWilson to burst out in laughter

[06:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: CW isn't here, though MikeSmith is here but only watching #html-wg

[06:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, that's ok. if you post something funny in #html-wg, you could get everyone to burst out laughing

[06:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: hmm…

[06:50:00.0000] <myakura>
/me is full. had too much cakes...

[06:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
The danger is you might say something that's not actually funny, and then you'll just look silly :-(

[06:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, sure that's always a risk

[06:52:00.0000] <karlUshi>
/me recommends myakura to run a bit ;)

[06:53:00.0000] <annevk5>
cake? yamyam

[06:53:01.0000] <annevk5>
/me wants some

[06:54:00.0000] <karlUshi>
/me has one week of travelling in France after TPAC… more food… more cakes… damn!

[06:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk5, they had lots of cakes available at lunch time. But perhaps you missed out because gsnedders and CWilso took about half the dessert table each.

[06:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me will go to Italy to burn the cakes eaten here

[06:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
what?

[06:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy, there was plenty left when I got the cakes I took, dunno about the equally piggish CWilso though

[06:56:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finishes running blame

[06:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy, I'll go to Italy tomorrow and hopefully walk more and eat fewer cakes

[06:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
ah, you mean burn off the calories from the cakes eaten today, rather than fail at baking cakes

[06:57:02.0000] <annevk5>
karlUshi, so sad

[06:58:00.0000] <karlUshi>
/me :)))

[06:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, that's great. Shift the blame to CWilso when he's not even here to defend himself!

[06:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
:-)

[06:58:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Duh.

[06:58:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I mean, I thought that's what we did to people from MS.

[06:58:05.0000] <Philip`>
That's what we do to everyone who's not here

[06:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me goes to check the logs for the times he's been logged out...

[06:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[07:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I assume some IE people do read the logs here, since they linked to it from the IE Blog once)

[07:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk5, zcorpan_ check the "related videos" section here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpZkkuMfFc8

[07:13:00.0000] <annevk5>
"Obsessed with Miley Cyrus ?!"?

[07:13:01.0000] <annevk5>
hmm

[07:14:00.0000] <annevk5>
we'll prolly move those videos over to vimeo as it has much better quality

[07:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
Can't you host them yourself?

[07:15:00.0000] <annevk5>
if we wanted to go through the effort, I suppose

[07:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it that much effort to pass the files through mencoder, find one of the zillion Flash video players that presumably exists, and then upload it and write a few lines of HTML to embed it on the page?

[07:17:00.0000] <annevk5>
apparently :)

[07:18:00.0000] <annevk5>
also, those video sites prolly have their config optimized for streaming and such

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
They have millions of viewers a day, you probably have about three, so you shouldn't need to worry too much about optimisation :-)

[07:19:01.0000] <annevk5>
we want to scale when it becomes a huge hit

[07:20:00.0000] <hasather>
annevk5: Dreamhost has some kind of converter in the web panel, see https://media.dreamhost.com/ Never tried it though

[07:20:01.0000] <annevk5>
anyway, we're using vimeo for now :)

[07:21:00.0000] <annevk5>
hasather, might be an idea for the future

[07:25:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: just those 409 views of that single video is quite a lot of bandwith

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: Dreamhost apparently gives you 5TB/month, and it's nowhere near that much

[07:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
I expect it's at least six orders of magnitude more than you'd need :-p

[07:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Wait, no I don't

[07:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
I can't do maths with numbers

[07:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
Four orders of magnitude, I think

[07:28:03.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: you'll be out of cpu cycles long before you can serve those 5TB

[07:28:04.0000] <virtuelv>
I have unlimited transfer and storage with them

[07:28:05.0000] <virtuelv>
... in theory ...

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has a server with 5Mbit/sec connection and 1.5TB/month limit, and conveniently 5Mbit/sec * 2.6e6 sec/month = 1.5(6)TB/month, so it's basically unlimited

[07:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me now has officially "unlimited" bandwidth with his dreamhost account

[07:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
(and disk space)

[07:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
dbaron: the script just looks for alt, but if you want some other mechanism i can add one

[07:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
the code is: 

[07:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
  div.onclick = function (event) {

[07:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
    if (event.detail == 2 && event.button == 0 && event.altKey)

[07:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
      that.edit(true, null);

[07:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
  }

[07:54:00.0000] <dbaron>
http://dbaron.org/tmp/mouse-events

[07:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that that conflicts with KDE's interception of alt to do window moving, but ctrl+alt doesn't get intercepted and still triggers the onclick behaviour in the spec, so that's bearable

[07:57:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: assume you upgraded to a green server, then?

[07:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
i signed up to whatever they offered

[07:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
it basically boiled down to "removing nfs"

[07:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
which i am extremely happy for them to do

[07:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
the bandwidth/disk is a bonus i wouldn't have asked for :-)

[08:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone already have the URL for my long SVG email? (the review of the SVG WG's)

[08:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's at the top of my reply, iirc

[08:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Real number algorithm is broken

[08:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, I'm stupid

[08:38:00.0000] <annevk5>
oh yeah, Sam Ruby's blog too

blog fallout

[08:42:02.0000] <annevk5>
:)

[08:42:03.0000] <smedero>
apparently people read these blog things

[08:43:00.0000] <annevk5>
they better read the news, that's actually reasonable and unbiased and such

[08:50:00.0000] <karlUshi>
annevk5: splash ;)

[09:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there some way I can make a <pre contenteditable> act like a <textarea> so users can't insert any markup or doing anything except plain text?

[09:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
(while still allowing scripts to insert markup into it)

[14:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hmm. Sam is caling data-* OPMLish over at burning bird

[14:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
is that an insult? or praise?

[14:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: definitely an insult

[15:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
i want AB and AC minutes

[15:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a logic to generated minute urls?

[15:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't find tp day minutes

[15:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>

[15:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
shocking

[15:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fortunately, the one of my sentences on the panel that invited the most negative feedback is not in minutes...

[15:15:01.0000] <Hixie>

Dunno

[02:16:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I've been dragged into some hotel room by marcos

[02:16:04.0000] <Lachy>
me too

[02:16:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, you're the guy beside me?

[02:16:06.0000] <Lachy>
:-)

[02:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
On a more serious note, anyone still around from TPAC who is here for today, we're in annevk and marcos' room waiting for annevk to get ready to go out at 10

[02:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, we're preparing to leave 20 minutes ago

[02:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
are we fully prepared yet?

[02:40:00.0000] <annevk5>
not really

[02:41:00.0000] <annevk5>
as you might have seen, my bag is completely unpacked

Applying is easy compared to what comes after you get accepted :-p

jcranmer: Treat DST as being a timezone change (as it technically is)

[15:49:02.0000] <jcranmer>
is it spring forward, fall back or fall forward, spring back?

[15:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
We're UTC±0 in winter, and UTC+1 in summer.

[15:52:00.0000] <jcranmer>
lemme work out for myself... in fall, the new 6:00 AM is the old 7:00 AM, so in fall the clock goes back an hour, so the timezone moves west 15°, so the differential falls an hour

[18:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, my bank now says "The Internet browser you are using is not supported by online banking.", which is odd since it claims to support "Opera 9.x", and it worked a while ago with Opera 9.5, but now I'm using Opera 9.6 and it doesn't :-(

Strangely, the layout is a bit broken in Opera normally, but if I tell Opera to identify as Firefox then it starts looking correct

Hixie: you could use http://www.microsoft.com/isv/static/images/ie_icon.gif for the annotation boxes

[08:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
as i expected, character is actually utf-16 code unit (html-color-attributes)

[08:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: have you considered character vs. utf-16 code unit in html5?

[08:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think it has come up much

[08:29:01.0000] <zcorpan>
or rather codepoint vs code unit

[08:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
operating on codepoints is more expensive than operating on code units, i presume

zcorpan: see ISO 2145

[09:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: still looks weird

[09:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
perhaps some padding could do

zcorpan: Get the spec changed, then I'll change :P

/me wonders if there's a trivial way to write a Python-like interactive interpreter in HTML/JS

[09:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear that follow ISO2145 gains us anything :-)

[09:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
It gains us a smug feeling of pedantic correctness

[09:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Fundamentally, Philip` is correct

[09:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html-editor/2005JulSep/0003.html

[09:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
"It is customary to separate the section number and the section title with a slightly larger space, e.g. an em space or two normal interword spaces."

[09:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me thinks the correct response to claims about not following ISO2145 is "I don't care"

[10:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: are you speaking from your perspective as a spec editor? if so, "I don't care" hardly seems like an appropriate response. Unless your goal is to piss people off or to get them to lose respect for you completely.

[10:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, i think for ISO2145 the response "I don't care" is probably pretty appropriate, so long as what one does isn't too far from it.

[10:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
The W3C doesn't generally follow 2145 and as far as I know the e-mail gsnedders' cited is the only occurance of someone caring

[10:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I see no reason not to follow it, thoguh

[10:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe it's just me, but I would think taking a few minutes to write an explanation of why it's not relevant rather than saying "I don't care." might be more effective way to respond. but for those who prefer to tell people "I don't care", nobody's stopping you. But you might also try saying it to people face to face rather than just by e-mail, and see how people feel about it when you do that.

[10:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
not that I'm advocating use of ISO 2145 or saying that it is necessary at all to follow it

[10:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, "I don't care" isn't a particularly constructive response

[10:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
who exactly would i speak to face to face about ISO2145? gsnedders?

[10:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:D

[10:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
i would bet that outside the discussion, almost nobody knows what 2145 is event about

[10:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
even

[10:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's not like we're saying "ignore the TAG" or anything controversal like that here :-)

[10:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I mean in general saying "I don't care." to anybody face to face about a particular issue.

[10:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wouldn't be willing to make a blanket statement about that in either direction

[10:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, the likely response that would get from me personally if somebody says that to me is a tendency on my part to want to kick them in the teeth

[10:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but maybe that's just me

[10:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think it's helpful to know when someone doesn't care as opposed to feigned interest which is often seen at w3c meetings :-)

[10:27:00.0000] <Hixie>

[10:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>

[10:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
either of them set charCode?

[10:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, it's always undefined

[10:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
keyIdentifier?

[10:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, it's always undefined

[10:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
you's sol

[10:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh well, nobody will want to type '&' anyway

[10:59:03.0000] <jcranmer>
shouldn't & have a shift modifier?

[11:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Depends on your keyboard layout

[13:03:00.0000] <hober>
just saw this go by on twitter: http://www.addfullsize.com/

[13:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly it should be called highsrc

[13:04:01.0000] <takkaria>
sounds like they want data-fullsize=""

[13:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
No they don't - they want browsers to do something with it

[13:08:00.0000] <annevk2>
that guy is basically campaigning for a new features

[13:08:01.0000] <annevk2>
feature, even

[13:08:02.0000] <takkaria>
yeah, but I can't imagine browsers ever supporting it natively

[13:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
And specific UI for an attribute

[13:08:04.0000] <annevk2>
the idea has already failed in the past

[13:08:05.0000] <annevk2>
see lowsrc

[13:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
he doesn't really go into why this wouldn't have the same issues, etc.

[13:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the idea of having a larger image with browser-native UI to pop it up is dumb, but arguably some markup-level affordance would be good to supply highres images for systems with UI scaling applied

[13:50:00.0000] <drew_>
The idea behind fullsize id to make a common practice (clicking on a thumbnail to display a larger image), a standard.

[13:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
what would the benefit be?

[13:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
can't people just use <a href="[...].jpeg"><img src="[...]-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Open full-size image of [...]"></a> ?

[13:52:01.0000] <drew_>
The benefit would be a very quick and very simple way to display a larger version of a thumbnail across all browsers without needing to use javascript.

[13:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
my example had no javascript

[13:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
and is pretty simple

[13:53:00.0000] <drew_>
yes people can do that.. but then why do they go through the trouble to make it look cool in javascript if that solution was good enough.. simple.. because it is not good enought and the web is progressing.

[13:53:01.0000] <drew_>
so.. why not make what is already common a standard.

[13:53:02.0000] <annevk2>
because people like to do it in different ways

[13:53:03.0000] <drew_>
exactly

[13:53:04.0000] <annevk2>
e.g., offer buttons to browser through images, zoom, buttons, etc.

[13:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
and handing all that off to the browser does not really seem needed and would be less flexible

[13:55:00.0000] <drew_>
with the fullsize attribute, you could comma separate multiple images, and have the browser render a gallery for you. It would add a much simpler and quicker way to view images.

[13:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
it wouldn't have the effects the Web author wanted

[13:57:00.0000] <drew_>
well if you wanted to write a custom solution.. you would still have the optioin to do so in javascript. in fact all pervious javascript scripts to handle this, will still work with fullsize.

[13:57:01.0000] <annevk2>
e.g., changing the background color, letting one image transform in another using some filter, etc.

[13:57:02.0000] <annevk2>
fullsize can be implemented using a simple javascript library and would in fact be more backwards compatible if done in a way as Hixie suggests

[13:58:00.0000] <takkaria>
using a comma-seperated list to create a gallery would be a massive change to the idea of what <img> represents

[13:59:00.0000] <drew_>
HTML 5 added a footer tag.... you can do that with a div... but they added it because it was common practice... i would argue the same case for fullsize.. wouldn't you think ?

[14:00:00.0000] <drew_>
takkaria .. i totally agree.. that was just an idea i had.. and is in no way a final solution

[14:00:01.0000] <takkaria>
footers are way, way more common than clever javascript things to show images vaguely-fullscreen

[14:01:00.0000] <drew_>
even though footers may be way more common.. image zoomers are still common

[14:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
drew_: browsers can already today detect that the target of the image is an image and do what fullsize="" suggests

[14:01:02.0000] <drew_>
i am suggesting not requiring an Anchor tag

[14:03:00.0000] <drew_>
i really appreciate the fact you guys are even talking about this :) i really hop that time will tell on this subject. if enough developers want this (that is what i made the website for)... it will be added as a standard

[14:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear to me why we benefit from new syntax here since it is already possible for browsers to do what this does even without the new syntax

[14:06:00.0000] <drew_>
same way we benefit from a footer & header tag.

[14:06:01.0000] <drew_>
i don't expect everyone to agree on this.. but i do suspect a lot of web developers would find it very handy, i am hoping enough do to make it a standard.

[14:12:00.0000] <drew_>
thanks guys!

in my philosophy course, I'm currently doing a lot of reading of 20th century philosophers who basically wrote the rules of modern logic

[18:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
part of the shift towards modern logic was realising that syllogistic logic isn't actually all that helpful

You can prove everything by enumeration, because infinite sets don't exist in reality so you don't need to care about them

anyone remember what various ways people suggested splittig the spec last week?

[21:41:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, there was a lot about splitting out the parts that define what 'valid' markup looks like

[21:42:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, and splitting out some APIs, don't remember which ones though

[21:42:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, oh, 'window' was one of them

[21:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, that's what i remembered too

[21:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[03:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, there were people asking for some kind of clean language spec that defined only what is considered conforming and a "clean parsing algorithm" that only works with conforming content.

[03:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
one specific case that was pointed out to me was where it defines microsyntaxes, it mixes the conforming syntax definition with the rules for parsing it a little too closely http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#numbers

"Another potential area for improvement is the quality of error messages that Jing gives when doing RELAX NG validation. They're pretty bad at the moment, and it's definitely possible to do significantly better with a bit of effort."

[09:34:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, new Option is a named constructor

[12:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone got an idea for how to solve the "don't validate for this submit button" use case? (e.g. saving state to the server, or asking the server for completion information, separate from the final submission step)

[12:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
use submit()

[12:39:01.0000] <annevk2>
if it's really common, add a dontvalidate attribute or some such

[12:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
bbiab

[12:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
"dontvalidate" is kinda ugly

[12:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
even "novalidate" is ugly

[12:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
is the attribute intended to go on the form element or the <input type="submit">/<button> elements?

[12:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, validate="no" is less ugly, but it doesn't fit the normal boolean attribute design pattern

[12:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ihatevalidation?

[12:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: if it's an attribute, the button, i guess, but i have no idea how to really solve this

[12:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe nonvalidating ?

[12:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's better than dontvalidate and novalidate

[13:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, that's a rather subjective comparison

[13:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
I thought novalidate looked better

[13:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
novalidate is not grammatically correct english

[13:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
nonvalidating is at least one word

[13:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[13:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
I still don't particularly like nonvalidating

[13:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't particularly like any of the

[13:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
m

[13:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
non is grammatically wrong so FAIL.

[13:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
?

[13:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think a sentence using the "fail" meme really should be complaining about grammar, btw :-)

[13:04:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm not thinking, ignore me

[13:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
k

[13:04:05.0000] <gsnedders>
(I am thinking, just about typing on a Dvorak keyboard)

[13:14:00.0000] <blooberry>
gsnedders: thinking about trying dvorak?

[13:15:00.0000] <nessy>
how about "novalidation" ?

[13:17:00.0000] <blooberry>
does it have to use a term with "valid" as a substring?

[13:17:01.0000] <blooberry>
Would something tangential like maybe check" or "nocheck" work instead?

[13:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
blooberry: I am trying, that's the problem

[13:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear to me that an attribute is right in the first place

[13:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
an element!

[13:19:01.0000] <blooberry>
gsnedders: keep it up! *cheering from my dvorak layout*

[13:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
blooberry: Everytime before I haven't for very long

[13:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But I seem to be picking it up quicker this time

[13:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me is using qwerty... but his dvoark keyboard is less than a foot away!

[13:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what about a new button type?

[13:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
instead of a new attribute

[13:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
not bw compatible

[13:21:05.0000] <Lachy>
<button type="whatever"> is kind of

[13:21:06.0000] <Hixie>
not in IE

[13:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
what about IE8?

[13:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
(and <input type=non-validating-button> isn't)

[13:22:02.0000] <blooberry>
/me would have huge problems going back to qwerty

[13:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
blooberry: I have to cope with that at school

[13:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
i use both

[13:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
(on different keyboard types)

[13:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
blooberry: So if I persist I have to cope with both

[13:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
does it need to be a declarative solution, rather than just some kind of javascript API that submits without checking validity?

[13:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i don't know

[13:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
if so, then there are 3 options: new attribute, new element, or new button type. If the latter is ruled out because of back compat issues, and the new element doesn't seem realistic, you're left with a new attribute

[13:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hikie doesn't know every thing!? :o

[13:25:02.0000] <blooberry>
for me, it's touch typing dvorak, hunt-n-peck qwerty. I have no idea where the dvorak keys are located unless I let my brain put the fingers in the right location when asked to hit the key.

[13:25:03.0000] <gsnedders>
See, I really can't type now

[13:25:04.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, of course, "Hikie" isn't omniscient, but I'm sure Hixie is :-)

[13:26:00.0000] <blooberry>
/me is always amused how many typos are an obvious sign of which keyboard layout a person is using

[13:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
blooberry: How so?

[13:26:02.0000] <blooberry>
hikie->hixie: qwerty the 'k' and 'x' are on opposite sides of the keyboard. On dvorak, they are adjacent

[13:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ah

[13:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But you just said you don't know where keys are!

[13:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: one could equally say "if a new attribute doesn't seem realistic, and a type is ruled out because of back compat issues, you're left with a new element"

[13:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Yes, it takes me that long to type.)

[13:29:00.0000] <blooberry>
I lied? 8-P (not for touch typing, no...but I know where the keys are.)

[13:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I can't think of any logical way of using a new element for this purpose

[13:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I wish there was a room in this house with good speakers and is warm.

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: there are plenty of ways we could do this, e.g. attributes on the button or the form, an API to submit, an API to disable validation, boolean attributes or enumerated attributes, new types, class values, a container element, not supporting it but requiring script of various kinds, etc

[13:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
they all suck

[13:33:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I don't understand the use case...in my experience of using and making and auditing websites, I haven't come across a button which submits a form but must bypass any client-side validation

[13:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me uses anathem as a keyboard rest and switches to dvorak

[13:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, see the whatwg archives for discussion of non-validating submit buttons

[13:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
or in the WF2 folder http://www.whatwg.org/issues/#WF2

[13:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: e.g. a button that takes a postcade and prefills the address

[13:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
postcode

[13:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
without requiring all required fields to be set

[13:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
or a button that cancels the form

[13:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
or a button that saves the current state

[13:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Actually, the "Cancel" button could easily be just a link, not a submit control."

[13:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I share Simon Pieters's experience where he says "I have never seen such a form" for the saving state without validation case. Nearest I've seen to that are multi-page forms (such as YouGov in the UK, IIRC) which save your progress as you go but still require the page you're on to be filled in completely.

[13:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, I understand the FAFSA case

[13:43:01.0000] <billmason>
The company I work for does online college applications...probably 99+% of them are multipage, and all of them have a button to save the page without validation.

[13:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
for the cancel button case, ideally none of the form's content would be submitted to the server since it's a waste of bandwidth, especially if it's a large form

[13:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
but sometimes a cancel button does actually need to be a button rather than a link because the server needs to be told to interrupt the process. e.g. cancelling half way through a multi step process

[13:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, the Cancel button can submit to a different <form>?

[13:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
The button that takes the postcode and prefills the address should be using AJAX, not form submission, because everyone loves AJAX

[13:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
the cancel button is not the compelling case

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
billmason: Do those pages ever do client-side validation?

[13:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me vaguely remembers multipage forms like that only doing server-side validation of the entire form at the end of the process (so it can't be client-side because it checks all the pages at once)

[13:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, yeah, that works

[13:51:02.0000] <billmason>
Philip`: Eventually to submit the completed form (when you complete all pages), yes.  The forms typically validate as you go from page to page, although there is often an option to suspend validation until the final submission.

[13:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
billmason, I recognise that use-case as being similar to YouGov, except that you can only save YouGov surveys at the first completed page and not at an arbitrary point

[13:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, AJAX for address look-up makes sense. Then again, if you've entered your postcode you don't need to see the address because it will be the correct address by definition.

[13:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
indeed, if the app can do look-up from a postcode there's no need to ask for other address fields?

[14:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: It can't determine the precise address from the postcode, because it's not a one-to-one mapping, so it needs to give the user the opportunity to correct their house number or whatever

[14:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
and the postcode lookup databases are not infallible, so the user has to be able to override it

[14:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, that's disappointing. :(

[14:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: That's life :-)

[14:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Even if nobody ever makes any mistakes, new houses will be built and they won't be in the existing databases

[14:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, house take a while to build so getting that far out of date is still disappointing.

[14:05:01.0000] <BenMillard>

[14:08:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, has it been shown that this problem needs addressing?

[14:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[14:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, <input type=submit onclick=this.form.submit()> works

[14:09:01.0000] <annevk2>
(maybe you need return false)

[14:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>

hixie: 38 in a half hour? You'll be done by bedtime at that rate

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
not all of them got direct replies, some got moved to other folders for bulk reply later

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>

"... if the returned value is an element node with either the local name datalist or the local name select, and (for XHTML) with the XHTML namespace" - why does the namespace bit only apply to XHTML?

I couldn't quite tell if people were expecting to eat at the meetup or before it or after it...

[18:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh yeah the meetup

[18:02:00.0000] <annevk2>
we can meat at the meetup I think

[18:02:01.0000] <annevk2>
I won't have eaten when I arrive

[18:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Meat?

[18:03:01.0000] <annevk2>
eat

[18:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok going to grab food.

[18:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
blooberry: you coming?

[18:09:01.0000] <dbaron>
I'm not sure about eating at a pub...

[18:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
actually that pub has ok food iirc

[18:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
but i wouldn't eat there either :-)

[18:09:04.0000] <dbaron>
of course, it might take me a good 20 minutes to find the people who I promised I'd give a ride...

[18:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[18:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
i'm ok with eating somewhere else too

[18:11:01.0000] <annevk2>
if someone can name me a restaurant i'll show up

[18:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
looking at the time I'll probably eat at the pub

[04:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think that <q> discussion has effectively turned into a permathread. It's basically rehashing the same arguments that I've seen on www-html, www-style and possibly other lists for at least the past 5 years

[04:29:00.0000] <hendry>
maybe someone needs to blog on the pros and cons to act as a reference

[04:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
hendry, thanks for volunteering :-)

[04:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't read that thread; have i missed anything?

[05:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, here's a quick summary of the arguments so far: Different langagues have different quoting conventions, nested quotes and mixed langauges make things more complex. Various solutions proposed ranging from defining explicit quoting rules, to no quoting, to dropping <q> altogether

[05:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
now you haven't missed anything

[05:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: thanks

[05:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i'd prefer one of the latter proposals

[05:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
personally, I'd prefer to drop it at this stage. But in any case, the rules for rendering quotes need to be defined

[05:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
in which case, I'd like the spec to say render no quotes. But since IE8 will be rendering quotes now, we might be stuck with defining something else

[05:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
like always using the curly double and single quotes by default

[05:21:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: do you see adding it back in HTML6 if all browsers don't render quotes by then?

[05:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
if there are use cases to justify it, then it could stay in HTML5. But there haven't been any compelling use cases presented yet

[05:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I think if it renders quotes by default, then it will make it a less valuable solution, even if there are use cases for it

[08:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yt?

[08:14:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: shouldn't a UA wait with load()ing until the </video> or </audio> end tag has been parsed?

[08:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: consider the UA getting "<video><source src=1>" and then the server waits a few seconds and then further gives "<source src=2>", the UA would already had started to load the first resource

[08:16:01.0000] <annevk2>

[08:20:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess browsers should "throttle the download" when there are many <audio>s

[08:22:00.0000] <smedero>
Is there an experimental build of Opera that support <audio>? I know there is a <video> one...

[08:22:01.0000] <zcorpan>
no, though we have an old impl of Audio()

Man. Too many emails.

[09:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
<q> is the new <acronym>

[09:16:00.0000] <aaronlev>
Hixie, BenMillard was just pinging me about tables

[09:16:01.0000] <doublec>
zcorpan, source isn't fully implemented - there's a bug to that effect

[09:17:00.0000] <aaronlev>
what do you guys want me to review

[09:17:01.0000] <doublec>
what's there was done mainly so another browser vendor could do a demo showing multiple video formats working across browsers

[09:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
doublec: ok

[09:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
aaronlev, here's the header association algorithm as currently specified: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tabular-data.html#header-and-data-cell-semantics

[09:21:01.0000] <aaronlev>
and was there some other algorithm it was going to merge with?

[09:21:02.0000] <doublec>
zcorpan, bug 449363 

[09:21:03.0000] <annevk2>
BenMillard, aaronlev and Hixie already communicated about that during TPAC

[09:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
BenMillard, Hixie was going to get back to aaronlev once he addressed outstanding feedback

[09:22:01.0000] <aaronlev>
annevk2: i wasn't at TPAC

[09:22:02.0000] <annevk2>
aaronlev, you still communicated though :) (over IRC)

[09:22:03.0000] <aaronlev>
i mean, hxie asked me to review something this week

[09:22:04.0000] <aaronlev>
so is it ready for my review or is there still outstanding feedback to fold in first

[09:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
the latter

[09:23:01.0000] <annevk2>
also, http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20081023#l-263 suggests it would not necessarily be this week

[09:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
aaronlev, there's a "semantics-tables" folder which lists some specific message Hixie will be going through: http://www.whatwg.org/issues/

[09:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
aaronlev, the "Smart Span" algorithm is a prototype James Graham documented here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Mar/0075.html

[09:25:01.0000] <aaronlev>
i'll review it when it's got all of the current feedback folded in

[09:27:01.0000] <BenMillard>
aaronlev, ok...just thought you might want to get a headstart, like trying out the various ideas prototyped here: http://james.html5.org/tables/table_inspector.html

[09:27:02.0000] <aaronlev>
BenMillard: if possible i would like others more familiar with the issues to arrive at a consensus

[09:27:03.0000] <aaronlev>
i'll check the algorithm to see if there are potential perf issues or whatever

[09:28:00.0000] <aaronlev>
and we can code it so people can play with the results

[09:40:00.0000] <aaronlev>
well my first feedback is that you have a list with 4 levels and all levels use arabic numbers

[09:40:01.0000] <aaronlev>
in the whatwg spec

[09:40:02.0000] <aaronlev>
kind of easy to lose your place

[09:40:03.0000] <Philip`>
Argh, I can't even draw a table with borders without getting totally different results in Opera and Firefox

Is Firefox (3.0) wrong in drawing a border underneath the 'y'?

[09:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
All I want to do is use table hacks to draw a matrix :-(

[10:10:00.0000] <svl>
Philip`: so it seems to set the border-bottom of td.left to be equal to the border-bottom of the second tr - and then apply the border styles of both td and tr to it. I don't know if the behaviour in the case of rowspan is actually defined anywhere... (And in the case of "undefined", I don't think gecko can be said to be wrong, though it's certainly counter-intuitive.)

[10:12:00.0000] <svl>
Looks to be https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332740

[10:12:01.0000] <svl>
yeah, the testcase matches

[10:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
svl: Okay, thanks

[10:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think I might have actually run into the same problem in the past in a totally different context, since the bug looks familiar

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
But I'm perfectly happy to blame Gecko for violating my expectations, regardless of what specs say, particularly if other browsers do what I want :-)

[10:51:00.0000] <svl>
Heh. :)

[11:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
(In this case I don't actually need border-collapse at all, so I can just remove it and it's all fine)

[11:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: no, it should look with every source, that way it starts getting one as soon as there is a good one

http://www.jroller.com/tedgoddard/entry/websocket_is_neither_web_nor

[11:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I have some issues with your disposition-of-comments2html.py script, which I borrowed from XBL2. It doesn't seem to work the way I expected it would.

[11:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
see http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/selectors-api/disposition-of-comments.txt and http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/selectors-api/disposition-of-comments.html

[11:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
it seems it totally ignored the summary field and used the subject line from the email as the heading instead.

[11:27:03.0000] <john_fallows>
hober: there seem to be some technical inaccuracies in that post

[11:29:00.0000] <john_fallows>
hober: but it does raise two interesting questions about IANA ports and WebSocket connection limits

[11:30:00.0000] <john_fallows>
Hixie: when would it be appropriate for IANA to be consulted regarding ws:// port 81 and wss:// port 815 ?

[11:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
john_fallows, when the web sockets section is relatively stable

[11:34:00.0000] <john_fallows>
Lachy: are the default port numbers for ws:// and wss:// schemes not yet considered stable?

[11:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know

[11:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
are there browser vendors looking at implementing really soon?

[11:39:00.0000] <john_fallows>
you'd have to ask them :-)

[11:40:00.0000] <john_fallows>
presumably this IANA request would be one of the last steps to stabilize the WebSocket section before browser vendors would provide an implementation

[11:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
it would need to be done before any release version was shipped with support for web sockets. But browsers could proceed with experimental versions before it was finalised and provide feedback

[11:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yes, that is as designed (by summaries sucked)

[11:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
s/by/my/

[11:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh. Is there another field that I can use that will be output by the script?

[11:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[11:42:03.0000] <Lachy>
or will I have to modify the script to output the summaries myself?

[11:42:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[11:42:05.0000] <john_fallows>
what is the proposed relationship between WebSocket connection limits and regular HTTP connection limits in the browser?

[11:42:06.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't even remember the script existed until 2 minutes ago

[11:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
my impression was that there was no IANA consultation process, just a registration process, and I do not want to register anything until we know we're sure we're doing it

[11:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
same with the headers, mime types, etc

[11:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
about the only thing html5 doesn't need registering is a new top-level mime hierarchy

[11:43:03.0000] <john_fallows>
Hixie: sounds like exactly the right strategy

[11:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
(we're even talking about registering new registries!)

[11:44:01.0000] <john_fallows>
lol

[11:44:02.0000] <john_fallows>
what is the proposed relationship between WebSocket connection limits and regular HTTP connection limits in the browser?

[11:44:03.0000] <jcranmer>
Hixie: I'm sure someone will come up with a top-level MIME hierarchy for HTML 5 soon

[11:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: We were discussing unknown as top-level, remember?

[11:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
john_fallows: i don't think anything is proposed

[11:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: oh jeez, you're right

[11:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
we're EVEN considering registering a top-level mime hierarchy

[11:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
what a jip

[11:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
this is ridiculous

[11:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
http headers, ports, schemes, mime types, mime hierarchies, registries

[11:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
anything else?

[11:47:00.0000] <jcranmer>
want more stuff to consider adding for the sake of registering?

[11:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
lord no

[11:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
just making sure i know the whole list

[11:48:00.0000] <john_fallows>
given that a WebSocket connection cannot be reused, it seems appropriate to specify connection limits independent from HTTP, to avoid WebSocket taking up all the HTTP connections

[11:48:01.0000] <jcranmer>
well, this is the lot: http://iana.org/protocols/

[11:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
john_fallows: yes i would think it is reasonable not to apply http limits to websocket

[11:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's probably the default, too, since http != websocket :-)

[11:50:00.0000] <john_fallows>
yes, agreed, although it probably ought to be specified explicitly to make sure browser vendors keep them separate

[11:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah maybe

[11:51:00.0000] <john_fallows>
Server-sent events would also benefit from being kept separate from regular HTTP connections

[11:53:00.0000] <john_fallows>
in fact, it is probably reasonable to place a combined limit on SSE and WebSocket connections, separate from the limit on regular HTTP connections

[11:53:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I'm guessing webservice is TCP, right?

[11:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
wow, my filters totally caught the entire <q> thread and considered it low-priority

[11:53:03.0000] <jcranmer>
s/service/socket/

[11:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
my filters rock

[11:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
jcranmer: yes

[11:54:01.0000] <jcranmer>
so you don't need to register a protocol number

[11:54:02.0000] <BenMillard>
cool, aaronlev sent some early feedback while I was eating a kebab: http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-October/016915.html

[11:55:00.0000] <jcranmer>
that appears to be the whole list then

[11:55:01.0000] <aaronlev>
BenMillard: but my feedback isn't nearly as tasty

[11:55:02.0000] <BenMillard>
:P

[11:55:03.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, since IE8 will be shipping soon with an implementation of <q> which matches HTML4 but differs from HTML5, maybe it should get bumped up the queue?

[11:55:04.0000] <BenMillard>
(for some definition of "soon")

[11:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see what we can do but drop the entire element at this point

[11:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suggest renaming the element from <q> to "

[11:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
right

[11:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
in my research, authors commonly use punctuation instead of <q> even when they do "

[11:57:01.0000] <BenMillard>
but they also use <em> with punctuation to avoid using <q> with CSS

[11:59:00.0000] <BenMillard>
so authors are happy to type the punctuation, but sometimes want styling as well...so if <q> was consistent with other phrase-level elements and didn't generate punctuation, that would be neat way of achieving this

[12:03:00.0000] <campd>
Hixie: so another offline nit... should a resource that matched a fallback namespace, but didn't actually fallback, be considered "loaded from the application cache" for the purposes of the cache selection algorithm?

[12:03:01.0000] <campd>
it seems like it should, but it's not explicit.

[12:05:00.0000] <john_fallows>
Hixie: since there is no explicit limit set on WebSocket connections in the spec, does that imply there is no limit, so any number of WebSocket connections could be made from the same browser to the same WebSocket server?

[12:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: well apparently <q> generates punctuation

[12:08:00.0000] <aaronlev>
BenMillard: i did not understand kristof's reply to me :/

[12:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
campd: top-level?

[12:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
john_fallows: yes

[12:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
aaronlev: nobody understands kristof really

[12:09:02.0000] <aaronlev>
snort

[12:09:03.0000] <john_fallows>
Hixie: ok, do you have any objection to making that implication explicit in the spec?

[12:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
john_fallows: not particularily, send feedback. :[)

[12:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[12:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[12:11:03.0000] <john_fallows>
ok, will do.

[12:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[12:16:00.0000] <john_fallows>
done

[12:16:01.0000] <takkaria>
Hixie: I'd like to see your filters, they must have some serious intention-detecting voodoo going on

[12:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I feel sorry for Chris Wilson...his opening message is an implementor giving feedback during their final approach to shipping a product and there's very little he can take away from the thread which resulted

[12:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
once all 4 main browsers are generating " on <q> and </q>, I guess we're stuck with it...even though hardly anyone uses <q> and it is impossible to internationise if it generates punctutation (as David Baron explained during the HTMLWG meeting)

[12:19:01.0000] <BenMillard>
s/punctutation/punctuation/

[12:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
s/internationise/internationalise/

[12:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: They shouldn't need much voodoo - they can be based simply on the existing distributed socially-networked human-powered filtering system, i.e. if certain people choose to respond to a topic then you probably don't want to read it

[12:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Those people do all the hard work of reading the emails and classifying them into "I must give my opinion here!" and "this is just technical details, I don't care about this", so it's classified along the same boundaries that you want

[12:25:00.0000] <takkaria>
I imagine that filtering any threads which generate so much noise from so few people would work quite well too

[12:51:00.0000] <campd>
Hixie: yeah

[12:53:00.0000] <campd>
Hixie: (or any context, if we end up making each iframe an island)

[13:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
campd: i mean, as opposed to an <img> image

[13:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
campd: as far as i can tell, it's all already defined

[13:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
campd: if it's top-level, matched a namespace but came from the network, it's only in the cache if it has a manifest

[13:12:00.0000] <campd>
ok

[14:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
should any event fire on auto-completion? do we want one to?

[14:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
in the end, I couldn't resist the <q> thread: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Oct/0221.html

[14:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I looked on the ESW wiki for things about <q> but there were only position papers, with few references to sources other than those the main contributor had written

[14:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, at least your post was well thought out and contained a lot of useul information, rather than being totally useless like most others in the thread

[14:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, thanks. :)

[14:57:01.0000] <hober>
indeed, it's been almost the only email worth reading in the thread

[16:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: Bug trackers suck though


2008-10-30
[17:05:00.0000] <doublec>
yes, bug trackers are difficult to use

[17:05:01.0000] <doublec>
they present an overwhelming number of fields to fill in and you're never sure what components to put things under. So most users don't bother.

[17:06:00.0000] <jcranmer>
especially when the bug tracker provides "Hardware" and "OS" when you're running a web-service :-)

[17:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
should i make things redundant or more complicated?

[17:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can either redefine "local date and time" to be almost identical to "global date and time" (but without timezones)

[17:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
or i can factor out the common bits and make the spec even harder to read

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me finds a way to factor without much confusion

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>

I have a time machine, but it only lets me travel forward in time. at a rate of just a few nano seconds faster than people at rest.

[07:43:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Lachy: I do too. It's called an airplane :-)

[07:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_quotes#French -- "Unlike English, French does not set off unquoted material within a quotation mark by using a second set of quotes."

[07:43:02.0000] <Lachy>
:-)

[07:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
also "when there should be two adjacent opening or closing marks, only one is written"

[07:45:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i'm sure this was mentioned in the <q> thread i've not read, but it makes it clear to me that css generated quotes don't work for french at least

[07:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: One of the recent <q> posts

[07:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: Maybe none of them ever wanted to come back to our time

[07:46:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: so will we have one?

[07:47:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: why not, though?

[07:47:01.0000] <jcranmer>
have we become a barbarian age in their eyes?

[07:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: You were speaking theoretically, so it doesn't matter why nobody will choose to come back to now, it only matters that they could choose that :-)

[07:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I can't tell you, as it would cause a paradox

[07:48:02.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: forever is a long time

[07:49:00.0000] <jcranmer>
you'd have to claim that no one would choose to come back to now

[07:49:01.0000] <jcranmer>
over the next hundreds of thousands, millions, even billions of years

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: Billions of years from now, they'll have an interval of billions of years they could travel back to, which will still be in our future

[07:52:01.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: but there are billions, if not trillions or quadrillions of people

[07:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
The further in the future you consider, the less chance they'll travel back to our past, so it all evens out

[07:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: Most of those people will just be sitting watching their holo-TVs, not travelling back to boring parts of history

[07:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
The novelty of time travel will wear off quickly, and there will just be a few historians who go back and summarise the fun bits for the mass market audiences

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
If I travelled to medieval times then I'd probably just catch some disease and die, so I'm much happier to stay here and watch programmes about kings and knights and jousting and dragons and whatever there was

[08:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
If I ever get a chance to go back in time, I've already picked a specific date to go to.

[08:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
I intend to go back and see myself.  So since I never actually saw myself on that date, I already know that I will never be able to.

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe you just will change your mind

[08:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
because you realise how much psychological trauma you would cause yourself by visiting yourself at that point in time

[08:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
no, not going to happen. I decided when I was 10 that I would go back to 7 March 1993, and haven't changed my mind since

[08:16:03.0000] <Philip`>
*will realise

[08:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe you did/will go back but you couldn't/won't be able to find yourself then

[08:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm fairly sure I know exactly where I was on that day, so finding my self won't be a problem

[08:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Reaching yourself might be hard - you might arrive on the wrong side of the world and forget that planes aren't fast enough yet to get you there in time

[08:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
or maybe I died on the plane to Australia from wherever the time machine left me :-)

[08:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders if there were any plane crashes on that day

[08:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
You might have arrived on the wrong day, because you forgot to deal with timezones correctly when translating from modern decimal time to the archaic 24-hour location-dependent system

[08:22:00.0000] <jcranmer>
are you might simply have met yourself, just in a different universe

[08:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
has someone started a wiki page with appropriate style sheet for quoting?

[08:23:01.0000] <jcranmer>
s/are/or/

[08:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
aiui it would contain lots of *|:lang(...) > q rules

[08:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me goes ahead and creates a page on the whatwg wiki

[08:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, Chris Wilson said IE8 does locale specific quoting. Ask him for details

[08:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
they might already have such a stylesheet

[08:25:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: ok

[08:26:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I thought :lang inherited

[08:27:00.0000] <jcranmer>
so q:lang() should be sufficient, right?

[08:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: If I write English and quote "some stuff in a different language" then (arguably) it should use English quotes, not the other language's quotes, so it should be based on the q's parent's lang and not the q's

[08:32:01.0000] <jcranmer>
makes sense

[08:32:02.0000] <Lachy>
it gets tricky when you have nested quotes of a foreign langauge inside an english document

[08:32:03.0000] <jcranmer>
I also missed the `>' in the specifier

[08:32:04.0000] <Lachy>
does the nested quote use the english quotes or the foreign language quotes?

[08:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
though in reality if I was doing any even slightly fancy like mixing languages and caring about punctuation, I'd write my own punctuation marks instead of hoping some algorithm would come up with the desired result

[08:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/any/anything/

[08:33:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, yes, that's why making <q> generate quotes automatically is a mistake

[08:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It uses whatever the author wants to use :-)

[08:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Web browsers aren't really the right place to encode grammar rules

[08:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
and why, IMHO, if we can't fix that problem with <q>, we should make it non-conforming

[08:34:02.0000] <jcranmer>
as evidenced by Jean's main character: "Je crois que «L'habit ne fait pas le moin…»"

[08:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I pointed to the MAMA research which put <q> as the 131st most-used element here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Oct/0221.html

[08:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has it as 125th, which is remarkably similar

[08:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
both used DMOZ but at different times, so maybe the selection bias as square as it is round over time :)

[08:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: I saw that, but I ignored it in my IRC comment because it would damage the validity of my claim ;-)

[08:38:02.0000] <Lachy>
one potential solution is to add attributes like <q start="“" end="’">...</q>. But then it's easier to just use the quotes without the <q> at all

[08:38:03.0000] <Lachy>
s/end"’"/end="”"/

[08:38:04.0000] <BenMillard>
I'm glad Chris replied to my summary with such detail and openness

[08:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I haven't seen a lot of technical feedback from Microsoft on that list previously

[08:40:00.0000] <smedero>
yeah, they're more active in css and webapps

[08:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Hmm, it looks like my sample was large enough that random variation would only cause a change of a couple of dozen places in the ranking, which is less than I expected, so it shouldn't actually be surprising that I got similar results to the other dmoz.org survey

[08:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I like your per-TLD breakdown on the use of <q>

[08:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
looking through the list, it seems particular sites use <q> on several pages...so my suspicion that websites tend to be internally consistent holds

[08:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
I was going to add a column for the percentage of pages in that TLD with <q>, but they all said 0.0% :-/

[08:42:02.0000] <BenMillard>
heh :)

[08:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hmm, looking at the "http://psychocorp.net/" entries that start with a big stretch of whitespace, then a <li>: http://philip.html5.org/data/q-tags.txt

[08:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
and there's too little data to make meaningful comparisons about the results anyway

[08:43:02.0000] <BenMillard>
they are using <q> around <a href> where the link text is the name of a work...so it looks like <q> is being used for <cite>?

[08:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
http://www.eskimo.com/~cwj2/atheism/moralath.html has this: <li class><strong><a href>Author</a></strong>: <q cite>Truncated Comment</q> <a href>[Date]</a></li> where all href and cite attributes share the same value, even though they have different text

[08:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Looks like psychocorp is using <q> whenever it mentions a film name, so it seems semantically quite like <cite>

[08:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
They don't seem to be styling <q>, so I guess they desire it to have quotation marks because that makes the film names distinguishable from the surrounding text

[08:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: i think mama has some filters to make the dmoz sample somewhat less biased

[08:48:02.0000] <zcorpan>
but don't quote me on that

[08:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
lol :D

[08:49:01.0000] <BenMillard>
http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html seems to use <q> for all sorts of things...usually there's an element nested inside the <q> like <q><em> or <q><code> which has the real purpose

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: blooberry said there were various things to limit the number of pages per domain and to filter out spam pages, I believe

[08:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I won't disagree with you :-)

[08:50:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, that debian.org page uses <q><em>free</em></q> for what seems like <dfn>free</dfn>?

[08:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
I use the high-tech method of ignoring the bias, and then if I'm going to make some claim like "59 pages use <q>" then I manually check to make sure they're not all from Wikipedia :-)

[08:51:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip` & zcorpan, I think one of the MAMA pages says they limit to 30 pages per domain...aha: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-the-url-set/#domaincapping

[08:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
but it failed on subdomains

[08:52:01.0000] <BenMillard>
"So, instead of the initial goal to have no more than 30 URLs from CNN, we now have 346!"

[08:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
I avoided the CNN issue by downloading the page list at a time when dmoz had removed almost all the CNN links

[08:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, from my skimming through your q-tags.txt, it seems <q> is often used for bogus purposes even amongst the tiny number of pages which use it :|

[08:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
One problem with limiting to 30 per domain is that it underrepresents the significant amount of content on Geocities and Angelfire

[08:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, oh yeah...they don't use subdomains.

[08:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
(They make up 2.5% of my sample, it appears)

[08:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
(which distorts the results because of the advert markup they insert into pages, but avoids the distortion of pretending (wishing) that Geocities pages didn't exist)

[08:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hey, look what http://www.voyager.prima.de/cpp/books1.html uses! <span class="quote">... <q>Title of Work</q> ...</span>

[08:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
incidentally, that link is a 404?

[08:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://web.archive.org/web/20080116164728/http://www.voyager.prima.de/cpp/books1.html

[08:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Eek, my data is 8 months old now

[09:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, cheers. Seeing it in context reinforces my view that <q> is bogus there.

[09:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it seems that <q> is so often used bogusly, like for the titles of works, that no longer generating quotes would make little difference to the usability of pages. The titles of work are using title case and therefore still look like titles with generated quote marks removed...

[09:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that http://people.opera.com/howcome/ is 1.7% of the pages that use <q>

[09:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
...and seems to use it correctly, too

[09:02:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, that page only contains the string "<q" once outside of comments, afaict?

[09:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
but that one use seems correct, yes

[09:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: what's the bogus/correct ratio?

[09:03:02.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, I haven't counted pricesely, but so far I've seen lots of bogus (several pages from several sites) and only 1 correct use (howcome).

[09:03:03.0000] <BenMillard>
s/pricesely/precisely/

[09:03:04.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Ah, I didn't notice the second was in comments, because I was just looking at the regexp output

[09:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: is "several" around 10 or around 50 or something else?

[09:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
Rather than "bogus"/"correct", perhaps a more useful classification is "needs quotes (else it's ambiguous/ugly/etc)"/"needs no quotes"/"doesn't matter"

[09:04:02.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, between 5 and 10

[09:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(in my mind, several sounds like "seven" so I use it as an approximation for that)

[09:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: makes sense

[09:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me used to think 'several' was precisely 7, when he was around 10

[09:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
and few is 3?

[09:06:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, "few" sounds like 4 or 5 to me :)

[09:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
what's a couple?

[09:07:01.0000] <zcorpan>
2-3?

[09:07:02.0000] <BenMillard>
2

[09:07:03.0000] <gsnedders>
2

[09:07:04.0000] <Philip`>
because my parents said Disney World probably had several Mickey Mouses rather than one person doing it all the time, and I thought that made good sense because it was one per day of the week

[09:07:05.0000] <BenMillard>
I guess 2-3 in some societies :P

[09:07:06.0000] <BenMillard>
I'm supposed to be updating Calthorpe Park School...any of you feel like categorising some of the pages in that list? Or shall I bookmark it and get to it as I progress through my research?

[09:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me didn't really understand the question

[09:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not quite sure what categorising the pages would actually be useful for

[09:09:00.0000] <BenMillard>
figuring out the true impact of removing the quote generation on <q> from UA stylesheets

[09:09:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(in terms of how it affects the user experience)

[09:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's primarily good to have interoperability, and it seems interoperability will be achieved soon by every browser inserting quotation marks, and it's not worth spending much effort to change them all

[09:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: but ie will do different things for different languages so we won't have interop if we don't change them

[09:10:01.0000] <BenMillard>
and it's impossible to fully implement the feature if you do locale sensitivity

[09:10:02.0000] <zcorpan>
and i guess ie won't do this for quirks/ie7 mode

[09:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but other browsers do

[09:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: But it's pretty close to interoperability - nobody is really going to be concerned if one browser uses slightly curlier quotes than another, whereas they do worry about quotes being entirely absent

[09:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
so it doesn't matter if it takes a few years to converge on precisely what quote characters to use

[09:11:03.0000] <Philip`>
Quirks is a good point :-(

[09:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
assuming that ie won't do this in quirks mode, i'd prefer to not generate quotes

[09:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
but i don't care much

[09:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
"{ quotes:'"' '"' "'" "'" }" is really not much fun to read in a small proportional-width font

[09:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I've bookmarked the list of pages using <q> and will run through it at some point, update my collection and send what I found to the list...maybe that'll be done by this evening, more likely some time tomorrow

[09:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: is '\201C' ... easier to read?

[09:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: No, since that makes it hard to see that it's a curly opening quote or whatever it is

[09:17:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, I use " on the outside and ' on the inside of quoted speech

[09:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
I think the solution is just to read mail in a fixed-width font

[09:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Hey, it said 'left' in my directions!"

[09:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: That's just because you're unpatriotic

[09:18:02.0000] <BenMillard>
in school, I was taught " is speechmark, ' is quote mark...I guess this is one of the intra-language inconsistencies

[09:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually I think I mostly see "...'...'..." in en-GB books, and '..."..."...' seems rarer (though still quite common, particularly in older books)

[09:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly it's American culture destroying our way of life

[09:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
this is another strong reason against generating quotes, imho: the rules aren't clear even within a language and they change over time

[09:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
at the 3rd level of nesting, I've no idea what English does (I guess it alternates)

[09:21:01.0000] <zcorpan>
css doesn't alternate, aiui

[09:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
At the third level of nesting, someone will tell you that your writing is far too complex and you should flatten it out :-p

[09:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
You couldn't use <q> for something like dialogue in a book anyway, because it can't cross paragraphs

[09:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
for dialogue you should use <dialog>

[09:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it seems webkit doesn't support open-quote and close-quote

[09:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: <dialog> is for dialogue like in plays, not in books

[09:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: does the spec say that?

[09:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
I just mean dialogue where I could write "some sentence like this, and then start a new paragraph.

[09:28:02.0000] <BenMillard>
I think Philip means books tend to put dialogue inline, inside sentences

[09:28:03.0000] <Philip`>
"And then continue saying stuff." and then stop the quoting

[09:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
(where the first paragraph doesn't end with a '"' because it's not the end of the quotation, and it cuts across the paragraph divisions)

[09:29:01.0000] <BenMillard>
The officer gave chase. "<q>Oi! Stop right there!</q>" she bellowed.

[09:29:02.0000] <BenMillard>
<p>The officer gave chase. "<q>Oi! Stop right there!</q>" she bellowed.</p>

[09:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Yes, because it says it's a conversation with an explicit speaker and quote, which is not how books are written

[09:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
(except when they are, for literary effect)

[09:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
yeah...plays and other scripts are written like that, plus stage directions, but prose usually isn't.

[09:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oooh, I can smell home cooking...lamb chops!

[09:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has fun writing an editable resizable matrix in HTML

[09:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
(contenteditable is pretty neat, since I can just make the contents of each table cell editable, and don't have to worry about fixed-size <input>s or anything)

[09:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
not splitting the <q> seems bogus to me and bending over backwards to work around how css quotes work

[09:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: In which case?

[09:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
« C’est une belle journée pour les Montréalais, soutient le ministre. Ces investissements stimuleront la croissance économique. »

[09:41:01.0000] <zcorpan>
the "soutient le ministre. " is not part of the quote

[09:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, right

[09:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
It does seem like a presentational hack if you put that not-part-of-quote text inside another element inside the quote

[09:42:02.0000] <BenMillard>
time for dinner

Philip`: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-tabular.html#header-and-data-cell-semantics is a 404 ... wonder if that's fixable by saying that /multipage/anything redirects to /multipage/ if it's a 404 (or otherwise redirecting all old urls appropriately)

[10:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Blame Hixie - it should be a pretty 404 page like http://www.whatwg.org/404 with a script that redirects you to whatever page contains header-and-data-cell-semantics

[10:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
(although if header-and-data-cell-semantics no longer exists in any page then it doesn't redirect you at all - maybe in that case it should go to /multipage/ ?)

[10:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The 404 page should include http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/link-fixup.js)

ROFL @ <span title='them' class='editorial-insertion' >their customers</span>

[12:52:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(what's wrong with <ins>?!!)

(taken from this message: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Oct/0267.html)

[13:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: <ins> is inappropriate in that case, given how HTML5 defines it

[13:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
because "The ins element represents an addition to the document.", but that editorial-insertion isn't a thing that was added to the document separately from the surrounding text

[13:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, make <ins> more general-purpose would better reflect how it is used.

[13:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm sure I've seen <del> used ironically far more often than used correctly

[13:09:01.0000] <BenMillard>
ironic use of HTML is fine by me

[13:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
check the quote starting "[B]loggers like [Rod 2.0]" here: http://blog.fawny.org/2008/10/26/maladaptives-arc/

[13:10:01.0000] <BenMillard>
<ins> used to mark editorial tweaks to a quoted source

[13:10:02.0000] <BenMillard>
makes sense to me

[13:10:03.0000] <Philip`>
((Is "ironic" the correct term? I don't really know))

[13:11:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip` <del>sucks</del> pwns, right?

[13:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
<ins> vs. <span class='editorial-insertion' > seems like a no-brainer, to me (<ins> ftw)

[13:21:00.0000] <mpt>
<del>their customers</del><ins>them</ins>

[13:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
mpt, that might be the wrong way around...I think "them" is what was replaced by the more specific "their customers"?

[13:26:00.0000] <mpt>
Well good, using more explicit markup can prevent my mistake :-)

[13:26:01.0000] <BenMillard>
this makes sense to me: <del>them</del> <ins>their customers</ins>

[13:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
although so does this: [their customers]

[13:27:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(with no markup or trace of what existed before the editorial change)

which to be fair to the airline, is what the itinerary said

"8592-01-01T02:09+02:09" Midnight UTC on ...

[03:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: doesn't look like midnight to me

[03:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh wait

[03:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
nm

[03:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems that UTC is to UT1 what URL is to IRI

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I filed bugs for the input[size] and content-language mentioned in the sitepoint thread you mentioned yesterday. thanks

[03:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if an author serves FooML+XBL2 to a browser, which tree would one put ARIA attributes in?

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think axioms say the FooML tree

[03:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but in practice a desire for encapsulation says the shadow tree created by XBL2

[03:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
seems like a big accessibility problem down the road

[04:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Has the <q> thread managed to come up with a solution that allows using <q> in languages that puts the following punctuation within the quote marks?

[04:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I must admit to skimming the most outrageous quote trains :)

[04:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if I'd only contribute to the damage done by the denial of productivity effect of <q> if I pointed out some of its history in order to make a point that the semantic need is questionable...

[04:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, please do

[04:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, although I really hate that convention, the solution is to put the punctuation within the <q> element if that's what you need.

[04:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
IMHO, punctuation should only be within the quote marks if it is part of the quote itself, otherwise it should go after.

[04:55:00.0000] <didymos>
Lachy, but there are plenty of people who disagree with you :)

[04:55:01.0000] <didymos>
(myself not included, though)

[04:55:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: But that's just plain _wrong_ when the punctuation isn't part of the quote

[05:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
The correct method of quoting is obvious in the computerised world: you copy-and-paste what someone else wrote, put quotation marks around it, and then put all your extra words and punctuation outside the quotes

[05:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
The old world didn't have copy-and-paste, so they could be excused for doing silly things like adding punctuation inside quotes instead :-)

[05:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I disagree with you in the case of en-US. :-)

[05:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
one of the many problems with <q> is that languages high up in the pecking order (en-US and fr-FR) are illogical in the sense that quotation marks do not strictly delimit the quoted string

[05:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Eggsac-tly

[05:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, what exactly is wrong with what I said?

[05:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: what's wrong is that implementing what you said for en-US is economically a bad idea

[05:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: which inline box model bugs would you forgo the fixes for while top hackers implement punctuation flipping?

[05:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I think you misunderstood what I said

[05:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: HTML does not have a mandate to change national languages

[05:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
if the punctuation should be within the quote marks, then the author should put it within the <q> element. e.g. <q>Some quote.</q> --> "Some quote." Otherwise, the author should put it outside. e.g. <q>Some quote</q>. --> "Some quote".

[05:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, I never said it did

[05:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that IE8b2 (at least on an en-GB system) seems to use single quotes for <q> by default, and double quotes once you add lang=en

[05:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. gsnedders isn't here today.

[05:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
he has a copy of The Handbook, right?

[05:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: No, it seems you're suggesting mangling the quote instead

[05:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
what?

[05:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The trailing punctuation is not necessarily part of the quote

[05:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
It's not me mangling the quotes, it's the illogical languages that incorrectly stick punctuation within quotation marks where it doesn't belong.

[05:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's why I said "IMHO, punctuation should only be within the quote marks if it is part of the quote itself, otherwise it should go after."

[05:12:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes, but as I said, we don't go around changing languages

[05:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees that IE8b2 does 'x"y"z' for default <q> (on an en-GB system), "x'y'z" if lang=en or lang=en-xx where xx is not gb, and those double/single chevron things if lang=fr

[05:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, so does it do "x'y'z" for en-AU?

[05:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
(When I say """ and "'", I mean the curly equivalents)

[05:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
(I'm not sure what the correct way is supposed to be, but I always do it that way)

[05:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Yes

[05:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
so is it doing that based on the system's own language settings when it isn't explicitly declared in the page?

[05:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
lang=no has funny quotes

[05:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Double-chevron, then comma/apostrophe or something)

[05:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I don't know - I'd need to change my system's language settings to test that, but I'm not sure how (and don't have time now)

[05:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders what a Double-chevron is

[05:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: do you mean right-pointing double guillemet?

[05:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me might be using the wrong term

[05:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
I mean something that looks like 《

[05:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
which my font doesn't really like, so it's the character that's like <<
