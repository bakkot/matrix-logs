"First of all, it's not like this code needs to be maintained *once*, it needs maintenance every time the set of void elements change. I would call this a stupid design of the target language."

[17:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
we did learn about particle and anti particles in undergrad

[17:11:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm tempted to reassign the "stupid design" tag to whoever decided it was a good idea to output HTML with XSLT :)

[17:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
can't recall if the hawking radiation was part of the discussion though

[17:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, bbl

[17:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, what is it about particles and antiparticles that is a lie?

[17:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Is it just the fact that the antiparticle is also a particle, just with opposite charge (or something like that)?

[17:16:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, yeah, I don't really get why we need to fix HTML5 while they really want to fix IE...

[17:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I'm redesigning the test file table to see if our views on that making it better are true or not

[17:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, did you get that table I emailed you? Have you had a chance to investigate it yet?

[17:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
National Enquirer: Dave Hyatt spotted in Memphis supermarket

[17:20:00.0000] <roc>
Lachy: it's not that it's a lie exactly ... the truth is a bunch of mathematics. Then to explain it to people, the physicists have to say something which is an English approximation to the mathematics. And the approximation is necessarily rough.

[17:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, checking inbox now

[17:20:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, oh you mean the search result table? Yeah, I got it.

[17:20:03.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, :p

[17:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, I filed in my "Research" folder for now.

[17:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, summary="Post query results" stood out as being text which would be better in <caption> or just omitted, since there's a preceeding heading which says "Displaying 1 to 50 of 854 reports"

[17:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
how do the various header algorithms deal with the dual-row items, each grouped by its own tbody?

[17:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, some header cells aren't using <th>, but if they were then parts of it would work

[17:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Nothing. I meant as an explaination for Hawking radiation

[17:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
in a way, it seemed much like a demo table I presented once before with a similar dual-tr structure. http://lachy.id.au/dev/2007/table-headers.html

[17:30:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, that table you just linked to is badly designed in several respects, imho.

[17:30:01.0000] <BenMillard>
it uses 2 levels of column headers but they don't make sense stacked up like that

[17:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the header cells and each row of data can be flatted to 1 row each, making it into a regular table that works without with plain <th>

[17:32:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Title   Last Name   First Name   Middle Name   Date of Birth   Mailing Address   City   Zip Code

[17:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
erm, "Title; Last Name; First Name; Middle Name; Date of Birth; Mailing Address; City; Zip Code"

[17:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
an interesting thing in the query table, which the "smart colspan" step handles, is what I call "sectional headers"

[17:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Perhaps for physicists to explain it to themselves, they have to say something which is a mathematical approximation to the reality, and that approximation is necessarily rough

[17:35:01.0000] <BenMillard>
these are cells which colspan the entire width of the table, creating implicit sections but where the main headers at the start of the table must still penetrate

[17:35:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, for example (if it were using <th>): <td colspan="6"> 29 Aug 2008 </td>

[17:35:03.0000] <roc>
that's not how it works

[17:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, much like the table you linked to, the search query table is packing information into cells where it isn't logical to put it

[17:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, refreshing to see it using <li> for pagination links, though :) It follows a common design pattern for their order and delinks current location, which is all cool.

[17:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, it uses <tbody class> to avoid lots of presentational markup. neat

[17:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, it contains unlabelled checkboxes (sad and much more common than labelled checkboxes for things like this, from what I've seen)

[17:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, the alt text is sensible and useful on the whole. :)

[17:42:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, <a href target="_blank"> :(

[17:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, that table I linked to was actually designed by the designer of a project I was working on, cause it needed to have all that information fit into a narrow space that wouldn't handle having it all in a single row

[17:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
I didn't notice the target=_blank. Since I have support for that disabled in my browser, it never really bothers me in practice, unless the site actually depends on the new window opening for some functionality

[17:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, I set mine the same way. :)

[17:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Needing to cramming too much data into too little width is a fairly common problem...I often come across it in my day job as a website developer.

[17:56:01.0000] <BenMillard>
my favoured solution is to cut the data down so only the most useful stuff is shown, then it usually fits

[17:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(sometimes linking each entry to a page where all the rest of the data is available)

[17:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's what I try to do. But when I'm not in control of the content, and I just have to implement what the client wants, there's little I can do

[17:57:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, that's also an experience I share. :(

[17:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
right, time for dinner...probably return in ~1 hour

[18:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, it seems that of all the media players I have, trying to find one that supports playing MKV that contains 2 1080p VC-1 video tracks and 5 AC3 audio tracks, and has UI for selecting which of those tracks to play, is a lot harder than I thought it would be :-(

[18:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Even VLC?

[18:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
VLC doesn't support VC-1

[18:00:03.0000] <Lachy>
yet

[18:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
QuickTime might work, but with the Perian plugin, it takes forever to finish loading MKV videos, and while it's loading, it's having trouble playing the HD

[18:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I should just remux them into separate files, one for each video track. Though it's a full quality blu-ray rip and I wanted to have it all self contained in one.

[18:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
Zoom player seems to work on windows, but it has some bugs

[18:06:00.0000] <GregHouston>
I haven't had much luck with MKV in general. It's probably user error, but I tried it out a couple times about 6 months apart with 3 different media players and an assortment of MKV files. My playback was always choppy and the audio was out of sync.

[18:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could buy a Blu-Ray player and the movie disc instead :-)

[18:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, you're assuming I actually have the disc :-)

[18:08:01.0000] <GregHouston>
Indeed. :)

[18:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That's why I said "buy" :-p

[18:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, ok. I thought you just said to buy the player

[18:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
I used the word "and", to indicate that I meant both :-)

[18:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll get a blu-ray player from Australia when a) I get confirmation that the manufacturer is legally required to sell in region free (or at least provide RPC-1 firmware on request), and b) blu-ray drives are available for Mac, and c) I can afford to replace my current Macs

[18:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
So in the meantime, you deserve to get everything for free? :-)

[18:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm fairly sure (a) is true, because of the Australian trade practices act and a nice court case that ruled it illegal for DVDs

[18:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, I pay $20 a month for my usenet subscription and even more for my internet connection. It's just that my money isn't going to the movie studios until they start showing that they want to treat their customers fairly

[18:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
I would buy more movies legally from iTunes instead, but they're really low quality compared to what I can get elsewhere

[18:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
and there's limited selection

[18:15:00.0000] <GregHouston>
The quality is generally good enough for me on Itunes, and so if I can rent it there I do, but most of their new releases are purchase only, which then sends me to usenet, and they lose out on my rental.

[18:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: First comment is moderated

[18:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Approved

[18:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
GregHouston, I refuse to rent from iTunes because it's not possible to strip the DRM from those, whereas its easy to do from purchases

[18:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why is it unfair that they are offering their product (which you clearly want to consume) in various media (DVD, Blu-Ray, iTunes, etc) with various quality and limitations and price?

[18:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, the DRM is unacceptable, especially the region encoding if it's done in the firmware instead of just software.

[18:17:01.0000] <jcranmer>
are people here using alt.binaries?

[18:17:02.0000] <jcranmer>
:-)

[18:17:03.0000] <Lachy>
jcranmer, yes

[18:17:04.0000] <GregHouston>
Lachy: I can see that. It's not much of an issue for me, because I watch everything on the same computer, don't own a tv, and most movies I will never watch a second time.

[22:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I've sent an e-mail requesting peer review of a follow-up to my last headers+id reply. Off to sleep now. I'll check the logs and my inbox when I return, just in case. :)

[23:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2008Sep/0000.html is interesting

[23:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
there, sent a reply with my version of the stats :-)

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: interesting development in ratios since http://junkyard.damowmow.com/291

[00:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
people ignoring me more, you mean? :-)

[00:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: no, the people whose ratio is > 1.0

[00:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
So YouTube conflates accessibility captions and translation subtitles under a "CC" menu

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
stats for all time http://junkyard.damowmow.com/342

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone has the complete whatwg archives in mbx format i can do the same for whatwg

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I thought lists.whatwg.org had the complete archives. what's missing?

[01:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
the mbx format part

[01:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
afaik

[01:24:03.0000] <hsivonen>
ah

[01:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. RB has sent more email than I have...

[01:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh hey

[01:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
the text files in the whatwg archives ARE mbx format

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://junkyard.damowmow.com/343

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://junkyard.damowmow.com/342 is public-html from the start

[01:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://junkyard.damowmow.com/343 is whatwg from the start

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg has had over 700 people contribute ideas, wow

[01:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I've sent a lot of email :-(

[01:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hey, I made the whatwg list twice :-)

[01:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: for a while, you had the #1 spot in terms of outstanding e-mails on my list

[01:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think you're #2 now

[01:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: who's #1 now?

[01:47:03.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, if you combine my @lachy.id.au and @iinet.net.au emails into one, how do I score?

[01:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
let's see

[01:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Juan R's Sent/Subj...

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
a high sent/subj means one of three things as far as i can tell:

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
1. you aren't explaining yourself well

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
2. you're repeating yourself

[01:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
3. i'm responding to each e-mail individually instead of doing one mass e-mail

[01:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
(#3 probably only applies to me :-P )

[01:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok reload 343

[01:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
so in about a third of the time, public-html received about the same amount of mail

[01:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's insane

[01:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, both lists have been high volume recently. I haven't been able to keep up with them.

[01:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
the whatwg list got to about 500 unread mails in my folder, mostly thanks to that RDF thread :-(

[01:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i tried to damp down the rdfa discussion when it got too verbose

[01:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I should try to read them one day, but I mostly ignored it since I don't like RDF

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
well the issue isn't really rdf

[01:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what's the issue in your view?

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
the issue is how do we address the needs of the communities that RDFa is addressing, and whether doing so is appropriate given our overall goals

[02:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i need to look at some of manu's and ben's e-mails more closely to determine the answer to both

[02:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
but that will have to wait until after wf2

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
(underlying both of those points is "what are the needs of the communities that RDFa is addressing")

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
to the extent the needs include compatibility with the RDF data model, it's about RDF

[02:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me suspects the RDF data model is too hard for mass adoption

[02:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't think that's actually been listed as a need

[02:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
AFAICS, everything beyond rel=license is totally unnecessary verbosity when it comes to expressing copyright info.

[02:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not even convinced rel=license is needed

[02:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's only needed if the copyright info is going to actually be used by computers

[02:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
and i'm not convinced that it is

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: one of the reasons why I chose Flickr was that Flickr is the place people go to when they want to search for CC-licensed photos

[02:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: they don't go to Google image search

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
there is value in being able to search by license

[02:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Would it work well in an open system?

[02:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
It doesn't work all that well on flickr

[02:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: it would not work if people can make licensing claims cross-Origin about other people's works

[02:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: but it could work it the licensing info is near the data object

[02:29:03.0000] <hsivonen>
preferably inside it

[02:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: what sucks on Flickr is that people don't know what they are doing when the flip the defaults

[02:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Inside might work technically but I think user-invisible metadata outside the object would almost never be right

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: also, what sucks is that people take photos of people, CC doesn't deal with model release, and the photographer can't unilaterally concoct model release

[02:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: People not knowing waht they are doing would be even worse without a consistent UI that explained everything, right?

[02:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: could be

[02:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't think Flickr's UI explains everything, though

[02:32:04.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: AFAIK Model release laws vary wildly by country

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Flickr says "You can choose to use a Creative Commons license to allow more liberal use and sharing of your photos or video while still maintaining reasonable copyright protection."

[02:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
one could argue that "reasonable copyright protection" is not a good UI term

[02:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Yeah, the explaination is worse than I remembered

[02:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
Does flickr default to a CC licence or ordinary copyright?

[02:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: defaults to ARR

[02:36:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[02:36:04.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: A CC default would be disaterous

[02:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Lots of photog. types are seriously paranoid about any copying

[02:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, yeah. But that means that people are somehow being coerced into changing to a CC licence, without actually understanding the concequenses of their actions

[02:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
e.g. http://duncandavidson.com/2008/04/the-copyright-conspiracy.html

[02:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: CC and FSF have very different marketing

[02:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: In what sense coerced? They are given several options but none are presented as "better"

[02:39:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, did you add fora⊙an to annevk⊙oc?

[02:39:02.0000] <annevk>
(for the WHATWG list)

[02:39:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: looks like it

[02:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: google has cc search that is directly based on the cc metadata; what is your opinion of it?

[02:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: too well hidden

[02:42:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie: 3095, Anne: 904, Henri: 590

[02:42:03.0000] <annevk>
I should e-mail less :)

[02:43:00.0000] <annevk>
whoa, Matthew and Jim Ley make it to the top five

[02:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: the script automatically merges names that are the same

[02:43:02.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, coerced is probably the wrong word. I probably should have said tempted or something, because there are people with CC-licenced stuff on flickr who still complain when their stuff gets reused

[02:43:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: also, not available in image search

[02:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: note that the script does things based on time active, so unless jim posts again, he'll stay high

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: well there's no way with rel=license to label an image

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: so if that's your use case, rel=license won't help google

[02:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yeah. that's a problem.

[02:44:03.0000] <Lachy>
that copyright conspiracy article is interesting. But in which countries does any form of copyright registration apply? Is that just a US thing, or more widespread?

[02:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me shrugs

[02:44:05.0000] <Hixie>
if you say so

[02:44:06.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[02:44:07.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I want a way to have a license field in EXIF/JFIF/PNG

[02:44:08.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and then I want tool support for it

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: ah well that's not my problem, luckily

[02:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: It annoys me the CC isn't standardizing embedded license metadata for EXIF/JFIF/PNG/Ogg/MP4

[02:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and PDF in a simple way

[02:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: it's a U.S. thing

[02:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
You can register copyright in the UK

[02:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dunno how it compares to the US

[02:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, that's what I thought. But I find it annoying that whenever I read anything related to copyright, it's usually very much US-centric

[02:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: you may safely omit "related to copyright"

[02:48:03.0000] <roc>
the US system gets exported everywhere else eventually

[02:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
so I basically have no idea what the copyright situation is in Australia, although I do know that we also have excessively long copyright terms

[02:49:01.0000] <roc>
say hello to WIPO

[02:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: It would be great if the U.S. system had been exported without the Victor Hugo input

[02:49:03.0000] <Lachy>
I think it's life-of-author+70 years, which is absolutely absurd

[02:49:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: that stuff came from Europe

[02:49:05.0000] <Lachy>
who's Victor Hugo?

[02:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the disaster is taking the worst parts of French and American copyright things and mixing them

[02:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wish we could go back to 14 year copyright terms

[02:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: a famous writer who was so annoyed at Americans pirating his books that he wrote what lead to the creation of the Berne Convention

[03:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think searching images by license is a more common use case than searching text by license, since images have different remixability characteristics

[03:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
no disagreement there

[03:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so in that sense, standardizing and implementing a license field for EXIF should be a higher priority than rel license

[03:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
agreed

[03:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
EXIF isn't my problem though

[03:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[03:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, Microsoft has just patented the page up/down keys http://news.zdnet.com/2424-9595_22-218626.html

[03:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i try and avoid reading about patents

[03:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
companies become three times more liable to damages in the US if it can be demonstrated that they (or their employees) had knowledge of an infringed patent

[03:26:00.0000] <roc>
that's actually changing

[03:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it's better to be ignorant

[03:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: oh thank god

[03:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
roc: for the better?

[03:26:04.0000] <roc>
depends on your point of view, but yeah

[03:26:05.0000] <Hixie>
good to hear

[03:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
I only read about patents that get mentioned on places like /., and are so absurd that there's obviously plenty of prior art

[03:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
like the Eolas patent?

[03:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah

[03:30:02.0000] <roc>
oh, the Patent Reform Act 2007 is stalled :-(

[03:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
lachy: being absurd and having plenty of prior art doesn't seem to matter

[03:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
roc: :-(

[03:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for some reason, people like the concept of Trial by Jury despite cases like Eolas

[03:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
and people like spec design by consensus despite cases like XLink

[03:32:00.0000] <annevk>
some people even like XLink

[03:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that the WHATWG is closer to arguing things to a professional judge and a panel of semi-pro lay judges than to Trial by Jury

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[03:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, what about public-html?

[03:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: They're not patenting the keys at all - they're patenting a method of scrolling (which jumps in a one-page increment and preserves the vertical offset of your view of your page, regardless of zoom, etc), which might be triggered by those keys

[03:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
(using the term professional to mean literally "paid", as opposed to "competent")

[03:34:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: no comment

[03:34:04.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, yeah, I realised that. But I just summarised it poorly

[03:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(using semi-pro to refer to the Finnish trial system--not the proness of the WHATWG panelists)

[03:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: ZDNet summarised it equally poorly/inflammatorily :-)

[03:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, in any case, that method of using pg up/dn has been used for decades

[03:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't easily remember any programs that scroll like that

[03:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, web browsers, word processors, text editors, etc.

[03:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
they all scroll like that

[03:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
Linux man pages even

[03:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
Web browsers and text editor don't usually split the document into pages

[03:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Word processors scroll by roughly the viewport height (which depends on your zoom setting), not by a single page

[03:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
in the case of web browsers, since a web page is a continuous medium, a "page" could be considered equivalent to the content of the viewport

[03:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
no matter how high it is

[03:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
If you're looking at just the top of a page, and press page-down, you jump to the bottom of page, whereas the patent is talking about jumping to the top of the next page

[03:44:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: @media projection

[03:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, Print Preview

[03:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Uh, you can't just consider things to be things that they aren't, and say it's prior art :-p

[03:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, the patent is too broad

[03:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries print preview in Opera and Firefox, and in both cases it scrolls by the zoom-dependent viewport height and not by a single page

[03:45:02.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: and virtually any other slideshow tool

[03:46:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Any PDF viewer whose zoom is set to "Fit to window" or similar

[03:46:01.0000] <virtuelv>
man

[03:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: the patent is a software patent, it's a given that it's not a good idea. but lots of companies have software patents, microsoft is no exception.

[03:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: apple's pdf viewer doesn't do what this patent says, i just checked

[03:48:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: evince does, if set to "Best fit"

[03:48:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Acrobat reader has a similar means

[03:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
even Notepad scrolls like that (though, I'm aware its an MS program, it's been around for years, and to patent the process now is just absurd

[03:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: That only works because the viewport height happens to be the height of a single page

[03:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Notepad doesn't have pages

[03:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, define what a page is?

[03:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: A page is like a rectangular piece of paper, but on a computer

[03:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
if you're only talking about the on-screen representation of an A4 page, then ok. But that's irrelevant, since the concept of keeping the cursor in place on screen and shifting it down by the viewport has been around forever

[03:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
The point is not to shift it down by the viewport - the point is to shift it down by a page, regardless of the viewport

[03:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
the whole point of this patent as i understand it is that it isn't about shifting by the viewport but shifting by the page height

[03:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
and i think virtuelv is right that acrobat does that, i remember it driving me crazy

[03:54:00.0000] <virtuelv>
either way, patents are just Evil

[03:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
patents as originally defined make some sense

[03:55:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: yes, but the problem is that the patent system does not scale

[03:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you come up with an idea for a physical product, it makes sense to give you some protection to allow you to sell it before some big multinational can use your idea and destroy your margins

[03:55:02.0000] <virtuelv>
and the threshold for getting a patent is ridiculously low these days

[03:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
but i agree that at least for software it makes no sense

[03:56:00.0000] <virtuelv>
like that guy getting a patent for a special case of multiply-linked lists

[03:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
because the economics just aren't the same for software

[03:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
patents on methods of construction or on algorithms, etc, also make no sense imho

[03:58:00.0000] <virtuelv>
a friend of mine with a PhD in control systems theory says most of the patents she encounters are also complete bullshit

[03:58:01.0000] <virtuelv>
and obvious to anyone skilled in the trade

[03:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
What about e.g. the MP3 algorithm? That presumably took substantial effort to develop, and seemed far in advance of any alternatives at that time, and the patent was specific enough that it didn't prevent development of similar competitors like Vorbis

[03:58:03.0000] <virtuelv>
(mostly for industrial processes, AIUI)

[03:59:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: discovering the general theory of relativity also took substantial time and effort, and Einstein's theories were specific enough

[03:59:01.0000] <virtuelv>
should he have been granted a patent on it?

[04:00:00.0000] <virtuelv>
algorithms are discovered, not invented

[04:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
algorithms are invented

[04:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
and if the mp3 patent was awarded, then a patent on the algorithm for predicting time dilation should be too

[04:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
and probably would be

[04:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i could see an argument for that, if it was limited to a very small time frame (low single digit years), and was limited to people actually using the technology to make money

[04:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: it shouldn't prevent me from writing an implementations and sharing it with people online

[04:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, wouldn't that just be a mathematical equation, which can't be patented?

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: all software is "a mathematical equation" in the same sense

[04:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: There's only one theory of relativity, and even if it was phrased differently you'd get the same results, so that theory just needed to be discovered; but there are millions of ways you can encode audio, each slightly different, and the problem is choosing the right set of tradeoffs, so that's much more like invention than like discovery of a pre-existing thing

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's not just one theory of relativity

[04:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
the whole point of how science works is that there are many theories on everything

[04:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
we test them to see which one is closest to reality each time

[04:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
and then keep improvign it

[04:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries to work out how to phrase it better

[04:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
coming up with an algorithm to predict how the universe will act is the same thing as writing an algorithm to compress music

[04:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
it just does something different

[04:07:00.0000] <roc>
no, I think there's a difference between science and engineering

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think I'm trying to say something like how Newton's theory of gravity and Einstein's theory of gravity are substantially different, and there aren't a million theories in between that they could have just as easily decided on but that might not have worked quite so well in practice

[04:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: what's the difference?

[04:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
Einstein didn't do some experiments to decide whether E=mc^2 or E=mc^2.01 or E=0.01+mc^2 - there's just one way that makes sense

[04:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's "just one that makes sense" in the same way that there is "just one" WebSocket spec definition that makes sense

[04:10:01.0000] <annevk>
lol, instead of volunteering to do something, TAYLOR starts debating Hixie's list, typical

[04:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
well my list had the desired effect

[04:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
someone (i won't say who in case they don't actually want to do it!) contacted me and volunteered to work on something maybe :-)

[04:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
The effect of demonstrating that people are more willing to complain about editors than to help as editors? :-)

[04:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, getting someone to volunteer

[04:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
at least if they're complaining about the list they aren't complaining about the spec, though

[04:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
happy mailman mailing list membership reminder day, btw

[04:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
haha pt(w)'s e-mail is funny

[04:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
let's see... i've written four specs like html5... he has written none... but hell, maybe he does know better after all

[04:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I like how he challenged some of the requirements, without actually making a case against them

[04:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
my favourite has to be the last one:

[04:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
"a pragmatic attitude that is willing to put the needs of the users, authors, and implementors (in that order) far ahead of technical purity"

[04:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
...which he challenges

[04:17:04.0000] <Lachy>
ironically, he partially challenged the "the ability to defend a decision" one without actually defending his :-)

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it makes sense that he wouldn't defend a decision to not defend decisions :-P

[04:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's not ironic that's just plain sensible :-P

[04:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
You should have added "The editor must not drown kittens" and see if anyone objected

[04:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't expect people to object!

[04:19:01.0000] <wilhelm>
Well, someone fulfilling those requirements would probably produce yet another spec he'd be unhappy with. Your axioms do result in a very specific type of spec.

[04:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe his view is the editor is just meant to edit, and decisions are made by WG consensus and not by the editor, and therefore the editor does not need to defend decisions

[04:22:00.0000] <roc>
in engineering we're optimizing a very complex utility function and we make a lot of trade-offs

[04:22:01.0000] <roc>
in science the utility function is much simpler, primarily "does this theory fit the data"

[04:22:02.0000] <roc>
and you make very few tradeoffs

[04:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
wilhelm: that's what i led with. "a spec of the quality of html5" or some such

[04:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: that doesn't get you a spec like html5. :-)

[04:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i'll grant you that, but i'm not sure that changes the argument at the point of "is it patentable"

[04:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Many people may consider that to be a good thing :-)

[04:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: probably :-)

[04:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me guesses consensus works best on specs which not many people care about, which is either boring specs that they're not interested in or new specs that they haven't heard of

[04:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know of any spec where consensus has worked well

[04:25:02.0000] <annevk>
it's hard to find such a spec, I tried

[04:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think the most i've found is specs where consensus didn't work worse than one poor editor would have

[04:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
and those were all very small specs, where there simply weren't that many design decisions to screw up

[04:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
Are there any specs were only one person was involved in development? That kind of spec would surely be the result of the unanimous consensus of all who were involved

[04:26:03.0000] <roc>
I think the idea is that in science, you're so constrained by observations that there's little creativity and so little """invention"""

[04:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
s/were/where/

[04:27:00.0000] <roc>
but don't ask me to defend the theory of patents

[04:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i think that relativity is very creative. and quantum even more so.

[04:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: but yeah.

[04:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: specs are really just software written in prose, and the same applies to both, really

[04:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: you can't write good software in a committee

[04:28:00.0000] <roc>
actually I think you're wrong there. The observations force you to adopt those theories, or theories equivalent to those theories

[04:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: the sheer number of competing GUTs right now suggests otherwise

[04:29:00.0000] <roc>
they're all "relativity + QM + extensions"

[04:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: science works the other way around. You come up with many theories, then you make predictions using them, and only the ones that predict reality survive.

[04:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: but you still have to come up with theories, and that's creative.

[04:29:03.0000] <roc>
and the fact that the extensions have so many degrees of freedom is in fact very disturbing to many/most scientists

[04:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
roc: it's a bit like having a test suite, and then writing a bunch of programs, and then throwing the ones away that don't pass the test suite.

[04:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
What do you do when you find there was a bug in the test suite?

[04:30:01.0000] <roc>
ok, but in engineering you get to choose the test suite and the results you want from each tests

[04:30:02.0000] <roc>
subject to rather vague and broad requirements

[04:30:03.0000] <roc>
in science, you don't get to choose the results

[04:31:00.0000] <roc>
and you're not supposed to be choosy about the tests either

[04:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: the problem is mostly that the predictions are things we can't yet test (e.g. LHC should help with that), but once we get to the stage where practical physics is testing the theoretical stuff again, they'll go away.

[04:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: science by definition has a bug-free test suite. :-P

[04:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
roc: granted

[04:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: but i still don't think that difference is, or should be, relevant for the purposes of the patent system

[04:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
concensus definitely screws things up, especially when that concensus overrules the editor's decision

[04:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
More than when the editor's decision overrules the consensus?

[04:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
just look at the selectors api naming crap. People were happy with the names I chose. Then I got overruled, and people were disappointed

[04:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
the naming thing just made different people sad

[04:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
naming decisions are a pain and really should never be something that people have to vote on

[04:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
If people were happy, how was there consensus to overrule that decision?

[04:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, there should be no concensus. In fact, in a really large group, concensus is almost impossible

[04:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Perhaps the solution is to avoid really large groups, not to avoid consensus

[04:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
there wasn't concensus in the case of the selector naming at any point iirc, it was just a bunch of narrowly-won votes that kept swinging the results back and forth

[04:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, because it was decided by a vote, with each member ranking their preferences in order. The winner wasn't the most preferred by anyone, it just happened to have the highest average vote

[04:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
(there definitely needs to be some oversight of the editor, though)

[04:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i just think it needs to be oversight of the form "keep us happy enough or leave", not "keep us very happy or do what we say")

[04:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
(because that both gives more motivation to the editor, and more responsibility, and thus more care, from the oversight)

[04:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
I prefer "if you're not happy, you leave!" :-)

[04:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
well an editor with no oversight has nothing to keep him in check, and that's dangerous

[04:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
because it is supremely easy to go down a path where you think you're doing the right thing and you're ignoring people saying that you're not

[04:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me thinks someone should fork HTML 5, to promote some competitive spirit between the editors of each fork

[04:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
even when they're right

[04:40:03.0000] <Lachy>
that way, the editor is always happy and the only people left in teh group are those who agree

[04:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i'm definitely up for that

[04:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i totally agree that that would be a good thing (seriously)

[04:40:06.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: that's how xhtml2 came to be, btw

[04:40:07.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I know :-)

[04:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i think it's not a good thing :-)

[04:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, forking the spec wouldn't be good if the two diverged significantly and different implementations followed different specs

[04:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
they wouldn't

[04:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
at least, my copy of it would always follow what the UAs did

[04:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
what wouldn't? The specs significantly diverging, or the implementers following different specs/

[04:43:02.0000] <Lachy>
?

[04:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
the implementers following different specs in a way that resulted in lack of interop

[04:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose, since they generally try to follow each other

[04:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
so if the spec was forked, and both editors tried to equally follow what the implementers did, then by the end, we'd have 2 specs saying roughly the same thing in 2 different ways

[04:45:01.0000] <roc>
because of human error, the specs would say two subtly but very different things, and we'd be in hell

[04:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think you'd see the browser vendors following different copies of the spec

[04:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i also don't think you'd find two people who'd edit the spec competently enough for the two to both be credible for long

[04:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
if they were both that competent, they'd likely get over their differences and merge

[04:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, from you're list, the things I need to work on are "the ability to defend a decision and resist flip-flopping" and "the ability to write tools to perform studies of Web content"

[04:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
you do need to resist flip flopping more. :-) but you're doing fine as editor

[04:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
the thing you actually need to work on is getting more editing hours in your day :-)

[04:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/need/would need/

[04:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
I would need to find an employer that would let me work on specs 100%

[04:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
or work in your free time

[04:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
having tried both, i recommend the former

[04:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
(getting an employer willing to let you work on specs 100%)

[04:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
assuming you want to become a full time editor, that is

[04:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, maybe not 100%, probably more like 80% to be reasonable, with 20% time on other random stuff

[04:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
good luck with that

[04:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
as long as I have 0% time assigned to filling out time sheets

[04:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
right now i'm at ~120% specs, ~10% internal stuff google wants me to work on

[04:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
and 0% other random stuff

[04:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
by random stuff, I meant including all the internal stuff the employer wants.

[04:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[04:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
html5.org is hammering svn.whatwg.org again

[04:56:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[04:56:01.0000] <annevk>
I had this idea of making static copies once people request a particular diff and then making some lookup table for redirects to those static copies

[04:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
that'd be neat

[04:57:01.0000] <annevk>
I wasn't actually planning on ever writing it :/

[04:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really understand why the usage is so spiky

[04:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
is google crawling it or something?

[04:58:00.0000] <annevk>
could be, yes

[04:58:01.0000] <annevk>
well, we have '<meta name="robots" content="index, nofollow">'

[04:59:00.0000] <annevk>
there's not an easy way to disallow indexing URIs with ? characters, is there?

[04:59:01.0000] <annevk>
(there's of course a lot of direct links from twitter)

[04:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
robots.txt Disallow: / or something

[05:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno

[05:00:01.0000] <annevk>
I guess I could prevent indexing /tools/ yes

[05:00:02.0000] <annevk>
it doesn't really matter anyway to bots

[05:00:03.0000] <virtuelv>
hm, the science vs. engineering discussion in the backlog is interesting

[05:01:00.0000] <annevk>
http://html5.org/robots.txt

[05:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, weird. I just got an auto-responder mail from the W3C mailing list system in response to my latest mail telling me how to subscribe to public-html, agree to the patent policy, etc.

[05:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: You could clone the svn.whatwg.org repository onto html5.org, and then you can just do local diffs and hammer your own server instead of someone else's

[05:50:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, neh

[05:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
There is clearly an unfulfilled desire for a way to mark up layout tables

[05:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
About 0.2% of pages on dmoz.org have <table summary="some string containing the substring 'layout'">

[05:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, 0.3%

[06:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Some people are willing to put a lot of effort into that markup - "Layout table: Main table.  The first row contains a USDAFS link and a service wide drop-down navigation.  The second row and third rows contains the forest name and search engine.  Below this are two cells.  The left cell contains the site navigation.  The right cell contains the content of the page."

[06:01:00.0000] <annevk>
-_-

[06:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
(e.g. http://www.fs.fed.us/wcnf/unit/ogden/)

[06:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.google.com/search?q=rfc2328 - "www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt ... by O Version" - good to see the author name heuristics working well

[06:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder if authors that use summary="Layout table" (or similar) actually think of the summary as more like a comment, rather than anything users actually see

[06:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
summary="Logo and Pictures layout. If this summary can be approved please email webmaster⊙sc"

[06:06:01.0000] <wilhelm>
Interesting. How many use <table summary> with any content?

[06:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
wilhelm: About 2.5% of the pages have <table summary>

[06:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
wilhelm: About 2.1% have <table summary="not an empty string">

[06:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
wilhelm: (and about 0.6% have <table summary="">)

[06:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
wilhelm: (obviously with some overlap between those sets of pages)

[06:09:01.0000] <wilhelm>
Right. Thanks. (c:

[06:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me proposes paving the cowpath by requiring authors to use summary="layout table" (case-insensitively) on layout tables, and suggesting that UAs use that to decide to render it as a layout table rather than a data table

[06:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me realises that the element categories have changed significantly since I last wrote that section in the html5 authoring guide

[06:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think I need to make some sort of diagram that illustrates the relationship between the various element categories, especially: Embedded Content --> Phrasing Content --> Flow Content

[06:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: You have a broken link to #durationUpdate - should that be #durationChange?

[07:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Also you have a broken link to #repetition

[07:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, annevk or someone else who knows python, where can I find the API reference for the simpletree that html5lib returns? Does it implement some of the DOM API or something entirely different?

[07:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I need to write a script that processes the spec and extracts all the data about elements and outputs it to a nice table

[07:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: import html5lib; help(html5lib.treebuilders.simpletree)

[07:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
when one writes Python code with html5lib and lxml, would the same app code work with a pure-Python ElementTree impl?

[07:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is http://codespeak.net/lxml/compatibility.html relevant?

[07:09:01.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, simpletree is probably best learned by viewing source :)

[07:09:02.0000] <annevk>
s/viewing/view/

[07:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, what are the advantages of using simpletree over minidom or something else?

[07:12:00.0000] <annevk>
simpletree has some custom functions we wrote, such as hilite, but I don't think it's much more useful than the other tree implementations, and likely slowe

[07:12:01.0000] <annevk>
r

[07:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll use minidom, since that'll have an API I'm somewhat familiar with

[07:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
lxml is what all the cool people use

[07:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll take a look at lxml

[07:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
OMG, what is it that makes people think excessive CC'ing of irrelevant people and lists is a good thing to do? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Sep/0009.html

[07:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
CC'ing the chairs isn't necessary, since they're already on the list, the wai-* lists are irrelevant to a discussion about editors, and bringing TimBL at this stage seems way over the top

[07:25:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, weird

[07:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's also interesting that all the responses have been commenting on the requirements to be an editor, rather than anyone stepping up and saying they'd be willing

[07:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://code.google.com/p/jython-elementtree/source/browse/trunk/elementtree/ElementTree.py#898

[07:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yet another place where the empty element list needs amending

[07:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I can make the spec-splitter 15 times faster by using lxml's HTML input/output instead of html5lib - does anyone mind if I use that (and get slightly different output)?

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: http://google.com/codesearch?q=area+base+basefont+br+col - there's a load more

[07:30:01.0000] <annevk>
I don't

[07:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what Fredrik Lundh's business model is

[07:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
how do I check what versions of libxml2 and libxslt I have on my system? I want to find out if I need to upgrade them for use with lxml

[07:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
grep LIBXML_DOTTED_VERSION /usr/include/libxml2/libxml/xmlversion.h

[07:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
perhaps

[07:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
and grep LIBXSLT_DOTTED_VERSION /usr/include/libxslt/xsltconfig.h

[07:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
it returned: define LIBXML_DOTTED_VERSION "2.6.16"

[07:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
and: #define LIBXSLT_DOTTED_VERSION "1.1.12"

[07:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I need to upgrade those

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds it hard to remember what it was like to have to manually install and upgrde software, rather than typing a single command and having it all work automatically for pretty much any software package

[07:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: what do you do with software that doesn't have aptable packages?

[07:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, I just downloaded and compiled the source for libxml2. Typing ./configure; make; sudo make install; wasn't too hard

[07:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: now, try to remove it fully

[07:59:02.0000] <Lachy>
though it seems to have installed it in a different directory from where the old version was

[08:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, no idea how :-)

[08:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I care more about things without emergeable packages, but in practice those things pretty much never exist :-)

[08:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can html5lib be emerged already? what about Java stuff?

[08:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wish Apple provided an easy way to upgrade things like this on Mac

[08:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: sudo port install foo

[08:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yeah, but that's not maintained by Apple, and how up to date are macports?

[08:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
dunno about up-to-datedness

[08:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Those things are much easier than C libraries, since I can just drop the directory/JAR in the right place

[08:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me was surprised recently to discover Gentoo had the necessary libraries to compile and run a 16-year-old SunOS program

[08:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
$ port installed; tells me I have libxml2 @2.6.32_0 and libxslt @1.1.23_0 already

[08:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
they're recent enough

[08:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, make uninstall; uninstalled everything I previously installed. That was easy

[08:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll just stick with the macport stuff

[08:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder if i should send comments on the xhtml media types note

[08:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
I imagine your comments would be useful, so that sounds potentially worthwhile

[08:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
at least it'd be pretty fun

[08:43:00.0000] <annevk>
hah

[09:08:00.0000] <annevk>
whoa, whatwg.org is slow

[09:09:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Indeed. I just got a 500 from whatwg.org too.

[09:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if anyone really uses the Accept header, other than as a fragile politically-correct UA-sniffing method to send text/html to IE

[09:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: there could be one or two servers still running legacy code that negotiates PNG vs. GIF

[09:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
also, I wouldn't be too surprised to find someone negotiating Word vs. PDF

[09:40:00.0000] <wilhelm>
It is used on some mobile sites to determine whether to send WML or HTML.

[09:42:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Incorrectly, usually. They often just sniff for WML, and serve WML if supported. That has caused trouble for Opera more than once.

[09:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: negotiating png vs gif doesn't have to be legacy code if one still cares about ie6

[09:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: IE6 claims to Accept image/png, doesn't it?

[09:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: mine doesn't afaik

[09:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ooh. interesting

[09:48:00.0000] <annevk>
I think WebKit and IE do */* + whatever plugins add

[09:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, is there a new version of xhtml-media-types being written?

[09:50:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: yeah

[09:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
link?

[09:50:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: it updates xhtml 1.0 appendix c too

[09:50:04.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2008/ED-xhtmlmime-20080827/

[09:50:05.0000] <zcorpan>
but now it's appendix a

[09:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL. They've got conformance requirements in the abstract :-)

[09:52:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah the whole thing is a great laugh

[09:53:00.0000] <annevk>
haha

[09:53:01.0000] <annevk>
btw, Google Chrome: http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-09-01-n47.html

[09:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders why to not be honest and call it "porn mode"

[10:03:00.0000] <Philip`_>
krijnh: I think your clock is off by five minutes

[10:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
hah, they also seem to indicate that UAs process XML documents depending on which XML MIME type was used instead of just the xmlns

[10:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
"Some HTML user agents render XML processing instructions" - they don't specify which ones. AFAIK, even NN4 didn't render them

[10:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
and they're still recommending the space in <br />

[10:08:01.0000] <annevk>
if the Google thing is a Hoax they did quite a good job

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be nice if they gave specific examples of UAs where the compatibility advice is relevant; other there's a danger of falling into 'we do it this way because this is the way we've always done it'

[10:11:00.0000] <annevk>
also, http://www.google.com/chrome has a different 404 from http://www.google.com/chroms

[10:12:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I don't think they care much for UAs

[10:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
University admissions is annoying.

[10:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: in my xhtml mobile study, some rendered the xml decl iirc

[10:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[10:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: catering to UAs is the whole point of the Note

[10:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
guideline #11 and #13 are giving advice optimised for use as text/html, which is incompatible with xhtml

[10:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
i.e. relying on the DOM returning uppercase tagNames and depending on implied elements like tbody in CSS

[10:16:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, that's orthogonal :)

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Wouldn't it be great, then, to start from scratch and design something based on the needs of today's web applications and today's users?" - maybe it would, but the list of features in that blog post sounds like pretty much exactly what every other browser already has or is working on

[10:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so browsers have gotten so complex that it makes sense design a product around the assumption that browser engines have bugs including memory leaks

[10:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
"We're applying the same kind of process isolation you find in modern operating system" - you mean like how Windows and Linux have all their drivers mushed into a single kernel address space, because microkernels which split every task into a separate process have failed?

[10:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
I like the idea of Porn mode.  I maintain a separate clean profile in my browser, which I clear after every use, for that :-)

[10:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: It would be quite an elaborate hoax since they even got Google to register memoryhog.net two weeks ago to put in an example :-)

[10:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: To be extra careful you could use an entirely separate browser, like Lynx

[10:24:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, how's that related? (and how did you figure it out)

[10:25:00.0000] <annevk>
(well, I can see how it's sort of related)

[10:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
"If there's a crazy memory leak it won't affect you for that long because you'll probably close the tab at some point and get that memory back." - i.e. "if your browser seems to be going really slowly, you'll have to randomly close a load of pages until you find it's sped up again"

[10:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/6 in the bottom-right refers to memoryhog.net

[10:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, of course, I use Lynx for ordinary browsing. I meant I use a separate Lynx profile

[10:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
The process isolation thing doesn't really help at all when you've got some big complex application like Gmail in a single tab and keep it open for a week, which I would guess is where memory leaks are most likely to occur

[10:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder what appropriate alternate text would be for that. Since it's an image inside a link, the HTML5 spec says to use text that describes the destination of the link. But the image is also one page of a comic strip.

[10:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
but it's making each one a link to the next in sequence

[10:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if the entire process gets trashed often, I wonder if one could just make a malloc that bumps a pointer and a no-op free()

[10:28:02.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, interesting

[10:29:00.0000] <annevk>
various googlechrome domains were registered "by proxy" on August 3

[10:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does page 8 imply something about Flash?

[10:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
If its engine is based on WebKit, how come "When we started we were passing 23% of WebKit's layout tests" (p11)?

[10:36:00.0000] <annevk>
because the "Denmark V8 Team" made their own JavaScript engine?

[10:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they forked WebKit and started hacking on it with no real idea what they doing and broke everything and then someone said "hey guys, we broke three quarters of all these tests, we probably shouldn't have done that" and so they crawled back up to 99%

[10:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
(There are probably more charitable explanations :-) )

[10:39:01.0000] <virtuelv>
where is that 23% quote from?

[10:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Compiling JS to machine code would be kind of novel if Firefox hadn't done that weeks ago

[10:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/11

[10:42:00.0000] <virtuelv>
blogoscoped is so totally hammered now

[10:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Wow, an address bar that searches more than just the URL, like page titles and stuff! I bet no other browser has thought of that and implemented it and shipped it or at least included it in the latest public beta

[10:43:00.0000] <virtuelv>
shipped, actually

[10:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
IE only has it in the beta

[10:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
OpenDNS's shortcuts work fine :P

[10:43:03.0000] <annevk>
http://thetruthaboutmozilla.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/the-google-browser/ has some interesting analysis

[10:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: There's an easy solution to that hammering: just open all 38 pages in background tabs, and come back in a while when they've all loaded

[10:52:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: yeah, or I can wait until someone has done that for me, and can just provide me with zips of the images

[10:52:01.0000] <virtuelv>
or I can wait till the server cools off a bit

[10:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ooh, I might have found something that isn't already in other browsers: a newly opened tab automatically shows pages you've visited most often, unlike Opera which is pretty much the same but requires you to click a bit to set the pages to be displayed, and unlike IE8 which shows recently closed tabs and some other stuff

[10:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wishes Scott McCloud was better at drawing checked shirts

[10:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I can't find anything else that's novel

[10:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
Did I just miss all the exciting parts?

[11:01:00.0000] <annevk>
putting tab buttons on top?

[11:01:01.0000] <annevk>
I can see why Google has been so active on ES4 now

[11:01:02.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: I fail to see the novelty of that

[11:01:03.0000] <virtuelv>
<nudge>

[11:01:04.0000] <Philip`>
Opera already has the tab buttons on top of the address bar

[11:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
and IE already does something crazy with the position of the menu bar

[11:02:01.0000] <annevk>
I thought they would put them on top of everything

[11:02:02.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: you're refering to the fact that application menus are below the address bar in IE?

[11:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: I think so, though I don't remember exactly what it does

[11:03:01.0000] <annevk>
ok

[11:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so when are we going to see benchmarks of V8 vs. TraceMonkey?

[11:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for reference, it would be cool to see Rhino generating Java bytecode and HotSpot JITting that as part of a pure-JS benchmark

[11:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I'd bet they're not going to manage to put the tab buttons sticking out the top edge of the window in a way that doesn't totally break my KDE theme, but maybe they're not concerned about that :-)

[11:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe the tabs will stick out above your screen

[11:05:02.0000] <Dashiva>
So you can physically select them!

[11:05:03.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be fun learning how to move and resize a window that has tab buttons sticking out of it

[11:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose the V8 "hidden class" thing might be interesting, particularly in comparison to TraceMonkey's tracing optimisations that are trying to solve a similar problem

[11:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Aha!

[11:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
(i.e. the variables-usually-stay-the-same-type-but-not-always-so-you-have-to-be-very-careful-before-optimising problem)

[11:07:02.0000] <Dashiva>
This time I wasn't tricked by the month change in the public-html archives

[11:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Because you bookmarked the /latest URL instead?

[11:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, actually, that's probably not really what the hidden class thing is about at all)

[11:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
now blogoscoped died totally

[11:09:01.0000] <annevk>
I guess nobody made a backup?

[11:09:02.0000] <annevk>
oh well, doesn't matter

[11:09:03.0000] <annevk>
time for food anyways

[11:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Try http://blogoscoped.com.nyud.net/google-chrome/ ?

[11:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
(That appears to work fine for me)

[11:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: No, because I realized what date it was :)

[11:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: thanks

[11:13:00.0000] <annevk>
lots of UI stuff copied from Opera, indeed

[11:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Google has tried to buy Opera at any point

[11:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Lots copied from IE too, like separate processes per tab, and lists of popular related sites

[11:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
and the rest is copied from Firefox and Safari

[11:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, not necessarily copied, since they've all been working on these things in parallel over the past couple of years)

[11:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also there's the question of how it can be a profitable product, because it's not like they can get a hundred-million-dollar search-box contract with themselves and make money off the deal

[11:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xhtml2/2008Sep/0000.html

[11:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: maybe if people wouldn't use other browsers they wouldn't have to pay the vendors for their search boxes

[11:22:01.0000] <annevk>
"This abstract sucks." so much for zcorpan being the good cop

[11:22:02.0000] <annevk>
:p

[11:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: That sounds a slightly convoluted way of considering their browser to be profitable, but I suppose it makes sense :-)

[11:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: the XHTML2 WG exposes even zcorpan's good cop bounds :-)

[11:23:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i'm the good cop?

[11:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: annevk is the bad cop. :-)

[11:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ok, sorry, i should have let you drop that line in a reply

[11:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gotta go now

[11:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
mm, I remember when NS4 was still something people worried about

[11:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: That was a long time ago

[11:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Did you have running water back then?

[11:35:01.0000] <takkaria>
I do believe so

[11:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan (if you read this): "Comments on this document may be sent to www-html-editor⊙wo (archive). Public discussion on this document may take place on the mailing list www-html⊙wo (archive)."

[11:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[11:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Presumably that's an RFC 2119 "MAY"

[11:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan's comments are spot-on.

[11:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish the document doesn't get published in that state

[11:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be pretty surprising if it did get published in that state, what with all the "@@@@add example@@@@"

[11:46:00.0000] <annevk>
if it gets published, we can just make a blog post

[11:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: It's for extensibility

[11:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Blog posts don't look nearly as official as W3C Notes

[11:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: some blog posts get more implementor support, though

[11:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
like feed autodiscovery

[11:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: No, feed autodiscovery is done in a way different to any blog post or draft spec

[11:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: do you mean the HTML5 spec is wrong there?

[11:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Next to nothing supports @rel=feed

[11:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: This is more about authors than implementors

[11:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: indeed

[11:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
and I would guess authors are more likely than implementors to consider the W3C authoritative

[11:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
(even if they then choose to ignore that authority)

[11:59:00.0000] <krijnh>
Philip`: I think so too :)

[12:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
One advantage of using irssi+screen+ssh is that I have two independent clocks on my screen, so I can tell if one of them has gone wrong

[12:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: shouldn't one have three clocks to tell which one is wrong?

[12:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No - I just need the two clocks so I detect the existence of a problem, and then I'll check that ntp is still running on both machines and restart it when necessary :-)

[12:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: When I use the text field entry in validator.nu, then click "validate", the resulting page has "address" selected instead of "text field", so if I click "validate" again then it fails because it was given an empty address instead of resubmitting the text

[12:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: yeah. that sucks pretty badly

[12:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I wanted to find a purely client-side solution

[12:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but I haven't been able to find one.

[12:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so I guess I'll just bite the bullet and do something on the server side

[12:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Okay - if it's a known problem, then that's fine, and I don't have a burning desire for it to be fixed as soon as possible

[12:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it annoys me, too, and I believe it annoys other people as well

[12:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: a way to improve it and still keep it purely client-side would be to show the textarea if source is shown

[12:28:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: that's actually pretty much what validator.w3.org does

[12:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: wouldn't that be bad if the user enables showing source for regular GET urls?

[12:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: why would it be bad?

[12:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: the UI wouldn't feel stable. it would be the reverse of the current usability bug

[12:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I don't see that behavior on validator.w3.org

[12:30:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: perhaps it was the experimental version

[12:30:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: you could still revalidate and having the textarea is nice for tweaking and testing

[12:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: hmm i probably remembered wrong about v.w.o

[12:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Time to update my about page with something a bit saner.

[12:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. my abstraction layers are so unleaky, that the code that has the opportunity to write stuff in the response doesn't even know the input came from textarea

[12:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I guess I should use setAttribute on ServletRequest to forward this datum

[13:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. if IE8 supports hashchange, it might become the first feature of V.nu that is IE-enhanced

[13:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone with access to the OED around and able to look anything up for me?

[13:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has access to the online one

[13:17:01.0000] <tndH>
/me raises hand too

[13:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Does it make any preference between the capitalization of mummy v. Mummy?

[13:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
For any particular meaning of the word?

[13:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
One's mother

[13:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
It uses lowercase everywhere, as far as I can see

[13:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
For "mum" it says "Forms: freq. with capital initial.", but it doesn't say that for "mummy"

[13:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
k.

[13:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"This led to the interesting statement that I made while a toddler, <q>I have three parents — a mummy, a daddy, and a Fiona.</q>."

[13:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would use a capital letter when using the word as a name ("I like Mummy") and not when using it as a noun ("I like my mummy")

[13:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I on the whole would always use lowercase

[13:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Actually, the OED may state that proper nouns should start with a capital somewhere else

[13:23:02.0000] <takkaria>
/me is happy he's in hir new flat, there's a church over the road and they practice bellringing on monday evenings :)

[13:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: You'll get annoyed with it eventually :)

[13:24:01.0000] <takkaria>
the eventual solution will just be to play loud music over it, I think

[13:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that's what I do with bagpipes around here

[13:26:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm somewhat tempted to wander over and ask how I can get involved

[13:26:01.0000] <takkaria>
I hear that church bellringers quite often don't care about your religion

[13:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: It's hard :P

[13:26:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me used to share an office with someone who rang bells

[13:26:04.0000] <takkaria>
gsnedders: as in physically strenuous?

[13:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
and my supervisor does bellringing too

[13:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: In your office?

[13:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: No, in terms of timing

[13:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm fairly sure they're both non-religious)

[13:27:04.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Because of the delay between pulling the string and the bell ringing

[13:27:05.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: No - sadly I've never worked in an office that contains church bells

[13:27:06.0000] <takkaria>
mm

http://digg.com/business_finance/With_Gustov_Strengthing_You_Need_to_Fill_up_NOW?t=18346414#c18346414

[13:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
How is that not -40?

[13:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Can't you just ignore the ringing and concentrate on matching your timing with the movements of everyone else?

[13:29:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That's the easiest way to do it, I expect

[13:29:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But still fairly hard

[13:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be pretty easy to automate

[13:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
You just need a heavy box and a motor and a pulley, and you could make a perfect bellringing machine

[13:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I have this slight thought that it has been done before

[13:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's not like it's a form of music that requires artistic creativity - you just pull the rope at the point where the little book of patterns says you should

[13:31:03.0000] <takkaria>
Philip`: that also destroys a lot of the fun, so I hear :)

[13:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You can play any music as the little book of patterns says you should

[13:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how does the HTML4+RDFa thing work in terms of W3C WG charters?

[13:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Normally the written form of the music misses out lots of subtle details of timing and volume and whatever else music has, so you can't just unthinkingly play the notes it says

[13:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
whereas I can't imagine there being much subtlety in bellringing, because all you can do is yank the rope

[13:49:00.0000] <hdh>

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>

It might be a pun, 'gust of (wind)'

/me wonders how long it'll be until Hixie is accused of being in some Chrome-related conspiracy

[14:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You made that edit yesterday just to please the Chrome developers! You don't care about the future of the web!

[14:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I bet people have been accusing him off-list already

[14:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But will we get people saying "Chrome is anti-accessibility"?

[14:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Well, duh, Hixie works at the same company, so obviously it is!

[14:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: re: http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=294 do I need to differentiate URL attributes

[14:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or just say "unescaped ampersand"?

[14:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: unescaped ampersand or typoed entity

[14:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: bonus points if you can figure out which entity, if any, the author intended ;)

[14:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
e.g. &nbspM is clearly intended to be &nbsp;

[14:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: maybe later for the quessing :-)

[14:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.google.com/search?q=%26nbspm

[14:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It'd seem nicer if you could differentiate between the very common <a href="foo?bar&baz"> and the less common <img alt="Fish&Chips"> or <span>Fish&Chips</span>, since the advice given to authors would be different in those cases

[14:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: isn't it "escape & as &amp;" in both of those?

[14:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
and also it'd be nicer if those could be differentiated from &bogus;, since you shouldn't tell people to escape & as &amp; in that case

[14:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
http://code.google.com/p/chrome/ is Forbidden

[14:28:03.0000] <hsivonen>
http://code.google.com/p/google-chrome/ is Not Found

[14:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Hmm, true; but maybe the explanation of the advice would be different

[14:29:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: why?

[14:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Because specific advice ("When you are writing a URL which contains a &, you have to write it as &amp;", "When you want a '&' character to appear on the page, you have to write it as &amp;") seems friendly and easier to understand than generic advice

[14:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me belatedly notes that he also works with someone who is into bellringing

[14:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy & jgraham, thanks for your review of the tables. I've replied with updates.

[14:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, looks good

[15:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Did you book the hotel, BTW?

[15:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, not yet, sorry. Been swamped with tables stuff, my collection midpoint and a usability audit which has just come my way.

[15:03:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I send an e-mail asking about availability, though

[15:03:02.0000] <BenMillard>
*sent

[15:03:03.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Do you mind if I just give you the amount in cash there?

[15:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, that's fine by me

[15:04:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, I've just swapped 3 & 4 with 5 & 6 so they have a slightly more logical progression.

[15:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: I'll review in the morning

[15:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, thanks. :)

[15:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, you also have to change the links in the article

[15:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, I had but SmartFTP has decided against uploading it for the past several minutes...

[15:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, should be correct now.

[15:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
yep, that's better

[15:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: actually, reviewing now

[15:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, I'm making some editorial tweaks to the entry so it reads a bit better. Also, I need to do a recount of cells, bytes and so forth.

[15:25:01.0000] <BenMillard>
the redesigned tables should be stable, unless you find errors :)

[15:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: nice! one thing though, the select says "address" but the textarea is shown

[15:30:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: solved by modeSelect.value = urlInput.className

[15:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, interested in reviewing my attempts to simplify a headers+id example? (It's what lachy and hsivonen have been reviewing.)

[15:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: thanks. I'll fix in the morning

[15:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: sure. pointer?

[15:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: good stuff. thanks for examining this

[15:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me likes that BenMillard considers public IRC to be "off the radar"

[15:37:01.0000] <zcorpan>
oh wait this channel is logged?

[15:37:02.0000] <zcorpan>
crap

[15:37:03.0000] <Philip`>
[off] the radar?

[15:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, keeping the links private to avoid premature public review is all I want. :)

[15:38:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, d'oh, I'll remember that text time! Forwarded.

[15:38:02.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Only teasing :)

[15:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen makes an interesting observation: "Does it make any sense to group by "budgeted" major and date minor to put all three "budgeted" columns side-by-side, etc.?"

[15:40:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so the dates would be repeated instead of the aspects

[15:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: ah my hotmail address. never check that these days

[15:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, that's the only one I have for you...

[15:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: no need to resend but simonp⊙oc or zcorpan⊙gc has a higher chance of me seeing the email :)

[15:42:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, oh actually I'm lying! I do have an @opera for you, sorry.

[15:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, does cabal⊙wo actually work?

[15:42:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: dunno

[15:42:04.0000] <Lachy>
maybe we should set it up :-)

[15:42:05.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I guess Hixie might get it

[15:42:06.0000] <zcorpan>
send an email there and see what happens

[15:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I think the answer is "without knowing the purpose of the table it's hard to say"

[15:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's not much of a cabal if Hixie is the only person in it

[15:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Best kind of cabal

[15:44:03.0000] <jgraham>
Most exclusive

[15:44:04.0000] <zcorpan>
it's Hixie and his cats

[15:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe he could train the cats to edit the spec

[15:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
Yep, Hixie, Pillar and Hedral are the founding members

[15:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me hopes he remembed the cat's names correctly

[15:45:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me just claims not to have a clue, and gets away with it

[15:45:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Thankfully, they haven't come after me yet

[15:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, yeah. It seems to me that the table is about comparing the Budget against what was Actual and what was Forecast; rather than comparing how each aspect changed over time.

[15:46:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, having said that, the Budgeted and Forecase values never change within each investment...so maybe it's really about seeing how the Actual changed each week?

[15:46:02.0000] <BenMillard>
*Forecast

[15:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I strongly suspect this is fake data

[15:47:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, that's also a possibility, in which case I'll redesign when we are shown the actual source table. :)

[15:47:02.0000] <annevk>
fyi: http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html

[15:47:03.0000] <Lachy>
it's not very good fake data. It makes analysing it and working out what's really important quite difficult

[15:47:04.0000] <annevk>
(no need to URL guess anymore)

[15:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: They seem correct, judging from http://www.flickr.com/photos/carinda/2672675271/in/set-72157606196286925/

[15:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
interesting, hotmail stripped out <http://...> when forwarding

[15:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
(unless those are totally unrelated cats and it's just a freaky coincidence)

[15:49:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, do I need to resend? maybe it thought they were HTML tags :)

[15:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, there's no caption on those cats!

[15:49:03.0000] <annevk>
I wonder what license it will be under

[15:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
grr. X-Chat keeps crashing when I accidentally right click :-(

[15:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That's why computers should only have one mouse button

[15:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: It pretty much has to be LGPL I think

[15:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Some parts of WebKit are apparently BSD

[15:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
Reaction from the intertubes seems somewaht muted

[15:52:02.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: no need

[15:52:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: they also claim to have used Firefox code

[15:52:04.0000] <roc>
the comic says BSD

[15:52:05.0000] <jgraham>
Which is GPL/LGPL/MPL

[15:52:06.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, my computer does only have one mouse button!

[15:52:07.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Oh, right

[15:52:08.0000] <roc>
perhaps they mean the non-Webkit bits

[15:52:09.0000] <Lachy>
but 2 finger tap behaves as a right click

[15:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Oh, I suppose you'll have to blame God then - if Steve Jobs had designed humans, we'd only need one finger, and all these problems would be avoided

[15:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Combining components from multiple open-source software projects seems a very rare thing

[15:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
hah! :-D

[15:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
Code reuse is usually far too much work compared to just rewriting it yourself

[15:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
roc, on which page does the comic say BSD?

[15:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, blogoscoped.com is very unresponsive right now

[15:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
luckily, I wgeted a copy of the whole comic earlier

[15:59:02.0000] <Lachy>
but I wanted to check if I got them all. Were there only 38 pages?

[16:00:00.0000] <roc>
yes

[16:00:01.0000] <roc>
I can't find the page which said BSD but I definitely saw it

[16:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: i'll look at this tomorrow, bedtime now

[16:01:01.0000] <jruderman>
in http://blogoscoped.com.nyud.net/google-chrome/37 they implied that it was a BSD-like license

[16:02:00.0000] <jruderman>
jgraham: where did they claim to have used Firefox code?

[16:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
it could also be LGPL or MIT based on that, but I suppose MIT is ruled out because WebKit is BSD/LGPL

[16:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
but then it could be all 3

[16:02:03.0000] <Philip`>
jruderman: http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html - "We've used components from Apple's WebKit and Mozilla's Firefox, among others"

[16:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
or even Apache2 licence, like google Android

[16:03:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, ok thanks

[16:05:00.0000] <jruderman>
Philip`: interesting

[16:05:01.0000] <jruderman>
so they might not have intended for the cartoon to be the first thing we saw ;)

[16:05:02.0000] <roc>
maybe I saw it in Slashdot

[16:05:03.0000] <roc>
in which case, I apologise

[16:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
jruderman: They probably didn't intend to indirectly DDOS the server of the first person who chose to scan and upload the comic :-)

[16:07:00.0000] <jruderman>
lol

[16:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
wow, the idea of a Google browser has been floating around since 2001 http://webword.com/moving/googleclient.html

[16:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's even earlier than I thought

[16:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
Has anyone predicted a Yahoo Browser yet?

[16:10:00.0000] <annevk>
prolly

[16:10:01.0000] <annevk>
or rather, toaly

[16:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I predict Yahoo will launch a browser next year.

[16:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Certainly.

[16:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder why Google is restricting Google Chrome to 100 countries?

[16:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
unless they mean 100 UI languages, cause being open source, there's nothing stopping anyone releasing it world wide

[16:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: US export laws

[16:18:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe because Google Search only works for a 100 countries?

[16:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, what do US export laws have to do with anything?

[16:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Cuba, Iran, etc. cannot have it sent to from US servers

[16:18:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't remember quite what the laws are

[16:18:04.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: They say "more than 100 countries", which might mean "all the countries in the world"

[16:18:05.0000] <Lachy>
Google have servers in other countries

[16:18:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: It may be relevant that they have their HQ in Google

[16:18:07.0000] <Philip`>
100 is just a nice round number

[16:18:08.0000] <Lachy>
there are over 200 countries

[16:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
in Google? in the US.

[16:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you get too specific about the number of countries, you'll get into all kinds of political disputes

[16:20:00.0000] <hdh>
maybe 100 launch parties, but it's just a beta

[16:21:00.0000] <annevk>
http://geography.about.com/cs/countries/a/numbercountries.htm says less than 200, fwiw

[16:21:01.0000] <annevk>
/me is not sure it's correct

[16:21:02.0000] <roc>
"country" is a fuzzy concept

[16:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
hdh: "just a beta" doesn't mean that much - Gmail is still just a beta

[16:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL, the comic has been taken down due to server load

[16:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The web applications wg was always in beta

[16:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: The pages other than 1 still work fine

[16:24:00.0000] <annevk>
roc, indeed, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries has better information than about.com

[16:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me predicts that calling Chrome "beta" will not stop lots of people downloading it tomorrow and finding loads of problem and saying it's rubbish and a failure

[16:26:00.0000] <roc>
I think we in New Zealand would classify the Cook Islands, Niue and and Tokelau as independent countries, even though about.com doesn't

[16:27:00.0000] <roc>
they're basically self-governing. NZers would be surprised to be told that we govern them

[16:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
me predicts loads of people will find loads of problems and say it's rubbish and a failure

[16:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
(In particular, it won't stop me downloading it and finding loads of problems and saying it's rubbish)

[16:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You normally do, though

[16:29:02.0000] <annevk>
roc, yeah, we'd say the same about Aruba and Netherlands Antilles (although there was some controversy about it recently)

[16:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me hopes it'll work in Wine

[16:30:01.0000] <roc>
Not to mention my favourite Norwegian possession, Bouvet Island

[16:32:00.0000] <annevk>
haha

[16:32:01.0000] <annevk>
just a plague of ice

[16:33:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, it has a ccTLD

[16:33:01.0000] <annevk>
that's funny

[16:33:02.0000] <roc>
yeah

[16:34:00.0000] <hdh>
gsnedders: can you make "import hotshot" in anolislib optional? python-profiler is not in debian

[16:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hdh: I guess

[16:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hdh: Remind me tomorrow, if I don't do anything about it by 18:00+01 :P

[16:38:01.0000] <hdh>
ok


2008-09-02
[00:18:00.0000] <maikmerten>
uh, on media elements... when is MEDIA_ERR_DECODE supposed to be set? As soon as the client realizes that he can't playback the media (e.g. no source with a fitting media codec)? This would could be during page load. Or is the error supposed to be set when actually attempting playback?

[00:21:00.0000] <maikmerten>
This is somewhat important so scripts can replace non-fitting (for the content) media elements with e.g. a video plugin fallback

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I think NonCommercial is more devious than NoDerivatives

[01:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://twitter.com/karlw3c/statuses/906253637

[01:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: fixed the popup to be consistent with the field

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I added aria-labelledby (but am not competent to test the result) thanks

[01:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
what should i call the insertion mode to replace the generic cdata/rcdata algorithm?

[01:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
"in text block" is all i have come up with so far

[01:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
'in [R]CDATA'

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
is "in CDATA/RCDATA" ok?

[01:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yes

[01:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[01:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[01:45:04.0000] <annevk>
that or (R)CDATA

[01:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i wanted to avoid parentheses everywhere

[01:45:06.0000] <Hixie>
it would look weird i think

[01:45:07.0000] <annevk>
fair enough

[01:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
crap i already have something called the "secondary insertion mode"

[01:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
state machines really don't handle push/pop "subroutine" semantics well

[01:48:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess http://twitter.com/karlw3c/statuses/906253637 was inevitable

[01:49:00.0000] <annevk>
though the reasoning is somewhat flawed: http://twitter.com/karlw3c/statuses/906259528

[01:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: can we please have a flag instead of secondary modes

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
you want to check a flag with every single token instead of jsut dispatching on a mode?

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
that seems... bad

[01:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's only needed once per character *run* and once per end tag

[01:55:00.0000] <roc>
that's not flawed, that's just delusional

[01:56:00.0000] <roc>
At a wild guess, seamless sandboxed iframes would be quite hard to implement in Chrome

[02:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: are you expecting the perf characteristics of a mode to be better than a flag because your runtime environment makes function pointer-based calls faster than conditional branch on flag?

[02:06:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, when will annotate IDL fragments with Null=Empty and all?

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that seems like more than necessary. it also wouldn't really fit into the way the spec is written.

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i'm expecting C++ to make an extra case in a switch statement to be cheaper than an additional if when the switch still has to be there

[02:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yes

[02:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but if you have a secondary mode, switching modes in mid-switch sucks

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i'm waiting for heycam to update the spec before looking at idl

[02:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: which is why I have a separate outer switch for foreign content

[02:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: then we're going to need a lot of research

[02:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: ?

[02:13:05.0000] <hsivonen>
it's a switch instead of an 'if' to make fallthrough work

[02:13:06.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, lots of trivial research :)

[02:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so if a switch on mode

[02:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i think you're making assumptions about your implementation that the spec doesn't

[02:14:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and you tell me to do something according to the secondary mode

[02:14:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'd need to re-enter the switch with a new condition

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so having secondary modes is not good

[02:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
unless they are a latent stack

[02:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and you never dispatch on the secondary mode

[02:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: for foreign stuff maybe, but for this rcdata/cdata thing there's no fallback

[02:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok. well that's cool then

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's just two options: text=>append, end tag=> do whatever is appropriate for that end tag, and switch back to the old mode

[02:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, IMHO, the worse CC licences are, in order, ND, NC, and SA. The reason is that ND prevents anyone from actually doing anything, except republishing unmodified copies which isn't very creative, and SA is bad because of the viral effect of copyleft licences

[02:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
SA is good because of the viral effect of copyleft licenses :-)

[02:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
still, having yet another thing called "secondary mode" isn't an option

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
and having one thing called secondary and another called alternative or something would be weird

[02:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
SA is good because it prevents proprietary use, but it's also bad because it affects the ability to use it in more permissive, non-copyleft licences without making the whole thing copyleft.

[02:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: at least ND is upfront about not letting you do stuff. NC is a trap. First you do something and then find that you are barred from doing stuff that touches money.

[02:21:02.0000] <annevk>
just call it RCDATA/CDATA mode

[02:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
copyleft doesn't forbid commercial use

[02:21:04.0000] <annevk>
oh, nm

[02:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, fine. I'll say they're equally bad

[02:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: even RMS thinks NDness is OK for opinion writings

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: SA->SA->SA->... is better than CC->CC->proprietary

[02:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in fact, RMS' essays are under a one-sentence formulation of CC-by-nd

[02:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
so? Is that an appeal to authority?

[02:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
if one finds oneself having a position even more extreme than RMS, one is usually wrong :-)

[02:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
RMS is the definition of the edge of the spectrum here :-P

[02:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: what Hixie said

[02:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
the spectrum isn't linear

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
an "edge" exists around any finite phase space

[02:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't have a big problem with BSD type licences because they allow non-copyleft proprietary uses, whereas RMS does

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: NC effectively puts you into this situation: http://overlawyered.com/2006/10/why-there-arent-dvds-of-some-of-your-favorite-old-tv-series/

[02:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I have a problem with my own stuff being forced into using a copyleft licence if I want to make use of copyleft licenced stuff

[02:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'm going to have an "original insertion mode" for rcdata/cdata and a "secondary insertion mode" for foreign

[02:27:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe call it 'foreign insertion mode'?

[02:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't want to change the foreign stuff today

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
or at all, until the svg issue can be resolved

[02:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how Google Chrome will do video codecs

[02:37:00.0000] <hendry>
really daft how http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/# isn't addressable

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
no alt attribute there

[02:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: It's really weird how Google is now publishing content in a form that is unfriendly towards search engines

[02:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: and so far, it seems that Googlebot isn't getting any unfair magic advantage

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the stuff just doesn't work with bot-based search

[02:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
google would never give googlebot an unfair advantage on one of its own sites

[02:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
in fact the search team goes out of its way to avoid doing that

[02:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[02:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
i need to solve the </script> problem for html now

[02:43:02.0000] <annevk>
incidentally, is that why Google uses crap markup? :D

[02:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i just say that a parser-inserted <script> element doesn't do magic when inserted?

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: http://www.google.com/privacy/

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: we're learning. slowly.

[02:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
and then i can trigger the magic when i see </script>

[02:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I learned that Google Maps has the HTML5 doctype by downloading and parsing random stuff from dmoz

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
having the doctype is one thing

[02:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
actually being compliant is what matters

[02:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yes, but I was still surprised to see Google do Ajaxy stuff in the standards mode

[02:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
true

[02:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
given how recent that is in GWT

[02:48:00.0000] <annevk>
interesting

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually i don't know if i told you this earlier, hsivonen, but someone in the zurich office set up an instance of your html5 validator internally

[02:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
to encourage html5 compliance

[02:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: cool

[02:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Jens Meiert from the WG is in the Zurich office

[02:50:03.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: i hope too google will "provide leadership" with this video codec mess...

[02:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yes; it was him who set up the validator in fact

[02:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://blogoscoped.com/files/google-chrome-screenshot.jpg - why does everyone want to get rid of menus nowadays :-(

[02:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/ :/? :/

[02:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how do multiple processes share drawing surfaces?

[02:58:01.0000] <annevk>
how do multiple processes still allow interaction with each other... eg, Flash communication

[02:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I've been told that the reason why Gecko's threading is the way it is was that back in 1998, X11 wasn't robust enough to handle even one *thread* per one *window*

[02:59:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe it's not completely sandboxed as the comic leds you to believe

[03:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me guesses it involves IPC

[03:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has no idea of anything more detailed, though

[03:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or perhaps they overlay the content area somehow and don't share actual drawing surfaces

[03:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
after all, there are already out-of-process browser plugins on Linux

[03:01:03.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: I don't know who told you that, but I doubt it.

[03:02:00.0000] <roc>
Having child windows (tabs) be rendered by different processes is actually "easy" on Windows and X11

[03:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
Opera already has an operapluginwrapper process on Linux, which seems to be related to Flash plugins in some way

[03:03:00.0000] <roc>
might get tricky if your UI has transparent overlays over the content

[03:03:01.0000] <roc>
there is really no solution to that on Mac that I know of, so I'm looking forward to seeing how Chrome does it

[03:03:02.0000] <roc>
so windowed plugins are in the same category, so OK for Windows and X11

[03:03:03.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: why does Gecko run all the windows on one thread?

[03:03:04.0000] <roc>
but *windowless* plugins, ... that

[03:04:00.0000] <roc>
that's a big problem. You can push bitmaps through shared memory, but that's suboptimal

[03:04:01.0000] <annevk>
I believe Chrome is Windows only for now

[03:04:02.0000] <annevk>
/me doesn't remember where he read that

[03:05:00.0000] <roc>
the beta is Windows only, but there is supposed to be Mac and Linux versions on the way

[03:05:01.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: the #1 reason is that making all structures shared across windows be threadsafe is a real pain

[03:06:00.0000] <annevk>
roc, indeed, I can't read :/

[03:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: ok

[03:06:02.0000] <roc>
the #2 reason is that the Firefox UI, and especially the extension system, assumes a single-threaded model for all content

[03:06:03.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: but that came a lot later

[03:07:00.0000] <roc>
but anyway you don't really want one thread per window. Chrome is doing the right thing, you want process separation

[03:08:00.0000] <roc>
unfortunately, doing HW accelerated rendering from separate processes into the same window, with plugins in the mix too, is going to be awfully tricky

[03:09:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: those issues are fixable though, and I think we'll tackle them, possibly once we've had time to look at Chrome and learn what we can from it.

[03:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems that supporting the Flash binary blog is getting more and more troublesome

[03:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
<video> obsoletes the video-only plug-ins

[03:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and some newer plugins like Gears and the Garmin GPS stuff are effectively faceless

[03:11:02.0000] <roc>
Process separation isn't free, there are performance and complexity costs, especially memory costs. Quite possibly it didn't make sense in the old days with small memories and only a few windows open at a time.

[03:11:03.0000] <roc>
Gears is not an NPAPI plugin.

[03:11:04.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. I thought it was

[03:12:00.0000] <roc>
Process separation probably still doesn't make sense for mobile.

[03:13:00.0000] <roc>
it'll be a long time before we can get rid of Flash (or Java, or Silverlight). I'm more interested in working with the plugin vendors to get better APIs so there isn't as much friction.

[03:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
isn't Java now an intranet problem?

[03:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I use the Web with Java disabled

[03:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and it doesn't Break the Web

[03:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I also don't have Silverlight and not having it doesn't Break the Web, either

[03:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lots of web sites teaching physics still use Java applets

[03:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Gears has to hook into browsers in ways that go beyond any public plugin API

[03:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: yeah, some university demo pages are really retro

[03:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I asked one of our mobile guys about multiprocess browser and he looked at me funny

[03:18:02.0000] <roc>
It may not break the Web for you, but when Java breaks, people yell

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I did have to use Java applets for math and computer science demos while studying

[03:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: but all those would be better as Java Web Start apps or as JavaScript apps

[03:20:00.0000] <roc>
othermaciej: Perhaps the mobile people are still getting used to operating systems with address space separation

[03:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I still haven't seen an applet that shouldn't be rewritten in JS or put into a dedicated Java Web Start window

[03:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: iPhone has plenty of address space separation, just not plenty of memory

[03:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it wasn't made by classical style "mobile people"

[03:20:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: those were Netscape 4-era applets

[03:21:00.0000] <roc>
smart move

[03:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
a number of online games i play (e.g. scrabbulous) use java

[03:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do they feel like they should be Web Start apps of GWT+canvas stuff instead?

[03:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
most could just be normal html web apps like gmail or google calendar

[03:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: btw, do the games you play use <object> or <applet>?

[03:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
good question

[03:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
scrabbulous uses both

[03:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
object for ie, applet for others

[03:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think my only experiences of Java and Flash on the Web are games and ads

[03:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
toulouse uses just applet

[03:31:02.0000] <roc>
and video I presume

[03:31:03.0000] <othermaciej>
some Flash games seem like they would be hard to do with good performance in current gen browsers

[03:31:04.0000] <othermaciej>
and video, yeah

[03:31:05.0000] <othermaciej>
(hard to do on open standards Web tech that is)

[03:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
we're getting there

[03:31:07.0000] <Hixie>
slowly :-)

[03:32:00.0000] <roc>
quite a few sites use Flash as a sound or persistent storage API (including gmail)

[03:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Sun still says <applet> works best cross-browser: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/deployment/applet/deployindex.html

[03:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the arguments against making <applet> conforming are more political than anything else

[03:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: do you count branded product catalogs entangled in Flash as advertising?

[03:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I have not used any such lately

[03:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I guess that's not visible to me, but that is kind of sad

[03:34:01.0000] <roc>
well, we're all doing our best to change that

[03:36:00.0000] <roc>
does using a Java telnet applet to play nethack count as a "game"?

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, checked in the revamp of <script> handling

[03:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I am happy with where the open Web platform is going

[03:42:00.0000] <roc>
good. I'm scared

[03:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and I've always enjoyed collaborating on actual standards work with Mozilla folks

[03:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and I think Gecko and WebKit are going in gratifyingly similar directions strategically despite pretty much no explicit coordination

[03:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(this despite occasional personality clashes or the like w/ specific Mozilla folks)

[03:47:00.0000] <aaronlev>
hsivonen: what was the discussion about aria-setsize/aria-posinset?

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aaronlev: are you referring to Ben Millard's feedback to the PFWG?

[03:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aaronlev: IIRC, there was (months ago) discussion about setsize belonging on the container instead of being repeated on each item

[03:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
aaronlev: and instead of posinset, an analogue of the start attribute on <ol> would be less verbose for paged views

[03:52:00.0000] <aaronlev>
hsivonen: ok, i saw an ongoing discussion which was forwarded to me

[03:52:01.0000] <aaronlev>
problem is sort of related to how trees or tree grids are structured and whether the whole thing is loaded at once

[03:53:00.0000] <aaronlev>
sometimes, some of the structure is missing 

[03:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
aaronlev: isn't it weird to have to update setsize in many places?

[03:53:02.0000] <aaronlev>
yes it's weird

[03:53:03.0000] <aaronlev>
ajax trees are weird

[03:53:04.0000] <aaronlev>
the structure is half gone

[03:54:00.0000] <aaronlev>
only the server knows the structure

[03:54:01.0000] <aaronlev>
but i agree we should look for a way to make it better

[03:57:00.0000] <aaronlev>
hsivonen ^

[03:58:00.0000] <aaronlev>
basically trees and treegrids are a case where there's often so much data on the server it's cruicial perf by only loading the visible lines, which could be anywhere in the middle

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aaronlev: I guess I don't know enough about ajax trees to see how there wouldn't be a container element to hand setsize onto

[03:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/hand/hang/

[03:59:02.0000] <aaronlev>
hsivonen: we should look at them again, maybe we can enforce that

[03:59:03.0000] <aaronlev>
i think in our case we're just dealing with how authors do things in JS

[04:00:00.0000] <aaronlev>
not what an ideal HTML widget would do

[04:00:01.0000] <aaronlev>
so, HTML would probably have a cleaner solution

[04:00:02.0000] <aaronlev>
aria is sometimes just accepting of the fact that it's applied to stuff after it was already coded, that a11y was an afterthought

[04:01:00.0000] <aaronlev>
but i'm definitely willing to help look at ways of making that better

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
search for "XSLT" in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-doctype and lower -- is it ok?

[04:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if an non-parser-inserted script element runs as the result of insertion and it itself inserts another script element that runs immediately, should control return to the first-mentioned script afterwards or should it die?

[04:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
why would it die?

[04:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it seems to die in the HTML5 Live DOM in Gecko

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
really? that's odd

[04:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I can't tell if it's my bug, Gecko bug or a platform feature

[04:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
testcase?

[04:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: hmm. might be my problem. I have to investigate more.

[04:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[04:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
bed time for me

[04:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "XSLT-generated"> WFM

[04:09:03.0000] <hsivonen>
nn

[04:10:00.0000] <annevk>
still seems silly to cater for XSLT, just output XML

[04:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: IE

[04:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"just output XML" isn't realistic

[04:11:01.0000] <annevk>
IE supporting XML at some point is realistic though

[04:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
XSLT users will need validation before that

[04:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
*way* before

[04:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
If IE supports XHTML before HTML5 goes to Rec, we can just remove that catering-for-XSLT feature

[04:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: at which point XSLT people would be angry at me for their stuff no longer validating

[04:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: That's their fault for relying on a draft spec

[04:14:01.0000] <annevk>
therefore it seems like a bad thing to add it now

[04:14:02.0000] <annevk>
oh well

[04:14:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: that's not really a tenable position when <video> is a killer feature happening long before REC

[04:15:00.0000] <annevk>
<video> doesn't work with XSLT anyway

[04:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: <video> does. <source> doesn't

[04:16:00.0000] <annevk>
<source> is sort of mandatory at this point

[04:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: <video src> should be just fine with XSLT

[04:16:02.0000] <annevk>
I know

[04:16:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: it isn't, if you are doing Ogg-only

[04:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: You just added <code titel="">

[04:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: what's the point of an RF codec on the authoring side if everyone makes an encumbered alternative anyway?

[04:18:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, dunno, we'll see how it goes I suppose

[04:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: "The same character as in item 8" - s/8/9/

[04:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Also, in "For the purposes of XSLT generators, which cannot output HTML markup without a DOCTYPE", maybe remove the comma because otherwise it's incorrectly suggesting that no XSLT generator is able to output HTML markup without a DOCTYPE

[04:21:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: you can fall back to .WAV!

[04:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
argh. the new tokenizer tweaks pushed the loop 8 bytes over the magic hotspot limit again (with ecj)

[04:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't think that would count as a valid technical reason to change the spec

[04:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I'm going to extract methods for errors

[04:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Isn't there a rarely-called chunk of code you could just split out into a separate method, to keep the main loop small?)

[04:42:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: so all the string formatting code won't count

[04:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: besides, I should do the null check for error handler *before* I format the error string

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, the error reporting code needs a much better localization story

[04:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: also, the spec change in this case was something I asked for

[04:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(and I could just not care about perf with ecj and only care about perf with javac)

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ecj does silly stuff like goto n; n: goto m

[05:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why did you go with <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "XSLT-generated"> instead of an emtpy string?

[05:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why does the spec give all the Unicode names for the characters in the DOCTYPE, but then only say "The literal string "XSLT-generated""?

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: why is XSLT-generated an ASCII-case-insensitive match when doctype quirkiness check is?

[05:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, nevermind, I guess it's because the XSLT-generated is case sensitive, whereas the rest of it isn't.

[05:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
*why isn't

[05:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
never mind. I added a case-sensitive check to my string portability layer

[05:29:00.0000] <hendry>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-mwts/2008Sep/0000.html # any suggestions for a test suite to do with mobiles?

[05:30:00.0000] <hendry>
now the http://www.w3.org/2008/06/mobile-test/ "Web Compatibility Test for Mobile Browsers" is done ...

[05:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: shouldn't mobiles be tested against the same suites as desktop browsers?

[05:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(except for CSS tests where the test assumes a wider viewport)

[05:32:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: yes, they should be really

[05:33:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: though i guess we're looking to highlight areas particularly lacking in mobiles

[05:34:00.0000] <hendry>
so there was earlier talk on "performance" testing, but i'm not so sure

[05:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder what the license for http://www.croczilla.com/svg/samples/lion/lion.svg is

[05:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: Maybe mobiles are lacking in <canvas> support? :-)

[05:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is tiger.eps under the GPL when obtained from GNU Ghostscript?

[05:51:00.0000] <hendry>
Philip`: there is canvas test already #14 http://www.w3.org/2008/06/mobile-test/doc.html  -- perhaps it can be improved?

[05:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: If the aim is to test that it's implemented entirely correctly, as opposed to simply being implemented at all, then I've got six hundred test cases for specific canvas features :-)

[05:56:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Philip`: The aim is to test whether various features are present, to determine whether a mobile browser is ready for the "one web", not just the "mobile web". The other six hundred tests for each feature is out of scope. (c:

[05:56:01.0000] <hendry>
well said wilhelm 

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Okay - as long as it doesn't encourage mobile browser developers to just provide minimal stub implementations of all those features, that sounds reasonable :-)

[05:59:00.0000] <wilhelm>
It would be possible to cheat, of course. Opera unintentionally cheats on the inputmode test. But where possible, the document links to relevant test suites.

[06:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wilhelm: how do you cheat? do you implement it per WF2 instead of XHTML Basic 2nd ed?

[06:03:00.0000] <wilhelm>
We support the feature in the browser core, so it's present in the DOM. But there is no UI for it, so it can't actually be used.

[06:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, this headers thread is going round in circles again. We already know scope isn't well supported today. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Sep/0046.html

[06:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/perf.html

[06:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
but it would be nice to get an experemental implementation of the smart headers algorithm in a browser which can be tested with an actual screen reader

[06:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Why would that be better than having an offline implementation, that can transform a table to just use @headers so that screen readers will get the same header associations as if they ran the more complicated algorithm?

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: why offline? greasemonkey could work

[06:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Ah, that's true, though it wouldn't help with IE-based screen readers

[06:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, to prove that even with the costly and long upgrade cycle of assistive technology, updating the browser it uses to provide the support is a workable solution

[06:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. it seems that the bottleneck with the Tiger in Gecko is DOM or painting, because TraceMonkey doesn't seem to make it faster

[06:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Ah, okay

[06:16:00.0000] <wilhelm>
hsivonen: Could you return the loading time on that page, for easy comparision between builds and browsers?

[06:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wilhelm: yeah. I'll improve it later. gotta go now

[06:56:00.0000] <hendry>
on the video topic; http://www.fsf.org/resources/formats/playogg and http://stephenfry.com/blog/?p=52 today

[06:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: doesn't play on page in minefield on Mac

[07:03:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: nightmare :/

[07:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: note how the FSF is using CC-by-nd here but not NC

[07:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, note how you're using that appeal to authority again! :-)

[07:13:00.0000] <annevk>
is there a MacBook Air next to him?

[07:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: as far as authorities go, Stephen Fry seems like a better celebrity endorser than Jerry Seinfeld :-)

[07:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I don't know who Stephen Fry is

[07:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
:-o

[07:32:00.0000] <gavin_>
seinfeld's much more popular here in the americas

[07:33:00.0000] <gavin_>
and in the australias too, I guess

[07:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: "The same character as in item 8" - s/8/9/

[07:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
I've heard of a TV show called "Seinfeld" and I can assume Jerry Seinfeld is related to that, but other than that I have no idea who he is

[07:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20080902#l-443 :-)

[07:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: that's the one. he'll promote Vista.

[07:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and the show Seinfeld has been gone for years but Fry is still shooting new stuff

[07:36:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: hah

[07:37:00.0000] <annevk>
the show Seinfeld is pretty awesome though

[07:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: sure

[07:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, what country are you from? How could you not know who Jerry Seinfeld i?

[07:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/i/is/

[07:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: England, where I assume it hasn't been shown much or if it has then I don't remember ever seeing it

[07:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
How could you not know who Stephen Fry is? :-p

[07:42:00.0000] <gavin_>
I think I recall seeing something with stephen fry in it

[07:42:01.0000] <gavin_>
or maybe I just found out about him after looking up hugh laurie

[07:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
Blackadder?

[07:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, Australians get a lot more American TV shows than English shows

[07:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
English TV is largely limited to being broadcast on the ABC, which is far less popular than the 3 commercial TV networks

[07:44:01.0000] <gavin_>
never heard of "blackadder"

[07:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
He narrated the UK editions of the Harry Potter audiobooks too, but I don't know how many other countries use the UK rather than US version (or do they have their own new version?)

[07:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: was Stephen Fry in Blackadder? Hugh Laurie was

[07:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Wikipedia says he was, so it must be true

[07:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also it has a photo of him in it, which is quite convincing)

[07:46:01.0000] <hendry>
Fry is prolific. His books are great too.

[07:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ah right. fourth season

[07:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is surprised to learn that English TV isn't big in Australia

[07:48:00.0000] <gavin_>
/me too

[07:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me can only actually remember watching one episode of Blackadder, and that was in a history lesson at school

[07:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: you had good history material at school :-)

[07:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but at least I've seen all of QI)

[07:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
We watched The Matrix in a maths lesson too

[07:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. that sounds questionable

[08:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'd heard of Blackadder, and I'm pretty sure it was aired in Australia, but I never watched it, probably because I was too young to be interested in it when it came out

[08:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
"The Black Adder was the first series of Blackadder and was written by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson, and produced by John Lloyd. The series was originally aired on BBC 2 from 1983-06-15 to 20 July, 1983, and was a joint production with the Australian Seven Network."

[08:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
I didnt' know it was jointly produced by channel 7

zcorpan, I know. I spoke to marcos about it last night

[08:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: ok

[08:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
if you have any suggestions for who to interview and what topic, let me know

[08:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
how about svg?

[08:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, maybe I could interview Erik D about it

[08:30:01.0000] <annevk>
isn't zcorpan closer to ed?

[08:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i am

[08:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, is he in Sweden?

[08:31:02.0000] <annevk>
yes

[08:31:03.0000] <Lachy>
I thought he was in Oslo

[08:31:04.0000] <annevk>
no

[08:31:05.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, are you able to do it?

[08:31:06.0000] <annevk>
(the reason for the break was simply vacation)

[08:31:07.0000] <annevk>
(i tell myself)

[08:31:08.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: dunno, don't have a camera for one

[08:31:09.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[08:31:10.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, ed has a MacBook, should work

[08:31:11.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: ah

[08:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i could ask if he's up for it

[08:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, as long as he as either QuickTime Pro or iMovie

[08:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
we should be able to get several interviews done when I go to Web Directions and then there's TPAC soon

[08:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders if any signficant amount of AT software will support @scope by the time of HTML6...

[08:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, AIUI, it depends on what the browser reports through the accessibility API, so if the browser supports it, it should be able to report the necessary info. But I could be wrong.

[08:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Then why are people saying AT don't support it, rather than browsers?

[08:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not like scope is used much outside of accessibility APIs

[08:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know. I could be completely wrong

[08:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
but that seems to be the way ARIA works, cause the browser sees the attributes and then reports to the AT what something is based on that. Apparently, ATs don't access the DOM directly, they do everything through teh accessibility API

[09:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: they do some things by accessing the dom

[09:04:01.0000] <zcorpan>
aiui

[09:04:02.0000] <zcorpan>
but they already have code that acts on the accessibility api

[09:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so it's less work for AT vendors if the browser does the mapping

[09:12:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, damn, there's another character to turn into U+FFFD at the inputstream stage

[09:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could treat it as a fatal error instead

[09:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
that's got the same implementation cost, more-or-less

[09:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
perhaps one day we'll report errors for non-Name tags

[09:15:01.0000] <takkaria>
in Hubbub, the inputstream just passes a UTF-8 stream of characters with no filtering, and U+0000 is handled in the same way as any other character would be, it just generally inserts U+FFFDs around the place

[09:16:00.0000] <takkaria>
though all I need to do is change "c == '\0'" to "c == '\0' || c == '\x0b'" for the most part

[09:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, would talking about Google Chrome in a standardssuck episode be on topic, even though it's a browser, not a standard?

[09:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, maybe if we focuss on their standards support. I wonder if google gears has implemented the HTML5 api yet

[09:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Wait a few hours, then it should be clearer how much they diverge from WebKit

[09:33:00.0000] <myakura_>
/me wondering if they use JavaScriptCore for V8

[09:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
myakura_: The API, or the implementation?

[09:48:00.0000] <myakura_>
Philip`: meant the latter, but if to know about both is fine :)

Sundar now asking the question, Why did we choose WebKit?

[12:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Because building on Trident would be a really bad idea?

[12:15:00.0000] <jcranmer>
how about Tasman?

[12:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
he's talking about V8 now

[12:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

[12:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is it "V8" as in "V8 engine", or is it stupid txt-speak for "vate"?

[12:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
(me hopes somebody asks whether it's faster than Squirrelfish... or least if it has a better logo (which I highly doubt))

[12:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it faster than SquirrelFish?

[12:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is it faster than TraceMonkey?

[12:18:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: The image was an engine, so probably the former

[12:18:03.0000] <Philip`>
Is it faster than JScript.NET?

[12:18:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it faster than C?

[12:18:05.0000] <Philip`>
Is it faster than God?

wow! Resizing tabs! Groundbreaking!

[12:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me has a grand total of one browser window, so there's nowhere to drag tabs to

[12:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No, just reordering them within a window

[12:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Reordering tabs within a window is quite substantially unexciting

[12:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Thus the "ho hum"

[12:52:00.0000] <roc>

the big deal about V8 is apparently that it compiles all the way to machine code (but Tracemonkey also does that)

[12:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I'd guess that's mainly down to the limits of V8

if they're talking about Google employees, they're in the Seattle Kirkland

[12:55:01.0000] <roc>
that's where Google set up an office to catch escaping Microsoft employees

Hmph, found a bug in Canvex: if the framerate exceeds 100, the FPS counter breaks :-(

[12:55:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Was that with chrome?

[12:55:04.0000] <LarsYngve>
Kirkland should be renamed Kirk Kirkwood

[12:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Yes

[12:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: (Safari might be the same; I don't remember testing it recently)

[12:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
Chrome doesn't have canvas.getImageData :-(

[12:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: dhyatt said in #webkit he thinks it's Saf3.1 WebKit

[12:57:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder if they're using apple's canvas or they made their own

[12:57:02.0000] <LarsYngve>
or Curt Kirkwood

[12:58:00.0000] <virtuelv>
anyone tried benchmarking yet?

[12:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
#chronium

[12:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: It doesn't seem to be using Apple's Windows CG port, so I guess it's doing something a bit different to work on Windows

[12:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Apparently it is Saf3.1 WebKit, though

There's an Inspector, that shows you the DOM tree and styles and stuff, and the times and sizes of downloaded resources - is that new or is that from WebKit?

[13:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: WebKit

[13:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
The tab-close button is too small

[13:08:01.0000] <mal>
inspector is webkit

[13:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, the Task Manager has a "Stats for nerds" link

hey, looks like Google forgot to make the videos about google chrome public http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/features.html

[13:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
youtube is blocking access

[13:54:00.0000] <aaronlev>
looks like bugzilla isn't being used much to track HTML 5 issues

[13:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's used

[13:54:02.0000] <aaronlev>
i only see 15 issues open

[13:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah most of the issues are in e-mail at http://whatwg.org/issues/

[13:54:04.0000] <aaronlev>
ok

[13:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
and because i tend to close the bugzilla ones quicker than e-mail

[13:55:01.0000] <aaronlev>
how is bugzilla working out

[13:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
pretty good for me

[13:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
but then i knew it already

[13:55:04.0000] <aaronlev>
right

[13:56:00.0000] <aaronlev>
i want to have ARIA implementor guidelines use that

[13:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[13:57:00.0000] <aaronlev>
it's not the ARIA spec -- it's the doc i started to describe what user agents need to do

[13:57:01.0000] <aaronlev>
if exposing to platform APIs

[13:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
sounds like a spec to me :-P

[13:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
what's the ARIA spec if not the document that says what uas should do?

[13:57:04.0000] <aaronlev>
well, it deals with a lot of platform issues

[13:58:00.0000] <aaronlev>
eventually they will fold in parts of it to the ARIA spec

[13:58:01.0000] <aaronlev>
but for now it's a smaller group of just browser developers working on it so we can go faster

[13:58:02.0000] <aaronlev>
it's something we should use for HTML

[13:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[13:58:04.0000] <aaronlev>
e.g. how to expose HTML via MSAA

[13:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, sounds useful. keep me in the loop

[13:58:06.0000] <aaronlev>
sure

[13:59:00.0000] <aaronlev>
it's a wiki, you can subscribe to see changes

:)

[14:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm giving up on that video accessibility thread. I don't know how else to explain that there's no need to provide alt text for a poster frame, when what is really needed is a brief summary of the video content or at least an indication of its topic

[14:19:00.0000] <hober>
(which should be in the markup surrounding <video> anyway...)

[14:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, either that or its title attribute

[14:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
The way Leif keeps going, he's making it seem as if the poster frame and the video represent 2 different things, which is just silly

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, chrome is causing acidtests.org (and thus whatwg.org) to get hammered

[14:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
but at least this time the server is staying up!

[14:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
it just isn't responding to http traffic

[14:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
hah.

[14:24:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Silly Hixie, you of all people should've seen this coming :)

[14:24:05.0000] <Hixie>
i did

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
when firefox came out the server crashed and burnt

[14:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
this time the server is happily up

[14:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
just not responding to http traffic because apache's out of ports

[14:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
which is fine by me

[14:25:04.0000] <gsnedders>
This is all putting me off the schoolwork I should be doing

[14:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
since it means i can still check e-mail, work on html5, etc

[14:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
All browsers should come with a pre-cached copy of the Acid tests, to avoid the pointless server load when ten thousand people run precisely the same test case against precisely the same browser code

[14:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[14:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thinks it's peculiar for Hixie to argue that changing implementations is easier than changing specifications

[14:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Changing specs are a pain in the ass. I agree.

[14:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
I tested google chrome with my local copy of acid3, and only scored 77

[14:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Saf3.1 has some odd bugs that make it inconsistent

[14:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Safari 3 is scoring 75 for me and safari 4 developer preview is scoring 100%

[14:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
Official Build 1583Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.149.27 Safari/525.13

[14:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
Safari 3: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_4; en-au) AppleWebKit/525.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.2 Safari/525.20.1

[14:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
so the webkit in Google Chrome is slightly older than that

[14:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: for an end user, it is

[14:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: for an end programmer, i should say

[14:40:02.0000] <hallvors>
/me admits he just loaded Acid2 in Chrome ..

[14:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: 525.13 seems to be the Windows build

[14:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yeah chrome forked off webkit a few months ago

[14:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: they'll sync again soon

[14:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
eseidel was saying he was working on syncing it up

[14:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[14:42:02.0000] <eseidel>
*long* ago

[14:42:03.0000] <eseidel>
our webkit is like from january

[14:42:04.0000] <eseidel>
or whenever 3.1.1 forked

[14:42:05.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, since you work at google, have you seen any internal builds before now?

[14:42:06.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[14:42:07.0000] <eseidel>
Hixie sorrta walls himself off in some other building

[14:43:00.0000] <eseidel>
sadly, we never really see him :( (those of us who work on actual browser stuff)

[14:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
A big wall to stop him shouting at you?

[14:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'd have played with it more if it was a mac browser :-P

[14:43:03.0000] <eseidel>
probably

[14:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
running it in a VM is a pain in the ass

[14:43:05.0000] <Lachy>
eseidel, do you work at google too?

[14:43:06.0000] <eseidel>
yes

[14:43:07.0000] <Hixie>
eseidel is google's webkit team

[14:44:00.0000] <eseidel>
ha

[14:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok

[14:44:02.0000] <eseidel>
in many ways true :)

[14:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me installs chrome into his non-secret VM and deletes his secret VM

[14:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: So you have no more über-c00l non-existing software?

[14:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
is hixie.ch and whatwg.org all on the same server as acid3.acidtests.org ?

[14:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yes

[14:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's all on hixie.dreamhost.com

[14:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i wish chrome had smooth scrolling

[14:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
you need more servers

[14:46:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me chants: Hixie! Hixie! Hixie!…

[14:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: right now i don't pay for them

[14:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: so if you can find me another free server... :-)

[14:46:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Doesn't your employee have a server or two?

[14:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
*employer, even

[14:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I am _not_ your slave!

[14:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
how do you get free hosting from dreamhost?

[14:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i doubt i'll work for google my whole life

[14:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: the referral bonuses i get balance out the costs

[14:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Dreamhost likely won't stay in business for your whole life, so you'll have to migrate your server anyway

[14:48:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, nice

[14:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
I have an effectively free host with asmallorange.com

[14:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Stop spamming us, please! I've heard you try and get us sign up often enough!

[14:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
but it has montly bandwidth and storage limiatations

[14:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: dreamhost has so far outlasted one of my employment terms

[14:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: (i.e. i'm glad i didn't host acid2 or whatwg on opera servers)

[14:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why would that be a problem? I'm pretty sure Opera is still around

[14:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
Would they have revoked your right to host it there after you left?

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt it would have been as simple as doing nothing

[14:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
OMG! even though you gave Julian what (s)he wanted with the XSLT-generated doctype, he's still not happy

[14:53:01.0000] <hober>
yeah, just responded to that (to www-archive; didn't want to waste list time with it)

[14:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
FWIW, I really hope Julian takes the issue to the XSLT WG and gets them to provide a way to output <!DOCTYPE html>, and then hopefully we can drop this XSLT-generated nonsense before well before HTML5 is done

[14:56:00.0000] <hober>
agreed

[15:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
I really don't like how google chrome copied IE's address bar feature that renders the domain in black and path in grey

[15:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
it makes reading it harder

[15:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
I can't find a way to turn it off either

[15:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, Requiem 1.7.4 has been released

[15:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
what does it change?

[15:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
not sure yet. I'll find it and see

[15:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
i won't bother upgrading unless it stops working

[15:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4374326/Requiem_1.7.4_iTunes_DRM_Remover

[15:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I guess, since you don't have the i18n problem, it's probably not worth it yet

[15:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I'll get it anyway cause I like to have the latest

[15:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm done dealing with julian

[15:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
i try to help him and he just acts like an ass

[15:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
does anybody other than julian actually care about this XSLT thing?

[15:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess jirka does

[15:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
he was nice about it

[15:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i'll leave it in

[15:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Didn't it turn out Julian wasn't using XSLT, but something else?

[15:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, Julian using using javax.xml.transform

[15:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
don't ask me why he's using an XML library to serialise HTML though

[15:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If only Russell was here, he'd tell us he was using a teapot to seralize HTML

[15:30:00.0000] <annevk>
making everyone upgrade to a non-IE browser or getting IE fixed is the real solution for these people

[15:30:01.0000] <annevk>
they don't like HTML anyway

[15:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Speaking of XHTML (kinda): Was there ever an official ruling on whether appendix C applies to 1.1?

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
didn't the xhtml2 group come up with some new xhtml1.x that had a new appendix c or something?

[15:35:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: isn't that what the new media types draft is partly about?

[15:35:01.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, they're working on that, yes

[15:35:02.0000] <webben>
providing guidance on how to serve xhtml 1.1 as text/html?

[15:35:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I know they're working on stuff relating to it, I'm just wondering about the current 1.1

[15:35:04.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, the second edition of 1.1 would say that

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me puts on his Firefox t-shirt to emphasise his vendor-neutralness

[15:38:00.0000] <annevk>
you sort of lost that position now

[15:38:01.0000] <annevk>
strike "sort of"

[15:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You need to where five shirts at once, really

[15:38:03.0000] <annevk>
hah, as if we'd be fooled by free t-shirts!

[15:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: well, html5 started while i was at opera, so i'm sure i'll live

[15:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so your best bet is to hope Chrome remains under 1% market share

[15:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. off to work i go.

[15:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[15:40:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Hmm... the latest second editon draft says SHOULD text/html or application/xhtml+xml, but refers to XMLMIME which says SHOULD NOT on text/html for 1.1

[15:40:03.0000] <annevk>
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/ has a huge team

[15:40:04.0000] <annevk>
and suspiciously there's no source code link

[15:41:00.0000] <svl>
src lives here: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/

[15:41:01.0000] <svl>
or at least the browser of - there's a tarball as well, iirc

[15:42:00.0000] <annevk>
so googlechrome.* are not Google owned after all, hmm

[15:48:00.0000] <annevk>
heh, "Rietveld", apparently Guido van Rossum names projects after Dutch artists

[15:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"XHTML documents served as 'text/html' will not be processed as XML [XML10], e.g. well-formedness errors may not be detected by user agents."

[15:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
They say that like it's a bad thing

[15:50:00.0000] <csarven>
Which is also misleading

[15:51:00.0000] <csarven>
<div monkey<see="> monkey do</div> <--- How would GRE, WebKit or Presto handle this?

[15:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks a see element as a child of a div element

[15:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But I'm guessing :P

[15:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's not a well-formedness error, though. That's a batshit-insane-author error.

[15:59:00.0000] <takkaria>
IIRC it would be a div with a silly attribute and no children

[16:06:00.0000] <annevk>
takkaria is correct

[16:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm. why is the empty string not allowed as id?

[16:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
seems convenient to say elm.id = '' instead of elm.removeAttribute('id')

[16:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Jirka brings up a scary point about XSLT-generated

[16:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Wasn't it XSLT-compatible at some point?

[16:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen suggested XSLT-compat

[16:12:01.0000] <hober>
I'd prefer something intentionally meaningless and hideously ugly

[16:13:00.0000] <hober>
like <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "f9601f618c1c7a5821c5a4368bd20a17">

[16:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"I am a muppet who uses XSLT to generate HTML" would never make it to REC

whee, google chrome crashing

[16:22:00.0000] <takkaria>
though it's quite cool how it didn't take down the browser

[16:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder if they left a few crashers unfixed just so people would see the effect

[16:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you want to see chrome crashing, just go to about:crash

hmm doesn't work so well with history

[17:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, it's missing the CC-by-nc-nd notice

[17:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I also put up a copy of the comic yesterday, though I didn't get creative enough to make easily browsable yet. http://lachy.id.au/dev/2008/google-chrome/

[17:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: copied your notice

[17:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
I updated http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About_URI_scheme#Google_Chrome-specific_about:_addresses with the about:crash thing

[17:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
are there any others?

[17:19:03.0000] <Lachy>
about: uri schemes?

[17:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
about:memory

[17:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
about:

[17:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's about:hang iirc

[17:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
something like that

[17:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
to test the hanging protection

[17:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
about:hang didn't work

[17:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's one something like that

[17:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
look in the source :-)

[17:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
about: isn't google chrome specific

about:memory, about:crash and the about:hang one whatever it's called are

[17:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
about:internets is pretty funny

[17:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
didn't know about that one

[17:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
pretty good demo of the chrome technology though

[17:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
shows how it works much like the screen saver control panel

[17:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't show up in the task manager though

uh

don't believe the issues graph

as sweet as it would be to have dropped to just 97 e-mails...

[17:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, it's swamped by requests for acid3

what's the new lines on the issues graph represent?

[17:56:03.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, yt?

[17:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria: the script that collects the data crashed due to the load (i assume) and didn't count all the e-mails

[17:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
comment spammers are getting sneaky. I just noticed this comment on JohnResig's blog, and I have one saying exactly the same thing with the same URI, but with a different name http://ejohn.org/blog/google-chrome-process-manager/#comment-320147

[17:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
it's sitting in my blog moderation queue. I almost approved it till I saw that

[17:58:02.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: yeah, it's real weird

[17:58:03.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, I recommend you delete it from yours

I wonder if the about:internets thing also shows random teapots, like the real screensaver

i'm getting very tired of dealing with the rudeness in public-html

[18:04:01.0000] <takkaria>
stevef I find consistently quite rude thesedays

[18:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't even get what "kill your babies" is supposed to mean?!

[18:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno but if somebody said that on the whatwg list they'd get banned pretty quick.

[18:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
(for a week)

[18:10:00.0000] <takkaria>
stevef said something about jgraham "squealing like a pig" recently, which is the most outright rude I've seen anyone be for a while

[18:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
"stuck pig", I think

wtf

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2008Aug/0154.html

[18:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love how they just want the spec to say something and have absolutely no care in the world for actually checking whether it makes sense

[18:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You mean sense isn't defined by what they want?

[18:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The meaning of "stuck" in that phrase seems quite archaic - the only place I vaguely remember the word 'stick' being used in that way was probably written by Tolkien)

[18:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Isn't it the same stick as in 'stick it to them'?

[18:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
(as in "I'll stick you" and so on)

[18:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I don't think so, in either of the ways that phrase could be interpreted

[18:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I think that phrase could be like "stick it to the police" or like "stick it to the wall")

[18:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I think I remembered mostly rightly

[18:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
"'Who says there's bad news?' shouted the soldier. / 'Ar! Who says there isn't?' / 'That's cursed rebel-talk, and I'll stick you, if you don't shut it down, see?'"

[18:37:00.0000] <takkaria>
Chrome is indeed pretty usable.  firefox should adopt showing history in the awesomebar results, it's more useful than I thought it would be

[18:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Will it still be useful when you have more than a few hours of history, and it's zillions of entries long?

[18:38:00.0000] <takkaria>
depends how well it scales

[18:38:01.0000] <takkaria>
er, fierfox already does it, actually, doesn't it?

[18:38:02.0000] <gavin_>
takkaria: hmm? firefox does show history in the awesomebar

[18:39:00.0000] <takkaria>
I appear to be being clueless today, please ignore me :)

[18:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
takkaria, Firefox does show navigation history in its awesome bar

[18:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I should have read gavin_'s message first. Please ignore me too ;-)

[18:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
woah, wikipedia is claiming Google Chrome fails acid2 because the page reflows when resizing the window http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#User_interface

[18:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll delete it cause reflowing isn't a bug

[18:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
lol

[18:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
"as a result it fails to fully adhere with existing webstandards"

[18:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's pretty awesome in so many ways

whoever wrote that should check the other browsers too :-)

[18:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool, pumping up the CPU allocation on hixie.dreamhost.com made it more responsive

/me begins the long and arduous task of merging the forms stuff into html5

[19:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, Google Chrome is randomly failing tests 26 and 27 in acid3. Is there any reason it shouldn't be consistent with those?

[19:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
Test 26 failed: e2 - parent element doesn't exist after looping

[19:03:02.0000] <Lachy>
Test 27 failed: e2 - parent element doesn't exist after waiting

[19:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks at the test

[19:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh that's the GC test

[19:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
GC is inherently unpredictable

[19:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
does that mean that it's getting incorrectly garbage collected?

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
i believe so

[19:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd have to make a test case to be sure

[19:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's probably either a v8 bug or something that'll be fixed when they sync to webkit tot

[19:08:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[19:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
so is it failing in test 26, and then that causes 27 to fail automatically?

[19:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
probably

[19:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't debugged it to be sure

[19:09:03.0000] <Lachy>
that's what it looks like, since it's the same error and appears to be the same variable it's checking

[19:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders why his setup doesn't have libgtk-x11 and wonders how to get it so he can upgrade from this mess of firefox2 to firefox3 which at some point suddenly started requiring libgtk-x11

[19:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL, the Incognito mode warnings are funny:

[19:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
Test 26 failed: e2 - parent element doesn't exist after looping

[19:18:02.0000] <Lachy>
Test 27 failed: e2 - parent element doesn't exist after waiting

[19:18:03.0000] <Lachy>

i wonder why we added <form accept>

[19:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me drops <form accept> for now

[19:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually i think i'm going to first spec only the basics and omit most of the new stuff (other than the new <input type>s and validation)

[19:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess <form name> is useful with document.forms

[19:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, probably because when you specced it, WF2 was a delta spec and <form accept> is in HTML4, and you just defined how it was supposed to be handled

[19:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh.

[19:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
so it is

[19:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
well

[19:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's evidence that i'm not biased against html4 and like my own stuff!

[19:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it was retarded even when i thought i'd invented it!

[19:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
you were right, it is retarded :-)

[19:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
does any browser support <input accept="">?

[19:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
or are we still hoping that some browser might implement it?

[19:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
i've just dropped it

[19:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
or "not added" it, to be precise

[19:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
unless Opera added it as part of its WF2 stuff

[19:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't have a build of Opera handy, so I'll have to check tomorrow if I remember

[19:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
does it even implement <input type=file accept>?

[19:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know, that's what I was wondering

[19:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not going to do the form and select seeding at the moment

[19:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
(they were only added for xforms parity, and don't seem to have really caught people's attention)

[19:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, i've done the green summary box for <form> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-form

[19:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, shouldn't it be in the Flow content category?

[19:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
uh yes

[19:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
that was copied from the <Div> element

[19:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is apparently also broken

[19:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
regenning

[19:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
why is onsubmit="" included as a global attribute, rather than a form specific attribute?

[19:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
all event attributes are global in html5

[19:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
what about onreset? That's allowed on HTML4 <form>, but not listed in HTML5

[19:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
simplifies implementations, makes it easier to catch bubbling events wherever convenient

[19:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
the list in html5 is woefully incomplete

[19:41:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[19:41:05.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't really tried making it complete yet

[19:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. all the media events are missing

[19:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, I can't believe Karl's suggestion to use standards mode without a DOCTYPE?!

[21:20:00.0000] <kingryan>
hsivonen: you around?

[22:27:00.0000] <kingryan>
Hixie: are you around?

[22:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
yo

[22:28:00.0000] <kingryan>
i have  parsing question

[22:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
shoot

[22:28:02.0000] <kingryan>
with content model PCDATA and input "</br/>"

[22:28:03.0000] <kingryan>
it seems that a parse error should be triggered

[22:28:04.0000] <kingryan>
and we have a tests that says so, but I can't figure out how

[22:29:00.0000] <kingryan>
instead i just get an end-tag

[22:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
what parse mode?

[22:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
or is "</br/> all the input?

[22:31:02.0000] <kingryan>
fragment

[22:31:03.0000] <kingryan>
with that as the entire input

[22:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
with what element as context?

[22:31:05.0000] <kingryan>
div

[22:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok let's see

[22:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
gah

[22:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can't handle chrome's lack of smooth scrolling to read the html5 spec

[22:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me goes back to safari

[22:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok so insertion mode becomes "in body"

[22:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
you get a parse error in response to the "br" end tag

[22:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
you then pretend you got a "br" start tag

[22:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
that creates a <br>

[22:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
you then get another parse error because the self-closing flag wasn't acknowledged

[22:35:01.0000] <kingryan>
hmm, i'm only running the tokenizer right now

[22:35:02.0000] <kingryan>
maybe that's the problem

[22:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
then you stop parsing

[22:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[22:35:05.0000] <Hixie>
well

[22:35:06.0000] <Hixie>
with just the tokeniser you get no parse errors

[22:35:07.0000] <kingryan>
that's what I thought

[22:36:00.0000] <kingryan>
i just wanted to be sure, before I blamed excors for checking in a bad test

[22:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wouldn't recommend implementing or testing the tokenizer as a separate object from the tree construction stage, to be honest; there are a number of optimisations that involve blurring the line

[22:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
the distinction is artificial

[22:38:02.0000] <kingryan>
yeah, that's probably a good idea

[22:38:03.0000] <kingryan>
but as it is, the tests in html5lib are separate

[22:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
the tests in html5lib that test just the tokenizer are specific to html5lib's tokenizer, then :-)

[22:39:01.0000] <kingryan>
i suppose

[22:39:02.0000] <kingryan>
its nice to be able to test the lower levels of the stack (tokenizer) independently

[22:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders whether to spec the summary blocks for the other form elements first, or to go into detail for <form> first

[22:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
i guess

[22:39:05.0000] <Hixie>
seems dodgy to me though

[22:40:00.0000] <kingryan>
since a lot of errors at higher levels get disguised

[22:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean the two bits are tightly related

[22:40:02.0000] <kingryan>
i agree

[22:40:03.0000] <kingryan>
full separation is a pipe-dream

[22:40:04.0000] <kingryan>
but at least basic tokenization can be tested independently

[00:01:00.0000] <Hixie>

err, no, just horribly slow

[00:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
today

[00:47:02.0000] <virtuelv>
yeah

[00:47:03.0000] <virtuelv>
shame I couldn't get it to work in WINE

[00:49:00.0000] <virtuelv>
especially since I don't have compatible virtualbox modules

[01:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
so do we want to keep the form="" attribute?

[01:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
and if so, do we want to keep it on <fieldset>?

[01:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
seems weird for fieldset to be associated with a form

[01:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
what does that mean?

[01:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: yes we do :)

[01:15:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: but maybe not on fieldset, dunno

[01:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess maybe it makes sense if you want to be able to hook into the onformchange or onforminput events

[01:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: his point is good in the sense that it does suck that something as trivial as void elements requires updates as HTML adds stuff

[01:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
"waah"

[01:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's a one line fix per new void element

[01:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
and they come at the rate of what, one a year on average?

[01:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
give me a break

[01:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yes and yes

[01:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
we could try to get e.g. Genshi to update and see how easy it is to do upgrade evangelism with a library that isn't bound by the XSLT spec

[01:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm tired of people whining about their minor inconveniences when we have people writing entirely new browser features (video, canvas, etc), validators, god knows what

[01:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm annoyed that the JDK keeps ballooning up with frozen code instead of the JDK being very lean and people updating their 3rd-party libs early and often

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder why so few sites use fieldset

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
how about multiple forms per control

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
can we throw that overboard?

[01:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
multiple forms per control?

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
<input form="a b">

[01:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
<form id=a>

[01:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
<form id=b>

[01:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
wf2 has that supposedly

[01:45:00.0000] <annevk>
/me hopes the html5lib tokenizer tests don't impose html5lib specifics to other implementations

[01:46:00.0000] <jmb>
annevk: I don't think they do

[01:47:00.0000] <annevk>
well, I'm specifically concerned about implementations trying to match our architecture, but that's prolly far fetched

[01:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I'll complain if you start testing something implmentation-specific

[01:48:01.0000] <jmb>
as will takkaria/I :)

[01:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jmb: are you working on Hubbub, too?

[01:49:01.0000] <jmb>
hsivonen: I started it :)

[01:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. nice

[01:51:00.0000] <annevk>
good :)

[01:54:00.0000] <wilhelm>

[01:54:01.0000] <wilhelm>

/me wonders what data Chrome sends to Google

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
apparently merely typing an URL leaks the URL to Google as a search term

[02:06:00.0000] <annevk>
quite a bit, from what I read yesterday on the privacy page

[02:07:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/privacy.html has the info on that

[02:07:01.0000] <Hixie>

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
the next fucking acid test is going to be 512 bytes long and a single file

[02:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
my server can't handle this load

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
though on the plus side, with the limits i got dreamhost to set on the apache server, at least the machine itself hasn't gone down at all

[02:12:00.0000] <jruderman>
you had to help dreamhost make their server not crash due to your site?

[02:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
dreamhost's default configuration overtaxes the server under heavy load

[02:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i told them how to fix it but i got the impression they didn't deploy the fix

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i did get them to fix it in a hardcoded way just for my server

[02:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
basically my server is limited to 75 connections at a time

[02:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
so even under max load, the machine won't even blink and i can still check my e-mail and edit the site, etc

[02:13:04.0000] <Lachy>
I'm looking for sites that break when forced to render in standards mode instead of quirks mode, but it seems every site I visit frequently is already in standards mode.

[02:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
... why can't we go back to the way it was where no-one but the early adopters used standards mode? It'd make this easier

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
just go down the list of sites on reddit

I should update my doctype page to cover Opera 9.5 and Chrome

[02:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
did Konqueror go from 3.3 to 3.5 or was there a 3.4?

[02:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
apparently there was

[02:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
though it probably doesn't matter, since distro updates force Konq updates onto KDE users

[02:23:00.0000] <jgraham>

ooh. Google Maps finally has walking directions

[02:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wants those for GMM

[02:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wants a way to move locations between Google Maps instances...

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. walking directions beta sucks for Mandelieu

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i believe walking directions suck for a lot of places

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
though at least it's not as bad as it was before we released it

[02:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
where it would make you walk down highways

[02:29:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, "I think rowspan and colspan can work the same in both (as specced in HTML5)." hmm, HTML5 doesn't do layout

[02:29:01.0000] <annevk>
cycling directions would've been more useful for me, but maybe they overlap enough

[02:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
GregHouston: yeah that wouldn't work for acid tests

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>

I want cycling+public transport dirctions for bay area

[02:37:00.0000] <KevinMarks>
and tube+walk for london

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah just public transport with the minimum walking speed increased a bit and the maximum walking distance increased a bit would be nice

[02:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
we already have a non-Ajaxy service for public transport + walking in Helsinki area, but it doesn't integrate with GPS

[02:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>

Hixie: google maps still has you park on highways

[02:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
well it doesn't do parking

[02:44:03.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. snfc.fr seems to have totally missed the point that the core use case is searching for schedules and booking tickets

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
it gets you from an address to an address

[02:45:01.0000] <jruderman>
the directions to the mozilla office abruptly end at 'merge onto 101N'

[02:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
sncf that is

[02:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
woah

[02:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's a bug

[02:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
wtf

[02:45:06.0000] <Hixie>
/me files a bug

[02:46:00.0000] <jruderman>
thanks :)

[02:46:01.0000] <jruderman>
of course, now i'm going to come to you whenever i find a non-security bug in google software, since everywhere else seems to be a black hole

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
feel free

[02:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What about that chrome crasher, is that fixed yet? :)

[02:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jruderman: you haven't heard about the gracious new mozilla office hosting in the middle of 101?

[02:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
very convenient and very generous of Google I say

[02:51:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: the walking directions from my house to google are similarly busted -- it doesn't realize i have to cross the freeway to get there

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
uri?

[02:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
walking directions in general aren't too hot right now

[02:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
they're still beta

[02:53:00.0000] <jruderman>
it also doesn't know the shortcut through the grass and trees just north of rengstorff&101, but i can forgive it for that ;)

"Take the hidden passage behind the bookshelf to the rear garden."

[02:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: that's transit, not walking :-)

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
but the bug is the same as the car bug

[02:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
we're geocoding the landings drive address wrongly

[02:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Try http://www.google.com

[02:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh i see what the problem is

[02:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
That gets broken layout if it's in standards mode

[02:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
people have "edited" the location of that address so that it is no longer on landings drive

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
and the map data doesn't have the car park as a driveable area

[03:04:00.0000] <jruderman>
don't you have an AI that can look at an aerial photograph and tell you which sections look like parking lots? ;)

[03:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, google.com doesn't noticably break in standards mode

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: google doesn't comment on future products and services

[03:05:02.0000] <jruderman>
bah :P

[03:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It does for me, in Opera - the "Advanced Search, Preferences, Language Tools" box gets totally misaligned

[03:07:01.0000] <jruderman>
Lachy: mozilla gets some bug reports that we resolve as INVALID because the page has a strict doctype, would work in quirks mode, but doesn't work in standards mode. a lot of them involve DOM differences rather than layout differences.

[03:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, ok. that's just a minor break

[03:08:00.0000] <jruderman>
when javascript on a page breaks, it's usually a major break

[03:09:00.0000] <jruderman>
well, if we hear about the breakage, at least

[03:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: a public beta might be more effective if the UI had a link to a bug tracker

[03:13:00.0000] <annevk>
like on http://validator.nu/ ? :)

[03:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: good point

[03:14:00.0000] <jruderman>
“Validation” and “validator” in the name and the user interface of the service refer to the ISO/IEC FDIS 19757-2 definition of “validator” (which performs validation), to the Schematron “validation” function (which is performed by a validator), and to the HTML 5 definition of “validator”.

[03:14:01.0000] <jruderman>
what the heck is that trying to say?

[03:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jruderman: it's saying "SGML old timers, please don't email me telling what a validator is"

[03:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I could move that to the FAQ section

[03:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
*F* AQ?

[03:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: maybe, though in practice we get most of what we need from beta from our logs. it's actually surprisingly easy to find out what the bugs are by looking for trends in how people are using the service

[03:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: more F than the others in the FAQ, sadly

[03:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
I thought frequently asked questions would be more along the lines of "my page doesn't validate! what do I do?"

[03:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Your site doesn't display google properly when I enter google.com"

[03:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the about page getting old in general

[03:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it was written for XML-oriented early adopters with special needs

[03:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
not for casual HTML5 authors

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how many people use the fancy XML-oriented features, compared to the HTML5 features

[03:25:00.0000] <annevk>
at some point html5.validator.nu and validator.nu should be flipped too, imo

[03:25:01.0000] <jruderman>
hsivonen: when i enter google.com (and get google.fi) it says "Using windows-1252 instead of the declared encoding iso-8859-1." what does that mean?

[03:26:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe validator.nu and validator.nu/advanced

[03:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jruderman: It means that the bytes were decoded according to Windows-1252 (for reality and HTML5 compliance), but the page declared itself as ISO-8859-1

[03:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jruderman: you get .fi, because validator.nu is hosted in Finland and Google tries to be smart

[03:26:03.0000] <jruderman>
hsivonen: what about the page made the validator decide to decode the bytes according to windows-1252?

[03:27:00.0000] <jruderman>
i guess i should grep the spec for 'iso-8859-1'

[03:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jruderman: the HTML5 spec says that when the page says ISO-8859-1, it must be decoded as Windows-1252

[03:27:02.0000] <annevk>
iso-8859-1 is just an alias for windows-1252

[03:27:03.0000] <annevk>
in the real world

[03:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if the validator should ever emit messages without telling the author how they can make the message go away

[03:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm surprised that Google still doesn't default to UTF-8 for unknown UAs

[03:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: should I add "Please upgrade to UTF-8" to all encoding errors?

[03:29:01.0000] <jruderman>
ok, that makes sense. it would be nice if the validator made it clear that was the reason (as opposed to there being something truly wrong with the page, like a content-type header not matching a meta http-equiv content-type or the bytes of the page)

[03:30:00.0000] <jruderman>
hsivonen: yes, especially the 'this is invalid UTF-8' encoding errors

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I guess most authors wouldn't have a clue what that meant or how to do that

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't want to make the messages themselves longer, but I could add elaborations similar to the elaborations on RELAX NG errors

[03:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(which are out of date)

[03:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't sure what the validator could actually say that would be sufficiently helpful

[03:33:00.0000] <jruderman>
"Support for UTF-32 is not recommended. This encoding is rarely used, and frequently misimplemented." is it more frequently misimplemented than UTF-16?

[03:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jruderman: I would expect so, but I have no data.

[03:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jruderman: interesting apps use UTF-16 internally, so developers are likely to notice bugs

[03:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jruderman: but UTF-32 is a checklist item that no one actually bothers to test seriously

[03:36:00.0000] <jruderman>
ahh

[03:36:01.0000] <jruderman>
most of the problems i've seen with UTF-16 involved surrogate pairs (or surrogates that should have been in pairs but weren't)

[03:37:00.0000] <jruderman>
although i also saw one awesome bug report where someone managed to set their *default* encoding to UTF-16 and then wondered why many pages appeared as random chinese characters

[03:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd expect most UTF-32 problems to involve conversion to surrogate pairs when the in-memory representation is UTF-16

[03:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jruderman: browsers probably shouldn't have UI for selecting UTF-16

[03:37:03.0000] <jruderman>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=452934

[03:37:04.0000] <jruderman>
yeah

[03:38:00.0000] <jruderman>
i noticed that google chrome had UTF-16 as an option for the default encoding, and i was mildly surprised

[03:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
UTF-16 as an interchange format should die

[03:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me saw that Chrome seems to be using ICU, rather than relying on native platform APIs

[03:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: not a bad idea

[03:41:00.0000] <jruderman>
kk filed https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=453423

[03:42:00.0000] <jruderman>
i'm sad that people in some countries are still expected to fiddle with character encoding overrides

[03:42:01.0000] <jruderman>
it's kind of a security hole

Hixie: it will have to be a near header each time so that browsers that only support 'nosniff' won't revert

[03:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh right

[03:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me tests how well nosniff actually works

[03:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
X-Content-Type-Options-2: nosniff

[03:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
X-Content-Type-Options-3: nosniff

[03:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: does it work with <img>, <script>, etc?

[03:46:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: how about navigating to a GIF labelled as PNG?

[03:46:06.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: or a text/plain video?

[03:47:00.0000] <jruderman>
X-Content-Type-Options-no-seriously: nosniff

[03:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It doesn't work on <img> - the Content-Type is still totally ignored

[03:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It doesn't work on <script> - the Content-Type is still totally ignored, and only the <script type> has an effect

[03:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It doesn't work on <style> - the Content-Type is still totally ignored, and only the <style type> has an effect

[03:54:00.0000] <annevk>
<style>? you mean <link rel=stylesheet>?

[03:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[03:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[03:56:00.0000] <annevk>
so far X-Content-Type-Options fails

[03:56:01.0000] <annevk>
just like whatwg.org btw

[03:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
It works correctly on <object type="text/html" data="some HTML with text/plain"> (i.e. nosniff makes it render as text instead of HTML)

[03:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
does it work for images in object or directly navigated?

[03:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
It doesn't work correctly on <object type="image/jpeg" data="some PNG with text/plain and nosniff"> (it still renders the PNG image)

[03:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
the most important one is really videos sent as text/plain

[03:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
how about without the type=?

[03:57:04.0000] <Philip`>
(although with type="image/png" it renders a broken X icon instead)

[03:57:05.0000] <Hixie>
-_-

[03:57:06.0000] <Hixie>
sounds like a roaring success

[03:57:07.0000] <Hixie>
someone tell public-html

[03:57:08.0000] <Hixie>
it'll get them off our backs for a few days

[03:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[03:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It renders a broken X regardless of the nosniff)

[03:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
(unless I'm doing something silly?)

[03:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
png is handled differently to jpeg and gif

[03:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
so i wouldn't be surprised

[03:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
I would test it in the Live DOM Viewer, but it's not working :-(

[03:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-(

[04:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Images (PNG and JPEG) work in <object> if type="image/jpeg" or type="image/gif", regardless of the content-type or nosniff

[04:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
and don't work if type="image/png"

[04:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
what if there's no type?

[04:03:03.0000] <annevk>
their code is buggy...

[04:03:04.0000] <Philip`>
Then they don't work at all

[04:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
even with the right type?

[04:03:06.0000] <Philip`>
Even with the right content-type, yes

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
man

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
they try so hard

[04:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
jesus <input> has a lot of attributes

[04:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone have good ideas for parser selection in case I enabled file upload and textarea input on html5.validator.nu?

[04:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
parser selection?

[04:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
you mean how to decide on text/html vs xml?

[04:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yes

[04:15:04.0000] <Philip`>
Decide on text/html

[04:15:05.0000] <Hixie>
well theoretically you could trigger on the UA-provided mime type, which will be based on the extension

[04:15:06.0000] <Hixie>
but i'd just use text/html

[04:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: UA-provided anything won't work for textarea

[04:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah for textarea just assume text/html

[04:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
or, provide ui

[04:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: providing UI sucks when the whole point of html5.validator.nu is that it has less UI

[04:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[04:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
so assume text/html

[04:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
autodetection will just cause confusion

[04:17:04.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
<input>'s summary is ridiculous

[04:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
btw i keep hitting your five second timeout

[04:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg.org is responding, just very very slowly

[04:20:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, you checked in an empty document into dev.w3.org creating a massive diff (the generated HTML file is >10MiB)

[04:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm reluctant to change timeouts, because normal non-broken non-tarpit sites respond in under 5 seconds

[04:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I already have to tweak other DoS prevention measures every now and then to accommodate the spec's growth

[04:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh fair enough :-)

[04:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yeah doesn't surprise me

[04:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: it'll fix itself

[04:22:03.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, maybe you should whitelist whatwg.org :)

[04:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
nah

[04:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
let's see if there are APIs for that...

[04:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd rather you didn't whitelist whatwg.org, that'll just lead to confusing errors later when one site gets different behaviour than another

[04:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
OK.

[04:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(and I didn't yet find a suitable API, either)

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk>
http://tapthehive.com/discuss/This_Post_Not_Made_In_Chrome_Google_s_EULA_Sucks

[04:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
more to the point, the EULA for the *Services* sucks

[04:33:00.0000] <annevk>
"Your use of Google’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document"

[04:33:01.0000] <annevk>
-- http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_text.html

[04:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
well that's dumb

[04:33:03.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. That's bad.

[04:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me will raise it with the lawyers

[04:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
though i expect they already know and are fixing it as we speak

[04:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
as far as I can tell, the EULA nastiness is already known for Google Docs

[04:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
well for google docs it makes sense

[04:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
without it we could theoretically not show the document back to you

[04:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: other application providers scope the language more reasonable to the right required for performing the functionality of the service and only for the duration that the content resides in the service

[04:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
someone made a comparison of Docs and competitors on the EULA point a while ago

[04:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
that would seem reasonable

[04:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
seems our lawyers are asleep

[04:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
which i guess makes sense

[04:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'll ping them tomorow

[04:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
tomorrow

[04:37:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: thanks

[04:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fortunately, Flickr has a lot of paranoid pro photographer users, which makes Yahoo! more careful on this point nowadays

[04:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: do you have OCR that worked on the Google comic?

[04:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2008Sep/0010.html

[04:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love people who send e-mails with the subject line starting "OFF TOPIC"

[04:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
that just about says it all right there

[04:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Google Gears does show up in about:plugins, so I wasn't totally crazy to think it was an NPAPI plugin

[04:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
gears is a lot of things

[04:53:02.0000] <Lachy>
hah! That's the best response to John Foliot I've seen in a while :-)

[04:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
that article about Google Chrome's TOS doesn't seem right. The section he quoted from the TOS is talking about Services, and Google Chrome isn't a service.

[04:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
the eula does define "services" to include google software

[04:57:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, for your viewer you want something like http://w3future.com/weblog/stories/2002/05/04/urisForDynamicPages.xml plus a timeout listener to take care of moving back and forth

[04:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, you're right

[04:57:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, see eg the source of http://anne.is.weggeweest.nl/image-viewer for example of such code

[04:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
the timeout error message i got from h.v.n changed

[05:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:02:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh, the Thomas Broyer tactic is also neat, we could just define a new XSLT 1.0 output method. That requires minimal effort and addresses the issue in theory

[05:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: perhaps your server is now responding in 5 seconds but takes more than 5 seconds between packets

[05:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
or something

[05:07:00.0000] <hendry>
http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/2824592876/ # can chrome be really failing a cookies test.. hmm :)

[05:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. is WebKit not supporting dynamic SVG at all at this point?

[05:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: Clearly Google has recognised the privacy risk of tracking cookies, and so has decided to entirely disable them to protect their users

[05:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. looks like the Finnish localizer of Chrome had no clue about the context of the strings or what common browser idioms are

[05:10:01.0000] <hendry>
Philip`: so JS access is disabled or something

[05:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Show Source is translated to something like Show Origin

[05:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders whether the localisations are open source

[05:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, for some reason, they served me a Finnish localization based on IP even though I used English Firefox and Windows XP

[05:13:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: geolocation rocks :)

[05:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: Swedish speakers must be thrilled

[05:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, google's geolocation localisation crap is a constant annoyance for me. Just make sure you get a cookie from google.com/ncr so they don't do it

[05:14:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I hate how this generally works on the web, where I get Norwegian pages forced upon me

[05:14:02.0000] <virtuelv>
no-bok, or no-nn is not even in my accept-language

[05:14:03.0000] <virtuelv>
(Google, I'm looking at you)

[05:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is no-bok even a valid value?

[05:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, at least you understand norwegian. It's a lot worse for people travelling to foreign countries

[05:15:02.0000] <Dashiva>
oh, n/m

[05:15:03.0000] <Lachy>
though, even when I was in Australia, I still hated that it redirected me from google.com to google.com.au

[05:15:04.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: I realise that

[05:16:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the other thing bothering me is geotargetting of search results

[05:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
At one point I had japanese first in my accept-language string without knowing it

[05:16:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It never kicked in until I tried to read apache docs

[05:16:03.0000] <annevk>
haha

[05:16:04.0000] <hsivonen>
with Maps, I want it to search Finland instead of the U.S. by default, but that doesn't magically happen

[05:17:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I really hate the fact that if I send a search result page to someone, and they won't be seeing the same results as me

[05:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Maybe it's a typo for no-bork

[05:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, doesn't it do that if you search from maps.google.fi ?

[05:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I've somehow set it to default to the exact area where I live, which seems to works well, though I've got no idea how I did that

[05:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: thanks. I hadn't tried going there. :-)

[05:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Google's DWIM isn't right

[05:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
I would do the same with maps.google.no, I have to use the .com so I get enlish, and then append "Norway" to the end of my queries

[05:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that Google optimizes Lapland out of the default view

[05:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Google should have some heuristics to calculate the cluefulness of a user, and if they're sufficiently clueful then it would start to respect their browser language settings instead of just guessing from IP

[05:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe we need a new I-Really-Do-Accept: header, or something to indicate that the language prefs have been customised and that they should be believed

[05:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
X-Authorative-Accept?

[05:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
though, if people download localised versions of browsers which have reasonable defaults, it's strange that they still think they can't be trusted

[05:24:00.0000] <annevk>
content negotiation failed, time to try something else

[05:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Wasn't there a lot of talk about meta language for content negotiation?

[05:27:00.0000] <annevk>
could be

[05:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: no i typed it by hand

[05:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i got history navigation work ok i think

[05:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
gocr does alright at OCR

[05:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
"Gaagle Chrome hndho OpnSourBrawsr)"

[05:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
etc

[05:31:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: if that's what you get then i guess it's faster to type by hand

[05:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I suppose so :-(

[05:33:00.0000] <annevk>
we could just have http://n.whatwg.org/xslt or something and map an output algorithm to that

[05:33:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You'd think google's ocr would also do spell checking :)

[05:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: that's a lot of typing

[05:33:03.0000] <annevk>
maybe #html at the end

[05:33:04.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I didn't know Google did OCR

[05:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: naw

[05:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: I just assumed the g in gocr was google :)

[05:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think we should take on the XSLT WG's job to define a new XSLT output method. If they're not willing to do the work to keep up to date, that's their problem. Don't shift the responsibility on to use to bend over backwards to cater for them

[05:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
s/use/us/

[05:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Ah - not all software in the world that begins with 'g' was written by Google :-)

[05:37:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Lies

[05:38:00.0000] <jcranmer>
gedit?

[05:39:00.0000] <jcranmer>
gnibbles?

[05:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
gcc, gmake, etc.

[05:39:02.0000] <jcranmer>
gmplayer

[05:39:03.0000] <jcranmer>
gfloppy

[05:39:04.0000] <Lachy>
even gBrowser

[05:39:05.0000] <jcranmer>
95% of GNOME, in fact

[05:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jcranmer: Yeah, but GNOME is a Google project, it starts with a G.

[05:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[05:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I cleaned up http://about.validator.nu/ a bit.

[05:40:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, and GNU was started by google 25 years ago too

[05:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: also, bookmarklets included. Thanks. (I hope I got the right versions.)

[05:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oops. the schema descriptions are broken still

[05:44:00.0000] <virtuelv>
and gimp is short for google image manipulation program

[05:46:00.0000] <jcranmer>
... this is where I'm supposed to make a bash.org reference, but it's down ...

[05:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: cool. looks like the right version

[05:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i noticed that it breaks the back button

[05:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: is that something I can fix?

[05:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does fixing it need HTML5 history management in the browser?

[05:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: maybe, by moving back the root element after the form has submitted or something. but maybe that would cause scripts to execute again?

[05:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: With the Text Field input, it's unhelpful that the validation results are scrolled off the bottom of the screen and invisible after clicking 'validate'

[05:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
(at least on a 1280x800 screen with various menus taking up some vertical space)

[05:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
(*menus and toolbars)

[05:52:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: perhaps you could clone the root element instead of moving it

[05:52:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: WFM on full HD Cinema Display :-)

[05:52:04.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: :-P

[05:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: OK. I'll file a bug. 

[05:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(today is a documentation day, so I'll write more docs now)

[05:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: do you have a suggestion how to fix? should I use media queries to make the textarea smaller?

[06:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: perhaps submit to a fragment id

[06:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but maybe that would be annoying?

[06:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that's a possibility, but if I don't tie it to MQ, it might annoy other users

[06:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[06:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that various Java XML tools roll their own character encoding support

[06:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I thought java was all about massive libraries

[06:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so much work when they could simply not support anything but UTF-8 for output

[06:20:02.0000] <takkaria>
there's some tests lying around in Hubbub's repository that aren't in html5lib's, I should probably fix that at some point

[06:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva:  pre-1.4.2 Java sucked badly for charset stuff

[06:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: and apparently, querying an encoding for the characters in can and can't encode doesn't work

[06:21:02.0000] <Dashiva>
That seems a bit lacking, yeah

[06:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(and even if you want to support non-utf8 you can still output utf8 and use a postprocessor)

[06:28:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, what does the "3" stand for?

[06:29:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fanne.is.weggeweest.nl%2Fimage-viewer does not tell me what attributes are missing that I need to specify

[06:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yeah that sucks. 

[06:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I have two excuses

[06:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
1) Hixie removed the "(required)" annotation from the spec

[06:30:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and

[06:30:04.0000] <hsivonen>
2) oNVDL upstream was supposed to fix this

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I changed the version number to 3 after some major feature

[06:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but since this is perpetual beta, the version number is pointless

[06:32:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe h1 span { display:none} then? :)

[06:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Maybe put the green/red pass/fail box near the top of the page, above the URL/file/text input and all the various configuration settings, and have the individual messages down below like they are already?

[06:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Then it'd be easy to see immediately whether the page is okay, and if it's not then you can scroll down to see the problems

[06:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
(That seems to be what validator.w3.org does)

[07:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: shouldn't it be "that cannot output HTML markup with the short doctype" or some such since they generally can output HTML without a doctype but a doctype is required

[07:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Judging by the referrer list in http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/, a lot of Chrome users are getting error 110

[07:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: when you see an xslt-compat doctype, you can point to XSLT4HTML5 :)

[07:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, IE says <select>.type == "select-one", and <select multiple>.type == "select-multiple"

[07:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Isn't that as expected?

[07:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Oh, apparently it is - it just isn't something I've ever seen or heard of before

[07:58:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, it's pretty obscure

[07:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but nice

[07:59:01.0000] <zcorpan>
also see textarea

[07:59:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I expect it was inteded for traversing the elements collection just looking at type (textarea also has the property)

[08:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: attr-form-form should be attr-fieldset-form

[08:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, is about:internets meant to do something in Chrome other than show an empty white page with "The tubes are clogged" in the title?

[08:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
If so, I guess it's buggy since it doesn't work for me :-(

[08:53:02.0000] <takkaria>
what OS are you on?

[08:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
Vista

[08:53:04.0000] <annevk>
geez, whatwg.org is slow

[08:53:05.0000] <takkaria>
that's why

[08:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[08:54:01.0000] <takkaria>
on XP and before, it shows the pipes screensaver

[08:54:02.0000] <annevk>
http://img352.imageshack.us/my.php?image=gogolegearseasteregguz9.jpg

[08:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
If Google can't even write code that works on the latest version of Windows, I suppose I shouldn't expect they'll ever do well on Linux :-p

[08:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, no, they probably just didn't care about Vista too much since no-one uses it anyway, since most people who get it use the downgrade option in order to upgrade to XP anyway

[08:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, you could try building it yourself http://dev.chromium.org/

[08:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm going to try building it for OS X

[08:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders at Lachy's definition of "most"

[08:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Apparently it sort of builds and runs some tests on Linux / OS X, but isn't at a stage where it actually has a browser window

[08:59:01.0000] <annevk>
I thought Mac and Linux were several modules sort, last I read

[08:59:02.0000] <annevk>
short, even

[08:59:03.0000] <annevk>
yeah, what Philip` said

[08:59:04.0000] <Lachy>
my definition of "most" is based on nothing more than anecdotal evidence about people really disliking vista and choosing to downgrade

[09:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, that sucks.

[09:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2008/09/platforms-and-priorities.html

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/09/02/ie8-security-part-vi-beta-2-update.aspx#8922060 - "Will the authoritative asttribute still be supported or is it dropped in favor of the new header? I already implemented it here and there, so that's why I'm asking." - implementing features before they've even been released in a beta is not necessarily a great idea

[09:17:00.0000] <hallvors>
annevk: wasn't content-negotiation a nice idea, just badly spec'ed with even worse implementations?

[09:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
kingryan: If you happen to read the logs and see this before the email I sent, I think your change to remove the parse error from </br/> is wrong, since the spec says "When an end tag token is emitted with its self-closing flag set, that is a parse error."

[09:31:00.0000] <annevk>
hallvors, I agree it's a nice idea, though on the other hand I'm not sure if multiple content types really makes sense, languages sort of does though

[09:31:01.0000] <annevk>
hallvors, though even there it's dodgy as the various translated resources might be crappy compared to the original one

[09:32:00.0000] <annevk>
eg, http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Amata and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Amata

[09:37:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, though ideally a validator only reports "</br> not allowed"

[09:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
"As of Beta 2, CSS expressions are not supported in IE8 Standards Mode." - ooh, only just noticed that

[10:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?sample=21&qprid=43&qpcustom=Chrome+0.2 - 1%? It's beating Opera already :-(

[10:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I like how it rises as people start trying it out, then drops back down :P

[11:16:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Hixie: it seems multi-page HTML 5 is broken ATM?

[11:16:01.0000] <jcranmer>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/stderr.txt

[11:20:00.0000] <jcranmer>
also, slight typo in that you're missing a comma, but typographical errors are unimportant right now

[11:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: Looks like my spec-splitter script failed (presumably timed out) while trying to download the spec to split

[11:41:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: 404 error, actually

[11:41:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I think

[11:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
and so then it ran the splitter script, which failed because there was no input, and then it zipped up the output files, of which there were none because it had failed, and then uploaded those and the old multipage files got replaced by the zero new ones

[11:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: It failed with "curl: (52) Empty reply from server"

[11:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me tells the script to try again

[11:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
which'll take a couple of minutes

[11:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
kingryan: If you didn't happen to read the logs, see http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20080903#l-909 :-)

[11:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: multipage is back now

[11:46:01.0000] <jcranmer>
^_^

[11:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Anybody who knows html5lib: Is http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/stderr.txt important and can I make it shut up?

[12:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Um, is javascript: defined anywhere (like, to not be a URI)

[12:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(so javascript:alert("/?#") works)

[12:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoehrmann-javascript-scheme-00 ?

[12:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"Designers of protocol elements that accept resource identifiers as defined in this document should consider this case and, where compatibility is a concern, define a pre-processing step that percent-encodes all '#' characters before the content of the protocol element is processed as 'javascript' resource identifier."

[12:50:00.0000] <kingryan>
Philip`: reading now

[12:50:01.0000] <kingryan>
about that: afaict, you're right, it should be a parse error, its just difficult (impossible?) to tell in the tokenizer

[12:50:02.0000] <kingryan>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20080903#l-300 :)

[12:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
kingryan: No it's not - you see that it's an end tag, and that it's got the self-closing flag, so you emit a parse error

[12:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I think)

[12:52:02.0000] <kingryan>
Philip`: you may be right, but i had a difficult time implementing that

[12:53:00.0000] <kingryan>
it could be that it was 2am and I was tired though

[12:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
if (end-tag && self-closing-flag) emitParseError(); :-P

[12:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
When you're emitting tag tokens, you must have some way of knowing whether it's start/end, and that seems to be about all it needs

[12:54:01.0000] <kingryan>
right

[12:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
(This is separate from the bit that checks whether the self-closing flag was acknowledged, or whatever the terminology is, which does seem impossible in the tokeniser)

[12:56:00.0000] <kingryan>
yeah, its probably not impossible, but it seems to be more than what the spec is asking for in the tokenization section

[13:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://stuff.gsnedders.com/referrers/referrers.html

[13:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
All kinds of bizarre things find my site

[14:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: just search for the word "fetching" in the spec, that should give you every case that can initiate HTTP

[14:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
and if i missed any, that's a bug

[14:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
uh, search for "fetch", even

[14:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: did you test to see if IE8 will treat video binary data as text/plain if sent with text/plain, nosniff?

[14:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i'm glad to inform you of http://www.google.com/google-d-s/addlterms.html

[14:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
and http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10031703-56.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-5

[14:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I didn't test that

[14:12:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: good stuff :)

[14:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't sure where to find a video that IE would render to test with

[14:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Didn't anyone from Google bother to check the EULA before releasing Chrome?

[14:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: well the real question is does it offer it for download or show it

[14:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish opera was consistent in its messaging

[14:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i understand people in one company having different opinions

[14:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
but people having different facts is very confusing

[14:21:02.0000] <wilhelm>
Hm?

[14:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
ed and chaals are disagreeing on whether opera supports namespace-less svg and on whether it's important enough to need to support it in svg

[14:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
er

[14:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
in svg-in-html

[14:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
<label> elements are associated with a form? really?

[14:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
that seems silly

[14:29:00.0000] <annevk>
Charles talks about image/svg+xml implying the SVG namespace if no default namespace declaration is set and the root element is not in a namespace and Erik is talking about the DOCTYPE augmenting the markup

[14:29:01.0000] <annevk>
Jeff then confuses the two

[14:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
chaals also said that we didn't need to handle <svg> without namespace, and ed said we did.

[14:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
given text/html has no doctypes inline, we either have to handle it or we don't

[14:30:02.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure Charles knows about the DOCTYPE augmenting the markup

[14:31:00.0000] <annevk>
(the quote from Charles is also from July...)

[14:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
one would assume he does know everything there is to know here, given how authoritatively he speaks on the subject

[14:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: It's possible to sound authoritative on anything

[14:34:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm also not sure whether Charles considers a DOCTYPE to augment the markup to be ok, but frankly, it all doesn't really matter

[14:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
well, it matters in that if ed is right, the svgwg proposal is fundamentally flawed

[14:36:00.0000] <annevk>
no comment

[14:39:00.0000] <annevk>
though fwiw, Erik is correct

[14:39:01.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure why Jeff didn't simply test instead of digging up some old quote

[14:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i look forward to seeing how the svgwg updates their proposal then

[14:44:00.0000] <hober>
Is their proposal work public? That is, how can someone follow along with edits to their proposal?

[14:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think so

[14:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
check their wg mailing list and minutes

[14:46:00.0000] <annevk>
seems Julian disagrees with my testing

[14:47:00.0000] <smedero>
I believe the draft work on the SVG in HTML proposal lives here: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/SVG_in_text-html

[14:48:00.0000] <smedero>
Or so I gleaned from looking at their tracker instance... I might be wrong.

[14:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
they haven't done anything since i sent the comments then

[14:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
which isn't surprising, that was relatively recently

[14:48:03.0000] <smedero>
around here, shepazu would be the person to ask

[14:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. gotta go.

[14:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab.

[14:50:00.0000] <shepazu>
yes, it's public, and we will be updating it with hixie's feedback shortly.... we're a bit busy with other things for the next week or two, then we will address his comments

[14:51:00.0000] <annevk>
http://annevankesteren.nl/test/svg/doctype.xml has the DOCTYPE SVG test so people can check for themselves

[14:53:00.0000] <annevk>
http://ajaxian.com/archives/adding-custom-tags-to-internet-explorer-the-official-way "I'm going to do more testing on this functionality today to see how deep it goes, but if true it makes it easier to create browser shims for Internet Explorer for things like SVG, MathML, etc., including HTML 5 (if we namespace the HTML 5 elements, required to get this to work)." yes we know, no we don't want that! :)

[14:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Re: your question about 3 hours ago, the warning is only important if you care abou <!DOCTYPE hTmL> vs <!DOCTYPE html> and you can make it shut up by messing about with the warnings module

[14:59:00.0000] <annevk>
euh Hixie, where you mean "label" in the parser you wrote "input"

[14:59:01.0000] <annevk>
+   <dt>A start tag whose tag name is "input"</dt>

[15:04:00.0000] <virtuelv>
 ugh, this is hacky, http://ajaxian.com/archives/adding-custom-tags-to-internet-explorer-the-official-way

[15:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
"The reason I'm looking for an alternative to the createElement trick is I've found that it doesn't work with nested custom tags" - seems to work fine with nested tags when I try it

[15:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
(except for the old problem of IE8b2 not styling them, but it doesn't style custom prefix:name tags either)

[15:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there some way to stop Opera trying to download all feeds simultaneously? It maxes out my (slow) connection for five or ten seconds, which is bad if I'm trying to play online games :-(

[15:16:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Philip`: The closest you'll get is that you can change the update interval, I think.

[15:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sadly it doesn't let me set each interval to a distinct prime number

[15:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it's still going to end up trying to download lots at once

[15:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
is it time for publication soon?

[15:22:01.0000] <annevk>
few weeks

[15:22:02.0000] <annevk>
/me tries to find the date

[15:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh i thought it was more like one week

[15:23:01.0000] <annevk>
I hilited it in http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html-wg/20080901

[15:23:02.0000] <zcorpan>
no rationale?

[15:23:03.0000] <annevk>
nope

[15:24:00.0000] <annevk>
works for me, WF2 might be integrated by that date

[15:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[15:25:01.0000] <zcorpan>
finally

[15:26:00.0000] <annevk>
lots of new elements to debug and report bugs on :)

[15:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Has the Forms Task Force officially been declared useless yet?

[15:27:00.0000] <smedero>
yes

[15:27:01.0000] <smedero>
i'd have to dig up the "non-binding" telecon decision.

[15:27:02.0000] <annevk>
/me saw Philip` already started by checking out <select>.type and all

[15:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: That wasn't related to WF2 at all

[15:27:04.0000] <Philip`>
I was just looking at strings in IE, and saw that

[15:27:05.0000] <annevk>
meh

[15:28:00.0000] <annevk>
Opera does it too

[15:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
Forms are boring, so someone else can look at them :-p

[15:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I'd hope so, since the DOM spec says to do so

[15:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but I never knew that before today)

[15:29:01.0000] <annevk>
well, same here

[15:30:00.0000] <smedero>
this somewhat tracks the decision process: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/actions/56

[15:30:01.0000] <annevk>
cheers smedero

[15:31:00.0000] <smedero>
i'm having trouble finding the transcript for the 7/10 telecon.... oh well

[15:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: ping

[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: pong

[16:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: cool. there's no rush, btw, i'm gonna be swapmed with wf2 stuff for a while.

[16:06:01.0000] <shepazu>
Hixie: ok, cool.. still, we will try to be as prompt as possible

[16:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[16:08:00.0000] <jcranmer>
/me wants <input type=""> widely supported NOW

[16:09:00.0000] <jcranmer>
especially date, datetime, and time...

[16:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
i want <datagrid>

[16:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
and websocket

[16:10:00.0000] <jcranmer>
<input type="gurh, unknown value"> should fall back to a single-line textbox?

[16:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[16:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
But you shouldn't rely on that, since WF3 might define the "gurh, unknown value" input type

[16:11:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I just tried using http://james.html5.org/tables/table_inspector.html on http://www.wisc.edu/about/facts/budget.php and got a huge error at http://james.html5.org/cgi-bin/tables/table_inspector.py?input_type=type_uri&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisc.edu%2Fabout%2Ffacts%2Fbudget.php&source=&algorithm=smartheaders

[16:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, the page does have a few parse errors: http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisc.edu%2Fabout%2Ffacts%2Fbudget.php

[16:12:01.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: it'd be about fallback for <input type="date"> in my case

[16:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: known bug. Turns out that people using "XHTML" trip up people like me who try to repurpose XML libraries for HTML because the XML libraries have special restrictions needed to stop people unwittingly getting namespaces in XML wrong

[16:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
It turns out to be harder than I would like to fix because lxml (the library in question) gives a choice of unsutiable behaviours

[16:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
If you have enough time you can work out how to aportion blame between me, the lxml authors, the page authors and the W3C for the problem :)

[16:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I'll leave that in your more capable hands. ;)

[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: html5 gives some ideas on how to deal with these issues

[16:29:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, can you remember the thread were people demanded you make the Table Inspector accessible, with headers+id? I remember it but can't find it...

[16:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: What does HTML5 have to say about dealing with libs that won't allow : in element names?

[16:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I remmber it existed and that I did what they asked. I think it was Leif asking

[16:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#coercing

[16:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, closest I've reached is: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Mar/0082.html

[16:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: If you copy the first table from that page into the table inspector source view it works nicely

[16:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/source view/textarea/

[16:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Oh nice. Is that new or have I just been oblivious for a long time?

[16:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: relatively new

[16:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: hsivonen asked for it

[16:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
iirc

[16:34:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: That's clearly because hsivonen rocks :)

[16:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's the rumour

[16:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
When I view the spec, I get "Fatal network error: Error: Internal Server Error (500)"

[16:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
in an alert box

[16:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's unfortunate

[16:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
wfm

[16:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[16:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
it ran out of memory trying to log you in

[16:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me gives the server a little more ram

[16:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I've found Leif's message using Outlook's search within seconds. Note to self: try that first next time.

[16:40:01.0000] <jgraham>
It somehow never occurs to me to search local email. I guess because that doesn't give me a URL

[16:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: should work now

[16:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, it does give you enough information to then have a happier time with the web search interface, though.

[16:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Indeed

[16:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, Leif's message is here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Sep/0153.html

[16:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I'm still searching for a reply where you say that feature is definitely in the inspector, though.

[16:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I replied off-list

[16:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Does work now - thanks :-)

[16:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
(I may also have replied on list)

[16:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: The X-Archived-At header in W3C mail gives you a URL

[16:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Interesting. I guess using view source on the mail isn't so bad

[16:47:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I guess this will do: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Mar/0082.html

[16:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: That sounds reasonable

[16:50:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, Archived-At gives you a URL, at least for w3.org lists

[16:50:01.0000] <annevk>
oops, didn't scroll down far enough

[20:30:00.0000] <PatomaS>
Hi

[20:32:00.0000] <PatomaS>
i have a lot of questions, and of course for you most of them should be boring, but well, i'm just trying to get a better idea of this 

[20:32:01.0000] <kingryan>
hi PatomaS 

[20:32:02.0000] <PatomaS>
:)

[20:32:03.0000] <PatomaS>
hi

[20:32:04.0000] <kingryan>
what are your questions?

[20:33:00.0000] <PatomaS>
well, many of them, after reading here and there, and trying to think a little, usually have one thing in common and that is, When and why was the necessity of joining html and xhtml born?

[20:34:00.0000] <PatomaS>
or may be i should rephrase that

[20:34:01.0000] <PatomaS>
?

[20:35:00.0000] <kingryan>
well, they've always been joined, in that xhtml is an xml dialect of the html language

[20:35:01.0000] <PatomaS>
yes, that's true

[20:36:00.0000] <PatomaS>
but the line was evolving/changing in one direction and now it seems a bit chaotic ...

[20:36:01.0000] <PatomaS>
i mean

[20:37:00.0000] <kingryan>
yes, there was a fork: xhtml2 went one direction and, well, everyone else went another

[20:37:01.0000] <PatomaS>
ha ha ha

[20:37:02.0000] <PatomaS>
yes, specially when they wrote that the v2 won't be backwards compatible ...

[20:38:00.0000] <PatomaS>
but reading some of their material in the list, it seems that at the end, it won't be as differente, if it makes it till the end, of course

[20:38:01.0000] <PatomaS>
i meant that different

[20:40:00.0000] <PatomaS>
i suppose that part of the chaos feling comes from two main areas, at least for me, one is the extremely complex specification of html 5, and the mess in the w3c lists

[20:41:00.0000] <kingryan>
yeah

[20:41:01.0000] <PatomaS>
for instance, the changes in css3, using namespaces, plus the overlapping with the html group and the xhtml group, and things like that ...

[20:41:02.0000] <kingryan>
the html5 spec is complex, but not as complex as browsers :)

[20:41:03.0000] <PatomaS>
that's true

[20:42:00.0000] <PatomaS>
i'm sure they are complex, specially adding more and more features

[20:43:00.0000] <PatomaS>
and of course the idea of a browser behaving purist is 100% unachievable

[20:43:01.0000] <kingryan>
purity doesn't matter, only interoperability. it doesn't matter what browsers do, as long as they all do the same thing

[20:44:00.0000] <PatomaS>
well, yeah, which we know it is not happenning

[20:44:01.0000] <PatomaS>
but they are behaving closer, i think ...

[20:44:02.0000] <PatomaS>
at least in many aspects, common aspects

[20:44:03.0000] <kingryan>
right, things are getting better. and i think the whatwg has facilitated that

[20:45:00.0000] <PatomaS>
well, i know this is not the best place to say it, but i don't know if the whatwg, but the people that forms it ...

[20:45:01.0000] <PatomaS>
and with that i mean

[20:46:00.0000] <PatomaS>
that the people in the group have been fighting for get thigs right, or better, or easier, most of them are kind of icons or referents you can use to follow or to help develop yourself (myself)

[20:47:00.0000] <PatomaS>
and for that, i'm ver very thankful

[20:48:00.0000] <PatomaS>
but about the html5 thing, i'm still, reluctant in may aspects, mainly with reasons, why's and the linke, and agree with many of the contents and ideas ...

[20:48:01.0000] <PatomaS>
i don't know if i that was clear enough?

[20:50:00.0000] <takkaria>
are you asking a question or just thinking out loud? :)

[20:50:01.0000] <codedread>
annevk:  because despite outward appearances, i do have other work I need to do :)

[20:51:00.0000] <PatomaS>
sorry for that ...

[20:52:00.0000] <PatomaS>
yes, i had questions, and some of them are not that straight forward ...

[20:52:01.0000] <PatomaS>
so, i'l try to write that in the forum ...

[20:52:02.0000] <PatomaS>
:)

[20:53:00.0000] <codedread>
(and i had the quote handy from an email)

[00:39:00.0000] <annevk>
codedread, ok, though testing that should have taken as long as writing the e-mail or less (simply pasting the given example in a file and loading that in Opera)

[00:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: good to see changes on the EULAs. thanks.

[01:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, are you here?

[04:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thinks browsers should detect when text/plain content looks like RSS, and then still display it as text/plain but show the little feed autodiscovery icon so you can still choose to subscribe to it (at which point it'll start ignoring the content-type entirely)

[04:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
aaronlev: i've checked "watch this page" but i'm not getting emails. is that the way to subscribe to changes?

[04:37:00.0000] <aaronlev>
zcorpan: check your preference

[04:37:01.0000] <aaronlev>
your prefs

[04:46:00.0000] <annevk>
euh, since when is #%3F supposed to match name="%3F" rather than name="?"

[04:46:01.0000] <annevk>
or is it supposed to match both?

[04:46:02.0000] <annevk>
and browsers do this for id="" too?!

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk>
(I couldn't find the door)

[04:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: for usemap?

[04:49:00.0000] <annevk>
dunno about usemap, this is about fragids

[04:49:01.0000] <annevk>
eg, href="#%3F"

[04:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: ah. i remember that being discussed on the list sometime ago. didn't firefox do the right thing?

[04:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: when you figure it out, mail the list :-)

[04:50:02.0000] <annevk>
ah, yes, but not for the name="" attribute

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, sure thing

[04:51:01.0000] <annevk>
/me goes back to fixing XHR2 from which he was distracted as it's quite boring

[05:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
two more elements to summarise

[05:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
and then the hard work begins

[05:23:00.0000] <annevk>
whatwg.org is rather quick again, nice

[05:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:25:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, btw, new Option takes 4 args

[05:25:01.0000] <annevk>
I e-mailed about this a long time ago iirc

[05:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
is <input type=hidden> interactive content?

[05:42:01.0000] <codedread>
annevk:  fair enough - i should have tested (and I did after I sent the email actually), but i also thought it important that there was an apparent difference of opinion between some folks at Opera (chaals seemed to think that making things stricter wouldn't cause any problems with content creators while Erik seemed to think the opposite) ... though as you mention I may have confused what each were referring to

[05:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I am now! Even if you aren't!

[05:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Email needs better metadata markup, since Gmail's heuristics keep getting it wrong -- 'Would you like to... Add to calendar: "r2148 - [] (0) WF2: Thu Sep 4, 2008 3:51pm"'

[05:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's doing alright at extracting the date, just not at determining whether that date is the kind of thing I might possibly want to include in a calendar)

[05:50:00.0000] <annevk>
codedread, on further reflection, no big deal, I get annoyed sometimes with public-html people always asking questions and never really doing anything, but you don't really fit into that category

[05:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
WF2 merge started, then?

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, day ago or so

[05:55:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, did you get lxml to work on DreamHost?

[05:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is somewhat he's amazed that he totally missed it

[05:55:02.0000] <annevk>
I'm willing to work on an Anolis Web service soonish but I need some help getting the dependencies to run

[05:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: No, but I never tried

[05:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
I just run the spec-splitter on my own server

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm not sure whether running the spec-gen on there would be sensible or not, since the server doesn't have much CPU or bandwidth)

[05:57:01.0000] <annevk>
your own server?

[05:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
(If it used lxml's HTML parser/serialiser instead of html5lib then that'd probably solve the CPU concerns :-) )

[05:58:01.0000] <annevk>
I don't really need you to run it, I need to able to play with it myself :)

[05:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
As I said, I can host it P

[05:58:03.0000] <gsnedders>
* :P

[05:58:04.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Yes, or at least my server-like computer that is sitting in my parents' house behind an ADSL line :-)

[05:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: If you just want to play with it yourself, can't you install it on your own local machine?

[05:59:01.0000] <annevk>
that didn't work out either for some reason

[05:59:02.0000] <annevk>
oh well, back to XHR2 for me I guess

[06:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: By the way, if you want to start using the new spec-gen some time, I've got an updated version of the spec-splitter that should work properly with it

[06:24:00.0000] <annevk>
grmbl, so IE does not decode the name="" attribute

[06:26:00.0000] <annevk>
I meant, does not decode name="" or fragment

[06:27:00.0000] <annevk>
which seems like a violation of RFC 3986

[06:27:01.0000] <annevk>
(fragment takes pchar, which takes pct-encoded)

[06:28:00.0000] <annevk>
Firefox decodes both

[06:28:01.0000] <annevk>
Opera decodes just fragment

[06:30:00.0000] <annevk>
(as per HTML5)

[06:31:00.0000] <annevk>
/me makes a few tests so people can cross test

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, it seems I had some code that was crashing Eclipse's Java compiler

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
and every time I started Eclipse, it started automatically compiling all my code in the background, and crashed

[07:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
But it seems alright now after I moved the project files away and then moved them back again, which I don't really understand :-(

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers unsurprisingly but happily that the Validator.nu parser works in Jython very easily

[08:18:00.0000] <hdh>
is that jython2.5? does it cope with unicode well?

[08:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: nice. which Jython version?

[08:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
2.5a1 and 2.2.1

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
though I'm only using it in the trivialest possible way, parsing a string (via StringReader) to SAX and printing tag names

[08:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: cool

[08:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Unicode seems to work in both versions, at least in my limited testing

[08:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Passing the front page of ja.wikipedia.org to the parser (via FileInputStream), it calls the SAX characters method with something like

[08:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
array('c',[u'\u51fa', u'\u5178', ':', ' ', u'\u30d5', u'\u30ea', u'\u30fc', u'\u767e', u'\u79d1', u'\u4e8b', u'\u5178', u'\u300e', u'\u30a6', u'\u30a3', u'\u30ad', u'\u30da', u'\u30c7', u'\u30a3', u'\u30a2', u'\uff08', 'W', 'i', 'k', 'i', 'p', 'e', 'd', 'i', 'a', u'\uff09', u'\u300f'])

[08:25:03.0000] <Philip`>
which looks about right, I think)

[08:26:00.0000] <hdh>
thanks

[08:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/apidocs/nu/validator/htmlparser/sax/HtmlParser.html - "void parseFragment(InputSource input, String context)  Parser a fragment." - s/Parser/Parses/

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.jython.org/Project/roadmap.html - "Jython 3.0 (or Jython 3000 to denote the likely year of appearance) ..." - that's not sounding very optimistic

[09:02:00.0000] <hendry>
does anyone know about the browser supportedMimeTypes object? http://static.webvm.net/supportedMimeTypes.html ? I've seen it in scripts but I can't find good docs about it and my test fails. :/

[09:03:00.0000] <annevk>
don't rely on it

[09:04:00.0000] <hendry>
annevk: i'm trying to find a reliable way of detecting plugins cross-platform. BrowserPlus use it and several other ppl like Apple I think. Any other suggestions? :)

[09:05:00.0000] <hendry>
still doesn't explain why the test doesn't finish ... http://static.webvm.net/supportedMimeTypes.html

[09:06:00.0000] <annevk>
don't use plugins? :)

[09:06:01.0000] <hendry>
annevk: plugins are the future dude :)

[09:09:00.0000] <hendry>
oops i see the problem. navigator.mimeTypes was what I needed. Crikey i need coffee.

[09:10:00.0000] <smedero>
In Gecko I think you have to use navigator.mimeTypes, right? http://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.navigator.mimeTypes

[09:10:01.0000] <smedero>
ahh

[09:10:02.0000] <smedero>
Not sure what support for that is like either...

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: Plugins are so much not the future that Google released a whole web browser to get around the problems of distributing Gears as a plugin :-)

[09:11:01.0000] <hendry>
Philip`: that's one theory :)

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Plugins look boring so nobody's going to bother downloading them; but a new browser can have an exciting shiny new interface which will make people pay attention and download in their millions

[09:12:01.0000] <annevk>
hendry, hopefully it stays that way

[09:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
and if that happens to have the plugin's functionality integrated into it, so much the better

[09:14:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, Firefox doesn't work with <!doctype> (Opera and IE do), but we've been over that, I think

[09:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
It works with <!doctypehtml> though, as do Opera and IE

[09:14:02.0000] <hendry>
well i'm working on a product that hopes to compete ultimately with gears. so i'm hoping it will become easier to install plugins (like extensions) https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=453632

[09:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is one less character, which is like a terabyte less data when you consider the whole web

[09:15:01.0000] <annevk>
though per hixie's argument Firefox 3 doesn't matter anymore when the spec is done

[09:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe HTML5 should say that <!doctype> must trigger standards mode, so HTML6 can shorten the required doctype?

[09:17:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe, in some way <!doctype html> is sensible, as it still works for XML

[09:18:00.0000] <annevk>
but then it doesn't work with common XML tools

[11:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.google.com/search?q=css3-color - "www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/ - 125k - Cached - Similar pages / by A Authors - Related articles - All 6 versions" - that author name detection thing is really a bit rubbish

[11:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: just a bit

[11:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees that page even uses hCard to mark up names

[11:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: without profile!

[11:30:01.0000] <tantek>
I think I added the hCards to CSS3 Color before we had a profile URI for hCard

[11:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: does profile solve a Real Problem and do hcard consumers have an incentive to start observing rel=profile?

[11:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: that is, isn't class=vcard enough of a disambiguator?

[11:32:00.0000] <tantek>
profiles references solve the same real problems that !DOCTYPE references do

[11:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I read that as a "no" :-)

[11:34:00.0000] <tantek>
class="vcard" is enough of a disambiguator as much as the <html> root element start tag is enough of a disambiguator

[11:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
The <html> root element start tag is optional :-)

[11:34:02.0000] <tantek>
hsivonen, it means that those that care about !DOCTYPE references also care about profile references, and those that don't, don't.

[11:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: I see

[11:36:00.0000] <tantek>
ah, correction, class="vcard" is enough of a disambiguator as much as the <body> start tag is enough of a disambiguator

[11:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
The <body> start tag is optional :-)

[11:36:02.0000] <tantek>
are we talking HTML4 here or HTML5?

[11:36:03.0000] <Philip`>
Both

[11:37:00.0000] <tantek>
ah, just <title> then?

[11:37:01.0000] <tantek>
right, that's the one then

[11:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
<!DOCTYPE html><title></title> is the shortest (syntactically?) valid HTML5 document, and I think <!DOCTYPE blah blah blah etc etc etc><title></title> is the shortest HTML4 one

[11:39:00.0000] <hasather>
Philip`: you need body element in HTML 4 at least

[11:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if class="vcard" could be unambiguously optional

Philip, feel free to join us in #microformats on that question ;)

[11:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[11:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think <!DOCTYPE blah blah blah etc etc etc><title></title>x is the shortest HTML4 one, then

[11:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
tantek: That would put me dangerously close to doing something useful, rather than just wondering randomly in an unrelated IRC channel

[11:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
krijnh: Your logs' referrer list has an interesting positive feedback effect

[11:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
You are the top result on Google for "chrome error 104", because it matches the occurrences of that string in your referrer list

[11:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
and the string is in your referrer list because lots of people are visiting your site through Google with it, because you are the top result on Google

[11:50:00.0000] <annevk>
sounds like epic fail on Google's behalf

[11:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Only under Transitional can you have just "x". Strict is a shorter word than Transitional in the DTD, so <p>x is needed

[11:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
Indeed, since it's their fault that people are searching for that string in the first place

[11:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Bah :-(

[11:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: though you can use just <p> and not <p>x

[11:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: yeah

[11:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"><title></title><p> gets through the W3C validator with no errors, though I don't entirely understand how

[11:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The lack of space after PUBLIC saves one character)

[11:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The validator says it's Transitional, but appears to apply Strict rules to it)

[11:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>

[11:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You need the space

[12:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Tell that to validator.w3.org :-p

[12:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No

[12:00:02.0000] <gsnedders>

/me is currently too lazy to even bother going home

[12:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sometimes stays in the school library after school due to that

[12:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: Nice mix of English and French

[12:11:00.0000] <hasather>
Philip`: you don't need the space

[12:11:01.0000] <hasather>
it's a parameters separator IIRC

[12:11:02.0000] <smedero>
gsnedders: I thought you might enjoy the "english language" version of their site...

[12:11:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me will go home and let gsnedders and hasather fight it out :-)

[12:11:04.0000] <hasather>
Philip`: those can be ommitted in some circumstances

[12:11:05.0000] <hasather>
*omitted

[12:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: No, I just gave up on that mix and looked at the French

[12:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hasather: Ah, I just assumed ps+ meant you needed one or more ps char

[12:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: No room for three people though :(

[12:13:00.0000] <smedero>
sigh

[12:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: They seem to never have three bedroom rooms free

[12:14:00.0000] <hasather>

[12:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hasather: ah

[12:14:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hasather: I was too lazy to check that

[12:14:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[12:14:04.0000] <smedero>
they don't have a "unlucky sob, gets to sleep on the floor" checkbox?

[12:14:05.0000] <smedero>
/me is actually quite happy to sleep on floors

[12:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they would be happier if you claimed you were going to share a bed

[12:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but then you could actually sleep on the floor instead, depending on your preferences)

[12:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: As I said, I can just stay elsewhere before the TPAC

[12:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: And it's only us two on the Friday night

alright, I can't actually remember what BenMillard found at the other hotel now...

[12:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>

[12:18:03.0000] <smedero>
oh, well that's not so bad.

[12:18:04.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: Yeah, 4 nights

[12:18:05.0000] <smedero>
not sure what I'm doing about saturday.

[12:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can probably find some distant relation to scrounge off if he has to

[12:19:01.0000] <smedero>
could probably find someone at the conference willing to lend a hand.

[12:19:02.0000] <smedero>
well, let's just do the 4 nights then

[12:19:03.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: Hmm. All they have is doubles for the Friday night

Is that another way of saying "implied body must have at least one child"?

[14:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone got anything they want me to do before the weekend?

[14:54:00.0000] <annevk>

[14:55:02.0000] <virtuelv>
and now I feel like shit

[15:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
so has there ever been an htmlwg telecon where someone changed their mind about something? or where any other kind of actual progress was made?

[15:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
every time i read the minutes they just seem to be people repeating the arguments they made in the mailing list

[15:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
like some sort of weird group therapy session

[15:02:00.0000] <annevk>
I wasn't sure either why we had this telcon. Seemed that DanC shared my feelings for at least some of the topics

[15:03:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought I'd volunteer for minuting this time so we wouldn't get the fallout that was there last week

[15:03:01.0000] <annevk>
(so far so good)

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders why this xslt thread is continuing now that the issue has been resolved

[15:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
why can't the people using libraries like java just output "<!DOCTYPE HTML>" and then use the serialiser without a doctype?

[15:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
or output whatever DOCTYPE they want and then just change it using a one line regexp?

[15:05:02.0000] <annevk>
"wc"

[15:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
or output XML and use one of the several convertors to convert the XML to HTML5?

[15:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: ?

[15:06:00.0000] <annevk>
(wc being wrong channel)

[15:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I don't know. That's what I've been saying all along

[15:06:02.0000] <annevk>
hard to find XSLT fans around here

[15:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's probably the usual problem fragmentation where three people have three different problems they want solved, and every time one solution is proposed it is rejected as not solving a different problem 

[15:07:01.0000] <annevk>
anyway, fragment tests: 4 engines, all different

[15:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
If there's one thing the XSLT thread has proven, it's that XSLT is not a suitable system to use for serialising HTML at all and I really don't understand why people insist on being able to use it for that at all

[15:13:00.0000] <annevk>

Konqueror says B on all eight of those tests

[15:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
(v3.5.9)

[15:38:00.0000] <annevk>
that makes 5, I think

[15:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
It converts 001.htm#? into 001.htm?# and then the empty fragment identifier matches the B div

[15:39:00.0000] <annevk>
oh? wow

[15:39:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe I shouldn't have assumed correct URL parsing

[15:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
WebKit makes 001.htm# show B too

[15:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Maybe it's just matching the first element with any name?)

[15:54:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, just # should show the top of the document in theory

[15:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
On the other hand, a *good* teacher would teach not to edit directly, 

[15:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
but to use a proper set of tools. For instance, editing in XHTML, and 

[15:55:02.0000] <Dashiva>
then serializing to text/html.

[15:55:03.0000] <Dashiva>
... with XLST?

[16:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: What do you expect IE to do with a text/plain movie file?

[16:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Some version of IE6 (in Wine) gives a file download box; IE8 seems to display it as plain text, regardless of nosniff

[16:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: display a download dialog, as per http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#content-type1

[16:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Ah

[16:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
well you can add http://wiki.opensocial-templates.org/index.php?title=OpenSocial_Data_Pipelining to the list of pages showing misunderstanding of namespaces

[16:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's a prefix used without even a declaration

[16:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I do get a download dialog if the file is served as application/octet-stream or foo/bar etc, but it's just shown as text if it's text/plain

[16:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
(s/you/we/)

[16:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: wow

[16:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: that's surprising

[16:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow in fact it's intentional:

[16:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://wiki.opensocial-templates.org/index.php?title=OpenSocial_Markup

[16:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
opensocial totally calls prefixes "namespaces"

[16:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's funny

[16:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
you can't process opensocial using an xml namespace-aware parser

[16:33:05.0000] <Philip`>
Better be careful not to tell Microsoft that they're not sniffing videos, in case it's a bug and they fix it

[16:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
XML Namespace-aware parser? Is that like a really fancy type of regexp?

[16:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Their <os:PeopleSelector> example seems to forget the > on the <form> element

[16:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I guess they haven't tested this incredibly carefully

[16:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[16:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's deployed, as i understand it

[16:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
How does the deployed implementation work? Given that they've seemingly got a properly namespaced schema, it might just be the spec writer didn't understand what was going on

[16:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

jruderman: fixed the routing problem

[17:03:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: which problem?

[17:03:01.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: oh, the google maps thing with the mozilla office

[17:05:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: now it directs people to building S rather than building K, but that's probably a lot harder to get right

[17:06:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: thanks, now we'll lose fewer moco employees to pedestrian fatalities on the 101 freeway

[17:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why does Google Maps choose a certain route when there's an alternative that's two minutes shorter, and that it's happy to pick when I drag the route around a bit?

[17:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't sure why it'd be optimising for anything except distance

[17:09:00.0000] <gavin>
it takes into account speed limits and such, doesn't it?

[17:09:01.0000] <gavin>
favors highways/major streets too, I think

[17:09:02.0000] <gavin>
I'm sure it's very complex

[17:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, speed limits for pedestrians?

[17:09:04.0000] <gavin>
oh, well

[17:09:05.0000] <gavin>
that's in beta!

[17:09:06.0000] <Philip`>
(This is the walking mode)

[17:09:07.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: well the pin can be edited by users (and has been. a lot. maybe other people in your office are moving it to the wrong location. :-) )

[17:10:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: hehe

[17:10:01.0000] <codedread>
funny - i just noticed this pin editing thing 5 minutes ago

[17:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: but the problem was that it ended on 101, and that has been fixed for the address you gave :-)

[17:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: simplicity is a factor

[17:10:04.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: did you fix it letting people put building pins on freeways, or did you just move that one pin?

[17:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: i can't talk about what the actual fix is, because it's a two phase fix and the second phase hasn't shipped yet.

[17:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
ask me again in a few weeks

[17:11:02.0000] <jruderman>
you guys take the 'future products or services' way too seriously

[17:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[17:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me passes jruderman a future product or service

[17:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I suppose it could be, but the shorter route is only two extra steps, and I'm too lazy to travel an extra two minutes just for that

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i'm not defending it, just saying what the reason is

[18:10:00.0000] <roc_>
I don't think the 101 problem was the pin location

[18:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc_: why not? (as far as i can tell, the pin location caused maps to decide the nearest street was 101.)

[18:19:00.0000] <roc_>
because even if the nearest street *is* 101 (and presumably there are valid locations for which that's true), it should know you can't stop there.

[18:20:00.0000] <roc_>
I'm not ripping on Maps, it's great and the problem is hard. Besides, I have friends who work on it

[18:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh i agree that it could try to avoid stopping on 101 in general

[18:21:00.0000] <roc_>
I only blogged about it because I thought it was hilarious. The Street View was particularly good :-)

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me didn't know you'd blogged about it

[18:22:01.0000] <roc_>
ages ago

[18:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[18:24:00.0000] <jruderman>
i also tried to report it as a bug using email a long time ago, but telling hixie about it yesterday got it fixed quickly :)

http://developer.mozilla.org/web-tech/2008/09/04/web-workers-part-1/

[19:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love how all the examples of workers are always really really inefficent implementations of solved problems :-)

[19:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
do any of the demos on whatwg.org/demos/workers work?

[19:17:01.0000] <roc_>
to be fair, compilers like to use fibonacci too

[19:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i'm to blame as well

[19:18:01.0000] <roc_>
I wish for a compiler that can optimize fibonacci to the closed form

[19:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
one of my examples uses 11 workers to return a constant

[19:18:03.0000] <roc_>
I don't really know much about the workers work myself, so I couldn't answer your question other than by testing them

[19:18:04.0000] <Hixie>

i'll grab a build once i'm back on my laptop

[19:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
(my linux box can't run ff3, doesn't have some required library)

[19:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
libgtk-x11 or something

[19:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
roc_: It ought to be easy for the compiler just to do pattern-matching to detect a Fibonacci function and replace it with an efficient library call

[19:19:03.0000] <roc_>
Philip`: yeah, but that's cheating

[19:19:04.0000] <Philip`>
(like what MSVC does with memcpy loops)

[19:19:05.0000] <Philip`>
(but pointlesser)

[19:20:00.0000] <roc_>
recognizing and solving general difference equations is possible, although probably equally useless in practice

[19:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess the compiler would have to work out it needs a "if (n < 0) { for(;;); }" to get the right computation

[19:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
I finally got my public-html email backlog down to zero! -)

[19:22:00.0000] <Lachy>

[19:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, there's a similar problem with ARIA examples for static web content: existing semantics in HTML4 are often adequate, or the ARIA becomes unnecessary when the feature is changed to follow a usable design pattern.

[19:45:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(Re: your comment about workers examples)

[20:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I sent a follow-up to my review of "@headers issue resolved": http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Sep/0163.html

[20:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the blog entry it links to has numerical analysis of the tables cited as supporting evidence versus corrected and redesigned versions I've done

[20:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
time for lunch :P

[00:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I guess in the case of Java the problem scenario is that someone has serialization code buried at the end of a pipeline somewhere

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and then they start sending HTML5 stuff through the pipeline

[00:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and the output is wrong

[00:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and ripping out 4 or 5 lines of code and replacing them with 2 lines of code referring to the serializer I wrote is onerous

[00:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as they'd need to discover and add Yet Another Jar

[00:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and perhaps convince their lawyers that code under the MIT license and copyright Mozilla Foundation is OK to use

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I get an impression that the HTML5 content would end up in the pipeline in a semi-uncoordinated way

[00:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
because if it were coordinated, one would think the serializer swapping could be coordinated, too

[03:00:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it's in the WF3 folder apparently o_O

[03:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL! I like how John Foliot claims my proposed study of longdesc is flawed based on the fact that it will reveal the exact problems I designed to reveal. :-)

[03:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Seems quite in line with most commercial studies :)

[03:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
one can read quite a bit of browser history in the UA string of Chrome

[03:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if we ever come up with a way to stop the growth of the UA string

[03:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does a typical HTTP GET request still fit on one IP packet?

[03:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, one day we'll have RealUserAgent instead

[03:27:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Since everything in the original UA string will be back-compat and talismans 

[03:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is Netscape 6 the only browser in history that has swam against the UA string cruft stream?

[03:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Opera did recently, but it can still vary it per site, right?

[03:31:02.0000] <wilhelm>
No. Mine says "Opera/9.52 (X11; Linux i686; U; en)".

[03:31:03.0000] <wilhelm>
Yes. It identifies as other browsers on some sites.

[03:32:00.0000] <wilhelm>
We maintain a list.

[03:32:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Why on earth does it list X11...

[03:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: well, it say U and en, too...

[03:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, but my windows version says that too

[03:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Chrome/1.0 now that would have been revolutionary :-)

[03:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
Does any browser ever *not* say "U"?

[03:33:03.0000] <Dashiva>
platform, U, language is always there

[03:33:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't know if they can be configured with rubbish encryption instead of U

[03:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
IE8b2 now sends a "UA-CPU: x86" header

[03:34:01.0000] <webben>
what?

[03:34:02.0000] <webben>
what for?

[03:35:00.0000] <roc_>
so that Web pages can send the correct x86 binaries for execution

[03:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: ActiveX install sites perhaps?

[03:35:02.0000] <roc_>
process separation rules

[03:35:03.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/17/accept-language-header-for-internet-explorer-7.aspx#839384 seems so.

[03:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, IE7 sends UA-CPU too?

[03:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if people who write about "token security" intended the pun...

[03:44:00.0000] <annevk>
so should I do my fragment tests again with ( or so as character instead of ?

[03:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
That should avoid the URL-parsing issues in (at least) Konqueror

[03:49:00.0000] <annevk>
does x' help with that too?

[03:49:01.0000] <annevk>
' seems pretty harmless, and suffix it with x just in case

[03:50:00.0000] <annevk>
prefix, I mean, though i'll suffix it as well

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
so far same results in browsers

[03:53:01.0000] <annevk>
I think I'll leave it be

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
How many Windows ports of WebKit are there with different graphics layers? Safari, Arora, Chrome, AIR. Did the company that ported WebKit to Windows Mobile have a 5th graphics layer?

[04:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does AIR use the same Abode vector graphics renderer as InDesign and Acrobat?

[04:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does any of them actually delegate Bézier rasterization to GDI+ or WPF?

[04:53:00.0000] <roc_>
I don't know what AIR does

[04:53:01.0000] <roc_>
the others definitely don't

[04:53:02.0000] <roc_>
 I'm pretty sure AIR doesn't either

[04:53:03.0000] <zcorpan>
should document.characterSet and document.charset be part of dom core instead of dom html?

[04:53:04.0000] <roc_>
GDI+ is crappy, WPF would be very hard to access

[04:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc_: presumably the WPF renderer is C or C++. Don't they expose a C API for it?

[04:59:01.0000] <roc_>
they don't

[04:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
roc_: that's odd.

[04:59:03.0000] <roc_>
no it's not

[04:59:04.0000] <hsivonen>
roc_: ok. strategically it may not be odd.

[05:00:00.0000] <roc_>
also, exposing APIs is costly

[05:00:01.0000] <roc_>
because then you have to support them to the end of time

[05:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah

[05:00:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me just published an API

[05:00:04.0000] <roc_>
sucka

[05:03:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, if they depend on charset sniffing might be easier in HTML

[05:04:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, also, DOM Core already has various encoding features (all completely pointless of course, the DOM shouldn't deal with encoding)

[05:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: does query string treatment depend on charset in XML?

[05:05:00.0000] <annevk>
eg, inputEncoding and xmlEncoding

[05:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
which reminds me that I should extend Jing to pass the document's original encoding around totally in violation of sane layering

[05:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: don't know

[05:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: should i drop xmlEncoding and inputEncoding? only firefox supports those

[05:11:00.0000] <annevk>
oh really? ugh

[05:11:01.0000] <annevk>
XMLHttpRequest references one of them :/

[05:11:02.0000] <annevk>
(that feature is not actually tested)

[05:11:03.0000] <zcorpan>
which one?

[05:11:04.0000] <hsivonen>
didn't DOM 3 specifiers look at what browsers already did?

[05:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: evidently not

[05:12:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, serializing Document for sending

[05:12:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, nono, not at all

[05:12:03.0000] <hsivonen>
is the browser DOM exposed as a Java DOM anywhere?

[05:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is the Gecko DOM still available to applets or something?

[05:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: xmlEncoding or inputEncoding?

[05:13:02.0000] <annevk>
input

[05:13:03.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[05:13:04.0000] <zcorpan>
i'll drop xml* and see if anyone complains

[05:13:05.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, there's this plan to make a new DOM spec for the Web

[05:14:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, we keep the old spec around as standard for Java and to upset nobody, but the spec for browsers would be this other thing

[05:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: my point is, will it break something that really assumes that the JDK DOM interfaces and the Web DOM interfaces match?

[05:15:00.0000] <annevk>
aah, dunno

[05:15:01.0000] <annevk>
they already diverge here and there so I don't think it matters much

[05:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if there will be demand for GWT wrapping the browser DOM in org.w3c.dom interfaces

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I can imagine someone might want to be able to compile the same code on the server and on GWT

[05:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
although GWT could probably fake the incompatible parts somehow

[05:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i've merged in dom2views

[05:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i'll drop all dom feature stuff except those that return booleans

[05:18:02.0000] <zcorpan>
(and are implemented)

[05:21:00.0000] <annevk>
dom2views is also merged in http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/

[05:21:01.0000] <zcorpan>
oh

[05:21:02.0000] <annevk>
including elementFromPoint

[05:21:03.0000] <zcorpan>
cool

[05:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
dropped both

[05:23:00.0000] <annevk>
feel free to merge the exceptions from XMLHttpRequest and Web Workers in btw

[05:23:01.0000] <annevk>
if your spec moves fast enough we can just reference that then :)

[05:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
done

[05:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ajaxian.com requires a New York Times -style registration in order to comment :-(

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the MSDN custom tag namespace stuff is amusing

[05:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
<HTML XMLNS:MY>

[05:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
no URI value

[05:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is the documentation for creating MathPlayer and Renesis-compatible DOM nodes via script in IE?

[05:30:00.0000] <roc_>
hsivonen: Java can still access the Gecko DOM, I'm pretty sure

[05:31:00.0000] <roc_>
as can Flash

[05:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
roc_: ok.

[05:31:02.0000] <roc_>
but not via the org.w3c.dom interfaces AFAIK

[05:31:03.0000] <hsivonen>
oh.

[05:31:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I expect the threading with Java is interesting

[05:32:00.0000] <roc_>
annevk: did you notice that we implemented ClientRect.width/.height on trunk?

[05:32:01.0000] <roc_>
the threading isn't really our problem

[05:33:00.0000] <roc_>
the Java plugin is moving to use NPRuntime scripting, the same plugin two-way scripting API that Flash uses

[05:33:01.0000] <annevk>
roc_, no, somehow missed that, was it a while ago?

[05:33:02.0000] <roc_>
I really have no idea how that looks on the Java side

[05:34:00.0000] <roc_>
annevk: actually very recent

[05:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me was unaware of NPRuntime scripting

[05:35:00.0000] <annevk>
roc_, oh ok, I guess I need to add you or someone else to my bugzilla tracking preferences then :)

Neil was really just trying to move scroll* and client* up to all elements, but also rolled in height and width

[05:37:01.0000] <annevk>
neat

[05:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
will IE8 mode break these custom namespace ActiveX controls?

[05:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if it's possible for a CGI script to print raw HTTP headers via lighttpd, instead of it being parsed and reserialised before transmission

[05:41:00.0000] <roc_>
I'm still a bit nervous about returning fractional values from ClientRect. People see it and assume it's a bug. However, I still think it's the right thing to do and it doesn't seem to have caused any actual damage

[05:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I think they're meant to still work in most cases, except for e.g. https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=333905 if you're using CSS to assign namespace behaviour

[05:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: can the <?IMPORT stuff be inserted via JS or does the parser need to see it literally?

[05:43:01.0000] <annevk>
roc_, the spec does say float :p

[05:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Microsoft, Renesis and DesignScience aren't particularly forthcoming about this

[05:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Do you count document.write as being inserted via JS?

[05:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I do

[05:44:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: although I'd like to have a purely parserless way

[05:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: document.write should be OK for packaging the V.nu parser as a JS shim

[05:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: however, for the HTML5 Live DOM, I'd like to have a fully scripted API

[05:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It works fine if I put the <?import...?> in document.write

[05:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[05:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/gsnedders/hsivonen/

[05:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: OK. thanks

[05:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: do you know if it persists if the document contents are removed after that?

[05:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does IE even support emptying the document and inserting a new root?

[05:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: You can also do document.namespaces.add('v', 'http://www.w3.org blah blah it doesn\'t matter what you put here', '#default#VML');

[05:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: excellent. thanks

[05:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535932(VS.85).aspx - woah, it's even documented

[05:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: it does so long as the new node is html and you use replaceChild (iirc)

[05:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: thanks. (the HTML5 Live DOM doesn't use replaceChild)

[05:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers a new way to crash IE8

[05:54:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: or wait, you can empty the document and then append a new child, too

[05:54:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: but you can't just empty the document and leave it empty

[05:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: how can it force me to insert something and not leave it empty?

[05:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/tests/ie8/cases/document-close.html - yay for IE8

[06:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: it throws if you don't insert anything

[06:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: and leaves it in the state it was before emptying

[06:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: ah. 

[06:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(without testing, I'm assuming this is one of those weird situations where the scripted view to the DOM and the engine understanding of the DOM are synced only upon spin through the event loop)

[06:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: what happens?

[06:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: IE8b2 just freezes permanently

[06:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
While trying to report the bug, something's broken Opera so it's using 100% CPU and making my fans very loud, but at least Opera is still being responsive

[06:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
(To be more specific, IE8b2 freezes permanently and uses 100% CPU too)

[06:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
(To be more accurate, IE8b2 freezes permanently and uses 100%-divided-by-number-of-CPU-cores CPU too)

[06:21:00.0000] <annevk>
btw, http://tc.labs.opera.com/html/img/usemap/001.htm demonstrates that name in combination with usemap is not affected, despite usemap taking a URL reference originally...

[06:22:00.0000] <annevk>
tested in Firefox 3, Internet Explorer 6, and Opera 9.5

[06:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: matches the spec

[06:25:01.0000] <annevk>
right

[06:26:00.0000] <annevk>

/me wonders what's the most efficient way to read a load of HTML pages from disk

[06:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose the best way is to not actually read them from disk, so if I can compress them so they'll fit in RAM then that'd be good

[06:41:02.0000] <zcorpan>
can i drop normalize() and normalizeDocument() from dom core?

[06:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
but then I'll probably want more pages until it's too much to fit in RAM again :-(

[06:45:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, prolly

[07:01:00.0000] <annevk>
hahaha, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Sep/0175.html

[07:02:03.0000] <hasather>
annevk: :D

[07:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me adds Element.children

[07:07:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, you have time to work on this now?

[07:07:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, also, when say "add" you mean "add in local copy"?

[07:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: yes and yes :)

[07:08:01.0000] <annevk>
great and not so great :)

[07:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, children is an HTMLCollection

[07:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
layering problem

[07:12:01.0000] <annevk>
I once heard Ian suggest HTMLCollection should be part of the DOM specs

[07:12:02.0000] <zcorpan>
but under another name?

[07:12:03.0000] <annevk>
no

[07:12:04.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[07:13:00.0000] <annevk>
but having references from DOM Core to HTML5 and vice versa doesn't seem bad eiter

[07:13:01.0000] <annevk>
either*

[07:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think dom core should be standalone

[07:14:01.0000] <zcorpan>
but for now i'll reference html5

[07:14:02.0000] <annevk>
i agree with the sentiment, not sure if it'll work out

[07:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
uploaded new revision

[07:22:00.0000] <annevk>
any chance you can do HTML5/XMLHttpRequest-style IDL fragments rather than oldschool-DOM-spec-style IDL fragments?

[07:23:00.0000] <annevk>
eg, dropping "raises(DOMException)", dropping a lot of space characters and newlines

[07:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah i'll clean it up second-pass

[07:25:00.0000] <annevk>
you should prolly also keep some notes in the source of what is left out for now

[07:25:01.0000] <annevk>
at least, I would find that useful

[07:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[07:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
r3: add comments about what is dropped; added Text, Comment, DocumentType, ProcessingInstruction

[07:53:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i think i have all interfaces now; is there something i've missed?

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk>
all the interfaces you want I assume? several interfaces appear to be dropped

[07:57:00.0000] <annevk>
DocumentPosition is needed fwiw; we recently had to add support for that

[08:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah. ok

http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Ftc.labs.opera.com%2Fhtml%2Fimg%2Fusemap%2F002.htm ?

[08:06:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[08:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
map is flow content

[08:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
perhaps it should be changed to transparent phrasing?

[08:11:00.0000] <annevk>
I feel to see a good reason for why I should move the <map> out of the <p>

[08:15:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, fail

[08:21:00.0000] <annevk>
in case people were not convinced that proprietary is bad: http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/09/04/startups-in-chaos-as-adobes-flashpaper-discontinues/

[08:24:00.0000] <smedero>
It feels like an edge use-case but is there a reason to allow <map> inside of <p> for something like a sparkline with an image map that had pointers to expanded info about different data points? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline)

[08:24:01.0000] <smedero>
(i'm trying to bring up the whatwg list to see if that has been brought up before, but uh.. it is list.whatwg.org isn't responding for me...)

[08:26:00.0000] <smedero>
(ahh, now it is)

[08:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
since <map> doens't behave like a block in the parser it feels unintiutive to disallow it in p

[08:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(and it's rendered inline)

Hixie: why is "pre, code { font-size: inherit;" in http://www.whatwg.org/style/specification ?

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
How lovely - BeautifulSoup is giving me a <div> element whose parent is a <div> element whose only child is an <a> element

[10:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also, html5lib fails a zillion tests, so there's no way I can change anything without being quite likely to unknowingly introduce a regression

[10:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So earlier it was all "@headers is only used in generated content, so it doesn't matter that it's complex and easy to mess up" and today it's "but the USER wants to use @headers in handwriting, so we should let him"

[10:49:00.0000] <takkaria>
http://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2008-September/msg00018.html -- icky

[10:57:00.0000] <smedero>
Dashiva: Well it is also funny because Gez said he modified his example to "simplify the problem"

[10:58:00.0000] <smedero>
I don't think he redesigned it.... but it was modified in some form and I asked for a pointer the original so I can understand what was changed and I got zilch.

[10:58:01.0000] <smedero>
(it wasn't just changes to anonymize the data... columns and such were removed to "make it easier to understand")

[10:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Simplify the problem of getting people to accept it

[11:25:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, ping

[11:37:00.0000] <smedero>
FWIW, Gez got me a pointer to the unmodified complexdatatable example: http://juicystudio.com/wcag/tables/altcomplex.html

[11:38:00.0000] <smedero>
(More or less, includes extra columns at the end...)

[11:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. Renesis has an ASV compat Quirks Mode

[12:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how do I create an element in IE via JS with a particular scopeName and tagUrn?

[12:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe by declaring a prefix with namespaces.add(...) and then createElement('prefix:name')?

[12:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't know any other way

[12:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: thanks

[12:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: that works

[12:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
to the point of getting scopeName and tagUrn right

[12:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can I associate the scope name with an ActiveX control without inserting an <object> into the document?

[12:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
giving a clsid: URL as the third parameter of namespaces.add does not work

[12:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know how to make it any clearer to John Foliot, he seems to be totally missing the point of what I'm saying

[12:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't get why he can't comprehend that the proposed study is about seeing how effective longdesc is for users that currently have the ability to access it, nor why he doesn't understand why that would be useful

[12:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems crazy if <?import has a JS equivalent but <object>-based ActiveX hook doesn't

[12:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: "in and" fixed. thanks

[12:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: HtmlParser Javadoc fixed locally. thanks

[12:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What? There are AT apps that don't expose longdesc?

[12:57:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: There are AT apps that don't do ... lots of things.

[12:58:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: JAWS has exposed it since version 4.something.

[12:58:01.0000] <webben>
although in some recent versions, you've had to enable announcements for it.

[12:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: as far as i can tell he's not interested in improving accessibility, only in sounding like he's an expert and getting his ego stroked by getting his way

[12:58:03.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: that behavior appears to have changed back to announcing by default in current JAWS 10 Beta.

[12:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, fair enough. But honestly, did you clearly understand what the purpose of my proposed study, and why it would be useful?

[13:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just want to make sure its not me who's missing something

[13:00:01.0000] <Dashiva>
webben: Wasn't it so that most JAWS users rarely, if ever, upgraded? So if it's gone in the latest version, it's not a big deal

[13:01:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: "most". I'm not sure that's true. Certainly the lag time for upgrades is greater for commercial AT at hundreds of $ a shot than for free web browsers.

[13:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yes

[13:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: your proposal was exactly the kind of study we need to get objective data

[13:02:01.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: I'm not sure what the referent of "gone" is though.

[13:02:02.0000] <Dashiva>
webben: default announcement

[13:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: though next time i would phrase your hypothesis to sound like you agree with the side that isn't yours

[13:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: since the hypothesis doesn't matter (we get the same results either way) and the people who are clearly unable to understand how to do research would at least not get a knee jerk reaction against you

[13:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
Now all we need is infinite resources so we can carry out reliable user studies without worrying about their cost

[13:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: They'd probably knee-jerk just from the from address

[13:04:01.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: No. It's the other way round, I think. Default announcement has come _back_.

[13:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: But then they'll say the hypothesis is self-evident and there's no point doing new studies on it

[13:04:03.0000] <Dashiva>
So it was added, removed and then re-added? Quirky

[13:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, ok. I'll keep that in mind. I'm rewriting it as clearly as I possibly can so that there can be absolutely no confusion about what I mean

[13:05:01.0000] <webben>
Lachy: FWIW I agree that your proposed study would be a very good addition to information collected so far, though I don't think studies of this (human-tech interactions) sort tend to produce "irrefutable" results.

[13:05:02.0000] <Lachy>
webben, ok, fair enough.

[13:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: then you just respond "well then you wouldn't object to a study would you"

[13:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
studies never provide irrefutable results

[13:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
webben, my point was that the results would take us from having only observation and hypothesis closer to having a theory

[13:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
they can always be refuted by more studies that contradict them

[13:06:04.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Absolutely. It's not my word.

[13:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: They should object to resources being spent on that study instead of on something more interesting and informative and insightful

[13:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does IE support adding methods to Element prototype?

[13:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
as i understand it IE doesn't have prototypes

[13:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: IIRC, it does have for objects that don't count as host objects

[13:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
like Array.prototype

[13:12:02.0000] <webben>
Lachy: I think a useful addition to your proposed study would be to try and work out, if there's a difference, why.

[13:12:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I know this stuff is not supported for ActiveX-based XHR DOM nodes

[13:12:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should just test

[13:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
webben, any suggestion how?

[13:13:01.0000] <webben>
Lachy: well, qualitative observation during the process and asking people at the end would help I guess.

[13:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: right i mean for host objects

[13:13:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[13:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i take it your validator instance wouldn't be able to handle the load of a google blog pointing at it?

[13:14:01.0000] <hallvord>
hsivonen: AFAIK Element.prototype and friends is coming in the very latest beta of IE8

[13:14:02.0000] <hallvord>
..well, should have used past tense: came .. thing is I haven't tested it yet :)

[13:15:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: e.g. this might uncover whether (for example) people don't use longdesc because they don't expect it to work because of bad UA implementation (as with the guy in Joshue's video) or whether (for example) they miss the description link because of their navigation strategy.

[13:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
hallvord: really? wow

[13:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it probably wouldn't handle it :-(

[13:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
k

[13:15:04.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Couldn't Google host an instance of it (if that were okay with hsivonen)?

[13:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it would be interesting to see how badly it would melt down, though :-)

[13:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben: hsivonen might be able to port it to appengine, i don't know

[13:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if you had appengine for Java...

[13:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
which I suspect Google already has internally for deploying its own Java-based apps

[13:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think we've deployed any java-based apps on appengine

[13:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know what the plan is for that team, either, so i don't even know if java is on the cards :-)

[13:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Validator.nu is well-suited for scaling on an infrastructure that replicates the app automatically

[13:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
after all, it doesn't need write storage except for logs

[13:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and it doesn't need a login mechanism

[13:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so it could be put on a cloud computing platform without the usual BigTable or Amazon SimpleDB lock-in issues

[13:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it does have the issue that it wants to do *a lot* of initialization up front to build read-only data structures that are shared among threads

[13:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I figured that Validator.nu on a usual day requires less CPU and RAM than one EC2 compute unit provides

[13:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so currently, it doesn't make sense to invest in automatic scaling on EC2

[13:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hallvord: thanks.

[13:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm trying to come up with a way to route setAttributeNS calls to something else in IE without imposing a per-call cost on other browsers

[13:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I've been speculating about what's next for App Engine

[13:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and since Google has a small set of supported languages, Java is the obvious runner up after Python

[13:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
that does seem like a good guess

[13:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
(i really don't know what that team is doing)

[13:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but I figured providing App Engine for Java would need new restrictions on the VM

[13:26:04.0000] <hsivonen>
and probably a class loading model that isn't transparently compatible with a normal JVM

[13:27:00.0000] <smedero>
mostly unrelated but there's a 20% project going to get Perl into App Engine... so there's a chance that Java could be a 20% as well.

[13:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but I wouldn't be too surprised if Google hacked up yet another environment that uses the Java language without the full JVM runtime semantics

[13:30:00.0000] <hallvord>
hsivonen: see

[13:30:01.0000] <hallvord>

[13:30:02.0000] <hallvord>
http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2008/09/ie8b2_roundup.html

[13:30:03.0000] <hsivonen>
smedero: I'd expect Java to require more drastic VM hacking than Perl

[13:30:04.0000] <smedero>
indeed.

[13:30:05.0000] <hsivonen>
hallvord: thanks

[13:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
"comments are HTMLCommentElement interfaces and inherit from Element" lol

[13:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
"Early on, we had to decide if we wanted to implement a "fake" layer for the constructor/prototype objects that looked identical to the W3C model, or to expose what we had, warts and all."

[13:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
...and they picked the warts... because of their commitment to standards?

[13:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"Object doesn't support this property or method" 

[13:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh

[13:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd appreciate it if IE said which property

[13:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
this one

[13:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
duh

[13:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, I think this HTML5 parsing thing can be programmed on top of IE eventually, although I'm failing ATM

[13:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
my proof of concept does work: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/ie-namespaces.html

[13:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
now if WebKit rendered dynamically inserted SVG...

[13:41:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: What are you trying to do exactly?

[13:41:01.0000] <webben>
implement a HTML5 parser as an activex control?

[13:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: I'm trying to emulate createElementNS for MathML and SVG namespaces in IE7+MathPlayer+Renesis

[13:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: so that the Validator.nu HTML Parser when compiled with GWT could work in IE as well

[13:43:00.0000] <webben>
ah okay

[14:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
reloading my test page crashes IE7

[14:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: iirc, attributes can't be namespaced in ie, though i don't know how the plugins handle it

[14:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, webben yt?

[14:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, webben, anyone else, could you review this before I send it? http://lachy.id.au/temp/study.txt

[14:55:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: I think the distinction between a user agent requiring users to change their configuration to be aware of long descriptions (e.g. earlier versions of JAWS) and announcing them by default (e.g. current JAWS 10 Beta on reading, iCab on hover) is significant.

[14:56:00.0000] <webben>
although I realize John only says "natively support" in the quote.

[14:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
webben, I wasn't aware of that. What should I say about it?

[14:59:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: I guess a prelude to this study would need to be some sort of agreement about what a decent implementation of longdesc might do and whether any current implementations do it.

[14:59:01.0000] <webben>
If none do, you'd need to introduce an test implementation that does (e.g. by hacking NVDA perhaps).

[14:59:02.0000] <Lachy>
I was just going to have the test run with each user's normal software and setup, to make it as realistic as possible

[15:00:00.0000] <webben>
realistic to what?

[15:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
to the way they use it use it normally

[15:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
it would be a bit unfair to have the test performed by a user who is unfamiliar with the software being used

[15:03:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: I agree that it introduces other complications. But I don't think a test of bad implementations would tell one much about the actual point at issue (at least from my understanding of the point at issue).

[15:04:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: So I guess I'm saying you _might_ have to take software users are familiar with and modify it somewhat.

[15:04:01.0000] <webben>
I'm not saying: make a brand new screen reader or browser or something ;)

[15:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't like that idea, because that would require informing the user of what changes have been made, which would bias the results due to having additional information about the test that they would not otherwise have

[15:07:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: Hmm. Couldn't you tell them that you've modified it but not tell them how?

[15:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
in what way would you want to modify it?

[15:07:02.0000] <webben>
for that matter, actually, what's wrong with them knowing about the feature?

[15:08:00.0000] <webben>
otherwise you're not just testing whether the feature can do a given task, but also the initial intuitiveness of the feature's presentation, which could bias the study in both directions

[15:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
because if the users didn't know about the longdesc before hand, and are supposedly representative of the general population, then informing them about the feature would influence the result

[15:09:01.0000] <webben>
e.g. people might think, hmm, what's this long description thing, must try that. or people might think, hmm, dunno what that is, better not try that.

[15:10:00.0000] <webben>
yes, but you're not trying to test people's knowledge of features, as far as I can tell.

[15:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm trying to test how useful a feature is in practice given the current, near the top of the range ATs

[15:11:00.0000] <webben>
okay, but that's not the actual point being debated.

[15:12:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: again, that's basically testing implementations not the concept.

[15:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm. ok. So then we would have to set a baseline for the ATs that can be used.

[15:14:01.0000] <webben>
Lachy: yeah, exactly, it very much depends on working out what a "good" implementation would do.

[15:15:00.0000] <webben>
which isn't necessarily trivial.

[15:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
fair enough. I suppose that's fair given how we would test the proposed headers algorithm

[15:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
which would need modified UAs/ATs to do it

[15:15:03.0000] <webben>
that is to say, it's easy to distinguish very bad from better implementations, but hard to distinguish very good from better implementations.

[15:16:00.0000] <webben>
e.g. Firefox native longdesc implementation is pants. the longdesc firefox add-on clearly improves it.

[15:16:01.0000] <webben>
iCab is an improvement again (because of the on-hover indicator).

[15:17:00.0000] <webben>
- that's for sighted users.

[15:17:01.0000] <webben>
I'm pretty sure that defaulting to announcing longdesc is "better" than defaulting to not announcing it.

[15:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
I added a paragraph saying "We need to set a set of baseline feature requirements for the assistive technologies that can be used. I'll leave this for those who are more familiar with them,"

[15:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
I sent it

[15:36:01.0000] <annevk>
for features with no browser implementations,  that's pretty impressive

[15:44:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/12/13/MegaXML (credit: tag)

[15:53:00.0000] <annevk>
/me added it to http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Namespace_confusion

[16:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
we want to test implementations and not the concept

[16:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
because users interact with the implementations, not the concepts

[16:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yeah. But we should let them use the optimal implementation. If the beta of jaws 10 notifies the user by default as webben said, then that's fair enough

[16:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
making them use implementations they know to be flawed isn't likely to be accepted

[16:21:01.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Testing implementations is a worthwhile activity as long as one is clear about what that actually means.

[16:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I agree, modifying the implementation well beyond would be considered a typical setup to could bias the results too much, so there needs to be limits

[16:24:00.0000] <webben>
I suspect that radical implementations aren't necessary, but I'm not quite sure what other people's view of an optimal implementation would be.

[16:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
I would prefer it to be a near default setup, with additional options only set based on each users' normal configuration

[16:26:00.0000] <webben>
e.g. I think JAWS 10 Beta seems reasonable for a blind user (not sure about deafblind) and iCab 4.x seems reasonable for a mouse-wielding sighted fellow.

[16:26:01.0000] <webben>
the problem with JAWS 10 Beta is ... it's beta.

[16:26:02.0000] <Lachy>
how is iCab considered assistive technology?

[16:28:00.0000] <webben>
From my perspective, these are just tools and sets of tools users with various abilities use to consume content.

[16:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
but they need to be users for whom long descriptions are considered the most useful

[16:29:00.0000] <webben>
I don't think long descriptions are necessarily more useful to blind people than colorblind people etc.

[16:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
John's complaint is that since no-one uses longdesc on the web, and because it's a relatively new feature in ATs, most users don't know about it, nor query for it.

[16:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
While I see that as a fundamental flaw with its design, he seems to think there is hope for it

[16:31:00.0000] <webben>
longdesc (as opposed to long descriptions) is useful (well, in _theory_) to people navigating non-linearly or any other case where you might want automatic extraction

[16:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
but if the default configuration was to notify the user about its presence, then that could potentially fix one of the problems. But I'm still not sure how to fix the problem of authors not using it

[16:33:00.0000] <webben>
I think that's like trying to fix the problem of Flickr not using alt.

[16:33:01.0000] <webben>
Lachy: In so far as authors might _want_ to use it, they've repeatedly been given guidance not to use it because of broken implementations.

[16:34:00.0000] <webben>
I think that guidance was wrong (because facilitating programmatic association is helpful, I think).

[16:34:01.0000] <webben>
I also agree that providing links to things or including descriptions on the page is good.

[16:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm just not convinced that longdesc has any advantages over ordinary links, and ordinary links have the benefit of being available to everyone

[16:38:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: I'm quite interested, on behalf of _future_ user agents, in potential mechanisms to avoid redundancy during linear processing while still facilitating the automatic addition of context during non-linear processing.

[16:38:01.0000] <webben>
though I think link text is a much more important case for this than img/longdesc

[16:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
authors do use longdesc

[16:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
but they almost uniformly use it in harmful ways

[16:39:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: I suspect if more implementations were like iCab there would have been less harmful use. Hard to prove though :)

[16:40:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: It might be interesting to know why authors who did things wrong, did things wrong.

[16:41:00.0000] <webben>
the most confusing aspect of longdesc seems to be that it's a URI. I guess better naming might have helped there - descriptionref or something.

[16:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
what does iCab do exactly?

[16:43:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: 1. If you hover over an img with longdesc it changes the cursor to a arrow with a little doc icon. (iCab uses cursor hints for various things.)

[16:46:00.0000] <webben>
2. If you open the context menu on such an img, one of the options is Show long description of Image. If you click that, it opens the referenced URL in a new window. (not that keen on the new window as opposed to new tab business myself, but there we go)

[16:46:01.0000] <webben>
So it's roughly similar to (say) viewing an image in its own tab in Firefox.

[16:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
is the description more useful than just zooming the image and giving a high-contrast vie?

[16:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
view

[16:47:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: I'd imagine that would depend on the image and the user.

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
can you name a case where an author would create a description that was detailed enough that it was more useful than zooming the picture?

[16:49:00.0000] <webben>
well, where the picture isn't very good to start with would be one example.

[16:49:01.0000] <webben>
i'm not sure how good high-contrast conversions are.

[16:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
wouldn't a description in such cases be better given inline for everyone to enjoy?

[16:49:03.0000] <webben>
i.e. how bad the information loss is

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems to me that whenever an image could be described in detail, that the description becomes generally useful and should just be an integral part of the page, not hidden away in a dedicated attribute

[16:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
webben, I don't think low such quality images are a typical use case

[16:51:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: dedicated attributes are an integral part of the page.

[16:51:01.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Where are the visible links to open images in their own tab? Or print them? Or download them? Or copy them to the clipboard?

[16:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
I agree with Hixie. I think it would be better to encourage authors to provide information about images designed for everyone, which has the effect of helping those who can't see the image well either

[16:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
webben: there's no markup for those either

[16:52:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Sure there is. It's called src.

[16:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
webben: well then linking to a description on another page is called <a href=""> and including a description inline is called <p>...</p>.

[16:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
sure, but src isn't meant to be human consumable information. The image is

[16:53:01.0000] <webben>
Lachy: likewise with the description.

[16:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
webben: basic language design -- accessibility should be inherent, people don't think about it and if you make it separate they will screw it up.

[16:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[16:53:04.0000] <Lachy>
<a href="description"><img src="foo"></a>

[16:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
longdesc="" has been shown to be a lost cause

[16:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
unless new information comes along, there's no point arguing it

[16:55:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Well, yeah I just don't buy the "shown" bit. Can't really help that. :)

[16:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
have you read http://blog.whatwg.org/the-longdesc-lottery ?

[16:55:02.0000] <webben>
yeah

[16:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
well if you don't think that shows it's a lost cause, i don't know what to tell you

[16:56:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Yes, I don't see how you can separate the concept from the implementations and the guidance given.

[16:56:01.0000] <webben>
*how you can't, rather

[16:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't matter what the implementations do

[16:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
over 96% _of images with longdesc_ have bogus longdesc

[16:57:02.0000] <webben>
I think that statistic is heavily determined by the implementations and the guidance given.

[16:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
there is no implementation stategy that can turn crap into usable content

[16:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
that statistic is actual web content.

[16:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't matter what causes it

[16:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's already caused.

[16:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
we could argue about whether to introduce a _new_ attribute

[16:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
and maybe implementations could support that better and we could avoid this problem

[16:58:05.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Oh, yeah, when I'm talking about the "concept", I'm talking about the "concept".

[16:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
however, one has to wonder why it would take 10 years for implementations of longdesc="" to come along, if it's such a great idea

[16:59:01.0000] <webben>
Hixie: iCab's implementation has been around longer than that.

[16:59:02.0000] <webben>
it's not a recent innovation I mean

[16:59:03.0000] <webben>
what i'm not clear about is when JAWS didn't read longdesc by default and why


2008-09-06
[17:00:00.0000] <webben>
looking at the manual when they introduced it, seems it originally was read by default

[17:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
It'll be interesting to see if anyone actually volunteers to carry out that study, or whether they're just going to continue saying the study is flawed and push for longdesc anyway

[17:00:02.0000] <webben>
then they stopped, and now they've started again

[17:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
either way, I'm confident that the study would show that longdesc is useless regardless of the implementation used

[17:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
having seen blind users browse the web, i agree

[17:03:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: fwiw looking at the lottery article again, looks like one could repair a lot of the longdesc attributes by (a) fixing Wikipedia and (b) not exposing a UI for certain machine-detectable cases where it's wrong.

[17:04:00.0000] <webben>
e.g. "not a valid url", "blank", 404

[17:07:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: I suppose you'd also have to look at how much of the incorrect content is useful content anyways to get an idea of how much it would affect people.

[17:07:01.0000] <webben>
wikipedia is definitely useful content.

[17:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
even when you ignored those, the fraction of useful longdesc values was still below 1%

[17:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
(based on a hand inspection of the remaining pages)

[17:09:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: sorry, 1% of what?

[17:09:01.0000] <webben>
the article mentions a 1% figure, but that's of all longdescs in the sample.

[17:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you discard all pages that didn't have longdesc, then discard all pages that had mechanically-observably-bad longdesc, and then look at the remaining pages (a tiny fraction of the web) and examine the longdescs by hand, you find that it is still below 1% of _those_ that are actually useful.

[17:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
we're talking about an insanely small fraction of the web here

[17:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
certainly far below the nominal 80% that we normally target for features

[17:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hello all

[17:11:02.0000] <webben>
I may just be tired, but I can't reconcile that with the article's stats

[17:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think the article mentions the final step

[17:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't talk to mark about that iirc

[17:12:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: is that sample still extant somewhere? could it still be documented?

[17:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me remembers stargate is on tonight :-)

[17:14:00.0000] <webben>
it might actually change between now and HTML5 being finished actually.

[17:15:00.0000] <webben>
if Wikipedia got fixed and large sites started using it for programmatic associations to diagrams.

[17:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
webben: it was on the web somewhere, probably one of the files on junkyard.damowmow.com

[17:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
webben: it might be linked from the whatwg wiki

[17:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Longdesc_usage ?

[17:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
(That's not from Hixie's data set, but it's the only detailed manual analysis I remember being done)

[17:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
not the one i was thinking of, but that shows much the same result

[17:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok, gotta go, meeting

[17:20:00.0000] <blooberry>
Philip`: I've got some results that might be interesting there too.

[17:20:01.0000] <webben>
some of those are machine detectable and some I wouldn't regard as a problem

[17:25:00.0000] <takkaria>
oo, I did that analysis

[17:25:01.0000] <takkaria>
always meant to do more

[17:26:00.0000] <webben>
takkaria: do you still have a link to it?

[17:27:00.0000] <takkaria>
that was the one Philip pointed at

[17:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
blooberry: Have you published any of the results so far?

[17:28:00.0000] <webben>
the problem with these numbers is they're very susceptible to changes in authoring practices from small codebases.

[17:28:01.0000] <blooberry>
philip`: Trying to get that done presently. Hoping to have it out soon. 8-}

[17:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
webben: yeah, well.  Hixie gave me a larger sample which I need to investigate at some point

[17:31:00.0000] <blooberry>
Philip`: Would a summary be more interesting or the actual longdesc data?

[17:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
blooberry: I'm not interested in longdesc at all, so someone else might have a better idea of what'd be good :-)

[17:33:00.0000] <blooberry>
Philip`: ok. Good point. ;-}

[17:33:01.0000] <blooberry>
/me reads back and notices where the confusion arose

[18:25:00.0000] <Philip`>

I like it how XMLPorn.jpg was from a talk called "Practical RDF"

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I tend to send a link to XMLPorn.jpg when friends are having trouble with Namespaces

[01:20:00.0000] <gavin>
google doesn't know about XMLPorn.jpg - link?

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
btw, if anyone has a solution for scaling Validator.nu hosting up in a way that could handle spikes from Google Blog, digg or somesuch without raising the fixed cost to the level of paying for the peak capacity all the time, I'd like to hear it

[05:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If they're all validating the same site(s), caching might help. But I suppose that's not the common case.

[05:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: in general, though, making a validator cache input is a sure way to cause confusion when author edits and revalidates but has a bug in cache control

[05:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it would be interesting to see, though, what the limits of the current setup are

[05:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
since I got rid of Schematron on the HTML5 side, there haven't been cases where the server would have died due to load

[05:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, if the same IP submits twice, you could invalidate. Or you could hash the markup or something to detect changes. I'm not a caching expert, but it should be doable. :)

[05:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and the previous load deaths were on the Apache side--not in the Java process

[05:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Less time per request would help the apache end as well, though

[05:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess the first step of serious scaling would be to have 3 IP addresses each with a separate process: Apache for static files. Jetty for html5.validator.nu. Jetty for validator.nu and parsetree.validator.nu

[05:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Gandi's pricing scales down better than Amazon's

[05:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
on my current host, changing the VM setup cost money and takes 24 hours

[05:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but so far, I haven't seen any system for any hosting provider that automated allocation of extra resources during a peak for Java hosting

[05:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
like App Engine does for Python hosting

[05:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Amazon doesn't scale down well

[05:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
because you have to host your persistent instance elsewhere

[05:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and it sucks that everyone has to reinvent infrastructural solutions for detecting the need for capacity and instructing EC2 to allocate it

[05:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps in the future, automatically spawnable Xen VMs and Amazon ESB functionality becomes commoditized, and App Engine-like software on top of those becomes commoditized, too

[06:01:00.0000] <tusho>
Why can't I put <nav> in <header>...?

[06:02:00.0000] <tusho>
My navigation bar is in my header.

[06:02:01.0000] <tusho>
Like this:

[06:02:02.0000] <tusho>
<header><h1>Site name</h1> <nav><ul>...</ul></nav></header>

[06:10:00.0000] <tusho>
:\

[06:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tusho: I'm just implementing what Hixie wrote in the spec here.

[06:17:01.0000] <tusho>
Yea, but I'm asking why

[06:17:02.0000] <tusho>
It seems very silly

[06:19:00.0000] <tusho>
If nobody gives me a good justification then I'll just be invalid until it's fixed ;)

[06:35:00.0000] <tusho>
Nobody want to offer an explanation? :P

[06:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
Probably everyone who knows (e.g. Hixie) is asleep :-)

[06:36:00.0000] <tusho>
/me throws a bucket of water onto Hixie

[06:37:00.0000] <tusho>
Hmm.

[06:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: perhaps s/e.g./i.e./ in this case? :-)

[06:37:02.0000] <tusho>
I wonder how many invalid pagers there are claiming to be HTML5 in the world.

[06:37:03.0000] <tusho>
*pages

[06:37:04.0000] <tusho>
(I mean, unintentionally)

[06:37:05.0000] <tusho>
Probably very little, as only the kind of people who would know about & actually use HTML 5 are the ones who would validate their pages as a matter of routine 

[06:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tusho: an infinite number of Google Maps pages

[06:38:01.0000] <tusho>
google maps pages claim to be html5?

[06:38:02.0000] <tusho>
weird

[06:38:03.0000] <tusho>
yes they do

[06:38:04.0000] <tusho>
is that intentionally claiming to be html5?

[06:38:05.0000] <Philip`>
Infinite? I thought they only mapped a finite area

[06:38:06.0000] <tusho>
or just coincidence of the doctype

[06:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I'd expect possible Google Maps URIs to be infinite, but there might be limits

[06:39:01.0000] <tusho>
Philip`: you can navigate outside of the map

[06:39:02.0000] <tusho>
and it also loops

[06:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
tusho: But that might just be a client-side effect, with the server only recognising a fixed-size rectangular set of coordinates

[06:39:04.0000] <tusho>
Philip`: Well, no, navigating outside the map doesn't wall in that

[06:40:00.0000] <tusho>
http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=89.999508,-127.96875&spn=0.001249,113.554688&z=3

[06:40:01.0000] <tusho>
*fall in that

[06:41:00.0000] <tusho>
But yea, is that intentional?

[06:41:01.0000] <tusho>
The doctype being HTML5's.

[06:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
tusho: I suspect it's intentional

[06:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think the client sends a request to some URL asking for a piece of the map that is off the edge of the world, and gets back a blank response - it just doesn't send the request at all, since it knows how big the world is

[06:41:04.0000] <tusho>
hsivonen: Why would they do that?... Claim to be HTML5 (for no particular gain, as far as I can see, they don't use any of its features) and then be _invalid_ HTML5

[06:41:05.0000] <tusho>
Philip`: It's still a unique page.

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tusho: perhaps they want the Standards Mode in Gecko, WebKit, Opera and IE <= 7

[06:42:01.0000] <tusho>
hsivonen: use an html4 doctype?

[06:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(it seems they want IE8 to emulate IE7)

[06:42:03.0000] <hsivonen>
tusho: costs more bytes

[06:43:00.0000] <tusho>
hsivonen: I'm sure even google could handle <!DOCTYPE html "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"> :P

[06:43:01.0000] <tusho>
But yea, it just seems odd to me.

[06:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
tusho: Oh, right, the actual maps.google.com URI itself?

[06:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
Sorry, I'm a bit slow :-p

[06:43:04.0000] <tusho>
Philip`: I think the HTML source will change too a bit

[06:44:00.0000] <tusho>
relating to the query params

[06:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why does Google send <meta http-equiv=X-UA-Compatible content="IE=EmulateIE7" /> instead of (a) saving space by omitting the quotes and the trailing slash, or (b) sending it via HTTP instead?

[06:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
They're really quite profligate with their bandwidth

[06:46:00.0000] <tusho>
a script is run through the theme on http://eso-std.org/ before it's uploaded

[06:46:01.0000] <tusho>
that strips all the whitespace from the php & css files

[06:46:02.0000] <tusho>
to make it go a little faster :P

[06:46:03.0000] <tusho>
Probably misguided.

[06:46:04.0000] <tusho>
Seemed to have an effect, although likely just a placebo

[06:47:00.0000] <tusho>
But yeah.

[06:47:01.0000] <tusho>
It's a bit odd for google to waste space like that

[06:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
Browsers need a pretty-printing 'view source' feature

[06:47:03.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps next to YouTube, nothing else matters

[06:47:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: indeed

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: and JS debuggers operating on the pretty-printed line numbers

[06:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
tusho: The reason you can't put <nav> in <header> is that <header> doesn't quite mean "page header"

[06:48:02.0000] <tusho>
jgraham: Yes, but it means 'header of the containing element', right?

[06:48:03.0000] <jgraham>
It means something like "title box"

[06:48:04.0000] <tusho>
So <header> in <body>...

[06:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
<header> is designed for things like <heading><h1>Yet Another Weblog</h1><h2>With a witty subtitle</h2></header> where you want to associate the title and the subtitle but don't want to have the subtitle appear in a table of contents

[06:51:01.0000] <tusho>
Hm.

[06:51:02.0000] <tusho>
jgraham: Well, how would you improve this?

[06:51:03.0000] <tusho>
<nav><ul><li id="site-name"><a href="http://eso-std.org"><h1>ESO</h1></a></li><li><a href="http://eso-std.org/archive">Archive</a></li></ul></nav>

[06:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
tusho: What is wrong with what you have?

[06:54:01.0000] <tusho>
jgraham: I dunno, the placement of the <h1> just seems a bit weird.

[06:55:00.0000] <tusho>
In a list item.

[06:55:01.0000] <tusho>
And tbh if you look at http://eso-std.org/ I'm not sure it belongs in the <anv>

[06:55:02.0000] <tusho>
Archive, and any other links that are displayed on the right, are the nav bar to me

[06:55:03.0000] <tusho>
I think header{h1,nav{ul}} would be more appropriate

[06:55:04.0000] <tusho>
but as I said & you expalined, that's incorrect

[06:55:05.0000] <tusho>
(and invalid)

[06:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think that only makes sense under a different definition of "header" than the one HTML 5 is currently aiming for. You could s/header/section/ I guess

[06:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
FWIW I have a crappy tool for producing outlines of HTML5 documents here http://james.html5.org/outliner.html

[06:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: does it have random access to the tree or does it just sweep it in document order?

[07:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: The tool? It has random access. I don't remember if it uses it ore not

[07:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/ore/or/

[07:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: ok

[07:02:01.0000] <tusho>
jgraham: so you'd reccomend <section id="header">?

[07:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
tusho: Well there is a disdvantage that <section><h1>ESO</h1></section><article><h2>Foo</h2></article> won't have ESO as a parent of Foo in the outline

[07:06:00.0000] <tusho>
Ah.

[07:06:01.0000] <tusho>
jgraham: Should I just do <div id="header"> then?

[07:06:02.0000] <jgraham>
So just <body><h1>ESO</h1><nav></nav><article><h2>Foo</h2></article> seems OK

[07:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
tusho: Or use div if you need it

[07:06:04.0000] <tusho>
jgraham: I do need it, if you take a look at the page I need to group the header and the nav bar

[07:08:00.0000] <tusho>
Alrighty.

[07:08:01.0000] <tusho>
Done.

[07:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>

[08:03:00.0000] <csarven>
Is @longdesc dropped in HTML5?

[08:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
csarven: Yes, in the sense that it's not in the current draft

[08:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
(since it's very rarely used, and when it is used it's almost always used wrongly, so it doesn't seem to be a good solution to whatever the problem is)

[08:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
I thought the point of @longdesc was to act as flamebait for public-html

[08:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
I seriously don't understand any of the arguments that have been going on around it

[08:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
Like the ones that go: 1) Users never encounter longdesc 2) Therefore it is hard to tell if they would find it useful 3) Therefore we must leave it in so that it can be used more

[08:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
4) Even though we have no expectation of that happening any time soon

[08:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
I mean, as far as I can tell that is an exact summary of one of David's emails

[08:23:00.0000] <annevk>
I believe the argument is that it's the fault of user agents that the feature failed. So that we should first have good implementations of it before we can determine whether the feature is actually bad.

[08:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
That didn't seem to be what David was arguning, but I find him quite difficult to follow sometimes so I might be wrong

[08:25:00.0000] <annevk>
Oh ok, well, that's one of the arguments I hear now and then anyway. If an accessibility feature failed, it's because of UAs, not because it's simply a bad feature.

[08:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
Also, since very few authors actually test with AT it seems very unlikely that better AT support would lead to substantially more widespead usage

[08:25:02.0000] <annevk>
(It's also so wrong to think of things as "accessibility features", but whatever.)

[08:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: The "accessibility features" thing seems to be one of the fundamental points of disagreement

[08:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems to me that there's also tacit disagreement on how long the trial window for a given feature is

[08:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, it seems that some people think that 10 years should be enough

[08:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and others want to give the feature a chance still

[08:59:00.0000] <takkaria>
heh, that is madness

[08:59:01.0000] <takkaria>
"Many of us have done real work on issues like @headers, @alt, @summary, including but not limited to: ... Attending teleconferences"

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
I hope I can count "making snide comments on IRC" as real work

[09:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think I'm making a more useful contribution by not making all the snide comments I can think of on IRC

[09:27:00.0000] <takkaria>
I have nowhere else to express incredulity :/

[09:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't complaining about it :-)

[09:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: I'm not complaining.

[09:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's just the "scientists are corrupt" post somewhat riled me

[09:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me must have skipped over that post

[09:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
"It has been known for some time that some scientists skew their

[09:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
research to gain favor in the eyes of their peers and to gain fame"

[09:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
"When there is an economic interest involved one can be virtually

[09:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
guaranteed that the full facts will not come out, it's naive to

[09:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
suppose otherwise."

[09:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
The first statement is true but I don't see any justification for the second

[09:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed. It's a crazy generalization

[09:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that these are not the snide comments

[09:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Fortunately I'm only a computer scientist so I don't have to even pretend to do real science

[09:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't remember when he last read a paper that was based on a hypothesis - it always seems to be "we built this system because we thought it'd be interesting, and here's how we did it, and look how neat it is"

[09:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
Many astrophysics papers are "We did these observations and got these cool results. Maybe it works like this." where "this" is not necessarily a unique explaination

[09:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
(you generallly need a hypothesis to get telescope time in the first place though)

[09:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Nowadays anyone can get virtually unlimited computer time with no justification from the box sitting under their desk, so we don't even need to do that :-(

[09:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
and if you have greater requirements and need a dozen machines, you can just run them all as VMs in the box sitting under your desk

[10:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?sample=21&qprid=43&qpcustom=Chrome+0.2 - that doesn't seem to have taken long to have mostly flattened off

[10:08:00.0000] <takkaria>
I wonder what the figure will be in a month

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
(http://getclicky.com/global-marketshare-statistics gives a significantly different absolute value, but seems to have the same one-day growth and then a slow decline)

[10:11:00.0000] <takkaria>
nice to see that 7% of people are on ff3 so soon after release

[10:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Automatic updates are a great idea :-)

[10:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me nudges the Opera people

[10:12:02.0000] <takkaria>
I didn't think ff2 automatically updated to ff3 yet

[10:12:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Actually it's fine for me since Gentoo upgrades Opera automatically)

[10:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: Well, it's automatic once you click the right button in the automatically-popped-up dialog, I think

[10:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
I thought I read in meeting minutes somewhere that it was being delayed until 3.0.2 or something

[10:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[10:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't at all sure

[10:16:00.0000] <takkaria>
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox3.1/StatusMeetings/2008-08-12#Firefox_2.0.0.17_.2F_3.0.2

"3.0.2 will be the version which we eventually offer as a major update"

[10:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Fair enough

[10:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'm sure I've heard people complaining that they're using FF2 and it keeps nagging them to update to FF3, though :-)

[10:19:00.0000] <takkaria>
ah well

[10:19:01.0000] <takkaria>
who knows? :)

[10:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, someone should have told me the Chromium SVN repository was going to use 1.9GB of space, before I downloaded it

[10:43:00.0000] <tusho>
well

[10:43:01.0000] <tusho>
i just got a report from someone that their firefox was "all different"

[10:43:02.0000] <tusho>
sure enough it was ff3

[10:43:03.0000] <tusho>
they said it did an update thingy

[10:43:04.0000] <tusho>
so...

Lachy: Can you live with straight hair, not green hair?

[11:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Straight hair is not quite as extreme nor as likely to result in people laughing at you in the street :-(

[11:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Okay okay okay…

[11:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Will having it green and straight do?

[11:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I've been bullied into this for tonight.

/me changes topic to 'WHATWG (HTML5) -- http://www.whatwg.org/ -- Logs: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/ -- Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks! -- gsnedders has green hair, photos coming really soon :-)'

[12:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, green hair is non-negotiable. But why does it have to be straight?

[12:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: It is green now

[12:23:02.0000] <gsnedders>
And curly

[12:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, not entirely green

[12:23:04.0000] <gsnedders>
But mostly

[12:23:05.0000] <Lachy>
good

[12:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/good/crazy/

[12:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, crazy is good.

[12:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
we're all crazy in here

[12:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders about correlation vs causation

[12:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Are we here because we're crazy, or are we crazy because we're here, or is there an external cause of both situations, or no cause at all?)

[12:34:01.0000] <takkaria>
this place doesn't make you crazy, just slowly more realistic

[12:34:02.0000] <takkaria>
so my guess is option three or four

[12:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think we only stick around because we're crazy. The non-crazy people tend leave pretty quickly when they see the kind of nonsense we talk about in here

[12:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders why the photos are taking so long

[12:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders could be using a non-digitial camera and I hear those can take a little while to develop.

[12:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I don't know, I haven't used one of those for years

[12:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
I know for a fact that gsnedders has a digital camera. However I guess he might be using a manual camera and developing in his kitchen. In black and white.

[12:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
That would somewhat defeat the point

[12:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
w00t! gsnedders will look hilarious with black hair :-)

[13:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me adds more people to his list of people to whom never to respond

[13:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
it's interesting how people's responses to me have ignored the real issue, and instead focussed on irrelevant crap

[13:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
on public-html

[13:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
and how Laura took what I said way out of context

[14:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Because the author did not know how to make the @longdesc attribute accessible for sighted users."

[14:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Why put it in a hidden attribute if you want to make it visible?

[14:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Those AT tools that *do* support @longdesc are generally configured so that announcing @longdesc is a toggle ON setting; it is toggled off by default."

[14:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me facepalms

[14:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, that was my reaction too

[14:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
in fact, that was pretty much my reaction to the messages from Laura, PTW, David and John

[14:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
webben mentioned yesterday that longdesc announcement was on by default when JAWS first added it, and it was later turned off

[14:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Which is pretty much unconditional surrender

[14:37:00.0000] <jruderman>
turned off by default *in jaws*?

[14:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
apparently it's on by default in the jaws 10 beta though

[14:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
 <webben> Dashiva: JAWS has exposed it since version 4.something.

[14:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
 <webben> although in some recent versions, you've had to enable announcements for it.

[14:38:02.0000] <Dashiva>
 <webben> Dashiva: that behavior appears to have changed back to announcing by default in current JAWS 10 Beta.

[14:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(and I wouldn't be surprised if it's off by default in v10 final)

[15:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if gsnedders parents are making him shave his head

[15:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, finally John has sent some real evidence to support his case. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Sep/0222.html

[16:08:00.0000] <webben_>
Lachy: The MSDN documentation he cites is somewhat bungled I think. I think what they meant to say is that they now expose longdesc directly via MSAA and that they no longer show alt as tooltip (based on my own experimentation with Beta 2 + http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=43)

[16:08:01.0000] <webben_>
that is, they expose the longdesc URI.

[16:10:00.0000] <webben_>
whether it's a good idea to dump that in accDescription seems a bit dubious

[16:10:01.0000] <webben_>
but maybe they're trying to work around fundamental limitations in MSAA.

[16:11:00.0000] <webben_>
I can't get it to display as a tooltip at any rate, and personally I doubt that would be a great implementation.

[16:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dumping the URI into a textual description field? That seems likely to encourage incorrect usage of the attribute, if anything

[16:13:00.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: the complication is accDescription may not be used for a textual description (at least by consumers in the know about IE, which is each reader produced after release)

[16:14:00.0000] <webben_>
as I understand it, MSAA is quite limited and getting a complex application exposed to it properly (e.g. an office suite, or a browser) involves a lot of hackery.

[16:15:00.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: see http://www.mozilla.org/access/windows/msaa-server for Gecko's notes on the subject

[16:15:01.0000] <webben_>
iAccessible2 is standardization based on such overloading of MSAA.

[16:16:00.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: for example, an AT might just use the presence of an accDescription to tell it to present an announcement that there's a longdesc present and provide a mechanism to access it.

[16:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries AccExplorer

[16:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
With IE8b2, on an image with longdesc, it says "Description: images/small_puppy.txt"

[16:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, well, whatever is implemented, it's still not enough until there is evidence that the implementations are even usable by those who need it

[16:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
so it does seem to be putting the (relative) URI (or whatever the attribute value is) in the 'description' field

[16:18:03.0000] <Lachy>
and that the increased usage of longdesc by authors can be verified to be significant enough

[16:22:00.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: what's in accValue out of interest?

[16:22:01.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: (I'm just looking at http://www.mozilla.org/access/windows/msaa-server#Dueling_text_equivalents )

[16:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
webben_: Would that be what AccExplorer calls "Value"?

[16:22:03.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: I suspect so, yeah.

[16:22:04.0000] <Philip`>
If so, that's the absolute image URI

[16:22:05.0000] <webben_>
ah okay

[16:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
(i.e. it's actually resolved to an absolute URI, rather than just being the attribute value)

[16:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
and "Name" is the alt value

[16:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
(In Gran Paradiso 3.0.1, Name is the alt text, and Description and Value are empty)

[16:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Opera 9.5 is the same)

[16:30:01.0000] <webben_>
strange.

[16:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The Inspect tool shows the same, and interestingly it lists ancestors with labels like '"p" [ BUG? State/Role should not be a string ]' in Firefox)

[16:35:00.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms696156(VS.85).aspx : Remarks section is interesting

[16:35:01.0000] <webben_>
"This property provides a textual equivalent of the object for the user. The description should be similar to the text supplied with the ALT attribute in HTML, which is the text that is displayed to describe images for people using text-only browsers."

[16:35:02.0000] <webben_>
"However, some controls use this property to store extra information about the control that is not related to a textual equivalent."

[16:35:03.0000] <webben_>
(i.e. overloading it, presumably)

[16:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, also, in Firefox, for "Value" Inspect says "[Error: getting string: hr=0x80004005 - Unspecified error]", so it's not quite just an empty string or missing)

[16:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
webben_: That sounds like utterly useless documentation

[16:38:00.0000] <webben_>
Don't look at me; I didn't write it! ;)

[16:38:01.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: I agree. Not very helpful.

[16:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
"The Description property might contain a description, or it might not! Have fun figuring it out yourselves"

[16:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
and it seems nobody puts the alt attribute text into that Description property anyway

[16:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it's actively misleading

[16:39:02.0000] <webben_>
including IE.

[16:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Safari 3.1.2 seems to be totally opaque to these MSAA tools - it's just a WebViewWindowClass and that's it

[16:41:01.0000] <webben_>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms695710(VS.85).aspx

[16:41:02.0000] <webben_>
"An object's Description property provides a textual description about an object's visual appearance. The description is primarily used to provide greater context for low-vision or blind users, but is also used for context searching or other applications"

[16:41:03.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: yeah, WebKit's MSAA implementation is still in the early stages AFAIK.

[16:42:00.0000] <webben_>
(VoiceOver doesn't do anything with longdesc. Then again VO doesn't do anything with tables either.)

[16:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like IE8b2 sets Description to the longdesc text (if any), else the title text (if any), else it's a 'none' value

[16:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
(If you have longdesc then the title isn't exposed anywhere that I can see)

[16:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
And it sets Name to the alt text (if any), else the title text (if any), else 'none'

[16:46:01.0000] <webben_>
What? they drop title if longdesc is present?

[16:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
but that's only in standards-mode

[16:46:03.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: is your test title the same as the alt or different?

[16:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
In quirks mode, the Description is the longdesc else the alt else none

[16:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
and the Name is the title else the alt else none

[16:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
webben_: Different

[16:48:00.0000] <webben_>
this implementation sounds completely crazed.

[16:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
Sure :-)

[16:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me is just using <!doctype html><img src=image alt=alttext longdesc=longdesctext title=titletext> in the Live DOM Viewer to test this

[16:48:03.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: I can't remember does either tool show accHelp?

[16:49:00.0000] <webben_>
because I think WebKit dumps title into  a help field.

[16:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
webben_: Inspect says "Help: none [nimpl]" for images in IE

[16:52:00.0000] <webben_>
oh well

[16:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I don't see any way to get any data out of Safari at all)

[16:52:02.0000] <webben_>
not exposing title sounds like a bug worth reporting

[16:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Where could it be exposed?

[16:54:00.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms695735(VS.85).aspx (accHelp)

[16:55:00.0000] <webben_>
"This property contains balloon-style information (as found in ToolTips) that is used either to describe what the object does or how to use it."

[16:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[16:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
That's not what title text is, though

[16:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, it's balloon-style information, but it's not describing what something does or how to use it)

[16:56:00.0000] <webben_>
I don't think MSAA is going to allow the level of granular semantics you're assuming there.

[16:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose I'm assuming something more than "stuff into whatever available field is kind of vaguely related to your data" :-)

[16:57:00.0000] <webben_>
Sure :)

[16:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it's kind of hard when a single image can have three distinct pieces of descriptive text, and you want to fit it into an application-agnostic API

[16:58:00.0000] <webben_>
title in HTML4 is "advisory text"

[16:58:01.0000] <webben_>
I think accHelp is best fit there.

[16:58:02.0000] <webben_>
I can't remember what HTML5 says (and don't think it matters since for practical web authoring purposes title = tooltip)


2008-09-07
[17:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(At least we're getting past the stage where alt = tooltip :-) )

[17:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
(except for most of the web, which is in quirks mode and will still work like that for most users)

[17:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, IE8b2's inline search UI way more complex than in Firefox and Opera

[17:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
They both have a labelled box to type into, and Opera also has a close button, and that's it

[17:04:01.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: that's not it

[17:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
IE has all that, and previous and next buttons, and a meaningless icon button (for Highlight All Matches), and an Options drop-down menu for whole-word and case matching

[17:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
plus a little vertical bar after that, for no discernible reason

[17:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also, IE is the only browser (out of IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome) where the scrollbar doesn't quite extend to the edge of the screen, so you have to move your mouse all the way across and then carefully pull it back by a single pixel before you can drag the bar

[17:08:01.0000] <webben_>
nm, thought you were talking about find generally.

[17:08:02.0000] <webben_>
I don't see why there should be different interfaces for different types of find operation though.

[17:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah - Opera's normal ctrl+f dialog box is pretty ugly

[17:09:01.0000] <webben_>
what I find annoying about IE's find implementation is that you have to press the tab key to get focus on a found link

[17:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
and I didn't know Firefox's ctrl+f had all those extra buttons too

[17:09:03.0000] <webben_>
(oh, and you can't afaik just search for link)

[17:09:04.0000] <Philip`>
but at least it doesn't embed a dropdown menu in it :-)

[17:10:00.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: note also the difference in fx between ' (quickfind links) and " (find everything)

[17:10:01.0000] <webben_>
by contrast in other browsers, you can just press enter (or whatever) to follow the link

[17:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
By '"', do you mean '/'? (That's what key it seems to be on my copy)

[17:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wasn't aware of the find-in-links at all

[17:11:02.0000] <webben_>
could be (i'm using Fx3 mac)

[17:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think Opera wins for find-some-text-somewhere-near-a-link-and-then-activate-the-link-by-keyboard because of the spatnav thing, so you just have to get close enough to the link and then it's easy to select

[17:14:00.0000] <webben_>
Opera wipes the floor with other browsers for keyboard navigation

[17:14:01.0000] <webben_>
(at least other visual browsers)

[17:14:02.0000] <webben_>
e.g. quick keys

[17:14:03.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, right, the vertical bar in IE's find toolbar is so that it can say "No matches found" a million miles away from where your eyes are focussing on the box you're typing into

[17:15:00.0000] <webben_>
would be nice if opera had a find-in-links feature too though

[17:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
webben_: I think it does, via the ',' key

[17:16:01.0000] <webben_>
oooh even more awesome :)

[17:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmm, Firefox and Chrome both make a ding sound and show some red stuff in the search box when there's no matches, which seems sufficiently obvious)

[17:18:01.0000] <webben_>
I guess an icon or something works for colorblind/deaf people too?

[17:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Opera at least puts the "No matches" text directly adjacent to the search text input)

[17:19:00.0000] <webben_>
that's craziness, related text should obviously be as far away from where you're looking as possible.

[17:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
webben_: Firefox says "Phrase not found" too, and Chrome says "0 of 0" too, so I guess that's sufficient

[17:20:00.0000] <webben_>
"0 of 0" seems a bit weird.

[17:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
webben_: That seems to be the principle behind IE's UI :-)

[17:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Woah

[17:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
Chrome does something funny to the scrollbar when you search

[17:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
I think it's drawing a little horizontal line corresponding to the position of each match

[17:24:03.0000] <Philip`>
but I'm searching the HTML5 spec for "e" so the whole scrollbar is solid yellow and takes three seconds to draw

[17:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
("41 of 149900")

[17:26:00.0000] <jruderman>
lol

[17:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually, that's kind of neat - I can search for e.g. "database" and it'll show where the highest concentration of mentions is, which is probably where I want to be reading

[17:29:00.0000] <webben_>
that does sound neat :)

[17:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Similarly I can search for "XHTML" and see that pretty much all of the body of the spec does not mention it once

[18:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I need to get the photos off those who took them

[18:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyhow, I'm off

[02:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: note that google is fully funding someone to work 100% on writing html5, which is a pretty big commitment to standards itself

[02:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: also, gears has been doing a lot of work around making their apis compatible with html5's

[02:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know if any of it has shipped yet, but certainly html5 comes up a lot in their code reviews

[02:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
cool, Justin is pushing for someone to fork the spec. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Sep/0224.html

[02:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i've gotten webkit to (1) happily create the new document (2) freeze and (3) crash when playing with createDocument(x, y, document.doctype)

[02:54:01.0000] <zcorpan>
which one happens depends on y

[02:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
writing web dom core is fun

[02:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: btw for your study it would be good to have a third (control) group that had no image descriptions, and then compare which of the groups most ably completed the relevant task

[02:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: (this is to test the hypothesis that detailed out-of-band image descriptions actually help blind users)

[02:57:02.0000] <aboodman>
I've decided to go straight for html6, personally.

[02:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
aboodman: i'll see you there in a couple of decades :-P

[03:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ok, DOMImplementation is done

[03:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or well hasFeature needs expanding

[03:01:01.0000] <heycam>
zcorpan, link?

[03:01:02.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core

[03:02:00.0000] <heycam>
thanks

[03:02:01.0000] <aboodman>
i saw on the blogosphere that ff 3.1 will have worker support

[03:02:02.0000] <aboodman>
it isn't clear which version though

[03:03:00.0000] <roc>
the current version

[03:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/sandbox/bookmarklets/reveal-comments might be useful when reading web dom core

[03:04:00.0000] <roc>
BenT wrote he'll be updating the syntax to match the current spec before beta1

[03:04:01.0000] <aboodman>
roc: as in the current html5 draft?

[03:04:02.0000] <roc>
yeah

[03:04:03.0000] <heycam>
nice bookmarklet zcorpan!

[03:04:04.0000] <aboodman>
cool

[03:04:05.0000] <roc>
of course, "the current version" is a variable, not a constant, so ...

[03:04:06.0000] <roc>
:-)

[03:04:07.0000] <aboodman>
right, i'm a little concerned about that

[03:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
heycam: thanks :)

[03:05:01.0000] <roc>
well, this issue comes up whenever we do anything

[03:06:00.0000] <aboodman>
it's almost as if there is some fundamental design flaw in the way apis are versioned on the web :)

[03:06:01.0000] <aboodman>
sorry, couldn't resist

[03:06:02.0000] <roc>
well

[03:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
i hope people take justin up on his suggestion in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Sep/0224.html

[03:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i could do with the motivation :-)

[03:07:01.0000] <roc>
my response to that is, "APIs are hard"

[03:08:00.0000] <aboodman>
i commend you guys pushing forward

[03:08:01.0000] <aboodman>
is there a schedule for FF 3.1 somewhere?

[03:08:02.0000] <roc>
sort of

[03:09:00.0000] <roc>
we were going to try to ship this year, but we won't do that now. Currently I think we're closing for beta1 end of this month, ship early next year

[03:09:01.0000] <annevk>
so does that also mean Mozilla will not introduce a second HTTP API in ECMAScript as I saw mentioned somewhere in one of the Workers bugs?

[03:09:02.0000] <roc>
annevk: I don't know

[03:10:00.0000] <roc>
ask bent

[03:10:01.0000] <aboodman>
ah, from the blagoweb, i got the impression 3.1 was upon us

[03:10:02.0000] <roc>
it's on a short leash.

[03:11:00.0000] <roc>
if you want to find out more, check mozilla.dev.plannng

[03:11:01.0000] <aboodman>
thanks

[03:11:02.0000] <roc>
or  dial in to the project planning meetings, they're public access :-)

[03:12:00.0000] <roc>
and the wiki notes are posted to planet.mozilla

[03:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I considered a control group, but I figured it wouldn't matter since the questions were only going to be designed to make the user navigate the page, and their final answers didn't really matter. Only whether they used the longdesc="" to access the description

[03:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I suppose it could also be extended to test the effectiveness of long descriptions

[03:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
well there's no point having them even if they navigate to them if they don't actually help

[03:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
of course to do this we'd have to find a page with actually useful longdesc=""s

[03:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
so as to not bias the study by making up artificial pages

[03:13:04.0000] <Lachy>
Joshue's videos already provided observational evidence that the descriptions are useful

[03:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
really?

[03:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
uri?

[03:14:02.0000] <aboodman>
roc: mailing list looks useful, thanks

[03:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't recall seeing them be useful

[03:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
the user he was testing said that they helped him to understand the images better

[03:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
the user he was testing also said that summary was useless and then that summary was useful

[03:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah

[03:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean i have great respect for the guy, but people in usability studies are notorious for thinking everything is useful

[03:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
you should see some of our studies at google, where users are like "ooh that rocks" but when we do actual studies to see if it helps them, the features actually hurts them

[03:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's rather sad

[03:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
hurt, even

[03:16:04.0000] <Lachy>
that's true, and it's quite obvious that the guy's answers were being influenced by Joshue with the way the questions were asked

[03:16:05.0000] <roc>
I've heard of examples like that

[03:17:00.0000] <roc>
users like bling even when it slows them down

[03:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
can any of the studies Google has done on the issue be published?

[03:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
we haven't done anything on longdesc

[03:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i know

[03:17:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Could you?

[03:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd love to, but i doubt it

[03:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't seem likely that anyone from the accessibility community is interested in doing the one I proposed, nor any others

[03:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
we don't really have the infrastructure set up to do studies of non-visual users in their usual environment (which is the only real way to do these kinds of studies for those users)

[03:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll mention it to our usability people though, maybe if they do another set of home studies for visually impaired users they can slide that in

[03:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
unlikely to happen any time soon though

[03:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
if at all

[03:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
you could perhaps do remote studying if the user has a webcam

[03:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
(also i could never release the videos, for privacy reasons)

[03:21:00.0000] <roc>
Park Google Street View outside their houses and watch through the windows

[03:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[03:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[03:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
the problem with a remote study is that the conditions can't be controlled well

[03:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but it's a lot cheaper (i guess) so you can do more

[03:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I could email Joshue directly is see if he's willing to do it

[03:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
turns out that a lot of blind users don't have webcams. (weird, i know)

[03:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
perhaps you could do studies without webcams

[03:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's hard to do studies without actually seeing the user

[03:27:02.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[03:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
half the data you get from a usability study is observing the user's body language

[03:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[03:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
if you can get a study, i encourage you to do so

[03:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
anything is better than nothing

[03:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
even if not ideal

[03:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps a sample website could be set up, provide the questionnaire with it online, and get blind users to complete the study from home. That way we can see where they went from the logs and how they answered the questionnaire. The only problem is eliminating cheaters.

[03:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: not a bad idea

[03:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me prepares for a flood of flame mail

[03:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well I hope Google's actions come together and end up being pro-standards

[03:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I certainly don't think any of the technical people involved (many of whom I know) are acting in bad faith

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i expect they will. there's a lot of good will, it's just not very well coordinated. Google is a very engineer-driven company, as opposed to manager-driven

[03:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so engineers have to be converted to the standards way, as opposed to being told to "do standards"

[03:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I know that sometimes combination of business needs and randomness of priorities can lead to weird looking outcomes

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[03:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
that too

[03:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I expect you'll get a lot of responses trying to say how the problem longdesc solves is obvious. Although, in all cases I've seen, the information in the description is useful to everyone, not just those with ATs

[03:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think it is the engineering side of Google that evangelizes other companies to code to Gears APIs but I wouldn't really know

[03:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
in any case hopefully the relevant people are susceptible to public encouragement to do teh right thing

[03:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: is there any part of google that evangelizes other companies to code to Gears APIs?

[03:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well, a number were held up as exemplars at Google I/O, with big formal announcements

[03:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
e.g. MySpace

[03:36:02.0000] <annevk>
WordPress

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
i might be mistaken, but i think google i/o was almost exclusively engineer driven

[03:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i might be wrong

[03:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i'll shut up now :-)

[03:37:03.0000] <aboodman>
no, there is a heavy dose of marketing at those events

[03:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
aboodman would know better

[03:38:00.0000] <aboodman>
this ship is going to take some time to turn around

[03:39:00.0000] <aboodman>
but it will turn

[03:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: some kind of caching on the web-apps-tracker would be really nice *pleading face*

[03:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I know Apple at times has misguided people who are for trying to push corners of Web technology in a not-entirely-open direction

[03:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it is work to keep them at bay

[03:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: right now there are like a dozen connections from html5.org to svn.whatwg.org and it's driving the load up way high

[03:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and making WebKit be a real open source project instead of bare-minimum passive-aggressive open source was itself a ship that took time to turn around

[03:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i bet that was a hell of a job

[03:41:00.0000] <annevk>
oh :/

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i don't really understand what the cause is

[03:41:02.0000] <aboodman>
See the geolocation api as an example of the way I'd like things to work more often.

[03:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: it seems to happen every now and then

[03:41:04.0000] <aboodman>
which, btw, i don't think we ever got any apple feedback on ;)

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess people link to it now and then in channels or so

[03:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me prods othermaciej for feedback on workers, too :-P

[03:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: oh yeah

[03:42:03.0000] <aboodman>
/me prods self

[03:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yeah but it always seems to be a random set of revisions

[03:42:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I both owe direct feedback and owe more reminders to ap to give feeback

[03:42:06.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, oh ok

[03:42:07.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you can imagine I have been somewhat distracted in light of recent eents and all

[03:42:08.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, is the frontpage less of an issue?

[03:43:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, because for the frontpage I don't really have an idea how to cache it properly

[03:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: like right now you're hitting web-apps for r2016, r1979, r2002, and r2035

[03:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: well, for the front page you just need the log of recent messages, right?

[03:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: so you could just cache that for five minutes (only hit the server once every five minutes or something)

[03:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: but for per-revision pages, seems like you could cache those forever

[03:45:00.0000] <annevk>
the front page does svn log with a limit

[03:45:01.0000] <annevk>
an individual revision does svn log + svn diff

[03:46:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, the per-revision pages are easier

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk>
hopefully I can do this tonight or tomorrow

[03:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[03:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey macdome

[03:49:01.0000] <eseidel>
hi Hixie, aboodman 

[03:51:00.0000] <aboodman>
eseidel? up at 3am? SHOCKING

[03:51:01.0000] <eseidel>
aboodman: just got home :)

[03:51:02.0000] <eseidel>
hangin w/ some friends.  beating Castle CRashers

[03:55:00.0000] <eseidel>
an now checkin in with my webkit peeps before betd

[03:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
bah, acid3 tests doctype.internalSubset :(

[03:57:01.0000] <zcorpan>
in webkit it's always null

[03:57:02.0000] <zcorpan>
so clearly it's not needed for web compat

[03:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i want to drop internalSubset from dom core. could you change acid3 to not rely on it?

[03:59:01.0000] <zcorpan>
        assertEquals(doc.firstChild.internalSubset, null, "internalSubset wrong (first test)");

[03:59:02.0000] <zcorpan>
        assertEquals(doc.firstChild.internalSubset, null, "internalSubset wrong (second test)");

[04:00:00.0000] <roc>
hey I just fixed that in Gecko

[04:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
roc: oh? would you like to keep it in dom core then?

[04:01:01.0000] <roc>
I don't really care

[04:01:02.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[04:01:03.0000] <annevk>
removing useless code seems like a win

[04:01:04.0000] <roc>
it is a bit disturbing that Acid3 tests for it not being present, but doesn't test for it being present

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, btw, you're not handling undefined in the IDL, should that really become "undefined" everywhere?

[04:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: dunno

[04:02:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: haven't looked at undefined yet

[04:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
i've made the test allow the property to be completely absent

[04:02:04.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: thanks!

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: (bear in mind that we'll still have to define what it should do if present, just like e.g. body.vLink will be defined in the "obsolete DOM attributes" section in html5)

[04:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: yeah, my plan was to just drop it

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
are UAs going to remove support?

[04:04:01.0000] <zcorpan>
dunno

[04:04:02.0000] <zcorpan>
roc?

[04:04:03.0000] <roc>
don't ask me, I just fixed the bug

[04:05:00.0000] <roc>
if you remove it from the spec and send us a patch to remove support, I'm pretty sure we'd take it :-)

[04:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
:)

[04:05:02.0000] <zcorpan>
opera developers are always happy to remove code

[04:05:03.0000] <roc>
I'm not a DOM Guy, I just fixed the bug for fun

[04:06:00.0000] <roc>
all developers are always happy to remove code

[04:06:01.0000] <roc>
I hope

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
all good ones, yes

[04:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, which test number did you just update?

[04:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
(also some bad ones, q.v. debian's changes to ssl keygen...)

[04:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
in acid3

[04:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
71

[04:08:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll update our copy on Opera's test server

[04:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, did you update test #7 recently too? It had a change that wasn't in my local copy

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh yeah

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[04:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
in <div><form></div><input> the input is obviously associated with the form

[04:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
but in <form id=a><div><form></div><fieldset form=a><input>, what is the input associated with? form#a, or the second form?

[04:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
also, how about <form id=a></form><fieldset form=a><div><form></div><input>

[04:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, could acid3 be made available via svn or something, so that whenever you make a change, we can just do svn update, instead of having to copy and paste the changes manually?

[04:22:01.0000] <webben_>
/me finds this vaguely amusing: http://www.css-zibaldone.com/articles/logo/creating.html : providing a D-link for a background-image.

[04:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
lachy: remind me for acid4

[04:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[04:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: (i don't want to go through the pain of doing this for acid3)

[04:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. In that case, just remember to notify me whenver a change is made so I can update our test server

[04:23:01.0000] <annevk>
/me decides to take a look at caching now

[04:23:02.0000] <annevk>
/me summons Python IO docs

[04:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me considers just dropping the fieldset association

[04:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me considers dropping form="" altogether

[04:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: without form='', how do you do forms for each row in a table?

[04:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
you don't, but with form="", i don't know how to make the parsing work

[04:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
especially if we have fieldset-scoping

[04:29:02.0000] <zcorpan>
we could drop fieldset-scoping

[04:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that's one of the two things i just said i was considering :-)

[04:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i mean, i'd rather fieldset scoping was dropped than form='' was dropped :)

[04:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
dropped

[04:32:01.0000] <webben_>
can't you just make form= take priority over preceding form or fieldset, but not over proceeding form?

[04:32:02.0000] <webben_>
/me maybe quite misunderstanding the problem.

[04:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
what would that do to the examples above?

[04:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
in <form id=a><div><form></div><fieldset form=a><input>, what is the input associated with? form#a, or the second form?

[04:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
and how about <form id=a></form><fieldset form=a><div><form></div><input>

[04:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
(and why?)

[04:35:00.0000] <webben_>
if </form> getting inferred before </div> there?

[04:35:01.0000] <webben_>
*is

[04:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
no

[04:36:00.0000] <webben_>
that's somewhat confusing

[04:36:01.0000] <webben_>
is that for legacy compat?

[04:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[04:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[04:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
(search for "form element pointer")

[04:41:00.0000] <webben_>
example 1) form=a takes priority over preceeding form, so input is associated with form=a; example 2) input is associated with form.

[04:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
why does it take priority?

[04:42:00.0000] <webben_>
to follow the apparent declared authorial intent mostly

[04:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, what is the algorithm used to determine that it takes priority?

[04:42:02.0000] <webben_>
oh

[04:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
are we walking the tree every time the parser inserts an <input> element?

[04:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
also, in case 2, does changing the id of either form change the association of <input>?

[04:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
(consider in particular the case where it changes the association of the <fieldset>, since the <input> is a child of the <fieldset> and not of either form)

[04:47:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: could the parser store something to indicate whether the nearest ancestor was a form= or form?

[04:47:01.0000] <webben_>
rather than walking the tree again to find out?

[04:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
the DOM can change while the parser is running

[04:48:01.0000] <webben_>
ah okay, then yes, it would involve walking the tree

[04:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's not really going to fly

[04:49:01.0000] <webben_>
presumably that's expensive, yeah

[04:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
also i don't really understand what the condition you are proposing is

[04:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
that would give different results in those two cases

[04:51:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: The thinking is something like: we want to associate an input with a form, but an input can't belong to two forms. So if nearest ancestor is form, it should belong to that. But if nearest ancestor is form= then the author has gone to trouble to specify which form it belongs to,

[04:51:01.0000] <webben_>
so it should belong to that.

[04:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
then wouldn't it be associated form form#a in both cases?

[04:52:01.0000] <annevk>
implemented caching, not sure it works

[04:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool, thanks

[04:52:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: fwiw, I think JF et al are right about the flaw of your longdesc user testing setup

[04:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
will let you know if i see peak load again

[04:53:00.0000] <webben_>
no it would be associated with form#a in the first case, since fieldset form=a is nearest ancestor

[04:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: in both cases, the nearest ancestor is a <fieldset form=a>

[04:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: otoh, longdesc has been out of the user testing *lab* in the real world for a decade and has failed in the ultimate lab

[04:54:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: then I'm misunderstanding the form element pointer stuff.

[04:54:01.0000] <webben_>
<form id=a></form><fieldset form=a><div><form></div><input> I thought <form> there was an ancestor of <input>?

[04:54:02.0000] <annevk>
I did not implement caching for the home page. For individual diff pages, I simply create a file each time a new diff is generated (identifier, from, to, context) and check before the diff is retrieved from svn.whatwg.org whether such a file exists

[04:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: play with hsivonen's live dom viewer to see the dom you would get from the parser

[04:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: the pointer is just set to the last <form> seen, and is reset to null by </form>

[04:55:01.0000] <annevk>
so changes to the formatting of the diff should not affect the cache

[04:55:02.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: yep, but that's why I thought <form> was the ancestor

[04:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: in the example you just quoted, the ancestors of input are, in reverse order, fieldset, body, html, #document

[04:56:00.0000] <annevk>
some algorithm is however certainly possible as we implemented this :)

[04:57:00.0000] <webben_>
oh okay, I don't understand that, but yeah in that case fieldset form=a is ancestor, points to form#a and therefore input belongs to form#a ?

[04:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: so what does opera do?

[04:58:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, I haven't looked into this

[04:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
opera gets different results for:

[04:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
<form id=a></form><fieldset><div><form id=b></div><input>

[04:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
<form id=a></form><fieldset form=a><div><form id=b></div><input>

[04:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
...which seems like it would be expensive to do reliably

[04:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
and thus shouldn't be required by the spec

[05:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
(it involves attribute lookups on the ancestor chain during parsing)

[05:00:01.0000] <annevk>
well, caching is certainly working

[05:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool, thanks

[05:00:03.0000] <annevk>
contents of the caching folder is growing rapidly :)

[05:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[05:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
who's using the page?

[05:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
googlebot?

[05:01:01.0000] <annevk>
no bots, they are forbidden per robots.txt

[05:01:02.0000] <webben_>
is this hsivonen's live dom viewer? http://parsetree.validator.nu/ ?

[05:01:03.0000] <zcorpan>
webben_: no, http://livedom.validator.nu/

[05:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
http://livedom.validator.nu/

[05:01:05.0000] <webben_>
is there a tools page where all these things are listed?

[05:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
damowmow.com/portal/ has a list of some of them

[05:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
on the right hand side

[05:02:02.0000] <annevk>
sorry for not doing this earlier as it was a twenty minute hack (adding about 10 lines of code)

[05:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
np

[05:02:04.0000] <webben_>
ah neat

[05:02:05.0000] <Hixie>
it wasn't serious, but it was becoming a minor annoyance :-)

[05:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: why does form="" affect parsing? isn't it resolved on the above-DOM layer?

[05:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: because of the form element pointer

[05:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: can't you just say that form='' overrides the form element pointer

[05:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: as the spec stood until about 12 seconds ago, form="" would never have any effect, because the form element pointer wasn't conditional on the attribute, and just always set the association

[05:05:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and have the parser set the pointer always

[05:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: we can, but then we still don't get <fieldset> association, unless we want to crawl the ancestor chain at some point and decide how we decide what owns what

[05:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so that the above-DOM layer looks at form='' first, form pointer second and containment third

[05:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. right

[05:06:03.0000] <hsivonen>
that sucks

[05:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
well for now i've dropped fieldset association altogether

[05:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
the main use case was table rows

[05:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
where it wouldn't help anyway

[05:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but don't parsers have to crawl the ancestor chain for dynamically inserted form controls anyway?

[05:07:03.0000] <hsivonen>
s/parsers/browsers/

[05:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
they do now, yes, but it's a single crawl at a well-defined time

[05:07:05.0000] <Hixie>
(insertion)

[05:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
and doesn't involve looking at attributes on the ancestors

[05:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
just looking for a form

[05:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tries to find Hixie's bug report in IRC logs

[05:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
<dl><dd></span> complained about a </p> iirc

[05:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: thanks

[05:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nope, that's not sufficient

[05:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
<dl><dt><dd><span></dd></dl>

[05:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
Error: End tag for p seen, but there were unclosed elements.

[05:09:04.0000] <hsivonen>
right. Thanks

[05:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<ol><li><span></li></ol> gives the same

[05:11:01.0000] <annevk>
not a single diff request with context other than 10

[05:11:02.0000] <annevk>
well, within the last few minutes

[05:11:03.0000] <annevk>
I guess I should check again next week or so

[05:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: btw, why does the text field jump around when i do a text field validation?

[05:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: to order the submission data right

[05:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's really disconcerting

[05:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: would it be better to empty the textarea and stuff the data in a trailing input type=hidden?

[05:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: or disable the textarea?

[05:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
well, first i'd ask why you have to do anything at all

[05:13:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: that might be better

[05:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
but you really don't want to be depending on script for something like this

[05:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/but/and/

[05:14:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the other fields contain data that the validator has to have before it starts reading the document input

[05:14:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: the feature isn't available without script

[05:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: you can't buffer 512 bytes?

[05:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: or even 2MB?

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I *could*, but it's much nicer when IO streams

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: (I do end up caching the data [as UTF-16 even] for show source)

[05:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: seems dubious to me. but if you really want to do it this way, then just have the textarea not be named, and copy it into a hidden field oninput and onchange

[05:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok.

[05:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
file upload is trickier :)

[05:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
incidentally, XMLNS Filter doesn't appear to be a label like the other labels

[05:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh no

[05:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
the text field is jus disabled

[05:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
nevermind

[05:19:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the field should be disabled when the HTML parser is selected

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is type=email staying?

[05:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have no plans to not merge it in

[05:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is as close to "yes" as i'm willing to commit :-)

[05:20:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok

[05:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do you have plans to change normative references when it comes to non-ASCII characters in type=email?

[05:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have no plans either way

[05:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not aware of an issue

[05:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[05:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i'm sure there's mail about it if there is one

[05:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, one attribute down (form). About 150 to go.

[05:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
bed time

[05:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
if there's an open-source Java library that implements exactly what type=email parsing requires, I'd like to know

[05:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:23:04.0000] <hsivonen>
nn

[05:24:00.0000] <annevk>
fixed a small bug

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk>
I had to specialcase revTo=0

[05:32:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, it will change

[05:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: type=email?

[05:32:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, IDN e-mail is under discussion at various places, though currently experimental RFCs only per my understanding

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh

[05:33:01.0000] <annevk>
I would expect that to effect type=email long term, yes

[05:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I suppose I can't fix type=email next week, then

[05:33:06.0000] <hsivonen>
I've already postponed it for a *long* time

annevk: thanks

[05:33:08.0000] <zcorpan>
/me just specced createElement()

[05:35:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, shouldn't it match the NCName production?

[05:35:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: no

[05:35:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, also, I sort of doubt that matches implementations, as I believe browsers have hacks for <div ...> and such

[05:35:03.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: that's createElementNS

[05:35:04.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: hmm

[05:35:05.0000] <zcorpan>
need to test that

[05:38:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ie doesn't work for me right now

[05:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
opera, firefox and webkit throw

[05:39:01.0000] <annevk>
drop the DOCTYPE

[05:40:00.0000] <annevk>
and use something like <div>

[05:40:01.0000] <annevk>
works in Firefox (I'm currently using Opera with DOCTYPE override in effect, so there it never works.)

[05:41:02.0000] <annevk>
interesting

[05:42:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe someone should slap the Gecko guys then :)

[05:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
:)

[05:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me replies to JF against his better judgment

[05:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
should createElement() lowercase the argument?

[05:49:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is tempted to say yes

[05:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is it black-box-testable via localName?

[05:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: yeah, you can see if "BR" creates a linebreak or not

[05:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: and it should be testable via localName too

[05:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, re "I agree that Lachlan's research setup has the problem you described" from your latest mail to public-html. I already addressed the problem John described regarding the existing poor implementations by saying it could be done with newer, improved implementations.

[05:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
if even newer, improved implementations suffer from the same problem, then there isn't much hope for it in the wild

[05:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the problem your setup has is that it doesn't test how people would behave in a hypothetical sitution if they haven't been able to develop routines in the hypothetical environment

[05:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: of course, testing if the hypothetical situation could be useful is pointless if there is no route form where we are to the hypothetical situation

[05:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
sure, but that's a fundamental problem with the whole idea of longdesc, because they haven't yet shown that they can even get there. They just seem to be basing their argument on the hope they somehow they will in some unspecified amount of time with some unspecified solution

[05:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I think a decade of failure outside the lab is a much stronger argument that what could be obtained through your test setup

[06:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, sure. but the test setup has the advantage of being able to do it with better implementations than is currenlty widely deployed, and the ability to compare 2 different solutions

[06:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
it just annoys me how they keep ignoring the alternative solution of using ordinary links, which also has the advantage of making it available to everyone

[06:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does anyone have the intent of actually performing whatever the test is?

[06:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, we would need someone like Joshue who has the resources available to do it. But so far, no-one has volunteered to do it

[06:05:00.0000] <annevk>
oops, svn.whatwg.org will still get hits for svn log, even for diff pages

[06:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
should createTextNode raise an exception if it doesn't match the Char production?

[06:05:02.0000] <annevk>
but svn log is probably not as problematic as svn diff

[06:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me goes with "no"

[06:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
what about createComment? should it throw for "foo -- bar" or "foo -"?

[06:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
WDBD?

[06:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: ?

[06:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
What Do Browsers Do?

[06:17:02.0000] <jgraham>

[06:18:02.0000] <zcorpan>
opera strips the dashes

[06:18:03.0000] <jgraham>
So maybe I'm not making any sense :)

[06:18:04.0000] <zcorpan>
firefox throws

[06:18:05.0000] <zcorpan>
webkit allows it

[06:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i need to get ie working...

[06:19:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me reboots

[06:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
Silent data loss sounds bad

[06:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has filed a bug about Opera stripping slashes in createComment

[06:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
312761

[06:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
because it made my Live HTML5 Parser thing not work as desired

[06:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I apply infoset coercion to make Gecko not throw

[06:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe someone should fork the HTML5 spec and put it on a wiki so anyone can edit it

[06:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
htmlpedia, the web standard anyone can edit?

[06:33:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Might be hard to implement

[06:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not at all - you just edit the standard to match your implementation

[06:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Have you committed the updated web-apps-tracker to SVN?

[06:37:01.0000] <annevk>
no, will do that later

[06:37:02.0000] <annevk>
tonight I hope

[06:37:03.0000] <annevk>
have to go now

[06:37:04.0000] <annevk>
well, I had to go -40 minutes

[06:49:00.0000] <webben_>
/me isn't sure what the advantage of the mailing lists has been over bug trackers and wikis.

[06:50:00.0000] <webben_>
mailing lists make it much harder to follow chains of discussion that last months

[06:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I assume David meant "something else that provides long descriptions for images" 

[06:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: I'm not sure bug trackers are good for discussion around an issue

[06:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: yeah. So I realized just after hitting send. :-(

[06:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: wikis make it even harder

[06:53:00.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: no bug trackers are good for tracking bugs :)

[06:54:00.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: harder how?

[06:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: AFAICT, wikis don't track the parts you have read, are organized by writer as opposed to reader, don't have good bozo filters, etc.

[06:55:00.0000] <webben_>
hmm.

[06:55:01.0000] <webben_>
seems like there's a space for some sort of hybrid

[06:56:00.0000] <webben_>
where stuff is organized by topic but tracks what you've read.

[06:58:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Kinda like a mailing list with threads

[06:58:01.0000] <webben_>
except threads tend to be very brittle

[06:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I guess I should also update my internal English dictionary do choose better between adjacent and juxtaposed

[06:59:01.0000] <webben_>
e.g. there are multiple threads about longdesc rather than one topic

[06:59:02.0000] <webben_>
and people don't tend to review what's already been said, so there's lots of repetition

[07:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Trust me, they don't do that on a wiki either

[07:00:01.0000] <webben_>
/me hypothesises that they do it more because it's easier.

[07:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think it's more a limit of human ability to understand complex discussions that have been going on for months, and no technology is going to solve the problem

[07:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
1. See interesting thing. 2. Want to comment. 3. I'm important, gotta comment ASAP! No time to read old posts. 4. Hilarity ensues.

[07:12:00.0000] <webben_>
I think most of  the misunderstandings aren't that complex.

[07:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
The misunderstandings make the discussion complex, though

[07:13:00.0000] <webben_>
But a lot of the misunderstandings derive from not having searched and read repetitive previous misunderstandings.

[07:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: See theHTML pages on the ESW wiki for evidence of htmlwg related wiki faliure

[07:14:00.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: I'd expect the HTML wiki to fail since discussion is happening in multiple places.

[07:14:01.0000] <webben_>
wiki + mailing list === even harder to follow previous thinking.

[07:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ie allows -- in comment

[07:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't want to check for Char anyway so it's possible to create comments that won't serialize, and at that point it's pointless to check for --

[07:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Sounds reasonable

[07:38:00.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Sep/0233.html : the problem with the real-world lab is that it only tests the UIs that implementors happen to have implemented.

[07:39:00.0000] <webben_>
the real-world lab isn't a good test of what _could_ be implemented

[07:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: the real world takes into account all the constraints implementors are under in the real world :-)

[07:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: it tests what _would_ be implemented :-)

[07:40:00.0000] <webben_>
I see no reason to believe that.

[07:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: so it shows that given the resource allocation constraints implementors have been under for the last decade, the status quo is what we got

[07:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: results that are produced under real resource allocation constraints are practically interesting

[07:42:00.0000] <webben_>
you assume that has predictive power.

[07:42:01.0000] <webben_>
I don't.

[07:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: my point is that in the case of longdesc, we don't need to *predict*, because we can see the results of a grand experiment that has already run its course

[07:43:01.0000] <webben_>
er... no you still need to predict

[07:43:02.0000] <webben_>
otherwise it would be a meaningless experiment.

[07:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: well, I guess you can call it predicting that you'd assume longdesc continues to suck if it has sucked for a decade

[07:45:01.0000] <webben_>
yes, but I think that's an illogical prediction.

[07:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: how long would you let longdesc go on and still assume that next year will be different?

[07:46:01.0000] <webben_>
(that is, if longdesc continues to suck, I think it would either be a) a set of historical contingencies or b) because of fundamental flaws. I don't think a particular set of contingencies has predictive power or automatically demonstrates fundamental flaws.

[07:47:00.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: i don't think time is a relevant factor at all.

[07:47:01.0000] <webben_>
(fwiw implementations do appear to be improving)

[07:47:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Time is the most relevant factor of all

[07:47:03.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: even if it were contingencies, the result is that it doesn't work

[07:47:04.0000] <webben_>
anything can be made not to work by contigencies.

[07:47:05.0000] <webben_>
that's the nature of contingencies.

[07:47:06.0000] <webben_>
they don't tell you _anything_

[07:48:00.0000] <webben_>
you'd have to actually do a deep analysis of the contingencies to get useful information.

[07:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: yes, but here we have a case where we know that a) the feature sucks inherently or b) contingencies *did* actualize

[07:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
either way, the feature is ruined

[07:48:03.0000] <webben_>
only a) is meaningful if true.

[07:48:04.0000] <hsivonen>
unless you believe you can remove the contingencies and make it soar

[07:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You'd think that if the contingencies could be removed, 10 years would be enough

[07:49:01.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: er... that's 10 years of contigencies

[07:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: right

[07:49:03.0000] <Dashiva>
webben_: And 10 years that people could use to remove them 

[07:49:04.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: so how do you know they are contingencies instead of permanent constraints?

[07:50:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: you don't "remove" historical contingencies.

[07:50:01.0000] <Dashiva>
webben_: You either do, or they're permanent

[07:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: I'd love to define that some ideas would be great if only the stuff from Econ 101 didn't apply

[07:50:03.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: no they're just happenings.

[07:50:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Either these contingencies can be removed, in which case 10 years have been wasted. Or they can't, in which case longdesc is inherently flawed.

[07:51:00.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: That would involve an actual analysis of the flaws and whether any of the contigencies were related to their flaws, not just noting that something didn't happen.

[07:51:01.0000] <webben_>
"War got declared, therefore peace doesn't work."

[07:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
War tends to get fixed in less than ten years

[07:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: as far as I can tell, peace doesn't work given the economic incentives of the military-industrial complex

[07:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
Turning this around, what would you describe as good evidence that the long term cost/benefit of a feature does not work

[07:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
So we should give up trying for peace?

[07:54:01.0000] <Dashiva>
No, but we should take the realities into account while trying

[07:54:02.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: Actual analysis of costs/benefits. I don't think "time"  is inherently relevant.

[07:54:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: no, but the structure of the military-industrial complex needs changing

[07:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: Time is relevant in that it gives us data to compare to our suppositions about the cost/benefits

[07:55:01.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: Time is not data in itself.

[07:55:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If the feature won't be useful for the next century because of contingencies, why spec it now and not in a hundred years?

[07:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: So? It is a necessary precondition for collecting real-world data

[07:56:01.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: Of course. But here time is being treated as data.

[07:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: I'd expect an economist to be able to estimate the net present benefit of working longdesc

[07:56:03.0000] <webben_>
removing any need to actually analyze the data collected

[07:56:04.0000] <webben_>
i.e. why did war break out

[07:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
For longdesc time has shown that people are not that interested in writing them (hardly surprising) and that UAs are not that interested in implementing it (more surprising)

[07:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
It has also shown that when people do try to author it they get it wrong

[07:57:02.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: It's a lot more complex than that.

[07:57:03.0000] <webben_>
firstly, some UAs do implement it and implementations are, if anything, improving.

[07:58:00.0000] <webben_>
second, better authors have long been told to avoid it (unlike with alt).

[07:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: The first part is surely not that much more complex. People just aren't interested in providing detailed textual descriptions of their images

[07:58:02.0000] <webben_>
third, most images don't benefit much from long descriptions.

[07:59:00.0000] <webben_>
(see "third" above, never mind people not being interested in supporting multiple audiences where they would benefit)

[07:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: So ignoring everyhing else, it's not even that useful as a feature?

[08:00:00.0000] <webben_>
that doesn't follow.

[08:00:01.0000] <webben_>
"that useful" compared to what?

[08:00:02.0000] <Dashiva>
The alternatives

[08:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
Compared to not having it at all. Especially compared to the authors spending the same time on other acceibility work

[08:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: as for "why did the war break out" analogies, can you identify some root thing that needs fixing and that is blocking longdesc like one can identify campaign financing as the first thing that needs fixing before many political problems can be fixed?

[08:01:02.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: the authoring time involved in longdesc is infinitesimal. the authoring time involved in writing text equivalents is substantial. 

[08:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
I don't understand your point

[08:02:01.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: i.e. removing longdesc doesn't free up substantial time for doing other accessibility work.

[08:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
It does if you spend the time that you would have spent writing long replacements for images doing something else that is more useful

[08:04:00.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: er... you're confusing long description and longdesc.

[08:04:01.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: long descriptions for images is necessary when it's necessary

[08:05:00.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: removing or keeping longdesc doesn't do anything to change the necessity of long descriptions

[08:06:00.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: Based on my experiences talking to implementors about HTML features, I'd say the lack of examples of how to implement it in the HTML4 spec was a contributing factor.

[08:06:01.0000] <webben_>
that much, at least, is something HTML5 could fix (if it chooses to keep longdesc at all)

[08:06:02.0000] <Dashiva>
But if longdesc is such a rare use, why does it need a special attribute? Why doesn't a link (potentially with ARIA associations) suffice?

[08:07:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: what ARIA association?

[08:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
One that fits the bill, the name isn't important

[08:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: You said it wasn't useful for most images. Therefore if an author spent the time that they would have spent on long descriptions on something else entirely like alt text or table headers or whatever that is likely to have a better payoff. 

[08:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Even if they do spend the time writing long descriptions burying them in an attribute that many UAs don't support seems like a collosal waste of time

[08:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: what should HTML5 say about how to implement it?

[08:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
Being invisible it also increases the chance the longdesc will get out of sync with the image and so on

[08:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or go 404

[08:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Good'ole invisible metadata

[08:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
londesc is the design I would choose if I wanted to minimise the chance of the feature suceeding 

[08:38:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: what's the difference between longdesc and this hypothetical ARIA association?

[08:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
a) the link isn't invisible metadata (unless you make it invisible) and b) it lets accessibility stay in an accessibility spec and c) it avoids any potential confusion-causing overlap between the two

[08:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
b may not be a great thing

[08:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: In what way?

[08:41:00.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: It could give examples such as indicating longdesc presence on hover with a cursor change or focus with an icon overlay; providing access via shortcut keys and/or context menus; and making the action be open a new browsing context with the URI if a different doc; or just moving focus if it's the same doc.

[08:41:01.0000] <webben_>
rather than just saying "oh, btw, you need to provide some sort of mechanism for this"

[08:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: letting accessibility stay in a accessibility spec takes a bolt-on view to accessibility

[08:41:03.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: That's not to say it should mandate a particular UI, but that it should give examples.

[08:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Well, in this case the accessibility is mapping the image to the link, the link is present to begin with

[08:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: do you consider iCab's implementation a successful UI?

[08:42:02.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: my one concern with iCab is keyboard focus, but then I think iCab has problems with keyboard interaction anyway.

[08:43:00.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: What do you reckon? Do you reckon it's a bad UI?

[08:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, and I forgot d) no attribute means people can't misunderstand and put plain text in it

[08:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: making things discoverable only on hover doesn't seem like good UI design to me unless the appearance of the hoverable item otherwise suggests that it can reveal more stuff

[08:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the reason why images as links work is that the image itself usually suggests linkness sufficiently

[08:45:01.0000] <webben_>
is it?

[08:45:02.0000] <webben_>
I thought images as link work because people move the cursor round the screen until it shows a hand icon.

[08:46:00.0000] <webben_>
or, alternately, click until something happens

[08:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's not images as links, that's any link

[08:46:02.0000] <webben_>
well, yes.

[08:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
<table  summary='Layout table: the first cell contains↩ the type of the return value, the second contains a short description'↩ border='0'>

[08:47:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
dom3 core

[08:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: I'm pretty sure people don't scan every decorative image for linkness usually but instead try to move the cursor over images whose content suggests linkness

[08:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: do you scan every image just in case?

[08:49:00.0000] <webben_>
ditto longdesc presumably.

[08:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: how do you suggest longdescness visually?

[08:49:02.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: diagrams, charts, important photos

[08:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: link-looking images have a much higher linkness rate than those have a longdescness rate

[08:51:00.0000] <csarven>
Is there currently even "longdescness"?

[08:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
so what is wrong with this solution then: <a href="longdescription"><img src="chart" alt="whatever"></a>?

[08:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
csarven: there is but very, very rarely

[08:51:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Some would say it doesn't allow longdesc on link images.

[08:51:04.0000] <Lachy>
that makes it accessible to everyone, has the same discoverability as iCab's longdesc-icon-on-hover

[08:51:05.0000] <webben_>
Lachy: that would presumably suffer from hsivonen's issue.

[08:51:06.0000] <Lachy>
which issue?

[08:52:00.0000] <webben_>
Lachy: if you're going to hover over an image to see if it's a link, you can see if it would have a longdesc at the same time.

[08:53:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: Is there a use-case for long descriptions on link images? I'm not sure that there is.

[08:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
webben_, sure, but people will more easily understand the hand icon than the icon that iCab uses. People know how to click a link and may not expect to check the context menu.

[08:54:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: if i click on an image link, i don't expect to come to a page explaining the image

[08:54:01.0000] <Dashiva>
webben_: That's why I said "some would say" :)

[08:54:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I figured it merited mentioning even if I don't agree with it

[08:54:03.0000] <webben_>
this would seem to be something worth working out: what people expect if they click a chart or diagram or big photo.

[08:54:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me looks at a product on the Tesco web site, and gets a handy "XML parsing failed: syntax error (Line: 30, Character: 361)" failure

[08:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
also, it's common for charts to link to either larger or more detailed versions, which could be included in a page which also has more explanation

[08:55:01.0000] <webben_>
hmm actually that's a potential problem

[08:55:02.0000] <webben_>
yeah, I guess the usecase for link + longdesc would be

[08:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, when you click an image link in wikipedia, you get a page with more information about that image (although that info generally isn't optimised for accessibility purposes)

[08:56:01.0000] <webben_>
<a href="chart.jpg"><img src="chart.jpg" longdesc="description.html" title="Chart of stuff"></a>

[08:56:02.0000] <webben_>
oh wait that's need an alt

[08:56:03.0000] <webben_>
<a href="chart.jpg"><img src="chart.jpg" longdesc="description.html" alt="Chart of stuff"></a>

[08:56:04.0000] <csarven>
webben Links (whether they embed an <img> or not) already has a representation and a user can scan the page and figure out what is a link. @longdesc on the other doesn't. It is hidden.

[08:57:00.0000] <webben_>
csarven: ? it's no more hidden than linkiness in iCab or JAWS 10.

[08:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
webben_, for that case, just use <a href="description.html">Mimg src="chart.jpg alt="Chart of stuff"></a> and include the larger version of the chart within description.html

[08:57:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: maybe wikipedia is different because all wikipedia does is explain things -- generally i don't expect to come to a page that explains a word when i click on a text link

[08:57:03.0000] <Lachy>
s/Mimg/<img

[08:57:04.0000] <webben_>
Lachy: what if you want to link to the image?

[08:57:05.0000] <webben_>
should HTML5 advise authors not to link directly to images?

[08:57:06.0000] <Lachy>
webben_, for what purpose?

[08:57:07.0000] <zcorpan_>
(unless it's a word i don't know and the link points to wikipedia)

[08:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
webben_, can you describe a case where an author would want to link to both the image itself and a long description?

[08:59:00.0000] <webben_>
if they believed links are easier to use than context menus and wanted to give people easy access to a big image, I guess.

[08:59:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
couldn't the long description contain the image?

[09:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
webben_, that doesn't really answer the question, and the bigger image can be included in description.html

[09:00:01.0000] <webben_>
Lachy: not if you want to allow people to just save the image without using a context menu

[09:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
they still need to use the context menu anyway once they're viewing the image

[09:00:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
if you want both then it seems more understandable to have two links under the image "(large version, description)"

[09:01:00.0000] <webben_>
Lachy: they don't they can use the File menu

[09:01:01.0000] <webben_>
or the save keyboard shortcut

[09:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
webben_, I think that's just a hypothetical situation, and you're ignoring the fact that most users are already familiar with how to save an image within a page

[09:02:01.0000] <webben_>
"most users" ... are they really?

[09:02:02.0000] <webben_>
/me would be interested if they are.

[09:02:03.0000] <webben_>
are you saying they're familiar with using context menus to manipulate images?

[09:03:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
some people i know weren't familiar with how to save images but they could figure it out on first try

[09:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
but perhaps they were smarter then the average user :)

[09:05:00.0000] <webben_>
or just more ui-canny.

[09:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
webben_, I'm sure you wouldn't doubt that more people would know how to save an image from a context menu than they would access a long description from it

[09:06:00.0000] <webben_>
Lachy: Yep, but I think the learning process involved in both seems much the same.

[09:06:01.0000] <webben_>
it's just that in IE, that isn't a context menu option, and there's no hint the image has a long description.

[09:07:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
you can save every image there is but every image doesn't have a long description

[09:07:01.0000] <webben_>
zcorpan_: that's the point of the hover/focus indicator?

[09:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps, but saving images is several orders of magnitude more common that accessing a long description, so people are likely to learn and remember it more easiliy than they would with longdesc

[09:07:03.0000] <webben_>
same as with links

[09:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
webben_: then the indicator needs to be understandable by average users :)

[09:08:01.0000] <webben_>
zcorpan_: just as with links

[09:08:02.0000] <webben_>
I think iCab's indicator does a reasonable job. could be a bit bigger maybe.

[09:08:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
perhaps a baloon saying "this image has a description - click here to open it in a new tab"

[09:09:00.0000] <webben_>
well, that could interfere with title

[09:09:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me doesn't know about iCab's indicator

[09:09:02.0000] <Lachy>
regardless of the size of the icon, the icon itself is very meaningless

[09:09:03.0000] <Lachy>
I tested it and if you hadn't told me it was for long descriptions before I saw it, I wouldn't have had a clue

[09:10:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
webben_: why would it?

[09:10:01.0000] <webben_>
Lachy:  would you have a clue what a hand icon means before experimenting?

[09:10:02.0000] <Lachy>
and the icon for when an image is a link and has a longdescription is even more confusing

[09:10:03.0000] <webben_>
zcorpan_: what, showing two balloons?

[09:10:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
webben_: yeah

[09:10:05.0000] <zcorpan_>
webben_: or one baloon with two lines

[09:10:06.0000] <Lachy>
the hand icon suggests that I should do something with my hand, and the obvious thing to do is either move the mouse or click it

[09:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
and since it has the index finger extended, that suggests clicking is more likely

[09:11:01.0000] <webben_>
if you're using a mouse yes

[09:12:00.0000] <webben_>
if you're using a touchpad, less so.

[09:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
if I'm using a touch pad, my index finger is still extended in much the same way as depicted in the icon

[09:12:02.0000] <webben_>
but it's not clicking all the time

[09:13:00.0000] <webben_>
(incidentally, my hand looks nothing like that when using a touchpad, but maybe I'm just odd)

[09:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me thinks this debate is pointless; goes to do something more productive

[09:14:00.0000] <webben_>
zcorpan_: maybe, not sure what that would look like.

[09:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
webben_: e.g. a baloon above or under the image and title as a normal tooltip

[09:16:00.0000] <webben_>
could work.

[09:17:00.0000] <webben_>
i'd be a bit scared of it interacting with weird ways with JS-based tooltips

[09:17:01.0000] <webben_>
*in weird ways

[09:17:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
icons in my systray can have both a balloon and a tooltip

[09:17:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
yeah but if you have a js-based tooltip then you could use that instead of longdesc

[09:18:00.0000] <webben_>
unless you're using it to work around limitations of title

[09:18:01.0000] <webben_>
or for some other weird reason

[09:21:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: with (a) longdesc does not exclude also having a link (it just makes the relationship between URI and image programmatically determinable). a link does not exclude being hidden (and thus not accessible to users).

[09:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So you'd rather have redundancy?

[09:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's even worse for avoiding link rot

[09:23:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: do you mean specifying the URI twice by "redundancy"?

[09:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes

[09:23:02.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: No, I'd rather the URI was specified once.

[09:24:00.0000] <webben_>
but linked to the image in a programmatically determinable way

[09:24:01.0000] <webben_>
I haven't yet seen any ARIA markup that does that for a description that isn't on the same page.

[09:24:02.0000] <webben_>
and the fate of describedby in HTML5 is less than clear anyways

[09:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You associate to the link on the same page, and the link associates naturally to the other page

[09:25:01.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: if it was actually specified like that, then sure.

[09:25:02.0000] <webben_>
i.e. if it was clear to implementors that describedby pointing an a href means that the target page is the description.

[09:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Surely it would be clear to the users even without that?

[09:27:01.0000] <webben_>
only if they explored around the page

[09:27:02.0000] <webben_>
not if they navigating by image

[09:27:03.0000] <Dashiva>
They'd get an image which says "I'm described by this here element"

[09:27:04.0000] <Dashiva>
And if that element is a link, following it would be natural wouldn't it?

[09:27:05.0000] <webben_>
oh I see what you mean.

[09:28:00.0000] <webben_>
perhaps, but _if_ that is the natural behavior, why couldn't one specify that for the user agent?

[09:28:01.0000] <webben_>
either it is the natural behavior but wrong in some cases, or you can simply map the URI to the img?

[09:28:02.0000] <Dashiva>
One could, I'm just suggesting it would work without as well

[09:28:03.0000] <webben_>
it would work, perhaps, but less well.

[09:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
webben_: Ah, but just describedby allows inline descriptions as well

[09:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
If the element is something else, e.g. a paragraph or table

[09:30:00.0000] <webben_>
yes, i'm only talking about the specific case when describedby points to an element with an href.

[09:30:01.0000] <webben_>
not the general case where describedby points to an element.

[09:30:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And you'd want to put the URI directly in the image then?

[09:30:03.0000] <webben_>
I'm not sure what that means.

[09:30:04.0000] <Dashiva>
In the image elmeent's markup, instead of a separate link

[09:30:05.0000] <webben_>
not necessarily.

[09:31:00.0000] <webben_>
like I said, from my perspective, a link is fine as long as it can be associated programmatically with the image.

[09:31:01.0000] <webben_>
and it would be better if you could spec for UAs to minimize user effort.

[09:31:02.0000] <webben_>
(e.g. by treating the href target as the description)

[09:31:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I think I see three different cases. Link to on-page content, link to off-page content with visible link, link to off-page content with invisible link.

[09:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The last one being essentially longdesc

[09:32:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me defines NodeList in terms of HTML5 "collection"

[09:32:02.0000] <webben_>
or <a href=""> that's hidden.

[09:32:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Exactly

[09:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So by using an association, we can get the same effect as longdesc, as well as the other two cases, with only a single attribute

[09:34:00.0000] <webben_>
yeah, I'm not arguing for longdesc intrinsically (although I think its faults have been overstated); I think programmatic association is useful. I'm just saying that we should hone the association as much as possible.

[09:34:01.0000] <webben_>
to make navigation as fast as possible.

[09:34:02.0000] <Dashiva>
That's a good thing.

[09:36:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: Can you see any problem with a UA treating the href target of an element pointed to by describedby as the description, as opposed to the UA presenting the element itself as the description? (in the case where the element does have an href)

[09:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
If page loading time (or cost) is important, perhaps

[09:37:00.0000] <webben_>
could you elaborate on that?

[09:37:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The user might want to be made aware if the description is a different resource

[09:38:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: it could do that with the UI.

[09:38:01.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: for example, Firefox or IE could map that uri exactly as they do longdesc

[09:38:02.0000] <webben_>
then JAWS could announce "Long description available" and the user could use their shortcut key to access it.

[09:39:00.0000] <webben_>
(this is assuming Firefox/IE are exposing it (IE8 is), rather than JAWS trying to dig it out of the DOM, however)

[09:39:01.0000] <webben_>
but at any rate that shows the UI that could be created.

[09:39:02.0000] <webben_>
or JAWS could say "same page description available"

[09:39:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, something like that should work

[09:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Do you think UAs would -not- do that, in the case where it was not specified?

[09:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It seems like value added then as well

[09:42:01.0000] <webben_>
It's entirely possible they might not. I think relying on UAs to implement things sensibly is over-optimistic.

[09:42:02.0000] <webben_>
if HTML5 assumes something can be inferred it should specify that assumption.

[09:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: the spec should indeed have well-defined algorithms for inferences

[09:43:01.0000] <webben_>
especially for this sort of thing, where developer effort is likely to be concentrated on issues like "How the heck do we get our users access to the Microsoft Office Ribbon?"

[09:43:02.0000] <webben_>
(but really, for everything)

[09:44:00.0000] <webben_>
not specifying stuff got HTML4 into a lot of problems

[09:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Would this be the same assocation as between a figure and its legend, or is there a semantic difference?

[09:49:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: a legend might just be a title like "Chart of commodity prices" mightn't it?

[09:49:01.0000] <webben_>
rather than (say) a paragraph summarizing the trends + a data table on a separate page

[09:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[10:21:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm... if i have text/html "<math><x:y>" and then do document.importNode(theMathElement, true) from another html document, should that raise INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR or not?

[10:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
or actually, the same question applies to a normal html element <x:y>

[10:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
copying a node between two documents should perhaps not do any checking at all if you copy to an html document

[10:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
As long as it's all DOM nodes being moved around (i.e. no serialization) it seems a bit odd to do error checking

[10:37:00.0000] <csarven>
Does @scope only apply to <th> ?

[10:43:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Dashiva: yes but the dom does error checking all over the place

[10:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
zcorpan_: So raise the same exception that would be raised if you attempted to create the element within the destination document?

[10:45:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Dashiva: the innerHTML getter in xml documents assume that the error checking that the dom does has taken place so not doing it when moving nodes between documents would break innerHTML and render the rest of the error checking useless

[10:45:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
Dashiva: yeah

[10:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I suppose that's equally consistent

[10:46:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Dashiva: i think it only needs to check nodeName for elements and attributes against the Name production

[10:46:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
but i'm not sure

[10:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
IMO DOM error checking is useless

[10:46:04.0000] <hsivonen>
either it should check *everything* like XOM or nothing

[10:46:05.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: should i check everything?

[10:46:06.0000] <csarven>
Is there any mechanism in HTML 4 or 5 that can be used to scope values locally? Sort of like prefix mappings in RDFa. For instance, when rel="license" is used in HTML 4 it is signifying the relationship between the current document and the destination resource. In this case, it is not about a particular section in the document.

[10:46:07.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: no, due to compat considerations

[10:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: yep right

[10:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Is it bad that I know the urls to most DOM specs by heart?

[10:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i can't really remove the error checking either

[10:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: why?

[10:48:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: acid3 tests it :)

[10:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fun

[10:50:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i've actually added more checks

[10:50:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
but perhaps i should try to remove checks instead

[10:50:02.0000] <Dashiva>
zcorpan_: It seems document.createElement('a:b') should work. Core3 says to check for the XML 'Name' production, which contains ':' as far as I can see

[10:50:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
Dashiva: yeah

[10:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So as you said, importing into a HTML document should work

[10:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
actually, I revise my all or nothing stance to XML API checking

[10:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it also makes sense to check potentially user-entered values (text content, attribute values, perhaps PI data and comments) but not check application programmer-entered data (element and attribute names) 

[10:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
DOM has this exactly backwards, of course

[10:53:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: should i check against Char for text etc?

[10:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
at this point of the API's life, probably not

[10:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I really don't know what to do with the DOM

[10:54:02.0000] <webben_>
csarven: Well, HTML5 currently says: "Hyperlinks created with the link element and its rel attribute apply to the whole page. This contrasts with the rel attribute of a and area elements, which indicates the type of a link whose context is given by the link's location within the document."

[10:54:03.0000] <webben_>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#rel

[10:54:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm just ranting in with 20/20 hindsight

[10:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
checking for Char before serializer would be bad for perf

[10:55:01.0000] <webben_>
csarven: No idea what UA behavior that's supposed to imply in terms of how a is scoped.

[10:55:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: indeed

[10:55:03.0000] <webben_>
csarven: eRDF uses HTML4 #id to scope rel, which (I think) breaks the HTML4 rel semantic.

[10:56:00.0000] <csarven>
True.

[10:58:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i've added the following checks that weren't in dom3: doctype.publicId match XML publicChar, doctype.systemId not contain both ' and ", pi.target not contain "xml" or colon

[10:58:01.0000] <webben_>
csarven: so I guess you'd still need to use class="licence" with a defined algorithm if you wanted to guarantee correct processing.

[11:01:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm i thought acid3 tested it but i can't find it

[11:07:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
would be nice to remove error checking from the dom

[11:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it would be incompatible with ie's createElement('<div class="test">') though

[11:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
but perhaps we can specify that while we're at it

[11:10:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me comments out the added error checks for now

[11:14:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
what's really sad is that you have to do two checks: once for Name and again for NCName

[11:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and throw different exceptions

[11:15:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
i guess i can eliminate that and just check for NCName

[11:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm i'll try to drop attribute nodes too

[11:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/index.jsp - <META NAME="description" CONTENT=<fmt:message key="description" bundle=s"${mr}"/>> - oops

[11:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(That slightly confusingly results in a ">" being rendered)

[12:38:00.0000] <nate_m>
Is the html5lib patch for lxml compatibility talked about at http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20071113 online anywhere?

[12:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
nate_m: That was a long time ago - lxml ought to work properly in default html5lib now

[12:48:00.0000] <nate_m>
testing with lxml 2.1.1 and html5lib 0.11.1 fails

[12:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Could you give an example of the code you're running that fails?

[12:53:00.0000] <nate_m>
Yeah, just a minute

[12:55:00.0000] <nate_m>
>>> from lxml import etree

[12:55:01.0000] <nate_m>
>>> import html5lib

[12:55:02.0000] <nate_m>
>>> from html5lib import treebuilders

[12:55:03.0000] <nate_m>
>>> parser = html5lib.HTMLParser(tree=treebuilders.getTreeBuilder('etree', etree))

[12:55:04.0000] <nate_m>
fails

[12:55:05.0000] <jgraham>
nate_m: That's not expected to work anymore

[12:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Try html5lib.HTMLParser(tree=treebuilders.getTreeBuilder('lxml'))

[12:56:01.0000] <nate_m>
Well I got that from the doc on the code.google.com site

[12:57:00.0000] <nate_m>
but i'll try the other

[12:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh. That's probably my fault

[12:58:00.0000] <nate_m>
You version does work, but i suppose you know that

[12:58:01.0000] <nate_m>
it also seems that parser = html5lib.HTMLParser(treebuilders.getTreeBuilder('etree', lxml.etree)) works too.

[13:01:00.0000] <nate_m>
althought that really not the same as it is setting strict to the result of treebuilder.getTreeBuilder

[13:01:01.0000] <nate_m>
rather than tree

[13:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
We really have to change that API. I wonder how many people would complain

[13:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
(because the strict thing is useless but the tree thing is important)

[13:06:00.0000] <nate_m>
Thanks for the help

[13:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
hey, I started designing a new layout for the various HTML5 tools. http://html5.lachy.id.au/beta/

[13:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
It's still very much a work in progress and nothing is functional yet. But I'm going to try and incorporate many of the tools we have spread across several different sites.

[13:48:00.0000] <webben_>
Lachy: looks handy :)

[13:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I see JF still thinks there's an infinite amount of time and resources for accessibility

[13:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
man this longdesc discussion is like the definition of putting the cart before the horse

[13:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
and the horse might not even exist

[14:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And the cart is too heavy for any known horse to drag

[14:03:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: Can you forsee any problem with speccing describedby where, if describedby pointing to an element with href, the target of the href should be understood as the description, rather than the content of the element?

[14:04:00.0000] <webben_>
because that could be a way of allowing much the same UI as longdesc allows but using an <a href="">

[14:05:00.0000] <webben_>
and it _might_ be possible for UAs to make it backwards compatible with screen readers that support longdesc now.

[14:05:01.0000] <webben_>
while old visual browsers would still at least get the visible link

[14:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: what problem would it be solving?

[14:06:01.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: programmatic association of description with img.

[14:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's not a problem it's a solution

[14:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
So apart from anything else, I don't understand why it is that there is general agreement that only a very few people will ever bother with longdesc but it is being argued that those people will still have visual design constraints that will prevent then putting <a href="longdesc.html">longer description</a> in the figure's caption

[14:07:02.0000] <webben_>
oh, sorry, yes, rapid navigation.

[14:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
rapid navigation of what?

[14:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused

[14:07:05.0000] <Hixie>
can you show me a page where there is this problem?

[14:07:06.0000] <webben_>
images

[14:08:00.0000] <webben_>
any page with an image and a description of the image

[14:08:01.0000] <webben_>
(off-page on on-page)

[14:08:02.0000] <webben_>
*or

[14:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
seems like the right solution is for the image to be hidden altogether from the user and for the description to be given inline

[14:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
why taunt the user by letting him know there's an image in the first place?

[14:09:01.0000] <webben_>
they might want to share the image. they might be referred to the image.

[14:10:00.0000] <webben_>
pulling the description inline from elsewhere could really mess up presentation of the page too

[14:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
do you have something more concrete? this seems very hypothetical.

[14:10:02.0000] <webben_>
replacing img with DOM from elsewhere seems rather hypothetical to me.

[14:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
who ever said anything about doing that?

[14:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
give me a url

[14:10:05.0000] <webben_>
what are you saying?

[14:10:06.0000] <Hixie>
and i will explain what i mean

[14:10:07.0000] <Hixie>
with that page as example

[14:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
(the url of a page with an image that is described)

[14:11:01.0000] <webben_>
righto

[14:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and described in a way that helps the user more than if the user didn't have access to a description)

[14:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
(it can be a fake demo page if you want)

[14:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
(since finding a real page that fufills those conditions is pretty hard)

[14:12:00.0000] <webben_>
indeed, thanks to people assuming graphics are easier follow

[14:18:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: actually the WAI longdesc example does this, since it has an actual link to the description from the same page as the chart: http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-curric/sam3-0.htm

[14:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
(wow that's horrific alt="" text)

[14:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and in a WAI spec no less)

[14:19:00.0000] <webben_>
the alt text is fine by HTML4's definition.

[14:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
Per HTML5, what is currently in longdesc="" for that page should just be in the alt="".

[14:19:02.0000] <webben_>
you can't put lists in alt

[14:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
so use <object>

[14:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
or, just put the description inline right next to the image, and use alt="", so that all users can benefit

[14:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
and not just those who have images hidden

[14:20:02.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: That longdesc is substantially more useful to me than the chart

[14:20:03.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: Me too. :)

[14:20:04.0000] <jgraham>
So why hide it in an attribute that almost no one can access?

[14:20:05.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, webben_ agreed. The description helps *everyone*

[14:20:06.0000] <Dashiva>
I imagine many complex images have longdesc that's semantically a table. Which will then apparently need a separate @summary. Oh ho.

[14:20:07.0000] <Hixie>
of the four solutions proposed here -- inline text, alt="", <object> fallback, and longdesc="" -- longdesc is the worst solution here

[14:21:00.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: er... that's not what I'm arguing for is it?

[14:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
don't hide it from me, even if you want to put it on a separate page for design reasons or whatever. Just use a normal link

[14:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
or just put it inline on the page

[14:21:03.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: Er, I'm not paying much attention to be honest

[14:21:04.0000] <jruderman>
"Future browsers or other agents will provide an optional a link to the description file called "graph1.htm"." such optimism

[14:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
five solutions. inline text, <a href="">, alt="", <object> fallback, and longdesc="". longdesc="" is the worst.

[14:22:00.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: I'm talking about programmatic associations between the <a href="graph1.htm" and the img.

[14:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
both for visually impaired users and for everyone else.

[14:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
The 5th and 6th solutions are 5) <a href="desc"><img ...></a> and 6)<img ...> <a href="desc">more information</>

[14:22:03.0000] <jgraham>
<figure>

[14:23:00.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: longdesc happens to do that, but I'm talking about whether describedby could provide the same mechanism without repeating the uri.

[14:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
webben_, I don't understand how you want to use describedby

[14:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
In fact <figure> + <details> could be neat

[14:23:03.0000] <webben_>
Lachy: well in that case, you'd stick an id on the link and refer to it from img with describedby

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i would personally mark it up as <img src="graph.png" alt=""><p>Ice Cube Tray sales tend to be higher further South, and tend to decline in autumn.</p><details><legend>Data</legend><dl><dt>Far North</dt><dd>Sales were 3, 4, 2, and 1 ice cube trays from...

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
no need to associate the image with the data -- in fact, no need to even show the image at all when the user can't view images

[14:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
it should be redundant with the text, thus alt="".

[14:25:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me agrees with Hixie, except s/autumn/spring/

[14:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
the graph doesn't show spring.

[14:25:04.0000] <webben_>
I think the notion that you're going to persuade designers to put massive blocks of text alongside every graph and diagram is optimistic, to say the least.

[14:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[14:25:06.0000] <Hixie>
i see

[14:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
you're from the upside down part of the planet

[14:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't show autumn either. It only shows months

[14:26:02.0000] <webben_>
fighting for links to text equivalents is hard enough

[14:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: i think the notion that you're going to persuade designiners to put those same massive blocks of text in a different page is even more fantastic.

[14:26:04.0000] <Dashiva>
We need an element to mark up seasons with, so it's clear what hemisphere the author is referring to

[14:26:05.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: What if you're on the equator?

[14:27:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: Oh, that's not so fantastic.

[14:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Flip a coin

[14:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: so far i have the web on my side -- people tend to put information about their graphs inline, and tend not to give external descriptions.

[14:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
(though of course it's much more common for them to not do either)

[14:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
but if the author really wanted to put the text externally he could too

[14:28:03.0000] <webben_>
i've mainly seen people trying to _hide_ equivalents.

[14:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
<p><a href="graph.html"><img src="graph.png" alt="View trends..."></a></p>

[14:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
(with graph.html containing what i wrote above)

[14:30:00.0000] <webben_>
so can the spec say that Long descriptions should either be in <figure> or 

[14:30:01.0000] <webben_>
linked via img link?

[14:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
which spec?

[14:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
wai?

[14:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[14:30:05.0000] <webben_>
HTML5

[14:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
html5 has an entire top-level-section dedicated to how you mark up text

[14:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
section 4

[14:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really see that we need to repeat it again

[14:32:00.0000] <webben_>
Section 4. is Web Browsers.

[14:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
section 4 is "The elements of HTML"

[14:35:00.0000] <webben_>
oh sorry, looking at the WD not the Editor's Draft.

[14:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://whatwg.org/html5 -- everything else is likely to be out of date :-)

[14:38:00.0000] <webben_>
hmm, this does make the image and its equivalent impossible to extract together.

[14:40:00.0000] <webben_>
I guess one could come up with microformats to make them extractable.

[14:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear that many users care about extracting them together

[14:41:00.0000] <webben_>
you'd probably need it to facilitate something like Aurora.

[14:41:01.0000] <hober>
besides which, <figure> covers that case, I think

[14:41:02.0000] <webben_>
hober: except when <figure isn't used.

[14:42:00.0000] <webben_>
why isn't figure used for the Carouge coat of arms?

[14:44:00.0000] <webben_>
is the idea that figure can't be main content?

[14:44:01.0000] <webben_>
"which can be moved away from the main flow of the document without affecting the document's meaning." ... I guess so.

[14:46:00.0000] <webben_>
hober: so that won't work for Aurora, where the example is a weather chart which appears to be the main content.

[14:46:01.0000] <webben_>
IIRC.

[15:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
given:

[15:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
<!DOCTYPE html><form><input name=a><input name=item></form>

[15:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
<script> var a = document.forms[0].item(0); w(a.name);

[15:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
</script>

[15:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
s/w/alert/

[15:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
what should the alert say?

[15:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
in IE the alert says "undefined"

[15:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
in every other browser, there is no item() method

[15:03:04.0000] <Hixie>
wtf is IE doing

[15:04:00.0000] <webben_>
that's freaky

[15:04:01.0000] <webben_>
does it do anything right with a?

[15:04:02.0000] <webben_>
e.g. a.tagName ?

[15:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
nope

[15:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
but alert(a) returns HTMLFormElement

[15:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[15:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
HTMLInputElement even

[15:05:03.0000] <webben_>
that's um, extra freaky

[15:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[15:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
typeof a returns string

[15:05:06.0000] <Hixie>
(!)

[15:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
wtf is IE doing

[15:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm going to ignore IE here

[15:06:02.0000] <jruderman>
it returns the string "HTMLInputElement"? that's not especially useful

[15:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's got to be a bug of some kind

[15:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, for longdesc to be included, is this all that needs to be provided: 1. Use cases, 2. Evidence that UAs have implemented usable UI, 3. Evidence that authors have begun to use it properly on a significant scale, and 4. Proof that it's better than any of the other solutions for the use cases?

[15:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
doesn't IE usually dodge these issues and alert "[object]"?

[15:07:03.0000] <Lachy>
did I miss anything?

[15:08:00.0000] <jruderman>
Lachy: i don't expect any of those to exist...

[15:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
jruderman, I realise they don't exist now. But I'm trying to explain in my next email what needs to be provided for longdesc to be considered for inclusion

[15:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: we have to go through the same process as everything else, as described in my recent e-mail to public-html, and as given on the whatwg faq

[15:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: which starts with establishing what the problem is

[15:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: and then considering solutions to that problem

[15:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll rephrase what I have to incorporate that. I'm just trying to make it as clear as possible what they need to provide

[15:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: IE8 changed that, it starts returning actual class names for host objects

[15:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i already did that

[15:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: and jf replied (completely missing the point)

[15:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: he didn't recognize "next best" as being part of the definition of opportunity cost

[15:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should clarify tomorrow

[15:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was impressed at how completely he failed at actually clearly describing a problem

[15:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
how answer to "Come up with a clear description of the problem that needs to be solved." was SIX paragraphs

[15:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
none of which actually gave a problem description

[15:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
he listed needs and requirements, without actually saying what he was trying to fix

[15:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
and as part of the _problem_ description, he asserted what the best solution was

[15:17:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Sometimes I wonder if there's actually a movement _for_ bolt-on accessibility because that way you're sure it's "real" accessibility and not "just" a side effect of language semantics.

[15:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe

[15:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
my goal is to improve actual end-user accessibility

[15:18:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If said movement exists, they would fight you every step of the way

[15:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt such a movement is conscious

[15:18:04.0000] <Dashiva>
True

[15:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
but i do think that there are people who have that mindset

[15:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's sad, since they are having a net negative effect on global accessibility

[15:19:02.0000] <hober>
classic "road to hell paved with good intentions"...

[15:20:00.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: Well, there was one fellow in HTML WG arguing to abolish the semantics of ordinary HTML elements and move all semantics to role or CSS or something.

[15:21:00.0000] <webben_>
(because of fears of presentational use of those elements contaminating the meaning)

[15:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't that more of an argument to remove default styling?

[15:21:02.0000] <webben_>
it would be _an_ argument for it yes

[15:22:00.0000] <webben_>
I think that may have been an alternative he put forward

[15:22:01.0000] <webben_>
at any rate, the principle is that bolt-on is more reliable

[15:23:00.0000] <webben_>
I don't think JF's arguing that bolt-on is better though.

[15:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Cascading Semantic Sheets came up in the RDFa thread as well

[15:23:02.0000] <webben_>
just that design considerations will require bolt-on

[15:24:00.0000] <webben_>
(compare Dojo's "restyling" of widgets - i.e. using div and span - leading (in part) to ARIA

[15:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, I think there's a significant difference between bolt-on information (e.g. longdesc) and bolt-on associations (e.g. pointing to normally visible content)

[15:25:00.0000] <webben_>
longdesc doesn't have to point to invisible content.

[15:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
No, but the implication order is switched

[15:25:02.0000] <Dashiva>
To have an association, you need the content to be present in the first place

[15:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
longdesc puts it in an invisible place, so it's quite possible the content isn't available from other places

[15:26:01.0000] <webben_>
by the information do you mean the URI?

[15:26:02.0000] <webben_>
as opposed to the description?

[15:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm not sure what you mean

[15:30:00.0000] <webben_>
hmm. I'm not sure what you mean either. :)

[15:30:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Just that the content should not be created for accessiblity purposes

[15:31:00.0000] <webben_>
what content? descriptions?

[15:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
webben_: All content, descriptions included

[15:36:00.0000] <webben_>
and it should instead be created for what purposes?

[15:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
For being useful in general

[15:37:00.0000] <webben_>
if useful in general === communicating to human beings, then that would appear to be the same thing.

[15:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, if you assume page authors are angelic beings of perfection

[15:39:00.0000] <webben_>
I thought you were making a statement about what they "should" do.

[15:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>
No, I'm making a statement about what we should hope for

[15:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And if we can make regular joes write content for regular joes, and get accessibility included by default, that's a win

[15:41:00.0000] <webben_>
people with disabilities are regular joes.

[15:41:01.0000] <Dashiva>
No, they're regular joes with disabilities

[15:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The more special treatment we require for accessiblity, the less we will get (outside of content ruled by certain laws)

[15:43:00.0000] <webben_>
If you're just restating Hixie's point that a language should have as much accessibility-for-free built in, then sure.

[15:43:01.0000] <webben_>
*as much ... as possible

[15:43:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Not just that, but the parts that aren't built-in should be as close as possible

[15:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So to get back to the start, stuff that requires _new_ content to be made for accessiblity is bad

[15:44:01.0000] <webben_>
new content?

[15:44:02.0000] <webben_>
like what?

[15:44:03.0000] <Dashiva>
...

[15:44:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Like longdesc, maybe?

[15:44:05.0000] <webben_>
longdesc isn't "content"

[15:45:00.0000] <webben_>
it points to content

[15:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes

[15:45:02.0000] <webben_>
by content, do you mean "code"?

[15:45:03.0000] <Dashiva>
No, I mean content

[15:45:04.0000] <Dashiva>
By putting longdesc in an invisible attribute, you place the assumption that the content it points to isn't interesting for anyone else

[15:45:05.0000] <webben_>
no you don't

[15:46:00.0000] <webben_>
that's the assumption developers of browsers have made

[15:46:01.0000] <webben_>
(well, some browsers)

[15:46:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If that wasn't the case, we wouldn't want to put it in an attribute, we'd put it in plain view for everyone

[15:46:03.0000] <webben_>
that's not at all obvious ... look at tile

[15:46:04.0000] <webben_>
*title

[15:47:00.0000] <webben_>
or indeed, IE displaying alt as tooltip

[15:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
A tooltip is special UI

[15:47:02.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: just as was supposed to exist for longdesc, yes.

[15:47:03.0000] <Dashiva>
You don't need speical UI for a link. We kinda invented those years ago.

[15:48:00.0000] <webben_>
I think that's premised on a single-model view of linking.

[15:49:00.0000] <webben_>
(that's not an unreasonable view of linking, but it's far from the only one)

[15:49:01.0000] <webben_>
it also doesn't really explain why we need a UI for advisory information

[15:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, turn it around. Why would you take an awesome accessibility resource and put it behind UI that doesn't exist yet? That seems like a very risky proposition.

[15:50:01.0000] <webben_>
Dashiva: Why use any new features?

[15:51:00.0000] <webben_>
all put interoperability at risk

[15:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Because when you frame it as accessiblity, you have to be twice as careful

[15:51:02.0000] <webben_>
or browser vendors might misunderstand what it's for?

[15:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You could see it as marketing. You get things done a lot easier by saying "You want this (and that way I get it too)" than just "I want this" :)

[15:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it actually _is_ the pipes screen saver (re your blog)

[15:53:02.0000] <webben_>
yeah, I'm not terribly impressed by the universalism school of accessibility marketing.

[15:54:00.0000] <webben_>
tends to lead to lots of effort spent making things work without JS and on old/broken browsers, and less attention to making things work for actual people.

[15:54:01.0000] <webben_>
(not that interoperability isn't a perfectly nice goal in its own right and all)

[15:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Take a cat herder view of our mandate, and things start to make sense :)

[15:57:00.0000] <annevk>
geez, >1000 log lines

[15:57:01.0000] <annevk>
longdesc spam?

[15:57:02.0000] <Dashiva>
This channel?

[15:57:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Mostly, yes

[15:57:04.0000] <annevk>
/me sighs

[15:57:05.0000] <Dashiva>
zcorpan talked some about dom core

[15:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
There might be some rubbish jokes in the log too

[15:58:01.0000] <webben_>
hixie talked about form and input stuff too

[15:58:02.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I filter your lines :p

[15:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe we need IRC threading

[15:59:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I'll put the trackerlib update on html5

[15:59:02.0000] <Dashiva>
There are experimental bots that do it, I hear

[15:59:03.0000] <csarven>
Or simply #tag a few lines!

[15:59:04.0000] <csarven>
That could let the reader scan the log lines for certain conversations.

[16:00:00.0000] <webben_>
@longdesc bla bla bla :)

[16:00:01.0000] <webben_>
or maybe "re longdesc bla bla bla"

[16:00:02.0000] <Dashiva>
csarven: Just search for \blongdesc\b or \balt\b and you've got your tags ;)

[16:00:03.0000] <csarven>
#readability #irc #logs

[16:00:04.0000] <annevk>
meanwhile, 1 person so far generated a diff with a different context (and maybe more people used it afterwards)

[16:01:00.0000] <csarven>
Dashiva I said "scan"ing the logs, not read every line ;)

[16:04:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, why does getElementsByTagNameNS not throw?

[16:09:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, done

[16:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: You probably want to sanitise the 'source' variable, instead of passing user input directly to the shell via popen

[16:16:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, how is source user input?

[16:17:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, I thought I killed that feature

[16:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?source=|shell%20code| etc

[16:19:00.0000] <annevk>
killed

[16:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Thanks :-)

[16:21:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, btw, svn log is still being hit; hopefully not intensive enough for it to be a problem, but if that turns out to be a problem as well let me know and I'll start caching that too

[16:29:00.0000] <annevk>
(svn complains about googlecode not having the right certificate)

[16:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, do you mean that Google Chrome actually loads and executes the real sspipes.scr, or does it just emulate it somehow?

[16:32:00.0000] <annevk>
it loads and executes the real sspipes.scr

[16:32:01.0000] <annevk>
see blogs

[16:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/browser/about_internets_status_view.cc

[16:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, cool. that mean it will also get the teapots :-)

[16:37:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, it's complete mystery to me how createElementNS arrives at localName

[16:41:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, getElementById should return the first element matching ID, I think

[16:41:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, not just any

[16:41:02.0000] <annevk>
/me thinks zcorpan scans  the backlog

[17:28:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, in Web Forms 2.0 the form="" attribute is a set of IDs

[19:51:00.0000] <faithfulgeek>
so I'm currently reading O'Reilly's book on RESTful Web Services, curious if URI Templating is still being considered for HTML 5

[19:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
I don't think it is

[19:53:00.0000] <faithfulgeek>
:( that was pretty exciting

[19:53:01.0000] <takkaria>
though I'm not quite sure what about URI templates HTML5 would be using

[19:54:00.0000] <faithfulgeek>
according to the book I'm reading, it was for forms

[19:54:01.0000] <faithfulgeek>
so you could say: <form action="..." template="something/{variable}"><input type="text" name="variable" /></form>

[19:56:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm not sure where that was proposed, but it doesn't appear to be in Web Forms 2

[19:56:01.0000] <faithfulgeek>
http://blog.whatwg.org/proposing-uri-templates-for-webforms-20

[19:57:00.0000] <takkaria>
the likelihood of it being in HTML5 I would imagine is vanishing

[20:01:00.0000] <faithfulgeek>
thanks for the info

[20:01:01.0000] <faithfulgeek>
it looks like they're still supporting put and delete as methods though, that's good to see!

[20:03:00.0000] <takkaria>
the Web Forms 2 spec is now being incorporated into HTML5

[20:03:01.0000] <takkaria>
so with any luck, non-Opera browsers might start implementing bits of it fairly soon :)

[20:03:02.0000] <faithfulgeek>
awesome

[20:04:00.0000] <faithfulgeek>
i'm preparing a presentation on REST services, and reading a book on it now, however the author is using a number of examples based on the proposed specs of 5 when it was written

[20:04:01.0000] <faithfulgeek>
so I'm trying to find out what's still valid and what's not

[20:05:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, the spec is the best place to look :)  though as I say, the forms section is still very much in progress

[20:05:01.0000] <faithfulgeek>
cool, thanks takkaria!

[00:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yeah the multiple id thing was dropped, see irc a few days ago

[02:13:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: why should getElementsByTagNameNS throw?

[02:14:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: i thought implementors didn't want to guarentee which element is returned because it allowed for optimization

[02:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: is step 3 unclear in createElementNS? i guess i need to specify what it means similar to how html5 defines "split on spaces"

[02:18:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, step 2 already talks about localName

[02:19:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, it does not throw now if you use a tagName of ">" or something?

[02:19:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, as for getElementById, I heard different arguments on that

[02:19:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: oops, that should be qualifiedName

[02:19:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it would be good to still split on spaces then, to allow for extensibility

[02:20:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: getElementsByTagNameNS('>') does not throw no

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk>
k

[02:24:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, I think Opera and Safari at least always return the first

[02:24:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, and Maciej said he'd like that to be specified

[02:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
getElementById?

[02:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah I think that should be spec'd

[02:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think you have to return first or at least something very close to it for web compat

[02:27:00.0000] <roc>
you mean return the first element in the document with a given ID?

[02:27:01.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2007Jan/thread.html#msg118

[02:27:02.0000] <roc>
Yeah, that's necessary for Web compat

[02:27:03.0000] <roc>
if you don't always return the first in the document, Amazon breaks

[02:27:04.0000] <annevk>
I'm told Gecko sometimes does something differently when mutations are evolved

[02:27:05.0000] <roc>
that's not true anymore

[02:27:06.0000] <annevk>
s/evolved/involved/

[02:28:00.0000] <annevk>
cool

[02:28:01.0000] <roc>
I seem to recall having this discussion a few months ago

[02:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I recall this as well

[02:30:01.0000] <annevk>
me too, though I'm not sure the above URL is that discussion

[02:31:00.0000] <annevk>
anyways, zcorpan_ didn't spec it as such, which is why we're having it again :)

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the test results at http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/longdesc.html no longer match I8b2

[02:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
IE8b2

[02:34:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok, fixed getElementById

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, qualifiedName should not match NCName as then it can't contain a ":"

[02:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is there any scenario where black box testing could distinguish between the tree builder managing text node coalescing in using an internal buffer and late-inserting text nodes and early-inserting text nodes and appending to them while in the tree?

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
s/in using/using/

[02:38:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: good point

[02:38:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
fixed

[02:39:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i guess you could have a setInterval that inspects the text node

[02:40:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, might be better to use QName instead of Name ?

[02:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: QName is NCName | PrefixedName

[02:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: ah. I hadn't thought of that

[02:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: however, the spec doesn't specify when the parser has to yield to let timeouts and intervals run

[02:41:03.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, yeah, so checking for that instead of Name and PrefixedName is a) less confusing and b) shorter

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so one could just pretend that when the parser yields, it hasn't seen the text at all yet

[02:42:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: but it should throw different exceptions (or well it does now)

[02:42:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: i'm considering dropping error checking altogether

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as far as I can tell, the parser only needs to yield when it sees a </script> end tag

[02:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and otherwise, yielding is up to the implementation

[02:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
which makes me wonder if Web compat requires some level of discretionary yielding

[02:44:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
there are libraries that poll the dom every X ms for an element

[02:44:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, I see, woefully over engineered

[02:44:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: indeed

[02:44:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: it's because namespaces are optional in dom3 core

[02:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
right now i just want to spec how things work

[02:45:01.0000] <annevk>
ok, well, keep notes :)

[02:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i am :)

[02:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: is the compat requirement that parser must yield every Y ms or is the compate requirement that whenever the parser yields for the CSS formatter, intervals must fire, too? 

[02:46:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: don't know

[02:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: for the library point of view it just wants to get the element as soon as it's available

[02:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. I guess I should check if Hixie has already specced this 

[02:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: yeah, but is it only to keep up with layout?

[02:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there any way to opt in to getting mutation events for parser-initiated insertions?

[02:48:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: no i think it's mainly to have e.g. buttons do something before the page has finished loading

[02:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: isn't that keeping up with layout?

[02:49:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i guess

[03:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in Gecko, the yielding from the parser depends on the user event queue

[03:06:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: You're aware that you have a doppelganger here in Oslo

[03:07:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I got a bit freaked out when he got of at the bus stop next to Opera

[03:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: I wasn't aware

[03:10:00.0000] <virtuelv>
He was so similar I tried to say hi to him

[03:10:01.0000] <virtuelv>
at which point he looked at me as if I was a loonie

[03:14:00.0000] <annevk>
heh, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243519 is fixed

[03:14:01.0000] <annevk>
I think this means I can simplify my CSS when Firefox 3.1 is reasonably deployed

[03:17:00.0000] <roc>
don't speak too soon, it already bounced out of the tree once :-)

[04:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ooh, I found a null pointer dereference vulnerability in Google Chrome

[04:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
<a href="about:crash">Click me for free puppies!</a>

[04:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't know how they didn't catch that problem

[04:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: am I right that reconstructing the list of active formatting elements is always a no-op when that step is hit in foreign content?

[04:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can the tree builder ever be in foreign content without the secondary insertion mode being 'in body', 'in cell' or 'in caption'?

[04:22:00.0000] <annevk>
in table seems to allow for it too, though it depends on whether foster parenting changes the insertion mode

[04:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ah. ok. for the optimization I had in mind, that suggests I should indeed only check for those modes and not for foreignness

[04:25:00.0000] <annevk>
seems foster parenting doesn't affect the insertion mode

[04:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I don't see the bug. When I click a link to about:crash in Chrome, it takes me to about:blank

[04:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it seems to do the same thing with all the other about: URIs too

[04:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh :-(

[04:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me didn't actually test it

[04:36:00.0000] <annevk>
supposedly <a href="foo:%">x</a> or something should crash it

[04:37:00.0000] <annevk>
(the whole browser)

[04:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
That just makes it ask me about starting an external application to handle foo

[04:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tries to figure if the "Any other end tag" algorithm for 'in body' simplifies significantly on the implied </option>

[04:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
hsivonen: what optimisation are you thinking of doing?

[04:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: not searching runs of characters for spaces in certain insertion modes

[04:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: have you checked if "any other end tag" simplifies on "</option>"?

[04:46:00.0000] <takkaria>
no, I've not tried optimising the treebuilder at all in Hubbub yet

[04:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, href="fo%:x" then?

[04:48:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe it's patched already

[04:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
some funny url thing with %s would take down the whole browser

[04:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not sure if they fixed it

[04:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(I do not believe the webkit.org version of WebKit ever had this vulnerability

[04:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
)

[04:50:02.0000] <annevk>
Safari had a unknown protocol vulnerability on Windows, but a different one

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk>
(I don't think the %-thing is a security issue though.)

[04:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone says ctrl+l then ":%" crashes, but it works fine for me

[04:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I hope Google hasn't been automatically downloading patches to my computer without telling me about it

[04:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: at least one check simpliefies away

[04:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay, it looks like they have been downloading patches automatically without telling me

[04:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
since the UA version has gone from 0.2.149.27 to 0.2.149.29

[04:56:00.0000] <takkaria>
hsivonen: I'll be keeping an eye on your SVN logs for optimisations to steal :)

[04:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: do new tabs start a new engine version while the browser is still running?

[04:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No idea

[05:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
That would be crazy, but neat :-)

[05:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
because for security updates, the user should either be prompted to restart the browser ASAP or the fix should be hot-applicable

[05:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so if they aren't prompting...

[05:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
At least on Vista, Chrome seems to install itself in per-user directories rather than the proper global applications directory, so you don't get UAC prompts when something is trying to update its files, which seems good for usability but bad for security

[05:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: do you have a mechanism for dropping the initial LF in textarea and pre without having a per-token memory access cost?

[05:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I just have a naive needToDropLF which is written to very often

[07:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has Safari crash half way through commenting on annevk's blog

[07:20:00.0000] <annevk>
yay

[07:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Parallels leaks "video memory" of the virtual machine

[07:20:02.0000] <Retrieving>
/me #whatwg modes...

[07:21:00.0000] <annevk>
I have this illusion that Hixie's and my blog are of a rare breed of blogs that end up in browser bug databases

[07:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Mine was in the IE8 one

[07:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
text-shadow and @font-face need graphics layer integration and Chrome has a different graphics layer

[07:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
<video> and <audio> in Safari use QuickTime

[07:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so it makes sense that those features would not work up front

[07:23:02.0000] <gsnedders>
SQL is likely disabled 'cos it'll be globalStorage in that branch of WebKi

[07:23:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*WebKit

[07:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
btw, what does Chrome do about sharing the HTTP cache between processes?

[07:24:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, if that's in response to my post, I did point that out

[07:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: That was basically what I was trying to write

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: you didn't mention specifics :-)

[07:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, Google has to have a plan for <video>

[07:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it'll be interesting to see what it is

[07:25:03.0000] <hsivonen>
will they use OpenCORE instead of DirectShow on Windows?

[07:25:04.0000] <hsivonen>
something different?

[07:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
On the whole I expect they'll use DirectShow/QT/GStreamer

[07:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me still hasn't seen an explanation of the OpenCORE MPEG-LA story for Android

[07:26:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, fair enough :)

[07:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I expect the company selling/distributing it has to pay the patent fees, so unofficial builds can't have support

[07:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: if it will work like that, it seems that the Apache license then has a whole in its patent language through which someone can introduce royalty-bearing technology as long as the royalty collector is structured as a separate entity

[07:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: The Apache License only covers those held by those who wrote the code.

[07:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: It has no bearing on any other.

[07:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
s/whole/hole/

[07:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's scary when one starts making speech recognition-style errors when typing

[07:35:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, I think it's quite natural. don't worry about it :)

[07:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Thx for dealing with the hotel BTW

[07:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Nice you shoving me and smedero in one room :P

[07:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, well you two were gonna share anyway, so it made sense to me.

[07:38:01.0000] <BenMillard>
also, I need somewhere to retreat to after pwning you all at GT :D

[07:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: You won't pwn me!

[07:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[07:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: You may win, but I doubt by much, unless I make a big mistake (rare)

[07:39:03.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, to be honest I'll just be playing for fun. :)

[07:39:04.0000] <BenMillard>
I often make big mistakes...consistency is the part I suck at

[07:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Well you're the one making it competitive :)

[07:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Want to race around the Nürburgring? :P

[07:40:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Know the track?

[07:40:03.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I know and am faster than the AI on all the tracks from GT up to and including GT4.

[07:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Beating the AI isn't hard

[07:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so I won't be a noob, but I'm not pr0 either

[07:41:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I think we should start with Fuji Speedway 2005 because of the run-off areas.

[07:41:03.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I tend to, within Forza 2, be within the top thousand times around each track. Fear.

[07:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Peh! There's no damage model!

[07:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: The Circuit de la Sarthe is fine too

[07:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, is 8MB/s reasonable Validator.nu SAX parser performance?

[07:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: The hard corners have plenty of run-off

[07:43:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, Fuji has tarmac run-off so mistakes in 2-player will cost you some time, but won't be race over.

[07:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Peh! Mistakes should kill you! :P

[07:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
If I do it multicoredly then I can parse about a thousand pages per second, which I guess is okay

[07:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: is that tree-buffered or streaming?

[07:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I think buffered, since I'm using XmlViolationPolicy.ALLOW

[07:45:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I'd like us to use a range of cars and tracks. Short courses like Autumn Ring Mini and Grand Valley East Section with Nissan mm-R Cup Car, for example.

[07:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I much prefer the Autumn Ring to the "mini"

[07:47:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, it's a bit long for the mm-R but in 2P I guess it'll still be fun. :)

[07:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I can't really remember the cars

[07:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I'll need to practice

[07:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is getting the input through a GZIPInputStream, which seems to compress things to ~20%, so a thousand pages a second is ~5MB/s, so hopefully his disk won't be a severe bottleneck

[07:48:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, having spent several months in GT3 with all driver aids off, I've been trying the same in GT4. Takes a while to get used to but I love it now.

[07:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is actually in large debate trying to draw up the deliberations of the National Youth Assembly of the Church of Scotland 2008

[07:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, you have to turn them off in the Settings for *each* car though, which SUCKS.

[07:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't understand the point of David Poehlman's reply to me

[07:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Isn't it an *incredibly* bad idea for a blind person to get a computer without audio out (unless the person is *also* deaf)?

[07:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, if they can operate a PC exclusively through Braille output then it would work, I imagine.

[07:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(and conventional or Braille-labelled keyboard input)

[07:54:01.0000] <wilhelm>
hsivonen: http://www.blindeforbundet.no/nbf/publikasjoner/brosjyrer/teksthefte/Leselist.jpg

[07:55:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Works fine without audio.

[07:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard, wilhelm: sure Braille displays exist, but it still seems like a bad idea to not have audio capability in hardware

[07:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
If a person is not deaf but just somehow managed to get hardware without audio output capability, that's not an accessibility issue

[08:05:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: Agreed. Choice of hardware is a output media independence issue, but not intrinsically an accessibility issue.

[08:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't like dom's error checking at all

[08:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it checks for some things but not others and the things it checks sometimes don't match what xml requires anyway

[08:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It'll be interesting to see if Safari will next spoof as Chrome and if they will start having authoritative=really-Chrome and authoritative=really-Safari

[08:20:02.0000] <zcorpan>
and you can smuggle in stuff from other documents without checking anyway

[08:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the questions are

[08:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
is there a reason why we can't drop all error checking

[08:22:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and

[08:22:02.0000] <zcorpan>
if we do, do we need to make createElement('<div>') or createElement('<div foo="bar">') do something magic

[08:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: does IE implement full attribute tokenization for those?

[08:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: afaict yeah

[08:23:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: though i haven't tested much

[08:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
document.createElement('<x y z=a x x y u>'); works as you'd expect

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems to trigger iff the first character is '<'

[08:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what if the string tokenizes to multiple tags?

[08:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what if it tokenizes to and end tag?

[08:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
what about "<>"?

[08:29:03.0000] <annevk>
I'd rather throw an error if the first char is "<" than implementing some small start tag tokenizer just for createElement

[08:29:04.0000] <hsivonen>
or something else that doesn't tokenize to a start tag

[08:29:05.0000] <Philip`>
It ignores everything after the first '>'

[08:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: presumably, one could reuse the real tokenizer

[08:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems to throw an error if it starts with '</'

[08:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
(but if e.g. it starts with '<!' then it'll just make an element whose name starts with '!')

[08:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
although it would probably lead to code duplication, since in a C++-based browser it could be perf win not to make the tree builder methods virtual

[08:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, if you just have '<>' then it makes an element named '<>'; if you have e.g. '<>x' then it throws an error

[08:31:02.0000] <annevk>
fail

[08:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sounds like fun

[08:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Out of n pages for an unknown value of n, I see one that does document.createElement('<iframe frameborder="0">')

[08:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
(http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/issue_items/education.htm)

[08:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
(n = tens of thousands, I think)

[08:35:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, btw, I think adoptNode basically becomes a no-op

[08:38:00.0000] <takkaria>
I think that's quite a cool shortcut :)

[08:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me continues to be amazed at an XML parser implementation where parseContent and parseElement are mutually recursive and the stack gets deeper as the parse progresses

[08:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose it's not even tail recursion?

[08:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I didn't check

[08:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: though IIRC, gcc can optimize tail recursion away in C

[08:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: so perhaps they feel it's OK to ship code like that in Classpath if GCJ fixes it

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me realises that storing all his page data in a single file is a bad idea since he'd need 8-byte offset pointers to refer to each page

[08:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it's not tail recusion AFAICT

[08:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I used a .sparseimage

[08:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwebkit.org%2Fperf%2Fsunspider-0.9%2Fcrypto-aes.html doesn't whine about non-ascii

[08:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose I should just split the data into chunks, so it's easier to process in parallel

[08:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: thanks

[08:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: doesn't it change ownerDocument?

[08:57:00.0000] <annevk>
RB: "At this point Ian, you're plugging your ears and screaming "I can't hear you" when you say something like that. You need to stop acting like a child and step up and participate in this WG and be a real editor."

[08:58:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, insertNode and all need to do that

[08:58:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, and insertBefore etc.

[09:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: ok

[09:05:00.0000] <annevk>
though maybe adoptNode should do it too in case people use it and then simply check ownerDocument

[09:06:00.0000] <annevk>
in any case, adoptNode is pointless

[09:06:01.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder if it can be dropped too

[09:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
RB is teh funny

[09:09:00.0000] <takkaria>
I like how he calls the permathread "deliberations" myself

[09:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL! :-D "At this point Ian, you're plugging your ears and screaming "I can't hear you" when you say something like that. You need to stop acting like a child and step up and participate in this WG and be a real editor."

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries to steal ideas from Sawzall

[09:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
grr. Java TCK is still for JCP participants only

[09:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wants unit tests for SortedSet

[09:17:00.0000] <annevk>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/chrome-ua/ :/

[09:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's not 0.2.149.27 any more, since they already updated it to .29)

[09:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I started writing the post before the update

[09:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
where do Classpath and Harmony keep their unit tests?

[09:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
"This is the WebKit version from with Chrome branched its copy." - s/with/which/

[09:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: fixed. tahnks

[09:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, perhaps it *is* scary to typo the response to feedback about a typo?

[09:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: no, I think the scariness of these cases goes the other way round

[09:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, I make typos in all cases...I just try to be brave about it :P

[09:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me finally finds Harmony TreeSet tester

[09:38:00.0000] <annevk>
Opera/9.51 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) is quite nice

[09:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder if anyone checks for the U, ever

[09:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: looks like I'm late :-(

[09:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what was the KHTML version WebKit originally forked from? 

[09:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
am I wrong about who put "KHTML" first in the UA string?

[09:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
The longest in my recent logs is "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) ;  Embedded Web Browser from: http://bsalsa.com/; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; Zune 2.5; InfoPath.2)"

[09:44:00.0000] <BenMillard>
fwiw, I've never even worked on a project where user-agent sniffing was used, let alone needed to do it myself.

[09:44:01.0000] <BenMillard>
nearest I've come is conditional comments for a few IE CSS fixes

[09:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
and even that's quite rare

[09:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm pretty sure I have the history of the "KHTML" part right and the other author has it wrong

[09:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
I still sort-of-maintain some code that has a $ENV{HTTP_USER_AGENT} =~ /MSIE 5.*?Mac/ check

[09:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
since apparently style="filter:shadow(...)" did bad things on that, or something

[09:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
according to http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php?name=Konqueror Konqueror started including "KHTML" only at 3.2 and that release already had code flowing back from Apple

[09:48:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I do use the User-Agent lines reported in my server logs to make general decisions about which browsers to spend time getting the CSS to work properly.

[09:48:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hence I still support IE6

[09:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.1; Linux 2.4.22-10mdk; X11; i686; fr, fr_FR)

[09:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.1-rc3; i686 Linux; 20020515)

[09:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
are in my logs, so I guess it looks like 3.1 didn't say "KHTML"

[09:49:03.0000] <Lachy>
wow, now RB is claiming that "The longdesc attribute is not another linking mechanism."

[09:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, he's at the top of my do-not-respond list, so I definitely won't be responding to his nonsense

[09:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, as planned I've happily returned to my "ignore nearly everything which happens on Public-HTML" mode

[09:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose he's saying it's wrong to always think of it like <a href> when it could be processed like <iframe src> instead, which sounds sort of reasonable by itself

[09:53:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, it enables me to spend time doing stuff which is useful. :)

[09:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, the way longdesc is implemented in UAs is exactly like a link, even if they choose to open in a new window by default. No implementation has yet used it to somehow embed the resource within the page itself

[09:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
although, hypothetically, I suppose they could do that, but then the same argument could be made about href too

[09:55:01.0000] <webben>
"This attribute specifies a link to a long description of the image".

[09:55:02.0000] <webben>
yep, it is a "link" of sorts, though no UI is mandated for either

[09:56:00.0000] <webben>
as you say

[09:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, ignoring it seems like a good idea. As of this morning, I decided to send no more responses to those longdesc threads

[09:58:01.0000] <annevk>
that's a bit late dude :p

[09:59:00.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, according to HTML4: "The alt attribute provides a short description of the image. This should be sufficient to allow users to decide whether they want to follow the link given by the longdesc attribute to the longer description, here 'sitemap.html'." -- http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html#idx-long_image_description

[09:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, yeah, I know. I got sucked into feeding the trolls again :-(

[09:59:02.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, so HTML4 thinks longdesc is like href and alt is like the content area of <a href>, by my reading.

[10:00:00.0000] <webben>
for some value of "like href" that's true. they both specify links, namely, although different types of links

[10:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, according to HTML4: "The src attribute specifies the initial document the frame will contain." -- http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/frames.html#idx-frame-3

[10:02:01.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, so HTML4 thinks src immediately loads the resource, whereas it thinks longdesc is fetched on demand.

[10:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(either of those could be changed in HTML5, of course)

[10:03:01.0000] <webben>
for frames at least.

[10:04:00.0000] <webben>
BenMillard: Something could be loaded on demand into an img or frame, I guess.

[10:04:01.0000] <webben>
bit like an img can be selectively enabled in Fx.

[10:04:02.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, hey this is weird, <iframe src> links through to <input src> for it's definition of src! (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/frames.html#edef-IFRAME and http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-src respectively)

[10:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, I was going by the Index of the HTML4 Attributes, which lists <frame src> as applying to both <frame> and <iframe>: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/index/attributes.html

[10:05:01.0000] <webben>
oh noes ... best report it for the all important HTML 4.01 errata ;)

[10:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I think that's called HTML5, isn't it? :P

[10:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I just noticed HTML4 uses bee-keeping in an example here (never noticed that before): http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#edef-TITLE

[10:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: ASCII whining fixed. thanks.

[10:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: </p> whining on </dd> fixed. thanks

[10:46:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, is there some Web SVN view on Validator.nu progress?

[10:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: there isn't

[11:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me cuts source location comparisons when validating cnn.com by 87% by replacing TreeSet with appropriately head and tail biased linked list-backed SortedSet implmentations

[11:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it was rather surpising that location comparisons for Show Source were a hot spot

[11:11:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, Hixie: ping

[11:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me can now write data to files with an entirely lovely combination of RandomAccessFile and ByteArrayOutputStream and DeflaterOutputStream and cPickle

[11:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It makes me feel a bit dirty :-( )

[11:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: do you have a regression testing system for v.nu?

[12:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: yeah that's where it comes from

[12:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: pong, but about to go offline for a bit

[12:02:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, word on the street is that HTML5 says that myHTMLNode.localName should return lower case?

[12:03:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, you sure that's not going to break stuff given that gecko has returned upper case for ages?

[12:03:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, or rather, what do you have to indicate that that won't break stuff :)

[12:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
webkit returns lowercase

[12:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i got several requests to keep at least one thing consistent between XHTML and HTML

[12:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
so it seemed like the least dangerous choice

[12:05:00.0000] <sicking>
least dangerous why?

[12:05:01.0000] <sicking>
it does seem like the most desireable for sure, not sure about least dangerous

[12:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
well tagName seemed like a big danger in comparison, e.g.

[12:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
and localName is relatively new compared to the others

[12:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not saying _not_ dangerous

[12:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
just _least_ dangerous

[12:05:06.0000] <Hixie>
i really have to go now

[12:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
send mail if you want to follow up

[12:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
or wait a few hours :-)

[12:06:02.0000] <sicking>
ok

[12:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: hey

[12:16:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, yo

[12:16:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: i'm working on fixing dom core - http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core

[12:17:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: i'm considering dropping error checking altogether, do you think that would be feasible?

[12:21:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, what is that spec, i've never seen it before

[12:21:01.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, it seems to have a lot of missing parts

[12:23:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, and specifically which error checking do you want to drop? the nodename ones?

[12:26:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: i started to work on it last week

[12:26:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: the checking against XML and XMLNS productions

[12:28:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, how do you mean?

[12:28:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
e.g. createElementNS throws if you pass in something that's not a QName

[12:28:02.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, ok

[12:28:03.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, is that something that we really don't want to enforce?

[12:29:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, we've enforced that in gecko for a while and I don't think i've seen any bugs about it

[12:29:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: thing is that it's not enforced, you can still get elements that aren't QName by adopting elements from other documents

[12:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: and the checking is arbitrary, everything isn't checked and some things are checked but not against what xml says but something different

[12:30:01.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, hmm..

[12:30:02.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, i guess the html parser can produce a somewhat larger set of node names

[12:30:03.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, still has some restrictions though

[12:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: indeed

[12:31:01.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, the two things that i remember specifically not wanting to allow was null characters and spaces in node names

[12:31:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: i'd be fine with checking for things that the html parser can't produce

[12:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: but right now it's just arbitrary and useless imho

[12:32:01.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, i'd be fine with loosening things a little, but i don't think i want to get too crazy

[12:32:02.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, i don't see much value in allowing too crazy node names

[12:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: ok

[12:34:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, but in general allowing the DOM and the parser to create the same set of names makes sense to me

[12:35:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: ok. thanks

[12:36:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: another thing, gecko in quirks mode allows createElement('<div>'), but opera and webkit don't

[12:36:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: is that something that could be changed in gecko?

[12:36:02.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, yeah, that originally came from some internal sites at IBM

[12:37:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, hard to say, i'm sure sites will break if we remove it

[12:37:01.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, the syntax originally comes from IE which allows you to do stuff like   createElement('<div foo=bar>')

[12:38:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, but we didn't want to go that far

[12:38:01.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, i think we added support for this pretty recently, around 4 years ago or so

[12:40:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: hmm. i see we have at least one bug on createElement('<p>')

[12:40:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://www.voetaf.com.br/

[12:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
or it does document.createElement("<OPTION>");

[12:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i don't want to have createElement be different in quirks mode though

[12:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: do you consider '1' to be a crazy element name?

[12:49:00.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, well, i think the discussion should be had in a broader audience. But from a security point of view that is fine with me

[12:49:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
sicking: ok

[12:49:02.0000] <sicking>
zcorpan_, possibly we could allow crazier names for HTML nodes than for non-HTML nodes

[12:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
clearly some characters shouldn't be allowed in tag names

[12:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. ' ' or '>'

[12:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
so if we're going to have to do checks anyway

[12:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
it seems like we might as well do more

[12:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
IE allows ' ' and '>' as tag name

[12:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me is generally reluctant to change the spec given how much effort has gone into following the spec and testing it in the first place

[13:00:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i wonder where dom core discussion should take place

[13:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I have a system waiting without the tests, because I haven't yet seen Hixie say that the spec is stable enough for a lot of test to be written

[13:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I suppose i should start writing tests regardless

[13:23:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: you could write tests as you fix bugs

[13:24:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: how does the system work? if i want to contribute with tests

[13:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
The system requires each test to live on an HTTP server somewhere

[13:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
then the tester front end is asked to dump JSON for that URL

[13:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
this JSON can the be edited to make the permitted error locations more wide

[13:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
then the JSON reference dump is committed to a big JSON file using the front end tool

[13:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the front end can then run all the tests in the big file or be asked to run individual tests

[13:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, there's a testing system for the tokenizer (html5lib) and thee builder (html5lib)

[13:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but the bugs you found recently where ouside the tokenizer in the IO layer

[13:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not at my develoment machine ATM

[13:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I can write docs for this tomorrow

[13:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: so how would a test for the ascii bug look like?

[13:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: <!DOCTYPE html><title>ä</title> served without charset on the HTTP layer

[13:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: doesn't it need to say somehow what is expeced?

[13:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: yeah, but I can't autogenerate the reference JSOn from this computer

[13:34:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: ah ok

[13:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but it's basically the out=json format

[13:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I see JF still thinks that any decision made at any point equals attaching semantic meaning

[13:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, that line of reasoning is just stretching the truth in order to fit his preconceived notions

[13:58:01.0000] <Dashiva>
How would he handle an image that was selected at random, like Hixie's front page image?

[13:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
now he's going for the whole "choice" argument, saying we should include it simply because it provides another choice

[13:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
why do you people even listen to the guy

[13:59:02.0000] <annevk>
sicking, pong

[13:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
he's obviously either a crackpot or a troll

[14:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, we don't, he's just funny

[14:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, his arguments are

[14:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me starts his stopwatch to see how long it takes for someone to complain to public-html about his inappropriate behaviour

[14:00:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I do it to atone for my otherwise merciless commentary

[14:00:04.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if he has ever heard of the paradox of choice? Or used a Mac

[14:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I bet he's a big fan of linux on the desktop ;)

[14:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me is a big fan of gnome-on-linux-on-the-desktop :)

[14:02:00.0000] <annevk>
sicking, I guess you settled it with Hixie

[14:23:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders who those anonymous people are who are spamming Chrome accessibility links on his blog

[15:26:00.0000] <annevk>
news.google.com/newspapers is slowish

[15:26:01.0000] <annevk>
been a long time since I've encountered that at a Google site

[15:27:00.0000] <annevk>
(where slowish means not possible to use)

[15:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems to work alright for me, although the timeline view indicates that "google" has been mentioned at fairly constant non-zero rate since 1890

[15:32:00.0000] <svl>
date extraction is totally screwy. taking birthdays and the like as publication dates

[15:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
It has a Wikipedia page dated to 1969 too

[15:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, cool, that must have been from the old days when wikipedia was edited on blackboards with chalk and dusters.

[15:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Reverting vandals was a huge pain back then

[15:40:00.0000] <annevk>
the frontpage is fast enough btw

[15:40:01.0000] <annevk>
it was browsing newspapers that was not doable

[15:41:00.0000] <annevk>
/me finds "4004 BC"

[15:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, yeah, especially those vandals that did their handywork with spray paint.

[15:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if anyone has made a form of XML that allows efficient random access into files

[16:32:00.0000] <annevk>
Opera actually shows EXIF data if you rightclick an image and hit properties

[16:33:00.0000] <annevk>
seems that Flickr removes it for everything but the original photo though

[16:36:00.0000] <annevk>
roc, thanks for http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2008/09/some_boring_css.html

[16:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
earliest mention of me seems to be:

[16:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
Aug 16, 1999 -  "I am quite happy to work for mozilla just to get a decent, free, standards compliant browser onto the market," said Ian Hickson, a Web developer from the UK who contributed to the mozilla BugAThon project. "That is an incentive in itself, the rest is just a bonus."

[16:36:03.0000] <annevk>
/me filed that long ago

[16:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
(earliest mention in actual news, anyway)

[16:36:05.0000] <annevk>
Google claims my about page is the earliest mention of me

[16:36:06.0000] <Hixie>
i was 19 at the time. i was a random student, not a "Web developer from the UK"

[16:36:07.0000] <annevk>
from 1986

[16:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[16:41:00.0000] <roc>
annevk: no sweat

[16:43:00.0000] <annevk>
I don't think I ever positioned the root element for any purpose, but positioning the body element against the root element that has a border was something I tried

[16:43:01.0000] <annevk>
(which then failed in Firefox at which point I filed that bug)

[16:45:00.0000] <roc>
when you filed the bug I don't think anyone except Opera got it right

[16:47:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej, roc, annevk: your input on http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2008JulSep/0441.html would be very welcome

[16:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
if there's someone in your respective organisations i should ping in particular, i'd be happy to do so, just let me know

[16:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: interesting

[16:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: any quantitative results available?

[16:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
the numbers vary a lot based on the kind of page, from what i understand

[16:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I am interested in how much it saves compared to gzip compression

[16:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: or other straightforward compression schemes

[16:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
well, for a page like, say, the google results page, gzip can only compress the page, whereas this can compress the header and footer parts dramatically

[16:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I see a slide deck, guess I will look at that

[16:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sure it sounds interesting in theory

[16:54:02.0000] <roc>
Lab result

[16:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
the proposal is in the PDF

[16:54:04.0000] <roc>
About 40 percent data reduction better than Gzip alone on Google search.

[16:54:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I would like to see numbers

[16:54:06.0000] <roc>
See faster Google search results. Especially under low bandwidth and high latency condition.

[16:54:07.0000] <roc>
so would I

[16:54:08.0000] <Hixie>
i shall poke for numbers

[16:54:09.0000] <othermaciej>
preferably on a wide range of sites

[16:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
having a per-site compression index does carry some risks

[16:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
complexity, new attack surface, etc

[16:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
for sure

[16:55:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but it also sounds in theory like it could be a big win

[16:55:04.0000] <roc>
yeah

[16:55:05.0000] <Philip`>
Also it'd be interesting to compare to gzip with a preset dictionary

[16:55:06.0000] <roc>
in principle it sounds good

[16:55:07.0000] <othermaciej>
true, a preset dictionary for the general web including common html and css constructs might be a big win too

[16:56:00.0000] <roc>
this could subsume that if you allow Access-Controls on dictionaries

[16:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also maybe to gzip of multi-request/response keepalived stream (i.e. compress the whole stream, not just each response separately))

[16:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and btw I am specifically interested in perf on a large variety of realistic examples, not just the best-case examples

[16:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(or else convincing argument that best case is very common)

[16:57:04.0000] <roc>
search pages are pretty common

[16:57:05.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe we could just hardcode Google's header and footer into all UAs

[16:57:06.0000] <roc>
but yeah

[16:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would hope it is more broadly applicable than google search result pages

[17:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
the paper mentioned in the e-mail is here: http://sdch.googlegroups.com/web/Shared_Dictionary_Compression_over_HTTP.pdf

[17:02:00.0000] <roc>
ok, I've read it

[17:03:00.0000] <roc>
with this design, you can't actually share dictionaries across domains, because that would open an DoS attack against other sites

[17:03:01.0000] <roc>
well, at least a reduction in performance

[17:04:00.0000] <roc>
so how do I give feedback?

[17:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
reply on the list

[17:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
(the http list, that is)

[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really know where the right place to standardise this would be if y'all are interested in taking this further

[17:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
probably a new w3c or ietf wg

[17:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
(no idea how the ietf works)

[17:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, he also attached the PDF, i totally didn't notice

[17:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/36097 is funny

[17:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me finds a part of wf2 that requires browsers to implement time travel

[17:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
paradox-avoiding time travel, even

[17:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I hope you didn't remove it, I was depending on that feature in my new awesome framework

[17:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i need a word for what we do to check the validity of a form that isn't "validity"

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
since we use that for conformance

[17:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
constraint cecking maybe

[17:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
checking

[17:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Constraint is good. 

[17:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
Filled-inedness

[17:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me takes Philip`'s merit badge back

[17:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
you now have -1 merit badges. :-P

[17:34:02.0000] <Dashiva>
User cooperation ensurance

[17:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[17:34:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Is ensurance a word?

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
you guys realise i now have to use both of these ideas in the spec somehow right

[17:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I will deny everything

[17:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
i have logs!

[17:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I could claim impersonation

[17:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
mmm.

[17:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
bummer.

[17:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
This is where you're supposed to vaguely hint to some kind of vast google conspiracy to control and monitor all traffic on the net

[17:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh right

[17:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
"google doesn't comment on future products and services"

[17:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I suppose I should try to at least pretend I sleep at sane times, as I'm not being paid to stay awake at night.

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you get paid for your work instead of your ass-in-a-chair-ness, then you can just work at night

[17:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, but even if I did go to the university at midnight, I doubt any students would show up to get help :)

[17:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah well

[17:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
that i can't help you with

[17:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
i recommend getting students to ask for help by e-mail

[17:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-D

[17:46:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Not like they show up in daytime either...

[17:46:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, tried that too. Maybe it'll pick up when the exercises get harder.

[17:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
When I took the course myself, I did email my predecessor quite a bit

[17:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
If the exercises are easy, they can do them without any help; if the exercises are hard, they won't do them at all and will instead play frisbee or whatever

[17:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't quite sure what lazy students do nowadays

[02:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: what's wrong with "Form validation"?

[02:08:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: why the difference between <!DOCTYPE html><title></title><table><tr><td></tbody><table></table> and <!DOCTYPE html><title></title><table><tr><td></tr><table></table> ?

[02:10:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: i think it's good to stick with terminology that people actually use, otherwise we end up with the same problem that wcag2 had

[02:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I guess the tree builder goes through one mode mode in the latter case

[02:14:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i guess html5 parser + relaxng doesn't make it easy to reach the "one message per mistake" optimum

[02:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: they sure don't

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for about three reasons

[02:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
1) HTML5 prescribes errors and sometimes jumps through more than one error-emitting state

[02:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
2) tree builder error correction introduces implied stuff that can react with RELAX NG

[02:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
3) RELAX NG element position errors suck after the first element position error

[02:18:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: perhaps you could make it slightly better by having a "validator friendly" mode in the parser that omits "duplicate" errors and makes the tree more useful

[02:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: would one ever want to have the duplicate errors for anything except unit tests?

[02:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: no :)

[02:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess it would be feasible to make an "at most one tree builder error per token" rule

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
however, maintaining a different tree builder mode for validation would be painful

[02:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
originally, I wanted the tree builder to have 3 modes

[02:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
1) tree building and conforming

[02:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
2) streaming and conforming (i.e. fatal error on non-streamable cases)

[02:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
3) streaming and non-conforming streamable recovery

[02:21:03.0000] <annevk>
(It would be nice if </br/> also generated just one error.)

[02:21:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I never got around to #3 and recently removed the code that anticipated such a mode

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: wouldn't an ""at most one tree  builder error per token" rule

[02:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
do that

[02:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[02:24:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: forgetting an </ol> end tag is an example where v.w.o has more useful behavior

[02:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
are the assumptions of the html5lib serializer tests documented somewhere?

[02:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Serializer_tests is empty

[02:27:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, the second / is a tokenization error

[02:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh right. 

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
however, it's an error that could be trivially moved to the tree builder phase

[02:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if the spec and implementors agree, so that the unit tests agree with it being a tree builder error

[02:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: anyway, I think </br/> isn't a case worth optimizing

[02:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so we probably should leave it as is

[02:31:00.0000] <annevk>
true

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk>
wow

[02:37:01.0000] <annevk>
with IE8 in standards mode people have to prefix overflow-x and overflow-y

[02:37:02.0000] <annevk>
http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/09/08/microsoft-css-vendor-extensions.aspx

[02:37:03.0000] <roc>
wah?

[02:37:04.0000] <annevk>
I wonder who comes up that

[02:38:00.0000] <roc>
We support it without prefix, and Opera and Webkit do too, right?

[02:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wow they prefixed filter

[02:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and changed the syntax

[02:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
bold

[02:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps it's like making getAttribute not return null

[02:40:01.0000] <roc>
hmm

[02:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
wait I though they reverted that

[02:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
or rather

[02:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
matched other browsers instead of spec

[02:40:05.0000] <roc>
text-overflow, background-position and word-wrap are also interoperably implemented without prefix

[02:41:00.0000] <roc>
although, what's this background-position-x/-y?

[02:42:00.0000] <roc>
"However, in order to ease the transition, the non-prefixed versions of properties that existed in Internet Explorer 7, though considered deprecated, will continue to function in Internet Explorer 8."

[02:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: right, so perhaps the overflow stuff go the same route

[02:43:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm going to comment that prefixing overflow-x/y is silly

[02:43:01.0000] <annevk>
(though in a friendly way)

[02:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
adding a prefixed version doesn't seem that harmful

[02:43:03.0000] <roc>
it's not harmless, just pointless

[02:43:04.0000] <roc>
er, not harmful

[02:43:05.0000] <roc>
hum, still no support for 'opacity'

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: people call it constraint checking too. but we have had confusion around the term "validation" in the past.

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the spec does allow you to do whatever you like after you report the first error, iirc, so you could have your parser do non-compliant fixup in order to give more useful error messages

[02:45:00.0000] <roc>
hmm, I shouldn't have said text-overflow was "interoperably implemented" ... it's just "implemented" :-)

[02:46:00.0000] <annevk>
roc, Opera actually has text-overflow prefixed

[02:46:01.0000] <annevk>
though we are considering removing the prefix

[02:46:02.0000] <roc>
ok

[02:47:00.0000] <roc>
but still, once one major browser has polluted the Web with a non-prefixed property, there doesn't seem much point in holding out

[02:47:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, don't really recall why we kept it prefixed

[03:05:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: will willValidate be renamed?

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
unlikely

[03:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
i might call it "constrain validation"

[03:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, IE8 adds __defineGetter__ (and Setter and lookup)

[03:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so does that mean from IE8 onwards, the top 4 engines all support prototypes for DOM nodes and defining getters and setters for them?

[03:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or am I missing something?

[03:29:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I think you're right

[03:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Now we just have to wait a decade or two for IE6 and IE7 to fade away

[03:30:01.0000] <annevk>
or for other browsers to get more market share

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder what the upgrade rate from IE6 to IE7 is when people install XP (instead of Vista) today

[03:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
IE6 will start getting reaped by the end of computer retention times

[03:37:00.0000] <annevk>
/me hopes they'll become obsolete due to other browsers

[03:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I hope so, too, but realistically, if someone hasn't upgraded from IE6 by now, chances aren't that they won't until they buy a new computer

[03:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone here got livejournal accounts btw?

[03:40:01.0000] <annevk>
nope

[03:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it publicly visible stats mean anything, it seems that most of the IE6 block are running it on XP as opposed to Windows 2000

[03:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/it publicly/if publicly/

[03:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and Vista will probably never surpass XP in market share

[03:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(that is, the next version of Windows probably comes before Vista goes ahead of XP)

[03:47:00.0000] <aaronlev_>
i created a mailing list for people working on free tools/resources to advance WAI-ARIA

[03:47:01.0000] <aaronlev_>
http://groups.google.com/group/free-aria

[03:47:02.0000] <aaronlev_>
i probably should have included HTML a11y in the scope but, i guess this will be a focused group

[03:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Only about 2-3% of all people seem to be using Windows 2000, so that can't account for much of IE6's usage

[03:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Are those the numbers you were going on, or do you have OS-browser-combination stats?)

[03:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, that depends if the versions of XP people are installing still only come with IE6. Since they would have been shipping with Sevice Pack 3 since April or May, and IE7 has been out longer than that, they could be shipping with IE7 by default

[03:50:01.0000] <annevk>
I read this article yesterday that Google kept Google Chrome security update specifics secret but http://groups.google.com/group/chromium-announce/browse_thread/thread/886cd07cbbc1b4cf seems to simply list them

[03:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
does Google Analytics have a public display of aggregate browser stats?

[03:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: my understanding is that there have been XP discs with IE6 on the market long after IE7 came out

[03:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: does MS remaster XP install discs at all?

[03:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
They make new discs to roll in Service Packs, as far as I'm aware

[03:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yes

[03:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[03:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
I have an XP SP2 disc at home that I use

[03:53:02.0000] <annevk>
but even SP3 does not come with IE7

[03:53:03.0000] <annevk>
per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP#Service_Pack_3 anyways

[03:53:04.0000] <Lachy>
no, but IE7 has started being distributed as a critical update, and the service pack should have meant new discs were produced

[03:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
SP3 does not update IE to 7

[03:57:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, see above

[03:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would notice if XP started automatically upgrading to IE7, since his mum would complain that it looked all funny

[03:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: you don't take care of your parents running an up-to-date browser?

[03:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yes, I'm aware of that. But AIUI, I believe they include all critical updates at the same time as they release new service pack discs

[03:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it has, but it still requires the user to manually perform the installation, which can be cancelled.

[04:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
last time I installed XP in my virtual machine, I let it do all critical updates and came back and noticed the IE7 installation dialog waiting for me

[04:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It's an up-to-date copy of IE6 :-p

[04:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and my dad has now switched to Firefox)

[04:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't see that the benefits outweigh the switching costs, if all you do is look at Hotmail and online banking

[04:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: think about the externalities of online banking with IE6

[04:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
banks see IE6 in their logs and continue to support it

[04:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
A single person will be lost in the noise and won't make any real difference to their logs

[04:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
IE6 should be easy to support if the banking websites weren't huge JS monstosities that claim to work only in Internet Explorer and Netscape and that sometimes hobble along in Opera too, so it's their own fault :-)

[04:06:00.0000] <annevk>
my bank works fine in Opera

[04:06:01.0000] <annevk>
it's just looks a bit fugly now I have standards mode override in effect

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk>
still perfectly usable though

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. sudo easy_install simplejson complains about not finding eggs

[04:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ah. I used the wrong copy of easy_install

[04:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I just saw the SDCH thing. In the PDF, I read "For example, retrieving a set of HTML pages with the same header, footer, inlined JavaScript and CSS requires the retransmission of the same data multiple times."

[04:39:01.0000] <BenMillard>
but often the header will differ slightly, since the current section will be highlighted (such as via class) or de-linked (by removing <a href>) or both

[04:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
and inline CSS is rather an edge case, given how well supported and cachable external CSS is

[04:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You don't have to make the whole header be one word, though?

[04:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Dashiva, the point is there's less which can be shared between requests on well-designed sites than the document seems to think.

[04:47:00.0000] <BenMillard>
simply writing better, lightweight markup would make Google result listings significantly more efficient without all this complexity

[05:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
How does a dictionary file get created? For it to be automated, a system would need to know every permutation of markup it can produce in the areas targeted for inclusion in a dictionary, such as the header, afaict.

[05:04:01.0000] <BenMillard>
if has to be done manually, I don't see it catching on

[05:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's easy - you just tell your team of PhDs to work it out for you

[05:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or, I guess, you use a tool written by Google, which scans your logs and looks at the most commonly requested files and works out how to optimise for that

[05:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is far too tired

[05:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, just writing better markup seems like a better idea to me...especially given how much scope there is for improving the markup of mainstream websites. :)

[05:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they could solve the problem of retransmission of inline CSS and JS by not making it inline

[05:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
launching a new compression scheme in order to deal with inline CSS and JS indeed seems weird

[05:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the footer stays the same until you visit a page linked to by the footer, then you delink that entry

[05:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
Presumably the theory is that CPU cycles are cheap compared to both bandwidth and authoring time

[05:32:02.0000] <BenMillard>
navigation changes all the time as you highlight the current section, delinking an entry when you're at the index for that section

[05:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
search box stays the same

[05:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
however, a new compression scheme will like be more deployable than a new HTML client side include mechanism

[05:33:02.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, my impression is few people even use the compression schemes which exist today, despite them being effective.

[05:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
having briefly done a manual review of several websites I've developed professionally in recent times, it's surprising how little markup is shared between pages

[05:35:01.0000] <BenMillard>
the decorative graphics + CSS + JS massively outweigh the markup in terms of filesize, and they're already cached by conventional means

[05:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: few people perhaps, but significant traffic generators do

[05:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: like wikipedia

[05:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, looks like myspace.com and google.com use gzip, too

[05:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, if it were commonplace and commonly inadequate, I could see space for a new technology to improve it.

[05:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>

oh, ignore me then.

[05:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: telling the DOM to coalesce adjacent text nodes may have an effect on passing the tree to XSLT in Gecko

[05:48:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, it also seems to assume people's markup cannot be improved...yet here's a typical example of markup currently authored on the web: http://groups.google.com/group/free-aria

[05:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is this thread on your radar: http://www.w3.org/mid/OFE3B13C49.D2CF8357-ONC12574BE.00686AE6-C12574BE.00692ED8⊙uic

[06:02:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/canvas/007.html and http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/canvas/008.html need to be updated

[06:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what tighter Web integration for Ubuntu Jaunty desktop means

[06:06:01.0000] <Dashiva>
They install it on google appengine, and you run an x server that connects there

[06:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
shouldn't the X protocol be implemented on top of Web Socket and <canvas> for that to be Web integration?

[07:16:00.0000] <annevk>
'There SHOULD be a @version attribute on the html element with the value "XHTML+RDFa 1.0"'

[07:16:01.0000] <annevk>
can anyone enlighten me how that helps?

[07:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, what spec is that from?

[07:20:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/#docconf

[07:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, in in the "in head" insertion mode http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#parsing-main-inhead when a meta element is inserted, the spec states:

[07:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
"Otherwise, if the element has a content attribute, and applying the algorithm for extracting an encoding from a Content-Type to its value returns a supported encoding encoding, and the confidence is currently tentative, then change the encoding to the encoding encoding."

[07:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
That doesn't seem to check for http-equiv="Content-Type". Is that intentional?

[07:21:03.0000] <annevk>
yes

[07:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, so <meta content="text/html;charset=UTF-8"> is enough?

[07:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
or even if it had http-equiv="Whatever"

[07:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[07:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[07:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me remembers some past discussion of this

[07:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: Validator.nu whines though

[07:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.w3.org/mid/47CEDDF5.6090100⊙cau

[07:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, ok. I was just wondering cause I need to write TCs for this part of the spec today, and trying to work out all the conditions that can trigger a reparse

[07:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
(See comment about content-style-type)

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, not really "discussion", just a comment, but anyway it's a known (mis)feature

[07:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i thought version='' was supposed to be the same as the FPI

[07:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
euc-jp reminds me

[07:37:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i think URLs aren't utf-8 if the page encoding is euc-jp

[07:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me checks if there are replies to zcorpan's comments

[07:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
no replies

[07:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: which comments?

[07:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: the comments about the XHTML2 WG draft that used EUC-JP in examples that people will copy and paste

[07:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ah

[07:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: what you mention of euc-jp related to something else?

[07:43:02.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.w3.org/mid/47CEDDF5.6090100⊙cau

[07:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ah

[08:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Validator.nu_Full-Stack_Tests

[08:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: thanks

[08:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: also, http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Validator.nu_Unit_Tests

[08:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: hmm i like omitting tags in test cases :P

[08:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: it caused me grief when annevk omitted tags in the WF2 test suite...

[08:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ok

[08:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
albeit in XHTML5

[08:40:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: should tests be XHTML-compatible?

[08:40:03.0000] <zcorpan>
or why did it cause grief?

[08:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh he omitted tags in XHTML?

[08:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
HTML5 tests don't need to be XHTML compatible

[08:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: he omitted, IIRC, <head> and </head> in XHTML, so the cases that should have had no errors related to WF2 had this other error

[08:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ok

[08:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: but can i omit optional tags in text/html?

[08:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: if you are certain that Hixie won't change the omissibility of those tags in random ways, yeah

[08:42:03.0000] <annevk>
fwiw, I did that when I still believed having different requirements for HTML and XHTML was ok

[08:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i take it that the test harness won't complain if i leave out "message"

[08:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: it won't

[08:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oops

[08:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I take that back

[08:47:03.0000] <hsivonen>
It will probably throw

[08:47:04.0000] <hsivonen>
but I can change that

[08:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. looks like it'll just say None in place of the message

[08:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so omitting the message works

[08:49:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[08:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: Writing a Test Eliciting No Errors is assuming that Validator.nu doesn't have a bug related to what is being tested :)

[08:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
right :-)

[08:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i'll try writing a test tonight

[08:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: great. thanks

[08:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder when gandi.net is going to start taking customers without invitations...

[09:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
For virtual hosting?

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how you're meant to work out whether particular hosting services are any good or not

[09:05:01.0000] <webben>
annevk: it only helps if you have different behaviors defined for the same elements/attributes in the same namespaces, which I guess is the risk XHTML2 is potentially taking. So: protection misunderstanding by theoretical future XHTML2 UAs?

[09:05:02.0000] <webben>
(re version)

[09:06:00.0000] <webben>
*protection from misunderstanding

[09:06:01.0000] <webben>
perhaps

[09:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
(At least Gandi doesn't have a blue-on-white website with stock photos of smiling people like pretty much every other internet service company, so that's a good sign)

[09:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
webben: If it was necessary to prevent documents being processed incorrectly, shouldn't it be a MUST rather than a SHOULD?

[09:07:01.0000] <webben>
Philip`: hmm, very good point!

[09:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: yes, for more flexible virtual hosting than what I have now

[09:09:00.0000] <annevk>
webben, without processing model and MUST requirement that's kind of moot

[09:10:00.0000] <annevk>
webben, hence my question

[09:10:01.0000] <webben>
yep

[09:11:00.0000] <annevk>
but that group is known for failing on proper specs

[09:12:00.0000] <webben>
i wonder if they're just following http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#ext-version

[09:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Sounds like it might not be strict invitation-only, if I interpret http://www.gandibar.net/post/2008/09/02/Hosting-maintenance#comments saying "you can always request some shares now and we try to accommodate people where possible" as meaning they can make exceptions if you ask nicely

[11:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finds bug in RFC3987

[11:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Note that the XML/HTML DOM consistency issue is not real, so it's worth focusing on the prefix issue."

[11:10:01.0000] <annevk>
I wasn't sure what he meant by that

[11:11:00.0000] <annevk>
One explanation suggests browser vendors are delusional, which I think is not true (but then I'm biased)

[11:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think Ben wrote that with the intent of somebody replying to ask what he meant by it

[11:26:00.0000] <annevk>
/me isn't really interested in asking :)

[11:27:00.0000] <annevk>
/me has seen too much RDFa e-mails lately all duplicating lots of info

[11:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess statements like "You want monolithic, top-down, one solution-fits-all. I want the Web." don't make me inclined to be interested in asking for more details either

[11:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The irony in RDF being "The Web" is overwhelming

[13:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wish I could tell Google never to return results from www.faqs.org when I search for RFCs, because they have a giant font and are impossible to read and I'd much prefer the IETF's copies

[13:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: you need to link to tools.ietf.org more

[13:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's a horribly indirect inefficient way to get the desired result

[13:16:00.0000] <annevk>
-site:faqs.org

[13:16:01.0000] <annevk>
or site:tools.ietf.org

[13:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's far too much typing on every query

[13:17:01.0000] <annevk>
you can make a shortcut for it in Opera

[13:17:02.0000] <smedero>
inject it with your user-scripting plugin (greasemonkey, etc) of choice

[13:18:00.0000] <smedero>
or, yes that's probably easier

[13:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't like using shortcuts, it feels like cheating :-(

[13:18:02.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, fail

[13:20:00.0000] <annevk>
something like http://www.google.com/search?q=rfc%s+site:tools.ietf.org&btnI=on as bookmark shortcut should work

[13:20:01.0000] <annevk>
/me makes one now as it seems useful

[13:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I need to learn to type

[13:23:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, thanks for the idea

[13:24:00.0000] <annevk>
"rfc 3987" now takes me to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987

[13:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Try http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001AZ7Q10/

[13:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: :P

[13:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
'"Mavis Beacon" is not a real person' - Wikipedia's destroying my world-view again :-(

[13:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Next they'll claim Hixie is just the alias of two dozen Google engineers

[13:52:00.0000] <annevk>
http://thebjoernhoehrmannproject.org/

[13:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: That would make sense - they could all pool their 20% time together, and arrange it to look like a single real person

[14:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: IT is.

[14:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*It

[14:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: How else does it barely sleep?

[14:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Adrenaline IV

[14:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A BLOODY USERNAME?

[14:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
sorry.

[14:14:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But ARGH.

[14:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder if we'll ever stop calling people 'users'

[14:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Only two businesses, etc

[14:16:00.0000] <annevk>
that's why Hixie always talks about "we" and "us"

[14:16:01.0000] <annevk>
makes sense now

[14:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I would never use "gmsneddon1" as a username.

[14:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Putting numbers in usernames is an abomination

[14:25:00.0000] <hober>
I only put the 0 in hober0 because gmail had a 6-char minimum username length requirement.

oh right i forgot today was new ipod day

[14:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me goes to see if the video is available yet

[14:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me just buys CDs

[14:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that thread was not on my radar but i don't know what i would have done differently if it was

[14:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: for audio i just buy unencrypted audio

[14:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
but there's no way to buy unencrypted video

[14:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
the new iPod nanos look cool

[14:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm waiting for the keynote though, it says it's coming soon

[14:54:00.0000] <sicking>
Lachy, got a good link to read about the new ipods?

[14:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.apple.com/itunes/

[14:54:02.0000] <sicking>
:)

[14:54:03.0000] <Lachy>

[14:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
brb

[14:55:01.0000] <sicking>
wow, perdy colors

[14:56:00.0000] <sicking>
wow, i guess accelerometers must be cheap these days

[15:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't look like today's annoncements were all that

[15:03:00.0000] <annevk>
nothing interesting

[15:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder why the quicktime plugin doesn't work in my safari

[15:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
works fine in mozilla

[15:05:02.0000] <sicking>
the new nano looks pretty sweet, but no, nothing revolutionary

[15:11:00.0000] <sicking>
still new iphone nano with a roll-out digital-paper screen :(

[15:11:01.0000] <sicking>
s/new/no/

[15:13:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, so i think we might need to bring back the header blacklist in AC :(

[15:13:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk, and blacklist 'cookie' and 'authorization'

[15:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
how can ou set cookie and authorization cross-site? that seems bad

[15:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
surely that's not possible

[15:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
can you set host?

[15:20:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, xhr.setRequestHeader("cookie", "hello world")

[15:20:01.0000] <sicking>
currently no spec forbids that if the site opts in

[15:20:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Geez, Ben is already appealing to process

[15:20:03.0000] <annevk>
sicking, XHR forbids that

[15:20:04.0000] <sicking>
annevk, really?

[15:20:05.0000] <Hixie>
i highly doubt that anne intentionally made that possible

[15:21:00.0000] <annevk>
sicking, well, it should

[15:21:01.0000] <annevk>
and does

[15:21:02.0000] <annevk>
see http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest/#setrequestheader

[15:21:03.0000] <sicking>
annevk, doesn't currently. Are you proposing that for same-site as well?

[15:21:04.0000] <sicking>
oh

[15:22:00.0000] <sicking>
when was that list updated?

[15:22:01.0000] <annevk>
long time ago

[15:22:02.0000] <annevk>
seems XHR2 has some <dfn> problem for setRequestHeader :/

[15:23:00.0000] <annevk>
though I did add Access-Control-Request-Headers/Method a few days ago

[15:23:01.0000] <sicking>
hrm

[15:23:02.0000] <annevk>
(in XHR2)

[15:23:03.0000] <sicking>
we recently updated our blacklist, but apparently didn't get those

[15:23:04.0000] <annevk>
sicking, same-site too, yes

[15:23:05.0000] <sicking>
wonder why

[15:23:06.0000] <annevk>
sicking, there was some discussion around this with abarth and collinjackson

[15:24:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, ah, adam did the updating of our list

[15:24:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk, what was the argument against?

[15:25:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, and is there currently agreement?

[15:27:00.0000] <annevk>
I don't think there was an argument against, although I believe IE either only blocks Cookie or just Cookie2

[15:27:01.0000] <annevk>
(for same site)

[15:27:02.0000] <sicking>
so what was the discussion about?

[15:27:03.0000] <annevk>
there's no real agreement on any of the specifics of XHR as browsers seem reluctant to fix bugs :/

[15:27:04.0000] <sicking>
/me wonders why adam didn't add the full list in his patch

[15:28:00.0000] <annevk>
sicking, well, abarth and collinjackson proposing to block it and me agreeing and nobody else complaining :)

[15:28:01.0000] <sicking>
ah :)

[15:28:02.0000] <sicking>
bummer, i guess we'll have to patch the branch again :(

[15:29:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, i don't think there has been reluctance, just uncertainty how stable the spec is

[15:29:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk, at least from us

[15:29:02.0000] <annevk>
fair enough, it does change now and then based on feedback

[15:29:03.0000] <annevk>
quite a lot based on feedback from ap (WebKit) a year ago or so

[15:29:04.0000] <sicking>
annevk, yup, makes sense, but we need to get it to last call and then to candidate

[15:30:00.0000] <sicking>
also, has there been any plan devised to get MS on board?

[15:31:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, same plan as for <canvas>? get devs to cry for it

[15:33:00.0000] <sicking>
ideal would be if we could find a faster way

[15:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't sure that really counts as a plan

[15:34:00.0000] <annevk>
Acid4? *blink*

[15:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
?

[15:35:01.0000] <annevk>
getting IE to support XHR2

[15:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[15:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well i'd rather they supported DOM2 Core before we started talking about new features

[15:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
and DOM2 Events

[15:35:05.0000] <sicking>
XHR1 rather

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
and HTML4

[15:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
and XML

[15:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
you know

[15:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
stuff from the late 90s

[15:36:04.0000] <annevk>
boring

[15:36:05.0000] <annevk>
:p

[15:37:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, btw, did you see my two feature requests for XHR2?

Applying for uni is annoying

[15:37:03.0000] <annevk>
sicking, I asked about use cases

[15:38:00.0000] <sicking>
as far as MS goes, i'd rather find a better way than drag them against their will

[15:38:01.0000] <jcranmer>
gsnedders: tell me about it... yuck

/me reiterates his opinion on browsers supporting WF2

[15:39:00.0000] <jcranmer>
s/on browsers supporting/that browsers should support/

[15:39:01.0000] <sicking>
hmm.. why didn't i get that mail

[15:39:02.0000] <annevk>
JSON is sort of scary as although it is a standard I believe there are quite a few differences between implementations... Also, it doesn't handle that many types...

[15:40:00.0000] <sicking>
hmm.. i blame gmail

[15:40:01.0000] <annevk>
(eg, allowing comments versus not allowing comments)

[15:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
JSON is a very loose "standard"

[15:40:03.0000] <sicking>
i don't have that mail at all

[15:40:04.0000] <annevk>
:/

[15:40:05.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk: There's the full spectrum from RFC-JSON to whatever-js-eval-supports-ON

[15:40:06.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if Gmail classifies my e-mail as spam sometimes

[15:41:00.0000] <sicking>
i have a bunch of other mails from that day

[15:41:01.0000] <sicking>
doesn't look like it's in the spam folder either

[15:41:02.0000] <annevk>
weird

[15:43:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, can you resend to me personally so i can reply?

[15:44:00.0000] <annevk>
done

[15:46:00.0000] <sicking>
hmm.. now i see it

[15:46:01.0000] <sicking>
dunno if it's your newly sent one

[15:46:02.0000] <sicking>
and i got the test mail

[15:47:00.0000] <annevk>
that was a mistake

[15:47:01.0000] <sicking>
heh

[15:53:00.0000] <annevk>
sicking, long ago timeout came up as well and people proposed send(data, timeout) as syntax

[15:55:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, I don't really care I guess, but it seems like .timeout makes a little more sense since the timeout isn't really related to the send() call any more than the open() call

[15:55:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk, sent reply

[15:55:02.0000] <annevk>
hmm, sync

[15:55:03.0000] <annevk>
don't use sync!

[15:55:04.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if workers have timeouts

[15:56:00.0000] <smedero>
I think Dashiva and I already had the "JSON implementations are crazy" discussion with DanC... see: http://deron.meranda.us/python/comparing_json_modules/

[15:58:00.0000] <annevk>
smedero, interesting

[15:59:00.0000] <smedero>
I know support is just as mixed with PHP...

[15:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: any idea what the story is with reqium and itunes "8"?

[15:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
requiem

[15:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
as in, when it'll be fixed?

[16:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
btw xhr should really be updated to integrate with the event queue stuff

[16:00:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk, indeed, found another mail from you that got into spam

[16:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
that would e.g. define whether timers fire during the sync wait

[16:00:03.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, no. But I can email the developer and see if he'll tell me

[16:01:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I guess it should

[16:01:01.0000] <annevk>
(and timers should not fire during sync)

[16:01:02.0000] <sicking>
bah, wish i didn't have to use gmails spam filter :(

[16:02:00.0000] <sicking>
ironport had much lower false-positive and false-negative rates

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: that's easy to define then, in fact it's the default, so you just need to say "Note: No tasks from the _task queue_ are processed during this method" or something

[16:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
btw for workers right now we don't have a good api set, so we don't have sync database apis or timeouts on any of the apis, btu that will likely change eventually

[16:03:00.0000] <sicking>
annevk, timers would be relatively easy to block during sync. Not sure if we could block UI events in gecko though

[16:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
you can kind of fake it today by spawning a second worker and killing it on a timeout

[16:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
"ui events"?

[16:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
you mean like onclick in the page aea?

[16:03:04.0000] <sicking>
mouseover

[16:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
or in the chrome?

[16:03:06.0000] <sicking>
well, chrome isn't web, so i don't care what spec says

[16:04:00.0000] <sicking>
i mean page area

[16:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
right the spec won't say anything about the chrome area

[16:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
the page area events is basically defined as a bunch of event queues, right now each one can be pumped independently

[16:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
so xhr _could_ define that some task queues are pumped and some aren't

[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
though right now no spec defines that 'mouseover' et al are ever actually fired

[16:05:01.0000] <sicking>
most events don't come from an event queue though

[16:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess that's either dom events or cssom

[16:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: ?

[16:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: per html5, all non-synchronous event dispatch goes through the task queue.

[16:06:00.0000] <sicking>
or rather, they originate there, but by the time they are mouse events we're not on the event queue any more

[16:06:01.0000] <sicking>
implementation wise

[16:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what you mean

[16:06:03.0000] <sicking>
i'm not saying it's impossible to stall/block/whatever, it's software, anything is possible, but it might be very hard with our impl

[16:07:00.0000] <sicking>
there's also the question of what to do with other tabs

[16:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh right because you're not pumping your ui thread at all while running script

[16:07:02.0000] <sicking>
do you still fire events on those

[16:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
so you get a lot of the blocking for free

[16:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
i keep forgetting that

[16:07:05.0000] <sicking>
yup

[16:07:06.0000] <sicking>
no process separation a'la chrome

[16:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
well chrome has the same thing actually

[16:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was thinking more opera

[16:08:02.0000] <sicking>
ah, yes

[16:08:03.0000] <sicking>
and then there is the issue of separate tabs in the same domain getting UI events

[16:09:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess I should look at the task queue tomorrow or maybe later this week

[16:10:00.0000] <annevk>
I still need to prepare my presentation for Thursday

[16:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: yeah well i still need to define exactly how it works but fundamentally pages on the same domain that can talk to each other share an event loop, so that's not a problem (if the loop is paused, it's paused for all the tabs that could talk to each other synchronously)

[16:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[16:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[16:11:00.0000] <sicking>
not a problem in the sense that all other pages from the same domain lock up?

[16:11:01.0000] <sicking>
seems suboptimal

[16:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's really no other way to do it given that they both have access to the same dom, unless you want to make your dom thread-safe

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
and even that wouldn't be web compatible


2008-09-10
[17:24:00.0000] <roc>
annevk: so currently the CSSOM spec doesn't have a way to get the size of the viewport excluding any scrollbars it may be showing

[17:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yt?

[17:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
hey

[17:48:02.0000] <Lachy>
http://html5.lachy.id.au/beta/ now has some functionality

[17:48:03.0000] <Lachy>
I disabled all the button cause they don't do anything yet

[17:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
but the basic live dom viewing feature works

[17:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
can you swap the dom tree and preview windows?

[17:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
the dom tree window is too small to see anything

[17:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
and almost always is bigger than the preview

[17:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's easy to do

[17:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
done

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
neat

[17:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll add the clipboard function now, that won't take long

[18:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej, roc: i spoke to the people who are experimenting with sdch, asked them about numbers, and they said they're experimenting with that right now trying to find good ways to compress data and so forth, trying to see how it works with proxies, caches, etc, and should have more concrete numbers in the coming months

[18:01:01.0000] <roc>
ta

[18:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: ok; hard to evaluate the value of pursuing the technology as a standard without some data

[18:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll give it some review once there is more data available

[18:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[18:07:00.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: you rang?

[18:09:00.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, hey so we have a quick question

[18:09:01.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, does gears let you create workers from inside a worker?

[18:09:02.0000] <aboodman>
yes

[18:09:03.0000] <sicking>
ben wants to know why

[18:10:00.0000] <sicking>
ben is the guy implementing our workers

[18:10:01.0000] <aboodman>
ben who?

[18:10:02.0000] <aboodman>
ok

[18:10:03.0000] <sicking>
he is not happy about this idea :)

[18:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
what's difficult about it?

[18:10:05.0000] <sicking>
and that hooks up the the whole error chain thing?

[18:10:06.0000] <aboodman>
to be honest, it isn't something i'm passionate about

[18:10:07.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, nothing's difficult really

[18:10:08.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[18:11:00.0000] <aboodman>
i think that it is just something that made sense to generalize

[18:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, the clipboard feature works now, though it has a known bug with not updating the DOM tree after using Retrieve

[18:11:02.0000] <sicking>
i think bens concern is basically that it allows a page to create very complicated things. I.e. trees of workers

[18:11:03.0000] <sicking>
me, i love it :)

[18:11:04.0000] <aboodman>
i think that a tree is not the right way to think about it

[18:11:05.0000] <sicking>
it lets me calculate fibanacci in crazy complicated ways :)

[18:12:00.0000] <aboodman>
i can't remember what the current state is in the proposed spec

[18:12:01.0000] <aboodman>
but at one time, workers had this elegant property that they weren't really trees

[18:12:02.0000] <sicking>
ah, right, you had these ids

[18:12:03.0000] <sicking>
so you could really communicate with anyone else

[18:13:00.0000] <aboodman>
right, not ids, but names

[18:13:01.0000] <sicking>
not just the workers that you created

[18:13:02.0000] <aboodman>
and you could even pass a port pointing to one worker to another, and make it stay alive longer

[18:13:03.0000] <sicking>
oh, the docs said 'id'

[18:13:04.0000] <aboodman>
i'm talking about hixie's original draft, not gears

[18:13:05.0000] <sicking>
you mean in current spec, or in gears

[18:13:06.0000] <sicking>
ah

[18:13:07.0000] <Hixie>
the spec still has that

[18:13:08.0000] <sicking>
i meant gears

[18:13:09.0000] <Hixie>
in that you can create a MessageChannel

[18:13:10.0000] <Hixie>
and hand the ends to two workers

[18:14:00.0000] <sicking>
right

[18:14:01.0000] <sicking>
so about this error thingy

[18:14:02.0000] <aboodman>
you're asking about onerror?

[18:14:03.0000] <sicking>
well, now i am :)

[18:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
right now onerror in the spec doesn't propagate more than one level out

[18:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
and in fact right now it doesn't even forward exceptions

[18:14:06.0000] <sicking>
initially i think i was just curious if gears (not spec) allowed workers to create workers

[18:15:00.0000] <aboodman>
yes

[18:15:01.0000] <aboodman>
and in gears, workers are arranged in trees

[18:15:02.0000] <aboodman>
and exceptions propagate up

[18:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
(though i think it would make sense to fire error events for exceptions, and make the default action of that event be to propagate to the higher level)

[18:15:04.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, yeah, i agree

[18:16:00.0000] <sicking>
the case for workers within workers that i've been thinking of is if you parse a word document which references external documents

[18:16:01.0000] <sicking>
you could start up a worker to parse the external (or embedded) resource

[18:16:02.0000] <sicking>
in which case you'd want to know if that worker fails somehow

[18:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[18:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've filed a bug to make me add that

[18:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
you can always implement it in the meantime using exception handlers of course

[18:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, an author can

[18:19:00.0000] <sicking>
right

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks at the w3c's debates on membership fees

[18:21:01.0000] <sicking>
so there is one thing that is sort of unfortunate

[18:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we should charge membership fees for whatwg

[18:21:03.0000] <sicking>
with the way exception handlers would work

[18:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
i need a new mac mini for my living room

[18:22:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, excellent idea. And the money can go towards the people implementing the specs :)

[18:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
if we follow the w3c model, it's the people implementing the specs who pay :-)

[18:22:02.0000] <sicking>
ugh

[18:23:00.0000] <sicking>
so these error events are sort of like exceptions, right

[18:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
sort of

[18:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
we could even clone the actual exception and put it as a member of the event object

[18:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
event.exception

[18:23:04.0000] <sicking>
you can catch them by having a handler, otherwise it bubbles up to be handled by someone higher up

[18:23:05.0000] <sicking>
and ultimately, if unhandled everywhere, gets logged

[18:23:06.0000] <Hixie>
not technically bubbling, but yeah, effectively

[18:23:07.0000] <Hixie>
right

[18:24:00.0000] <sicking>
so one difference is that for exceptions, if you have a catch block, just having the catch prevents the error from propagating

[18:24:01.0000] <aboodman>
Hixie: is this only for non-shared workers?

[18:24:02.0000] <aboodman>
because i don't understand what "higher level" means for shared workers

[18:24:03.0000] <aboodman>
as they currently exist in the spec

[18:24:04.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, agreed

[18:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
aboodman: yes, SharedWorker objects don't have an onerror

[18:25:01.0000] <sicking>
but with error handlers, you would have to explicitly prevent "bubbling" by calling event.preventDefault()

[18:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: right

[18:25:03.0000] <sicking>
even if you have a handler

[18:25:04.0000] <sicking>
this seems unfortunate

[18:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: yes

[18:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno that we can do anything about it though

[18:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
how does <body onerror=""> work?

[18:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's not an event

[18:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
does it not need to be canceled?

[18:27:00.0000] <sicking>
hmm.. i'm not really sure when that fires, it might even fire after the logging has taken place

[18:27:01.0000] <sicking>
(which would otherwise be the default action)

[18:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
apparently returning true prevents the default action

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
so if you use worker.onerror, you'd just need to return true (or false or whatever) to prevent the default

[18:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
as opposed to calling preventDefault()

[18:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
like with any event handler

[18:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
in fact

[18:28:04.0000] <sicking>
true

[18:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
you only need preventDefault() when you use addEventListener()

[18:28:06.0000] <sicking>
/me proxies to ben

[18:28:07.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[18:28:08.0000] <Hixie>
get ben to come online :-)

[18:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
brb moving building

[18:29:01.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: are you guys implementing both shared and non-shared workers?

[18:29:02.0000] <aboodman>
also are you planning to implement messagechannels

[18:29:03.0000] <aboodman>
(as in new MessageChannel())

[18:33:00.0000] <sicking>
probably no shared and no channels for now :(

[18:33:01.0000] <sicking>
due to time constraints

[18:33:02.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, ^

[18:34:00.0000] <aboodman>
k

[18:34:01.0000] <sicking>
and possibly no localStore

[18:34:02.0000] <sicking>
but xhr is mostly working

[18:34:03.0000] <sicking>
should work fine with cross-site xhr even

[19:18:00.0000] <billyjack>
does anybody have appcache test cases online?

[01:20:00.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: in the house?

alternative solution: give people money.

[03:06:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure that works long term

[03:06:01.0000] <annevk>
btw, Firefox <video> impl fails a bit on http://people.opera.com/howcome/2007/video/wikipedia/macaw.html (pressing stop, play, etc.)

[03:06:02.0000] <annevk>
though it works good enough for a demo

[03:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
is working long term a requirement?

[03:07:01.0000] <annevk>
(it also doesn't determine the size correctly until the video starts playing)

[03:07:02.0000] <annevk>
I think so

[03:07:03.0000] <zcorpan>
dang

[03:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Presumably the RDF equivalent would be allowing everyone to mint their own currency

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I think there are bad historical precedents with that approach

[03:19:01.0000] <annevk>
and DNS is like gold?

[03:19:02.0000] <annevk>
(like gold used to be, that is)

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: but if you use URIs only for identification without resolving them, DNS becomes like gold now :-)

[03:20:01.0000] <annevk>
haha

[03:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
was there much RDF talk

[03:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
?

[03:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it was just a brief bit of process talk

[03:22:00.0000] <annevk>
well, a week ago or so there was

[03:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[03:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
i thought people were saying they were reading abotu rdfa today

[03:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i was

[03:23:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me is catching up on email

[03:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me updates the rdfa wiki page to indicate the problems more obviously

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
are developers supposed to build federated facebook-like apps with FOAF?

[03:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how much overlap there is between Lips folks and RDF folks

[03:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lisp

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lisp and RDF both have very simple core concepts

[03:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and both aren't mainstream

[03:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
both are harder to grok than mainstream stuff

[03:59:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and the mainstream stuff keep reinventing things that Lisp and RDF had years ago

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
foaf has near zero uptake so far

[04:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
xfn has quite a lot, though that's somewhat biased by wordpress

[04:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
(foaf's only notable user is livejournal, as i understand it, which also does xfn)

[04:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: does livejournal consume FOAF?

[04:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
OTOH, Lisp is very much about minimalist syntax

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whereas RDF's first attempt at syntax wasn't minimalist at all and RDF tries to pretend it isn't about syntax

[04:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think lj consumes foaf no

[04:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
what kind of software consumes FOAF?

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
google's social stuff consumes foaf

[04:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and lisp has short identifiers

[04:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
like cons

[04:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
(for now, anyway)

[04:03:04.0000] <hsivonen>
instead of http://ai.mit.edu/lisp/namespace/cons

[04:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if we should fire onsubmit before or after validating the form

[04:03:06.0000] <Hixie>
i guess after makes sense

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
if onsubmit does something like disable the submit button

[04:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what does Opera do?

[04:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
wf2 says after

[04:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know what opera does

[04:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I like how, in the Generic_Metadata_Mechanisms wiki page, one of the requirements is "Inlinability", yet the proposal with the most pro's (using an external resource) doesn't meet that requirement :-)

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
the proposals were supposed to be "and"ed, i believe

[04:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[04:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
then a con for the whole lot is that it is overly complex to have them all

[04:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
quite possibly

[04:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really care what the proposals are

[04:08:04.0000] <Lachy>
and redundant to have "Inline (as multiple attributes)" and "Inline (in a single attribute)"

[04:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's the actual problem and the resulting requirements that matter

[04:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to edit

[04:09:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but they haven't filled out the problem yet

[04:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
i know

[04:09:04.0000] <Lachy>
I would if I knew what the problem was

[04:09:05.0000] <annevk>
the primary RDF advocates haven't touched that page

[04:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
so it seems

[04:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wish they would

[04:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
the 'submit' event bubbles? wow

[04:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
who'da thought

[04:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nn

[05:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
should jslint be considered a legitimate general JS validator or a manifestation of Douglas Crockfords personal opinions?

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Problem at line 59 character 25: 'installHandlers' was used before it was defined.

[05:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
are forward references a real problem in JS?

[05:20:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, not for functions

[05:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
only variables have to be declared before you can use them

[05:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
So Doug Crockford doesn't like semicolon omission

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does semicolon omission now suck officially, or is it just one person's opinion?

[05:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
semi-colon omission is considered bad practice

[05:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
:-(

[05:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
(although, that's just my opinion too)

[05:22:04.0000] <hsivonen>
and I made an effort to try to be pythonic and avoid the silly semicolons

[05:22:05.0000] <Lachy>
javascript is not pything

[05:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'd say in a real script, I would include the semicolons

[05:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
python*

[05:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Crockford did have some good reasons for using semicolons though

[05:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
there's real pitfalls to skipping them

[05:23:04.0000] <hdh>
fwiw js2-mode also flag semicollon omission

[05:23:05.0000] <othermaciej>
but for a one-liner event listener they are ok

[05:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
what are the conditions under which semi colons are allowed to be omitted?

[05:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
onclick="callSomething(event)"

[05:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
can Aptana or something insert semicolons for me?

[05:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
if there's a line break you can generally omit the semicolon unless it might look like the next line could continue the statement

[05:24:04.0000] <othermaciej>
so ++ and -- are dangerous

[05:24:05.0000] <hsivonen>
/me uninstalled Aptana because it seemed to leak memory

[05:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
since they can be either prefix or postfix operators

[05:26:00.0000] <annevk>
/me also writes pythonic JavaScript

[05:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess it's less controversial if I implement links to the CSS Validator and leave JSLint out for now

[05:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
when I write python, I tend to write it more like JavaScript :-)

[05:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
hey, with CSS3 Media Queries, the spec has this BNF: media_query: [[only | not]? <media_type> [ and <expression> ]*] | <expression> [ and <expression> ]*

[05:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm wondering what the OR (|) operator applies to. Is it equivalent to: media_query: [[only | not]? <media_type> ([ and <expression> ]*]) | (<expression> [ and <expression> ]*)

[05:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
Or ...

[05:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
media_query: ([[only | not]? <media_type> [ and <expression> ]*]) | (<expression> [ and <expression> ]*)

[05:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: or has looser binding than sequence in BNF

[05:33:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm, the first of your equivalents is malformed

[05:33:02.0000] <Lachy>
if it's the latter, I think that would make this legal: media="(min-width: 100px) and (min-height: 100px)"

[05:33:03.0000] <annevk>
that is legal

[05:33:04.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, probably not. I was only using the paretheses to mark the sections that the OR was applying to

[05:34:00.0000] <annevk>
well, you did it wrong then :)

[05:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in other words, you can either start with a media type (optionally prefixed by only or not)

[05:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or you can start with an expression

[05:34:03.0000] <annevk>
even if it was not malformed, it would not be less ambiguous

[05:34:04.0000] <othermaciej>
any number of and <expression> can follow in either case

[05:34:05.0000] <othermaciej>
that is what the BNF sys anyway

[05:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I didn't realise that before. I thought all expressions had to start with a media type

[05:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure if that was intentional but that appears to be the effect

[05:35:02.0000] <annevk>
as editor of said spec, i can say it's intentional

[05:35:03.0000] <Lachy>
there are no examples in the spec that don't start with a media type

[05:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, you're not listed as an editor in the /TR/ copy. When did you take it over?

[05:37:00.0000] <annevk>
later

[05:37:01.0000] <annevk>
you should really read http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-mediaqueries/

[05:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I didn't realise it had a public editors draft

[05:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me thinks specs at TR/ should point to the editor's draft

[05:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
editor's drafts are pretty hard to find

[05:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there ever a good reason to read TR/ instead of dev.w3.org?

[05:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, not if the spec is a draft and there is a copy of it on dev.w3.org. But if it's a REC, then reading the TR is reasonable

[05:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: well, you wouldn't want to read CSS2 instead of CSS 2.1 ED or HTML 4.01 instead of HTML5 ED

[05:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
but for all the CSS specs, all my bookmarks point to the TR drafts and I'm too lazy to look up the dev.w3.org versions and change them

[05:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
it depends on the reason. Sometimes it's useful to look up how some things were defined in HTML4, especially for web developers who are still only writing HTML4 in practice

[05:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
although, I tend to use both. HTML4 tells me what's valid, HTML5 tells me what it means and how browsers will handle it.

[05:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone have an opinion on whether the usability of http://html5.validator.nu/ would go up or down if the text area and file upload selections had two submit buttons: Validate as HTML and Validate as XML?

[05:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me wants to read HTML 4.01 instead of HTML5 ED, because it's much easier to read and understand

[05:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
(at least when I'm just trying to write HTML pages)

[05:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it would be much easier to remove HTML 4.01 from Validator.nu if HTML5 allowed the most popular Transitionalisms

[05:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Just make it validate as both and report both results - it's quicker for the computer to do that than for the human to choose which button to click :-)

[05:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Am I just being stupid by having a name attribute on the submit button on Validator.nu and going through all the trouble of disabling and enabling it?

[05:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
(P.S. That would be a bad idea)

[05:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: Hixie has suggested something like that

[05:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
It would just confuse users if the validator said their document was both valid (HTML) and invalid (XHTML)

[05:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, 2 buttons seem reasonable

[05:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. I've forgotten to implement ruby in the HTML5 schema

[05:51:03.0000] <Lachy>
although, perhaps it will be a problem for authors who think they're writing XHTML, but still serve it as text/html

[05:51:04.0000] <hsivonen>
and no one has pointed it out to me

[05:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(unless I've missed the logs or something)

[05:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you have have two buttons, be sure to record stats on how many people use each one, and if almost nobody uses XHTML then you might as well remove it from the default UI

[05:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
having 2 buttons poses the problem of which one which browser will pick as the default

[05:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also you should use onmouseover to record stats of how many times people wave their mouse indecisively between the two buttons, to get some idea of how much time it wastes

[05:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and whether I should put HTML on the right (Mac) or on the left (Windows)

[05:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
Use UA sniffing to decide

[05:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or put one below the other

[05:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or have a <select> to choose HTML/XHTML, since few people will use XHTML and so the extra clicks are not significant

[05:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone happen to know if getResourceAsStream stuff in jars is subject to Java package/class naming restrictions?

[06:01:00.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: put the html button on the left, people usually say "html and xhtml", not "xhtml and html", and most people read from left to right, so have html first, then xhtml. Kinda makes sense to me anyway :)

[06:01:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: just support HTML and let people use the generic interface for XHTML :)

[06:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: for LTR text, putting the default on the right (as on Mac) actually makes sense, since that's where the eye is going

[06:03:01.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: OK. But maybe it's best just to have the radio buttons instead

[06:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I want to add SVG 1.1 support to the HTML5 facet, though.

[06:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like the validator behavior isn't graceful if a blank file upload field is submitted

[06:07:01.0000] <annevk>
can't you just have two small links at the bottom: "Also from Validator.nu: XHTML Validator & Advanced Validator"

[06:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yes, I intend to do that RSN

[06:08:01.0000] <annevk>
define:RSN

[06:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Real Soon Now

[06:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: why? most people don't use svg

[06:09:01.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: you wouldn't need an "HTML/XHTML" option for file upload right? Doesn't V.nu just decide between HTML and XHTML based on the file extension?

[06:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: SVG is a real Web technology supported by 2 or more of the top 4 engines, and detecting it on root ns is easy for the URI validation case

[06:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: yes but for textarea

[06:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: perhaps if the first token is "svg" you switch to xml mode :)

[06:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(first start tag token)

[06:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
What you need is doctypes

[06:11:03.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: good point. It already looks at the filename extension.

[06:11:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I forgot :-)

[06:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Inline metadata is far more reliable than external metadata that's bound to get separated from the data and will force the user to re-enter it multiple times whenever they try to process the data

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Validator.nu now doesn't disable the submit button on submit

[06:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
better? worse?

[06:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: better because you can submit several times when it's too slow :)

[06:17:00.0000] <annevk>
and because when you hit back it might not be undone

[06:18:00.0000] <annevk>
and because then you can quickly fix a typo and hit submit again, etc.

[06:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I still disable the other fields that I want to omit from the dataset

[06:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
because it would be confusing if those weren't fixed on back button but there was no visual feedback about it

[06:27:00.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: Although, that brings up another problem that I've been wondering about lately. What if some one is editing a XHTML5 document that they don't want validated as XHTML5, but want validated as HTML5 because they are going to serialize it to text/html before sending over the wire. So I wonder if V.nu needs to cater for someone who says: Validate my XHTML5 document in HTML5 (text/html)...

[06:27:01.0000] <deane>
...compatible mode please, if you know what I mean.   

[06:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: V.nu should support that via the complex interface

[06:27:03.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: I don't want that case complicating the simple interface

[06:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: check the lax type box and select the parser manually

[06:29:00.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: cool, I just wondered if it had that feature, that's all

[06:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I started adding use cases for accessibility to the wiki http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Video_accessibility#Selection_Mechanisms

[06:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. http://code.google.com/p/concentre-xforms/ 

[07:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so... when XForms JS libraries start using colon in names in text/html, does it mean does colon-based NS processing in the browser level in text/html is even less of an option than it used to be?

[07:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, it was already not an option at all.  If it's possible to be less of an option than that, then yes

[07:15:00.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: does Opera 9.6 have querySelectorAll?

[07:15:01.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: does Opera 9.6 have querySelectorAll?

[07:15:02.0000] <JohnResig>
oops

[07:17:00.0000] <JohnResig>
hmm, doesn't seem to in the release notes, at least: http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/960b1/

[07:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
no video it seems...

[07:18:00.0000] <JohnResig>
it seems like a bug fix release

[07:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me sees Added Core version (currently "Presto/2.1.1") to the User Agent header

[07:18:02.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, I cannot comment on future product releases

[07:18:03.0000] <JohnResig>
Lachy: it's not really future - I was just wondering about the beta release

[07:18:04.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I didn't know the beta was released

[07:18:05.0000] <Lachy>
that's a desktop thing, which I don't work with

[07:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: what do you work with?

[07:19:01.0000] <virtuelv>
JohnResig: 9.60 does not support querySelectorAll, no

[07:19:02.0000] <JohnResig>
virtuelv: k

[07:19:03.0000] <Lachy>
I work in QA Core, using gogi

[07:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
like the Acid 3 build we released a while back. it's basically just the core of the browser with a minimal UI

[07:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I didin't realize QA Core didn't see the desktop UI

[07:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(even though I knew about gogi)

[07:21:01.0000] <virtuelv>
JohnResig: however, fwiw, the acid 3 build Lachy is talking about does support querySelectorAll 

[07:21:02.0000] <JohnResig>
virtuelv: that's the one that I tested on, which is why I was wondering

[07:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I use the desktop build on when I need to on Mac, since gogi is only build for windows and linux. But I generally try to avoid using it

[07:29:00.0000] <virtuelv>
JohnResig: useful read: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/presto-2-1-web-standards-supported-by/

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
The text-shadow example on that page would be more impressive if it didn't make Opera (9.5) slow down to ~5fps while it's scrolling into view

[08:10:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: heh

[08:10:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I have an animated example with text-shadow lying around that easily manages a lot more

[08:12:00.0000] <virtuelv>
does anyone know if we've release anything to the public on w.o.c. with Rune's animation lib?

[08:13:00.0000] <virtuelv>
err, wrong channel, obviously

[08:13:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(I just need to sort out rights for some code before publishing the example)

[08:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
I added more use cases to http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Video_accessibility#Selection_Mechanisms

[08:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, can you think of any that I've missed?

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, is that the quality of use cases you need?

[09:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: http://virtuelvis.com/gallery/text-shadow/

[09:09:01.0000] <virtuelv>
is that just as slow for you?

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: That seems much faster, though it still looks a bit jerky

[09:14:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hm, that has acceptable performance here, and doesn't tickle the CPU enough to upstep from 800MHz to 1.4GHz

[09:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm. should </x><!doctype html> trigger standards mode?

[09:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
no quirks mode

[09:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: Doesn't use much CPU here either, but it's not fading smoothly - it seems to kind of get very briefly stuck occasionally, so it looks like it's going in steps rather than a single continuous transition

[09:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, the page works in Safari now

[09:24:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: yeah, seems opera's parsing of arrays is a little on the lenient side, so I never caught the error

[09:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
file a bug about that array parsing then, I don't think we should be lenient

[09:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
Firefox and Safari both throw the same error, so I don't see a reason for us to ignore it

[09:29:00.0000] <hallvors>
what array parsing issue is it? I think it's known.

[09:33:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hallvors: [ "foo" "bar"] produces an array with length 2

[09:34:00.0000] <Lachy>

aboodman, in the house now :)

[10:29:00.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, you pung

[10:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
is that the past tense of "smell"? :)

[10:31:00.0000] <aboodman>
sicking - yeah, wanted to talk about worker stuff, but i will write up coherent thoughts.

[10:31:01.0000] <sicking>
Lachy, virtuelv: That gives me a parse error in FF3

[10:32:00.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, cool

[10:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
sicking, yes, we know. It's a bug in Opera that makes it not throw a parse error

[10:46:00.0000] <sicking>
Lachy, ah, ok

[10:57:00.0000] <gavin>

[12:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting accessibility hack: <img src="http://images.apple.com/main/elements/spacer.gif" border="0" height="5" width="20" alt="Voiceover users click here to listen to keynote address.">

[12:42:00.0000] <webben>
alts in spacers is old school.

[13:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-public/message/1778 — that is lovely.

[14:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
how do I make VoiceOver work with Firefox? All I can make it do is make it tell me that the close button is selected

[14:09:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: VO doesn't work with Fx.

[14:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[14:09:02.0000] <webben>
Lachy: Mozilla haven't implemented the Apple Accessibility API for Gecko.

[14:10:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: best current option for speech on Firefox Mac is Fire Vox.

[14:10:01.0000] <webben>
Lachy: see also aaronlev 's article: http://accessgarage.wordpress.com/2008/08/21/firefox-and-os-xs-voiceover-reading-the-magic-8-ball/

[14:11:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: oh, or WebAnywhere.

[14:11:01.0000] <aaronlev>
we have only very basic support

[14:12:00.0000] <aaronlev>
needs work

[14:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
webben, I just wanted to try using voiceover to get to that audio only copy of the apple keynote that hsivonen mentioned

[14:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
I can't get it to navigate the page using safari either. It's really not intuitive for me

[14:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, If I copy the link  manually from the source, I get 404

[14:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems that the stevenote video track is text/html

[14:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I had problem with getting non-Apple software to show it

[14:20:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: which URL is the link on?

[14:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/0809dt4bs89/event/index.html

[14:20:02.0000] <webben>
ta

[14:21:00.0000] <webben>
I see the img hack is in a link.

[14:21:01.0000] <webben>
nasty

[14:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't get why they don't make that audio more easily available to everyone

[14:22:00.0000] <webben>
agreed

[14:23:00.0000] <webben>
Yeah, the link 404s for me.

[14:24:00.0000] <webben>
Also, in Safari, when I tab to the link it reads the href not the alt.

[14:25:00.0000] <smedero>
webben: that happens when using VoiceOver on OS X? are you using Safari on Windows.. or?

[14:26:00.0000] <webben>
VoiceOver, Safari, Leopard.

[14:26:01.0000] <webben>
s/tab to/focus on/

[14:27:00.0000] <webben>
If I had to guess, maybe WebKit/VO is specifically excluding pixel gifs from consideration as content.

[14:29:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: reads correctly in Opera :) 

[14:30:00.0000] <webben>
also works in latest WebKit

[14:35:00.0000] <smedero>
webben: hrm, yeah with respect to the latest WebKit - the Safari 4 developer preview reads the @alt text as well.

[15:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, this is cool http://www.youtube.com/blog?entry=mi8D3ntPgFQ

[15:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
this is a video with subtitles http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XraeBDMm2PM

[15:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
Their UI won't scale to 120 languages...

[15:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Er, maybe I should have started with "cool!"

[15:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think anyone will provide subtitles in 120 languages for one video

[15:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
Ironic the BBC don't capion in English

[15:46:03.0000] <Lachy>
I think they just meant that there are 120 langauges to choose from

[15:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
Right, so they should design a system that will work for 120 languages :)

[15:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
this one has english captions http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ullmDNjb_ec

[15:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
(Yes I realise that would be really hard)

[15:47:03.0000] <jgraham>
(and almost certianly not worth the effort)

[15:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is a script executed when added to the DOM using createElement() and appendElement()?

[15:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I think the answer is yes but I don't know if/where it is defined

[15:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
it isn't, as far as I can see

[15:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
When a script element that is marked as neither having "already executed" nor being "parser-inserted" is inserted into a document, the user agent must run the script element. 

[16:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#script

[16:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
So all you need is to verify that DOM calls neither set the "parser inserted" nor "already executed" flags

[16:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, ok

[16:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, have you got those photos yet?

[16:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Oh, let me nag Ross to see if I can use his photo

[16:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: You have a camera, right? You could have a picture on the tubes within minutes

[16:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Temp. dye.

[16:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I no longer have green hair

[16:06:02.0000] <jgraham>
lame

[16:06:03.0000] <Lachy>
oh, what?! That wasn't the deal!

[16:06:04.0000] <jgraham>
;)

[16:06:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: You didn't specify :)

[16:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
I was expecting you to turn up at TPAC with it

[16:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: OK, maybe I'll let someone perm. dye it there

[16:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I have next to no money, so maybe I'll have to get someone else to buy the dye

[16:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, my hair will certainly need bleaching to get it to work at all

[16:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Give me a bit and I'll email you a photo

[16:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
flickr or it didn't happen :)

[16:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: When I put up the rest of my photos, sure

[16:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Till then, be patient :)

[16:19:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Don't forget to add descriptions

[16:19:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Should upload them this week, though

[16:19:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: I don't know who half the photos are of!

[16:19:06.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm terrible with names!

[16:19:07.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't label them!

[16:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Surely it isn't much harder to upload 1 photo to flickr than to email it

[16:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I want all my photos going up at once!  :P

[16:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to go to sleep

[16:20:03.0000] <jgraham>
?!?

[16:20:04.0000] <jgraham>
(the sleep bit I got)

[16:20:05.0000] <Dashiva>
If he doesn't upload them all at once, the alt defense fails ;)

[16:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Exactly :P

[16:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
I almost never upload more than one photo at a time so I have a different alt defence

[16:21:02.0000] <jgraham>
:)

[16:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, there are so many nice search strings for my site

[16:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
"what causes girls feelings to change"

[16:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
As long as you don't get the ones involving donkeys and neon bathtubs, it's all good

[16:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I could quote the bible on donkeys penises…

[16:29:00.0000] <smedero>
the what on the who?

[16:29:01.0000] <smedero>
gotta love search query data

[16:29:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Just remember that once you've posted it, you can't unpost it

[16:29:03.0000] <gsnedders>
"There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses." — Ezekiel 23:20

[16:31:00.0000] <smedero>
is this why you've been writing a habari fortune plug-in?

[16:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I have?

[16:32:02.0000] <smedero>

[16:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: Oh, that's just random quotes of me

[16:33:00.0000] <smedero>
oh good, so no donkeys then?

[16:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
No, I'm not Ezekiel

[16:33:02.0000] <smedero>
most excellent

[16:33:03.0000] <gsnedders>
They're all totally out of context though

[16:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
There again, that's most of the fun

you can now click on <dfn> elements in html5

[20:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: click-on-<dfn> thing is great 

[20:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ted Nelson would be proud

[21:14:00.0000] <kangax>
what would be the best way to draw ellipse on canvas?

[21:28:00.0000] <roc>
kangax: transform a circle?

[21:28:01.0000] <kangax>
that's what i'm doing now

[21:29:00.0000] <GregHouston>
kangax: if the ellipse is the only thing you are drawing then you could just draw a circle with arc and scale it in one direction. Otherwise you might want to go with a couple bezierCurveTo()s or plot it point by point with a parametric equation.

[21:29:01.0000] <kangax>
would it be possible to make one with 2 bezier?

[21:29:02.0000] <kangax>
GregHouston: right. now i just want to find out which one would be faster

[21:33:00.0000] <GregHouston>
kagnax: faster for you or the browser. I couldn't say for the browser. The easiest way is going to be the scaled circle. At the bottom of this page is the parametric equation. You can use it like the spirograph example at developer.mozilla.org. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse

[21:38:00.0000] <kangax>
GregHouston: for the browser

[21:38:01.0000] <kangax>
I'll go with transformed circle, thanks

[21:39:00.0000] <kangax>
(building svg to canvas parser)

[21:39:01.0000] <GregHouston>
Nice. What language is it written in?

[21:41:00.0000] <kangax>
GregHouston: JS

[21:43:00.0000] <kangax>
It's mostly a general purpose library that makes it easy to draw basic shapes on canvas (with support for drag/drop and any affine transformations)

[21:44:00.0000] <GregHouston>
Do you have a blog? I would be interested in keeping tabs on it.  

[21:44:01.0000] <kangax>
I do, but it's not related to canvas : )

[21:45:00.0000] <kangax>
GregHouston: http://thinkweb2.com/projects/prototype/

[21:50:00.0000] <GregHouston>
kangax: Cool. I'll add you to my feeds and see if you don't post anything about it. I wrote a function for drawing a rectangle with rounded corners if you haven't got to that one yet. 

[21:50:01.0000] <kangax>
nice

[21:50:02.0000] <kangax>
haven't yet

[21:54:00.0000] <GregHouston>
kangax: I pasted it here: http://paste.mootools.net/f3be6b0e8

[21:55:00.0000] <kangax>
didn't know mootools have pastie

: )

[21:55:02.0000] <GregHouston>
:)

[01:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
you know, when we started html5, xforms and xhtml2 provided a kind of motivation to do a good job and do it quick

[01:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://crypto.stanford.edu/websec/chromium/ - ooh, an HTML5 page

[01:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
as competition is wont to do

[01:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
but our success has removed the credibility from those efforts

[01:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess Flash and Silverlight provide a little more motivation

[01:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or even Gears

[01:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
especially now that we have a competing browser with built-in Gears support

[01:13:00.0000] <takkaria>
Philip`: HTML5 with XHTML talismans, too :)

[01:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not worried about XHTML2 but I am worried about the open web platform vs. proprietary alternatives

[01:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and I am not even so afraid of that (not as much as roc anyway)

[01:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
ugh, another +1 post on public-html

[01:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem with flash and silverlight is that they're competitors to the overall platform, not to html5 specifically

[01:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: Are you not so afraid because you don't think it's so likely, or because you don't think it's so bad if a better (but proprietary) alternative wins?

[01:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me isn't worried as much as he was because of the former

[01:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: I don't think it's so likely

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It's sad that in this day and age, *anyone* can launch a new Flash-like thing

[01:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
i.e. Silverlight

[01:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I feel like Flash is close to peaking, and I doubt Silverlight will see much some success in the grand scheme of things

[01:18:04.0000] <hsivonen>
though I am hoping that Silverlight scares Adobe enough for them to open-source all parts of Flash that are licensable by Adobe

[01:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and I think Google is sensitive enough to criticism that native web platform features will mostly obsolete Gears (or reduce it to an IE uncripplement add-on)

[01:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, I'm wondering about the strategic smartness of the whole Novell Mono thing

[01:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
though things could be different if OpenJDK had arrived earlier

[01:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
now it's like Mono tries to rescue legacy Java code to run on it

[01:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
instead of OpenJDK rescuing legacy C# code 

[01:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
wait, what?

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: you can use ikvm.net to run Eclipse on Mono

[01:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it translates JVM bytecode to MSIL?

[01:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but as far as I'm aware, there isn't a viable project that allowed one to take a C# project on bring it over to the JVM

[01:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: either bytecode or Java source

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but to come to back to the Web relevance of Mono

[01:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems to me that Moonlight is helping Silverlight when it's done so early

[01:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it definitely is

[01:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's kind of its intention

[01:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Miguel has a weird love of Microsoft technologies

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
to be fair, C# and .Net are pretty solid technologies, from a purely technical perspective

[01:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean they're not perfect by any means

[01:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
but they compare pretty favourably compared to the rest of the industry's best efforts

[01:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think they're overly suitable for the web

[01:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i think their microsoft pedigree and lack of truly open development process are fatal flaws, though

[01:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it seems to me that giving control of the GNU platform direction to MS isn't a good idea

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i don't think mono is strategically sound

[01:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'd prefer to get the good stuff from C# bolted onto Java even if it meant some more warts

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not a big java fan myself, i'd rather have many different languages available

[01:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that's besides the point

[01:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the problem is that there are only two big multi-language server-side VMs

[01:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not expecting Parrot to rock the market

[01:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but on the client side, the approach GWT is taking is *very* interesting

[01:29:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd like to see that for more languages

[01:29:04.0000] <hsivonen>
particularly Python

[01:29:05.0000] <Hixie>
the mono effort could have been strategically sound -- and still could be, actually -- if they used a slightly different path

[01:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
if they can get enough critical mass of people moving in both directions (mono <-> .net) then they could start introducing "innovations"

[01:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It seems to me that the direction the client VM is going is better for concurrency than the direction the JVM went

[01:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
JS implementations (other than IE) are getting fast enough that compiling to JS might not be totally insane

[01:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. embrace-and-extend

[01:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, running normal-looking (not erlang) language with workers instead of shared-memory threads

[01:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
and that would end up forcing microsoft's hand a bit with silverlight

[01:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
which would make it harder for them to abuse the platform

[01:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
but as i understand it right now mono is just playing follow-the-leader with mono in the role of follower

[01:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[01:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: isn't that basically what v8 does?

[01:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: oh, you mean compiling _to_ js

[01:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/mean/said/

[01:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
i read just "compiling js"

[01:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder who the +1 posts are intended for

[01:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
every JS implementation "compiles" in some sense

[01:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
has Google announced anything about <video> in Chrome or Android WebKit?

[01:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I have not heard announcements but I believe <video> does not work in Chrome currently

[01:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it has the Safari 3.1 featureset in the engine minus (at least) @font-face, <video>, text-shadow and Database

[01:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah, but they must have a plan

[04:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Surprisingly many people use the script from http://cow.neondragon.net/stuff/reflection/ (or derivatives), which uses canvas (on non-IE), so that's quite a lot of indirect canvas users

[04:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Sadly it uses "if (document.all && !window.opera)" to trigger the use of 'filter: flipv progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(...)' instead of canvas)

[04:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
regarding the discussion the other day: it seems that Windows XP SP3 still doesn't install IE7 as an automatic update, but it does install it as an Express Update if you go to Windows Update and accept the defaults

[04:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is Silverlight still non-selected by default?

[04:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I don't see Silverlight being offered through Windows Update at all

[04:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Windows Update tells me to upgrade to Microsoft Update

[04:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but it's not at all clear why I, as a user, should have to make a decision between two update mechanisms

[04:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe you have to make that decision because it would be unfair for Microsoft to leverage its privileged OS-developer position to automatically provide additional services for its own non-OS products

[04:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I see

[04:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Or maybe that's totally wrong)

[04:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i'm on windows using cygwin

[04:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: are you using easy_install?

[04:48:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: no

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: in that case, I suggest trying it

[04:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
python ez_install.py

[04:52:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Fishished processing dependencies for setuptools==0.6c7

[04:52:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
but running validator-tester.py still says ImportError: No module named simplejson

[04:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ez_setup.py should install a script names easy_install

[04:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
then easy_install simplejson installs simplejson

[04:54:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
there's no easy_install :(

[04:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that's weird

[04:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
you can get a new one from here http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

[04:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(the site loads very slowly)

[04:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
thanks

[05:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
validator.nu goes offline for a moment. sorry

[05:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
back up

[05:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
easy_install.exe is in my Python24\Scripts directory but trying to use it doesn't work

[05:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
:-(

[05:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
just found out there will be a WebJam on while I'm in Aus. I should try to organise a 3 minute presentation for it.

[05:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm completely inexperienced when it comes to troubleshooting Windows Python problems

[05:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, it probably means that the directory isn't in the PATH environment variable

[05:11:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: i added it to PATH... do i need to restart cmd for it to start working?

[05:11:02.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[05:11:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
ah

[05:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
you could just type echo %PATH% and see if it was really in it

[05:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
aargh, I hate how Windows update sometimes installs critical updates and then does a restart without even asking. Especially, when I'm not around to stop it!

[05:13:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
it worked after i did echo %PATH% but not before

[05:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok simplejson is installed

[05:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, maybe I should get http://html5.lachy.id.au/beta/ finished and present that at WebJam, since it will have a lot of nice features for web developers

[05:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Set it to ask before installing updates, and then it won't do it silently

[05:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
(It'll still force you to reboot after the installation, though)

[05:16:03.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I'm sure I have

[05:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[05:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
ah, crap. That machine was still set to automatic :-(

[05:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
fixed now

[05:17:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
or i think it was installed... but validator-tester.py still says it's missing

[05:18:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: you can stop the automatic updates service to make it not reboot

[05:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: You could just copy simplejson's .py files into the right place, and not bother with the whole installation setup thing

[05:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It has a _speedups.so (or .dll or whatever) too but that appears to be optional)

[05:19:02.0000] <didymos>
Lachy, I experienced that same thing yesterday, and it was a bit annoying, because I was in the middle of a conversation, and couldn't take the time to disable it

[05:19:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: which .py files and where's the right place?

[05:19:04.0000] <didymos>
so I just had to click 'later' everytime it tried to restart

[05:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
didymos, I have the same experience. To me, the "later" button should mean "when I decide to do it myself".

[05:21:00.0000] <didymos>
BenMillard, certainly

[05:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: The really lazy way is to copy the 'simplejson' directory from http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/simplejson/simplejson-1.9.2.tar.gz into the directory you're running Python from, and I think then it should pick it up properly

[05:21:02.0000] <BenMillard>
rather than "bug me again about this in 5 minutes, then do it of your own accord if I'm not here when you ask, losing all my unsaved work for me".

[05:22:00.0000] <didymos>
unfortunately, it seems they have to go for the lowest common denominator, if they want it to be installed on non-techie users' machines

[05:22:01.0000] <BenMillard>
didymos, I doubt non-techies leave their machines running for many days in a row

[05:22:02.0000] <BenMillard>
didymos, so interpreting "later" as I describe would be fine on non-technie machines, since they don't run for that long at a time anywy.

[05:22:03.0000] <didymos>
good point, although I have a case to prove you wrong, but in theory I believe you'd be right ;)

[05:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Now that Vista's hidden the 'power off' button, I'd guess many people just suspend or hibernate it and never actually reboot

[05:23:01.0000] <didymos>
BenMillard, my mother has a laptop in the kitchen, which she leaves on so she can get to it fast -- it can easily run for weeks in a row

[05:23:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
wonder if Python24 is the right directory because i have python 2.5

[05:23:03.0000] <Philip`>
particularly on laptops where you just shut the lid and it'll happily suspend itself for days

[05:24:00.0000] <didymos>
exactly

[05:24:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
how do i figure out which directory my python is running from

[05:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: 'which python'

[05:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
(assuming Cygwin with suitable packages installed)

[05:25:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: /usr/bin/python

[05:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
ideally, computers should never need to reboot to apply a patch. They should just apply hot patches to everything

[05:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Is that a symlink to a python2.x file?

[05:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
(ls -l /usr/bin/python)

[05:26:03.0000] <didymos>
Lachy, Steve Yegge, I believe? :)

[05:27:00.0000] <didymos>
at least he said it at some point

[05:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: The problem with that is that it can get extremely complicated, particularly if you care about efficiency in the normal not-applying-patches state

[05:27:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
wait is it my cygwin/bin directory?

[05:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: It's probably cygwin/usr/bin

[05:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
(in the Windows view of the filesystem)

[05:28:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: ok

[05:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: it's empty but i'll try pasting the simplejson directory there

[05:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Oh, no

[05:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: I meant the directory which you are in when you run Python, not the directory which the Python you run is in

[05:29:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: ah

[05:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Ah, if cygwin/usr/bin is empty then I guess /usr/bin (which sounds non-empty) must be somewhere else, but I don't know where

[05:32:00.0000] <virtuelv>
is Cameron McCormack usually present on IRC?

[05:32:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok now i got a different error running validator-tester.py

[05:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: That sounds promising

[05:32:03.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, that's heycam

[05:34:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
in dumpReference simplejson.dump({uri:self.database[uri]}, handle, cls=ValidationErrorMessageEncoder, sort_keys=True)

[05:35:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: thanks

[05:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: What is the error message there?

[05:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: do you have an up-to-date svn checkout?

[05:38:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: KeyError: 'http://simon.html5.org/test/validator/character-encoding/non-ascii.html'

[05:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that line should now read simplejson.dump({uri:self.database[uri]}, handle, cls=ValidationErrorMessageEncoder, sort_keys=True, indent=2)

[05:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I think it throws a key error if you don't have the URI you gave it already in the database

[05:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the database being a file called db.json in the working directory by default

[05:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: aha

[05:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i should be using dumpuri

[05:49:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: but if i write a test, don't you need to add it to your database?

[05:53:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: so i can just point to a testcase in a bug report and when you have fixed the bug you do adduri and i don't have to get this working

[05:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: yes. so I'd need you to send me your db.json file (preferable containing tests only form you) so I can merge it in

[05:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: that would work, too

[05:54:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: ok. then i won't spend more time trying to get it working :)

[05:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
OK. sorry about not thinking about this before 

[05:55:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
that's ok

[05:57:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: your sniffer is still looking at 512 bytes right?

[05:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: yes

[05:57:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: you think it will continue to do so?

[05:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think it will continue to look for n bytes where n is likely to be 512 or 1024 depending on what Hixie puts in the spec

[05:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
512 is a good guess

[05:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
though IIRC, WebKit switched to 1024

[05:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me suggests 768

[05:58:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: jokingly or seriously?

[05:58:05.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I'm just trying to be awkward

[06:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
I presume "one packet" could be the most sensible thing for a browser to use, rather than a fixed number of bytes, in terms of being able to render the page as quickly as possible - maybe it'd be interesting to work out how many bytes of content do fit in the first packet...

[06:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: my sniffer works with blocking Java IO

[06:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: so I don't see packets

[06:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Implementations where the network layer pushes data to parser could be different

[06:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Your abstractions need more leaks

[06:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
although I suppose it's Java's abstractions in that case

[06:03:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
now ftp won't connect

[06:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I couldn't follow the Gecko source on this topic with full confidence, but I think it scans the first packet

[06:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: If I wrote a NIO driver and if NIO can be told to push data on a per packet basis, then it would be doable

[06:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: but SAX assumes IO--not NIO

[06:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the Validator.nu HTML Parser core assumes neither and, by design, fits a NIO/Gecko-like IO setup as well

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I implemented the <rp> spec literally without allowing space characters around the paren

[06:20:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: could you use a different favicon? my brain thinks that the html5 tools tab is the spec

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like the mean HTTP header size (from a very small sample from dmoz.org) is around 290 bytes (and the median is 260, and very few are above ~500)

[06:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
so you should get at least a kilobyte of content in the first packet

[06:38:02.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, ok

[06:38:03.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, any suggestions for what I should use?

[06:38:04.0000] <Philip`>
(Interestingly enough, Google seems to send 1418 byte TCP packets, whereas everyone else sends 1448 bytes)

[06:39:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: anything but the whatwg icon. no icon wfm :)

[06:39:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: don't you have one for you blog?

[06:39:02.0000] <Lachy>
no

[06:39:03.0000] <Lachy>
I need one though

[06:39:04.0000] <Lachy>
I'll remove it for now, and replace it later

[06:39:05.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[06:39:06.0000] <Philip`>
Use the Space Invaders favicon

[06:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oops, it was Defender

[06:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
done

[06:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll find an icon of some tools or something

[06:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
I need to figure out how to set up my localhost server to use custom .localhost domains (or whatever) so they can mirror my web server better

[06:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
some of the things are broken in my local copy because I have paths like http://localhost/html5.lachy.id.au/ and that page has non-relative paths like "/script/...", which break

[06:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could run each on a different port

[06:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, maybe. I'll have to figure out how to get MAMP to do that

[06:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and multiple servers, rather than one server with virtual hosts)

[06:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'd have have a domain like http://html5.lachy.id.au.local/ or something

[06:47:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, I use Apache with <virtualhost> in the httpd.conf to produce http://calthorpe.local/ and http://ben.local/ and so forth

[06:47:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Apache as part of the WAMP package, I mean.

[06:47:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I can probably set that up

[06:47:04.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, apache is in MAMP too

[06:48:00.0000] <BenMillard>
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>

[06:48:01.0000] <BenMillard>
 DocumentRoot "C:\Program Files\WAMP\www\ben"

[06:48:02.0000] <BenMillard>
 ServerName ben.local

[06:48:03.0000] <BenMillard>
</VirtualHost>

[06:48:04.0000] <BenMillard>
is one of them

[06:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, you have to edit the "hosts" file if your on Windows so the "ben.local" part works

[06:49:01.0000] <BenMillard>
e.g.: 127.0.0.1       ben.local

[06:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I knew about the hosts file

[06:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, ok I'll leave you to it. :)

[06:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
apparently MAMP Pro offers easy setup of virtual hosts like that

[06:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
Raw Apache httpd.conf offers easy setup like that :-)

[06:50:03.0000] <Lachy>
but it seems rather expensive. I'll see if I can set it up manually myself instead

[06:50:04.0000] <Philip`>
and is free

[06:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I'm not paying about $75 for something I can do myself for free

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
With that kind of attitude, why are you a Mac user? :-p

[07:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, because there are no decent alternatives

[07:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me briefly scans through http://www.w3.org/mid/2d509b1b0809101646y4bbda2f9k56474ee3cd72003d⊙mgc

[07:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes the TOC doesn't use HTML lists

[07:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess that counts as a failure of HTML/CSS to produce the wanted result reliably

[07:07:00.0000] <takkaria>
"To facilitate independent evolution of producers and consumers, languages in distributed systems should be Extensible."

[07:07:01.0000] <takkaria>
(from Dave Orchard's post)

[07:07:02.0000] <takkaria>
surely producers that produce something that consumers don't understand doesn't help anyone, so independent evolution isn't helpful in the slightest

[07:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, numbered lists with decimal places are faked in a variety of ways.

[07:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
Producers that produce something not all consumers understand still helps the consumers that do understand it

[07:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
though I suppose that's not "independent evolution", since at least some consumers would have to evolve to understand exactly what the producers produce

[07:10:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, maybe <li value> should just allow any string, like <li value="3.2"> or <li value="2a">? Or maybe <ol type> should have a couple more values to do this automatically...

[07:11:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: you could use <ul><li>3.2

[07:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, that's one of the ways I see it faked.

[07:12:01.0000] <BenMillard>
layout tables and &nbsp; with <br> are others

[07:12:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
<ul> seems better

[07:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
yes, but <ol> with the desired markers (by some method) seems best. :)

[07:13:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
why?

[07:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
firstly, <ol> is a closer match to the content than <ul> (unless we think <ol> is a pointless element)

[07:15:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
are markers searchable?

[07:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, wait...are you asking whether <ol> is at all useful?

[07:16:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: no i'm asking whether it's useful for TOCs

[07:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, since TOCs are just a numbered list of links, <ol> seems as useful for them as it is any other numbered list (whether it has links or not).

[07:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
cool, I got the virtual hosts to work. That was easy

[07:19:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
but for a TOC you want 1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, and not 1, 2, 1, 2

[07:19:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
and it's nice to be able to search for "2.1"

[07:19:03.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, I've seen TOCs with either

[07:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, I see no reason for browsers to make list markers non-searchable

[07:20:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: file a bug :)

[07:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, I don't search for section numbers in TOCs, so I don't mind either way.

[07:21:01.0000] <BenMillard>
but if you want it to work, I guess you should indeed file a bug.

[07:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
searching works for me since specs i care about use <ul> :)

[07:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, searching also works in the ones that fake it with &nbsp; or layout tables.

[07:24:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: yes but i imagine they are less usable with ATs

[07:25:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
but i could be wrong

[07:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, using <ul> for a numbered list produces bullets and numbers when author CSS is disabled or overridden by user CSS.

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://timepedia.org/chronoscope/ is an interesting use of GWT + <canvas>

[07:27:01.0000] <BenMillard>
and using the semantics of <ul> when a TOC is better matches by <ol> means any device which makes use of those semantics might be getting short-changed (such as what announcements you get in screenreaders or in a Braille output, maybe)

[07:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, something like <ol type="decimal-compound"> (or something along those lines) could avoid authors having to type in all the section names

[07:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
and it doesn't rely on CSS and does have the <ol> semantics which best fit a TOC

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
They'd still have to type the section numbers into the section <h2>s, though

[07:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
and if those are entered manually while the TOC is numbered automatically, they're more likely to get out of sync

[07:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
Section numbering is an outdated concept in a world of hyperlinks, anyway :-p

[07:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, for that to happen the TOC would have to differ from the sections in the document, so the TOC would be wrong anyway

[07:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Indeed, but the effects of an error could be localised, rather than cascading through the rest of the TOC and destroying all of the numbers

[07:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I agree that authors would still have to type into the headings and when making references within the document.

[07:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the error would only cascade to siblings that came after it and the descendents, AFAICT

[07:35:01.0000] <BenMillard>
and if the TOC isn't matching the document, making that error as obvious as possible actually seems like an asset to me :P

[07:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
s/better matches/better matched/

[07:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
This is HTML, not XHTML - errors are meant to be papered over, not made as obvious as possible :-p

[07:38:02.0000] <BenMillard>
s/all the section names/all the section numbers/

[07:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
time for lunch...

[08:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://html5.validator.nu/ now supports ruby

[08:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.city.kawasaki.jp%2F25%2F25zinken%2Fhome%2Fkidspage%2F seems to work, at least in the sense that it's only complaining about <rb>

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
It would be user-friendlier if the validator recognised <rb> and gave an informative message like "You're not allowed to use <rb> and have to go to loads of effort to remove it from all your pages, because it has no effect and we don't want to allow it like we allow xmlns and xml:lang and trailing slashes"

[08:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
otherwise people will have no idea why it's suddenly become an error

[08:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: or we could allow it as a talisman

[08:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: That too

[08:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http://www.geocities.co.jp/Hollywood-Spotlight/2135/ seems to fail at encoding sniffing

[08:15:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
ruby isn't used much though, is it? and <rb> even less

[08:15:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
(compared to xmlns and xml:lang)

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: and that page there gets error reports on line 0, which doesn't exist

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Also, the "show source" view has something totally bogus on line 45 that isn't in the real source

[08:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It says:      "http://www.geocities.co.jp/Hollywood-Spotlight/2135/2pigpigsan.jpg",     "tiiojpol      "http://www.geocities.co.jp/Hollywood-Spotlight/2135/2pigpigsan2.jpg",↩)

[08:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the validator doesn't run heuristic sniffing (parsetree does)

[08:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: should the validator run a heuristic sniffer, too?

[08:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
line 45 is certainly interesting

[08:20:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me ponders about "Error: The font element is obsolete." vs "Error: Element rb not allowed as child of element ruby in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)" in <RUBY><RB><FONT face="ＭＳ Ｐゴシック">区役所</F

[08:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: the implementations are different

[08:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
should I give <rb> the <font> treatment?

[08:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It would make the output more useful if it didn't let one error (lack of explicit encoding) cause the rest of the error report to become unreadable, since maybe people have a good reason for not fixing the first error (e.g. they're not the site author and can't fix it straight away) but they'll still want to know about subsequent errors

[08:21:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: seems reasonable if <rb> is used enough to care

[08:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
now I'm most immediately curious about line 45

[08:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008May/0620.html - 0.3% of the .jp pages use ruby, and I think most (or at least many) of those use <rb>

[08:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the unmappably byte sequence errors repeat themselves

[08:23:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i get       var args = 6 * div;↩ on line 45

[08:25:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: ok

[08:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: That's the right line but the wrong page

[08:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: It was http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.co.jp%2FHollywood-Spotlight%2F2135%2F&showsource=yes#l45 but now that looks correct to me

[08:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
there has to be something very wrong with the show source code

[08:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
something that depends on how buffer boundaries fall

[08:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh

[08:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
why can't show source ever just be easy

[08:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
It is easy: slurp the whole HTTP response into a string, then parse and validate and print it out again :-)

[08:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: can't slurp without the parser figuring out the encoding

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/string/byte buffer/

[08:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, the code I used for calculating the UTF-16-level line and col when a byte-level error occurs was utterly bogus now that the tokenizer has undergone notable changes

[08:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and that caused assertions to be violated in the show source package

[08:46:00.0000] <takkaria>
I do worry a bit about adding parse error reporting to Hubbub and how much that'll complicate things

[08:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: error reporting as such is not bad

[08:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: approximate error locations aren't bad

[08:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would typically prefer a fast parser that doesn't report errors, since he's usually parsing other people's junk and doesn't care as long as it works as quickly as possible

[08:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: error locations that are good enough for the kind of lighlighting that Validator.nu does are a major PITA

[08:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I've been toying with the idea of having a preprecessor for removing error reporting code and source location tracking code

[08:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Would that be better than having the error reporting code etc being in methods in a class which you can switch for a minimal stub implementation class, and then let the JVM inline all the stub methods and eliminate the dead code?

[08:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the location tracking code goes pretty intimately in the hottest method of the tokenizer

[08:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: also, I don't want too many Javaisms so that the code can be mechanically translated to C++ without having to use virtual methods

[08:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Could you write two implementations of that hottest method, one without the location tracking, and choose which one to use at runtime?

[08:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
...using virtual method calls

[08:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: It has crossed my mind but only recently

[08:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
In C++ you can just use templates - they solve all problems

[08:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"now you have two problems" :-)

[08:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
But now they're more fun problems

[09:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: but you are right, I could make the Tokenizer parametrized by a buffer management class using generics in Java and make the parametrization templatized in C++

[09:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Except for the problem that compile times become huge, which is never fun)

[09:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: but then, mechanical translation to C++ already needs to mung stuff, so...

[09:01:03.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, I hadn't thought of generics

[09:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: no point in using generics for this expect to make it use the <foo> syntax in both languages

[09:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
(probably because they're boring and don't let you do anything you couldn't do before - C++ templates are much more exciting)

[09:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aargh. I have to deal with CRLF again

[09:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
CRLF is such a pain

[09:13:00.0000] <jmb>
yes

[09:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: hmm. what are the intended html4-only errors? xmlns, xml:lang, />, </x in rcdata...

[09:17:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
unquoted attributes with special characters

[09:17:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
non-boolean empty attributes

[09:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: that seems about right, except there's an open bug (from you) about xmlns and />

[09:20:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: yeah i know, i'm writing tests for it :)

[09:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I started fixing that bug, but then this more immediate show source bug came up

[09:20:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: ok

[09:20:03.0000] <hsivonen>
(crazy show source stuff must be fixed while the Web remains constant, because even taking a local copy changes buffering)

[09:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Do you have a way of writing test cases that trigger buffer-handling bugs?)

[09:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I don't.

[09:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. now I have the bytes-to-UTF-16 line and col counting fixed

[09:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or so I think

[09:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but an assertion still fires in show source...

[09:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: hmm wouldn't it be good if the tests had a pass condition? "there should be no errors"

[09:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I don't understand the question

[09:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: wouldn't it be good if the test file said whether an error is expected or no errors are expected? e.g. <!doctype html><title></title><p>There should be no errors.

[09:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: yeah, that would be good

[09:35:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
added pass conditions

[12:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't get why a separate wiki page had to be created on the W3C wiki http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/MultimediaAccessibilty

[12:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
it just puts the info in 2 places instead of one, and the ESW wiki sucks

[12:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
looks like some people still don't understand what use cases are :-(

[12:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The use case is getting your pet feature into the spec :P

[13:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
Using the ESW wiki, how do you markup code samples?

[13:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, I hate the ESW wiki, when there are edit conflicts :-(

[13:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
in fact, I just hate the ESW wiki alogether

[13:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
*altogether

[14:09:00.0000] <smedero>
Lachy: ESW is a MoinMoin wiki I believe.

[14:09:01.0000] <smedero>
so I think you can do {{{inline code}}}

[14:09:02.0000] <smedero>
or `inline code`

[14:09:03.0000] <Lachy>
smedero, yeah, I found that out by looking at another page

[14:09:04.0000] <virtuelv>
I hate wiki syntax

[14:09:05.0000] <smedero>
um, blocks are 

[14:09:06.0000] <smedero>
oh ok

[14:09:07.0000] <smedero>
sorry

[14:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, me too. But atleast I'm relatively familiar with MediaWiki syntax

[14:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
and MediaWiki allows people to edit specific sections instead of the whole page, which reduces the chance of conflicts

[14:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
aargh! Laura Carlson just went and removed everything

[14:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wrote on the wiki

[14:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, well, that's the *last time* I use the ESW WIki. I'm off to add the real info the the WHATWG wiki

[14:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I should have realised this would happen. The same thing happened when I once tried to fix the so-called "Use Cases" on the LongdescRetention page a long time ago

[14:32:00.0000] <smedero>
"Reinstaing Lachlan's lost the use case"

[14:32:01.0000] <smedero>
is the last change...

[14:32:02.0000] <smedero>
but that's not quite what you intended...

[14:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, that's good. But it's still listing descriptions of disabilities as use cases

[14:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
and it doesn't include the authoring and end user requirements section. It just goes straight to the proposed solutions, which starts with a requirement, not a solution

I don't understand what he's trying to say

[15:07:01.0000] <roc>
what am I afraid of?

[15:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
commitment?

[15:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
roc, spiders?

[15:11:02.0000] <Lachy>
snakes?

[15:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
me?

[15:11:04.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know. Why are we playing this game?

[15:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: from my reading, a CURIE is wholly equivalent to a IRI

[15:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Where are you reading that?

[15:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
"The value space for CURIE is IRI."

[15:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's syntactically, not semantically

[15:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(and also the problem)

[15:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
he may have meant semantically, since a CURIE is just a shorter, less useful, IRI abstraction mechanism

[15:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, the problem remains. You can't tell them apart, which is why safe CURIEs were created.

[15:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know what a safe CURIE is

[15:17:02.0000] <gavin>
roc: <othermaciej> I'm not worried about XHTML2 but I am worried about the open web platform vs. proprietary alternatives

[15:17:03.0000] <gavin>
<othermaciej> and I am not even so afraid of that (not as much as roc anyway)

[15:17:04.0000] <roc>
yeah I found the IRC logs thanks

[15:17:05.0000] <Dashiva>
safe_curie  :=   '[' curie ']'

[15:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
"value space" is semantic, not syntactic - the lexical space is the syntax

Haha

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyone planning to point out on www-tag that html5 already allows uri-lookinh strings in rel?

[02:20:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh, pete is not using the alt attribute in his fronteers presentation

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk>
also, IE still has DOM storage extensions

[02:21:01.0000] <annevk>
also, they are suggesting to simply set <meta> to IE7 if you think it's too much effort

[02:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
did they at least prefix their extensions?

[02:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
of course not. they only prefix the extensions that they don't need to prefix.

[02:22:02.0000] <annevk>
the presentation was not clear

[02:23:00.0000] <annevk>
it was also not clear whether their implementation is still asynchronous

[02:23:01.0000] <annevk>
as it was in IE8 beta 1

[02:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: are rel tokens case-sensitive?

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: HTML5 and the LHC have different network effect considerations

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: it would be a fair comparison if there had been two LHCs built and the goal was to have them act exactly the same in every testable respect...

[02:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
colliders don't need to interoperate technically

[02:28:03.0000] <hsivonen>
(although we assume that laws of physics are consistent in CERN and in the North American collider)

[02:29:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, yeah

[02:29:01.0000] <annevk>
but it's still funny

[02:29:02.0000] <annevk>
and prolly reflects how most people think about it

[02:29:03.0000] <hsivonen>
the JS on http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/ is funny

[02:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it's case insensitive, but the spec doesn't appear to say that

[02:29:05.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, they probably should be, although HTML5 doesn't say so

[02:29:06.0000] <hsivonen>
thanks

[02:29:07.0000] <annevk>
e.g. rel=STYLESHEET

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: well luckily i don't really mind how people think about it :-)

[02:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
the 2022 date has actually worked pretty well to filter out the people who don't read

[02:30:02.0000] <annevk>
I rather have these people paying attention and use <canvas> then switch to Flash

[02:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
if people are considering flash, canvas isn't going to solve their needs

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
SVG-in-text/html with an IDE might, though

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
well for that they'll likely have to wait til 2022 too, the way things are going

[02:38:01.0000] <annevk2>
grr

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
i actually forgot about that feature yesterday, but it's not that interesting either yet

[02:40:00.0000] <doublec>
canvas works well for a lot of things that flash is probably used for (simple games, applets, ads, etc)

[02:41:00.0000] <doublec>
my js 8080 emulator uses canvas for the display and it runs good on firefox and webkit nightlies

[02:41:01.0000] <doublec>
just

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: are you suggesting that a vast Google/Apple conspiracy isn't resulting in Flash-killer GWT features within a couple of years?

[02:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm suggesting IE won't support SVG in a couple of years

[02:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the rumors of a Google/Apple conspiracy are gratly exaggerated

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk>
what is the %%%% business?

[03:22:00.0000] <annevk>
new feature?

[03:22:01.0000] <annevk>
(for data: POST)

[03:22:02.0000] <annevk>
lol: http://ishtml5readyyet.com/

[03:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: no, just porting wf2 over

[03:23:00.0000] <annevk>
oh ok

[03:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://ishtml5readyyet.com/ misses the point pretty spectacularily :-)

[03:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
by that definition, the Web isn't ready yet

http://bholley.wordpress.com/2008/09/12/so-many-colors/ - I'm much more comfortable when the world is just RGB 0-255 and you can fiddle with your monitor's gamma settings until it looks right - things are getting too complicated now :-(

http://micycle.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/why-ian-hickson-is-wrong-about-br-and-p-tags/

[04:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me presumes that person is also in favour of editors inserting <i> instead of <em> when users hit the 'italics' button

[04:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
so at least HTML5 goes most of the way towards what they want

[04:03:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
considering that wysiwygs insert <br>s for linebreaks and users type generally type two line breaks when they want a paragraph break, should html5 define two or more subsequent <br>s as meaning a paragraph break?

[04:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
Seems better for editors to translate two <br>s into <p>

[04:03:02.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, no. Two <br>s for a paragraph is a bad practice that should be discouraged

[04:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
i think i hate forms.

[04:03:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
but that's really hard when you have lists too and you're not working with html syntax

[04:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and you're implementation is regexp

[04:04:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: that wasn't my question though

[04:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/<br>\s*<br>/<p>/ - that wasn't hard :-p

[04:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess tomorrow i get to specify accept-charset

[04:04:04.0000] <Lachy>
inserting a <p> for Enter, and <br> for Shift+Enter is acceptable, and is what MS Word does by default

[04:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
(although MS Word also sets the default paragraph margins to 0, so the effect not very noticable by default(

[04:05:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: i guess it would work with the new rules where <ul><li>foo<p>bar</li> is allowed

[04:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, yeah, defining that <br><br> should be treated as a paragraph break is acceptable, but shouldn't be considered conforming

[04:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me remembers originally learning that <p> was a paragraph break (like how <br> is a line break), rather than a paragraph wrapper (like <div>)

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
that was originally true

[04:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think it was true when I was learning HTML, but maybe the books were just old rather than wrong

[04:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: do you think it's useful to replace two linebreaks with <p> in wysiwyg editors?

[04:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[04:08:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: why?

[04:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
because most of the time when people type 2 line breaks, they mean a new paragraph

[04:09:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: so if <br><br> is defined equivalent to <p>, why bother?

[04:09:02.0000] <Lachy>
and typographically, the spacing between 2 paragraphs separated by 2 <br> is too much

[04:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
Even HTML 2.0 says <p> is non-void

[04:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but draft-ietf-iiir-html-01 say it's void, or empty or whatever the term is)

[04:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, that's because HTML2 was made more compatible with the SGML approach.  It's the non-specced HTML1 that TBL originally created which used <p> like a break

[04:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, my earliest site just used <br> everywhere

[04:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think I didn't use <p> because I just didn't understand the point, when it was like <br> but wasted more screen space

[04:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, inferring paragraph semantics from <br><br> is something I've considered.

[04:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
as Lachy points out, Return, Return doesn't always produce <br> in editing tools throughout the desktop

[04:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
<p> elements allow better control of styling with CSS

[04:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I've worked with sites where the content had <br><br> and they wanted to redesign their content styles but found it hard because they weren't using <p>

[04:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
AFAIK, the larger screenreaders already infer that two line breaks = a paragraph

[04:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do they do anything to indicate the presence of single line breaks?

[04:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
personally, I find reading blogs on blogger generally quite difficult because they insist on using only, when the WYSIWYG editor is used. It's really quite irritating having too much spacing between paragraphs

[04:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
*only <br>

[04:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: at least the old Gecko behavior of inserting br for return and paragraph break for two return sucked really, really badly

[04:23:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I don't know. I've heard of them having a "next line" command but I don't know how that works.

[04:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, that actually sounds reasonable to me...what made it so bad?

[04:24:01.0000] <roc>
WYSIWYG editing of structured documents is Hard

[04:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: it was counter-intuitive, non-obvious, unreliable and incompatible with IE

[04:25:01.0000] <roc>
a basic problem is that when the user pressed a character key, the rendering must change. anything else is a bug

[04:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
If we want to have a format that has paragraphs on the format level, we need to rub this fact in the faces of users by making return break a paragraph *and* by having non-zero paragraph margins by default

[04:26:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, I know my dad uses a single return in e-mails when he starts a new paragraph.

[04:26:02.0000] <BenMillard>
my mum used to do the same thing but now she's been on internet forums for a while, she uses two line breaks everywhere.

[04:27:00.0000] <roc>
figuring out what the right or minimal thing to insert into the DOM to achieve an appropriate rendering change, in all possible situations, is really tough

[04:27:01.0000] <BenMillard>
having said that, an ex-girlfriend used to put song lyrics on her blog without <blockquote> and used single return between lines and 2 returns between versus...

[04:27:02.0000] <roc>
and even if you achieve it, it leads to unpredictable behaviour

[04:27:03.0000] <virtuelv>
/me really just wishes everyone could write Markdown instead

[04:28:00.0000] <virtuelv>
(In markdown, two trailing spaces+enter = <br> and enter = <p>

[04:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wishes everyone just wrote text/plain

[04:28:02.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: markdown is mostly text/plain

[04:28:03.0000] <Philip`>
Eww, trailing spaces?

[04:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tends to automatically delete trailing spaces whenever he sees them, because they're ugly

[04:29:01.0000] <doublec>
Hixie: in the audio portion of the spec, at the end of 4.7.8.0 it mentions "If the src argument is present..." but the example given calls it the argument 'url'

[04:29:02.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: yes, because the assumption is that even though you, for writing purposes, might wish to hard-wrap your plaintext file, you don't wish to get <br> in your transform to HTML

[04:29:03.0000] <BenMillard>
roc, I think you're right in saying it's a difficult problem. :)

[04:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, I think it's useful for WYSIWYG to produce <p> given the styling problems I've seen when websites redesigned...quite how it gets there is hard. and it's probably sensible to infer paragraph semantics from <br><br>

[06:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
show source fixed on http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.co.jp%2FHollywood-Spotlight%2F2135%2F&showsource=yes#cl3c41 thanks

[06:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(whew that one has hard to track down although trivial at the end)

[06:35:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: what was the problem?

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the first problem was that the byte level counted lines and columns according to SAX tradition

[06:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the second problem was that it started from the whole offset when there were more than one bad byte per buffer

[06:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the third problem was that I was trying to sync these using standard SAX line/col getters instead of specilized internal getters

[06:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I turned heuristic sniffing on in the validation facet

[06:55:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: what's heuristic sniffing?

[06:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: it tries to user jchardet and ICU4J heuristic sniffer to detect the character encoding statistically if there is no encoding decl on the HTTP layer on inside the first 512 bytes

[06:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do browers ever look at the domain name as an extra hint to their heuristics?

[06:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
never heard of them doing it

[07:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, the sniffer should reduce noise when validating badly authored CJK pages

[07:00:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: can it be sniffed to be something ascii-incompatible?

[07:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: no

[07:00:03.0000] <hsivonen>
all the previous problems with mislabeled UTF-16 remain

[07:01:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: ok. what happens if you find a real <meta> after the sniffer has decided on a particular encoding?

[07:01:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: or is that fatal anyway?

[07:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: if the later meta declares a different encoding, the result is still fatal

[07:02:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the sniffer only looks at the first 512 bytes?

[07:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
right

[07:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
surprisingly, that seems to be quite enough

[07:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: do you have a URL handy where the sniffer makes a difference?

[07:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.co.jp%2FHollywood-Spotlight%2F2135%2F&showsource=yes

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Error 65 ("Element font not allowed as child of element html in this context") says

[07:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
but clicking the location marker doesn't work

[07:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also I don't see a font element there)

[07:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: whoa! that's crazy

[07:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: thanks

[07:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
real-world fuzzing strikes again

[07:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
how can I get Google Groups to pick up my non-⊙gc From address from Gmail?

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not really fuzzing, it's just basic testing :-p

[07:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
If someone generated millions of random pages and checked for errors, that'd be fuzzing; but I'm just picking a random URL and trying it and finding all these errors ;-)

[07:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the set of URLs you are picking from does have random weird stuff though

[07:24:00.0000] <hallvors>
Philip`: I think Opera uses TLD as one of the factors for charset detection, but it's not a topic I know much about and I haven't checked if I'm right. UI language is also used.

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: The set of URLs I'm picking from is basically just the web :-)

[07:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I expect it does have much more random weird stuff than the subset of the web controlled by people who run validators on their own pages

[07:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
hallvors: Okay, thanks

[07:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I want to know why the line break between </body> and </html> causes formatting elements to be reopened

[07:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know yet if it is an implementation bug or a spec bug

[07:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hah. I have // XXX bug? on the relevant line asking if this is a spec bug

[07:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if I've email Hixie about this a year ago

[08:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html is not looking good

[08:00:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: how does the spec ever insert anything after the body element?

[08:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: it doesn't. that part is my bug

[08:00:03.0000] <Philip`>
I thought there wasn't any outstanding feedback on the parser

[08:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and I can't see any in the issues list)

[08:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. then I'll file a bug

[08:01:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: probably because Hixie started to work with wf2 instead of dealing with feedback

[08:02:00.0000] <takkaria>
hsivonen: when WF is done, I imagine it'll drop by a good few hundred

[08:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, the spec bug is that space characters in 'after body' reconstruct the list of formatting elements

[08:06:00.0000] <annevk22>
http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2008/sep/11/two-thousand-twenty-two/ is part of the reason for the twitter messages

[08:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. it might not be a spec bug after all...

[08:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
what jeff writes makes sense if you're an author

[08:11:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: perhaps the web developer guide to html5 shouldn't mention stuff that's not widely implemented

[08:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
To a reasonable margin of error, everyone is an author, so it makes sense to make sense to authors

[08:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aargh. the spec is not in error

[08:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
IE8, Opera and WebKit actually behave like that

[08:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Gecko doesn't

[08:12:03.0000] <annevk22>
seems adactio explained it already

[08:13:00.0000] <annevk22>
(re: jeffcroft.com post)

[08:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in Opera and WebKit, </body> splits the text node, though

[08:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like in the streaming mode, the Validator.nu HTML Parser gets the infoset wrong if there are space characters after </body>

[08:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'll probably call it a feature

[08:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
since fixing it would make the messages really annoying

[08:16:03.0000] <Philip`>
That's cheating :-p

[08:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: is it useful to throw a fatal error because the parser couldn't move an additional space inside the last <font>?

[08:18:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
in 2022, HTML5 will be what CSS1 is now, but CSS1 was still worth it

[08:18:01.0000] <annevk22>
seems I already blogged about the HTML5 timeline last december

[08:18:02.0000] <annevk22>
zcorpan_, nice line, might use that

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: The informative message is the "End tag for body seen but there were unclosed elements" one (or at least it would be informative if it said what elements were unclosed), and then it's just quite confusing for it complain about a new font element after that point

[08:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
so if there was a fatal error, it'd still give the informative message, and wouldn't give the confusing message, so maybe that'd be good

[08:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but I might be missing lots of issues here)

[08:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: oh, there's definitely a bug to fix here

[08:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I'm unsure about whether making the placement of endgame spaces just right is worthwhile, though

[08:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[08:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't really care much about spaces :-)

[08:22:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me thinks it's not worthwhile and would also like whitespace after head to just be inserted in head

[08:23:00.0000] <annevk22>
/me agrees

[08:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Jeff Croft seems to miss the point between Hixie writing stuff down and not having to maintain separate site code bases for different browsers

[08:24:00.0000] <annevk22>
well, he also misses the point of reading beyond the point of disagreement

[08:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, since the guide is meant to be a complete guide to HTML5, it doesn't make sense to omit stuff just because it's not implemented yet. Besides, everything will be implemented or dropped by the time HTML5 is done

[08:30:00.0000] <virtuelv>
zcorpan_: I'd prefer such a document to be live, and to reflect stuff people can actually test on their own

[08:30:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: well you can't write everything at once anyway and the guide could be a living document evolving along with html5 and implementations

[08:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
bad. I guess I'll just fix the endgame spaces

[08:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
virtuelv: my point exactly

[08:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: we should have HTML snapshots like CSS Beijing

[08:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
was there anything in particular that it mentions, but shouldn't right now?

[08:31:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: dunno

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
that post from Jeff Croft pretty much sums up the reasons why I stopped telling people that time line directly, and instead focussing on their ability to use the new stuff that's becoming available

[08:37:00.0000] <annevk22>
i managed to explain it at fronteers by talking about CSS2

[08:37:01.0000] <annevk22>
people using the features, and the amount of time getting complete interop takes

perhaps it would be better PR to pretend not to have a guess about how long it will take to get *everything* implemented in an interoperable way

[08:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
"when it's ready"

[08:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: yeah

[08:43:00.0000] <annevk22>
zcorpan_, euh, where exactly?

[08:43:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk22: "How did we got here?"

[08:43:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk22: in the presentation, that is

[08:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://twitter.com/riddle/statuses/918917836

[08:47:01.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: :)

[08:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on missing the point: http://twitter.com/singpolyma/statuses/918912066

[08:49:01.0000] <annevk22>
zcorpan_, ouch

[08:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
wow, I think we need to improve our PR a bit. Those reactions are a bit surprising

[08:50:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: don't mention 2022 in interviews :P

[08:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: not really surprising

[08:51:00.0000] <annevk22>
zcorpan_, fixed, damage already done though

[08:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk22: our education and outreach party line should probably say "XHTML 1.0" instead of "XHTML 1.x", since we aren't trying to be compatible with the stuff the XHTML2 WG does under the XHTML 1.1 name

[08:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, the fact that they don't really understand the timeline isn't surprising, but their hostility towards the spec is

[08:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
when they put together CSS Eleven, I wonder what their expected commitment span was...

[08:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that Jeff Croft was on CSS Eleven

[08:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me also notes that CSS3 is taking its time

[08:56:03.0000] <annevk22>
hsivonen, yeah, good point

[08:57:00.0000] <annevk22>
/me fixes that while he's still connected

[08:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the aspect ratio of the demo video is wrong in Minefield

[08:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i think that's a known bug in minefield

[08:59:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me remembers someone commenting on the spec because of that bug

[09:23:00.0000] <takkaria>
is anyone else finding it hard to follow the privacy/disability thread?

[09:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: I got the impression that everyone but David Dailey says "Not a Problem" and I have trouble following what David Dailey said

[09:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, Safari and Firefox incorrectly parse <meta =charset="UTF-8">, at least according to the current spec, for their encoding detection

[09:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, but IE gets it right

[09:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
and Opear

[09:36:02.0000] <Lachy>
Opera*

[09:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: No, I just use the mark all as read feature of my mail client

[09:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
some character encoding detection tests are available here http://lachy.id.au/dev/markup/tests/html5/encoding/

[10:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Could you make it determine pass/fail automatically, and then have a tool which runs all the tests at once, for lazy people?

[10:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, eventually, I can do that

[10:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
I still have a few hundred more tests to make

[10:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
and then I can make a test harness

[10:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Isn't it easier if you have a harness before you write the tests, so you can more easily run and test the tests?

[10:03:00.0000] <takkaria>
I was going to suggest doing them as data: urls, but I forgot IE didn't support them

[10:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, maybe

[10:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
if I can work out how. But I also have to make them capable of being integrated into Opera's testing system

[10:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
I should be able to write some javascript to check the textContent of the element to make sure it contains the right character, and then have that report to the test harness

[10:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Presumably something like <script>'Å' == '\xc5' ? pass() : fail()</script> would work for most of the tests

[10:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, yeah, that's what I did

[10:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: That's possibly a bad idea since data: URLs specify their own encoding

[10:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I guess you can't put a raw uninterpreted byte in them

[10:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, if you want to create a test harness for them, that would be helpful. Just make use of the top.opener.rr(passed) function that gets called in them for obtaining the result. That's how Opera's system works

[10:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
Making framerate counters in SVG by having each digit represented by an object containing the text "0\n1\n2\n..." (converted to path form so that it doesn't depend on fonts or dodgy text renderers) which is dynamically moved upwards/downwards so the right sequence of digit values is visible, is a stupid idea

[10:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I only allowed for two digits, and now Chrome goes at >100fps, and I can't be bothered to go and update all my SVG and JS to make it work again :-( )

[10:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's weird how comments and space characters go to different places after </body>

[10:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me decides to not bother fixing it, until he rewrites Canvex in the distant future

[10:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
oo, Chrome does canvex that fast?

[10:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes, at 320x240

[10:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
and around 30fps at 640x480

[10:33:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: So the advice is to use a higher res.?

[10:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sadly it inherits WebKit's total failure to render table layouts

[10:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
which makes the page take twice as much vertical space as it should, so at high resolutions it's larger than the screen, and the up/down movement keys cause the browser to scroll up and down the page, which is highly irritating

[10:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: why am I not seeing a huge fps difference with tracemonkey?

[10:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me starts to suspect his Minefield doesn't really enable TraceMonkey

[10:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Because it spends nearly all its time drawing nice bilinearly-scaled bitmaps to the screen, not running JS

[10:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Chrome uses the Skia library for graphics, which I presume it what makes it fast)

[10:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/it/is/

[10:39:01.0000] <takkaria>
I wonder if Cairo will get as good as Skia at some point

[10:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Skia is under the Apache License 2.0, so I presume Cairo can't copy any of its code

[10:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
yeah, someone was complaining about that on planet.mozilla.org

[10:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Skia has some OpenGL code but I don't know if it actually uses that

[10:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, the public Skia code doesn't even seem to really have any assembly or SSE or anything, so I don't see how it could be that much faster

[10:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I don't think it was particularly lower quality at scaling images downwards than other browsers

[10:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me will have to look more closely when he gets home

[10:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
would it be bad if in the streaming mode instead of detecting the non-streamability of trailing comments I just hoisted them into body

[10:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, if I simply deferred the endElement events for body and html without bookkeeping of whether there are trailing comments?

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Does the streaming code currently follow the spec precisely (except in cases where it aborts with a fatal error), so this would be the first divergence?

[10:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: well, not the divergence is that trailing whitespace goes outside the body

[10:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/not/now/

[10:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: but yeah, until now I have imagined it followed the spec

[10:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I could still claim that it conforms if you don't set a LexicalHandler

[10:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems pointless to put in all the code to allow trailing comments to go into the right place but then throw a fatal error if there's a line feed after such comment

[10:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wouldn't complain if it was just a documented deviation from the spec

[11:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me zaps a lot of fatal errors

[12:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
the new Microsoft ad is even more boring than the one from last week, and it's 3 times longer

[12:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I didn't really get it

[12:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think anyone gets it

[12:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
for anyone who hasn't seen it, http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.aspx?icid=winvan

[12:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me hasn't seen any of the Microsoft ads but maybe just getting people to talk about the ads is the idea

[12:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, the problem is that the ads are backfiring because the ads suck so much, it makes Microsoft look bad

[12:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
it certainly doesn't want to make me buy any of their products

[12:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: But you're a smelly Mac user, so you're really not the target audience for Microsoft ads :-p

[12:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think they are supposed to sell product directly

[12:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
they are supposed to "humanize" the company

[12:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I will admit the ads increased my estimate of Bill Gates's coolness by a small amount

[12:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but that estimate was already abysmally low

[12:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and in general the ads seem in bad taste and make both BG and Seinfeld look annoying and distant

[12:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
until Vista came out, I was a Windows user

[12:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that where Vista's "(My) Computer" window shows system information (network name, CPU name, RAM, etc), if you click on the text with those details (as opposed to space between them, or the textual field labels, or anywhere else in the window), the window does not get focussed

[12:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also the detail text isn't quite lined up with the associated label text)

[12:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
I assume there's some kind of security-related reason for that bug, but it doesn't make me particularly happy about Vista

[13:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
heh. the MS ad is Flash with a Silverlight download button on the page

[13:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I liked it!

[13:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
the 2022 date is useful for getting rid of people who don't read -- the interview was pretty clear about what it meant

[13:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i'm happy for people to talk about html5 :-)

[13:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
regarding microsoft's ad, i thought it was quite reassuring

[13:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
i had thought that their $300bn campaign might give them their edge back

[13:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
but having seen the ads, i am no longer concerned

[13:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
the comments on the various blogs about 2022 are encouraging

[13:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
people seem to be getting it

[13:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
i am, however, amused by the people who think in 14 years the web won't exist or will be radically different or whatever.

[13:55:03.0000] <gavin>
did something happen recently regarding 2022?

[13:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
i imagine those are the same people who thought we'd be driving flying cars...

[13:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
gavin: i mentioned it in an interview

[13:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=718

[13:59:00.0000] <gavin>
that was a while ago though, wasn't it?

[13:59:01.0000] <gavin>
guess not that long ago

[13:59:02.0000] <gavin>
/me has been meaning to read it

[14:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, we are going to be driving flying cars and riding hover boards by 2015. Back To The Future showed us that.

[14:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Hey! I didn't exist when the web began! Things can change!

[14:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
gavin: The recent happening is that someone read that interview

[14:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
(http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2008/sep/11/two-thousand-twenty-two/)

[14:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, are you saying that changes to the human population are relevant to to the internet, or just that your birth was a significant event in its history?

[14:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: That things can change over time.

[14:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: But you're saying that the web changes slower than human life

[14:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I change very slowly

[14:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for content negotiation: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/versioning-compatibility-strategies

[14:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmmm.

[14:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I need more than normal on the front page of my LaTeX report :\

[14:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
like, on the title page

[14:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I don't anything about content negotiation in that document

[14:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
or were you referring to being sent the useless application/xml copy of it instead of the text/html version, due to content negitaion?

[14:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I get an unstyled XML doc in Firefox

[15:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't. I get the HTML version in Firefox

[15:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
check what accept headers Firefox is sending

[15:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this is Firefox 2 on ubuntu 7.10

[15:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I've got Firefox 3

[15:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5

[15:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
FF3 must have changed them.

[15:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

[15:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I added a couple more features to the beta and changed the layout a little. http://html5.lachy.id.au/beta/

[15:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
new features include the buttons to insert template markup

[15:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
and the small gap between the DOM tree panel and the toolbar below intentional, not a bug. It will have something added to the space later.

[16:16:00.0000] <annevk22>
markp++

[16:17:00.0000] <annevk22>
we should have a bot that keeps track of what like in #webkit

[16:17:01.0000] <csarven>
http://ishtml5readyyet.com/

[16:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmmm. I wonder whether I should do that as XHTML.

[16:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me waits to be killed

[16:18:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: What? Is XHTML ready yet?

[16:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Why wait for things to be ready?

[16:19:01.0000] <annevk>
/me places a comment

[16:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me feels he is missing something

[16:19:03.0000] <annevk>
and I make a typo, nice

[16:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
according to WHOIS, this is the guy that set up that site http://jcornelius.com/

[16:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: What did markp say/do?

[16:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to come up with a description of what the form element is

[16:22:01.0000] <csarven>
annevk No wonder HTML5 is taking so long with all the typoZ. :)

[16:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
  <p>The <code>form</code> element represents a collection of <span

[16:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
  title="category-field">data entry fields</span> that can be

[16:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
  submitted to a server for processing.</p>

[16:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Sounds reasonable, no?

[16:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
good.

[16:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
thnks.

[16:23:03.0000] <csarven>
Not necessarily "data entry fields", unless type=hidden stuff is classified as such.

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
just data fields maybe?

[16:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
now, wtf is accept-charset and what does it do.

[16:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me cracks open html4

[16:24:03.0000] <csarven>
I suppose "entry" comes off as if the user physically taking an action on the form.

[16:24:04.0000] <jgraham>
data fields is arguably more precise but I think either is good enough

[16:25:00.0000] <annevk>
http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2008/sep/11/two-thousand-twenty-two/#c147306 well, there's that

[16:25:01.0000] <annevk>
csarven, hah

[16:25:02.0000] <csarven>
annevk That's where I came across it. I didn't get to reading the comments yet.

[16:25:03.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, he made a snarky remark on my blog

[16:25:04.0000] <nessy>
isn't accept-charset http ?

[16:26:00.0000] <annevk>
(that comment says, Jeff Croft: "If, in 2022, I’m still writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I will probably shoot myself. :)")

[16:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah! and if in 2008 we're still using TCP and ASCII, we should kill ourselves

[16:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
"The value is a space- and/or comma-delimited list of charset values."

[16:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
ffs

[16:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or, god forbid, coding in C

[16:27:03.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Oh I see. Yeah it's unny how Jeff said all that stuff and then denied that he meant it was a negative thing. I guess he needs to work on his writing skills ;)

[16:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's like the html4 wg went OUT OF IT'S WAY to make design decisions that were as vague and annoying as possible

[16:27:05.0000] <jgraham>
s/unny/funny/

[16:27:06.0000] <annevk>
I guess the good thing is that the smarter cookies out there get better informed because of this madness

[16:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if any browsers support accept-charset and how to test it

[16:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: No need we have the LHC for that :)

[16:28:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, they do

[16:28:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, isn't that the charset that ends up being used by the browser for submission?

[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
I thought browsers did something vaugely surprising with accept-charset

[16:29:02.0000] <annevk>
you can probably test it by using different encodings for the page and accept-charset

[16:29:03.0000] <annevk>
not sure how to test the multiple values thing accurately

[16:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: implementing it per spec would be vaugely surprising

[16:29:05.0000] <annevk>
maybe with unsupported encodings

[16:29:06.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: That would be midblowing ;)

[16:29:07.0000] <jgraham>
mindblowing even

[16:29:08.0000] <annevk>
you mean not possible

[16:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me starts work on an article to explain the exactly what spec timeline means for web developers

[16:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: For the WHATWG blog or for your own blog?

[16:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
haven't decided yet. There are a few other options I could try too

[16:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
depends how much visibility I want to give the article

[16:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
I can happily write a 1 paragraph entry for the WHATWG blog

[16:38:01.0000] <annevk>
go for it

[16:38:02.0000] <jgraham>
Something that woughly reads 2022: This number is irrelevant

[16:38:03.0000] <jgraham>
roughly

[16:39:00.0000] <annevk>
sounds good

[16:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me must try hitting the right keys in the right order

[16:39:02.0000] <annevk>
that's how I ended up with mesaure

[16:40:00.0000] <annevk>
(well, correct keys, wrong order)

[16:41:00.0000] <annevk>
and "charset values" implies the weird matching rules?

[16:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
I was intending to write something a little longer that explains the spec process and outlines what each milestone means to each of the stake holders, including web devs, browser vendors and spec writers

[16:41:02.0000] <annevk>
oops

[16:41:03.0000] <annevk>
yeah, no reason we can't have both though

[16:41:04.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Sure. I think longer is good. 

[16:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
I'll only bother if also having something short adds value

[16:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
I could submit it to ALA, that would give it a lot of visibility, or perhaps get it published on WaSP

[16:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
the 2022 date is when the spec becomes mostly irrelevant, ironically :-)

[16:43:00.0000] <GregHouston>
2022 is about around the time NASA is suppose to have astronauts living on the moon. Maybe that can be worked into the blog. ;)

[16:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
at least, assuming that we've moved on to html6 and co by then, at least on the spec side of things

[16:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok well

[16:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
accept-charset interoperability result:

[16:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
0.

[16:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
by 2022, the interplanetary internet should be working too, so that astronauts living on the moon will be able to use the internet

[16:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
The ping time will be horrendous

http://www.sstl.co.uk/News_and_Events/Latest_News/?story=1254

[16:47:03.0000] <GregHouston>
Haha. Yeah, there was a post about that on slashdot yesterday.

[16:47:04.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's where I saw it

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
forget ping times, iirc TCP congestion control doesn't even work right with the kind of latency you'll get on the interplanatory net

[16:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well the distance to the moon / the speed of light is about 1.3 seconds which isn't too bad

[16:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
hopefully by then, physicists will have worked out how to make use of quantum entanglement of particles to transmit messages instantly over any distance

[16:49:01.0000] <hdh>
"Note that 120 sec is defined in the protocol as the maximum * possible RTT." from /usr/src/linux/net/inet/tcp.c

[16:49:03.0000] <annevk>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=455043 is sort of an interesting historical artifact :)

[16:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, of course they're wrong. That's why they're *only* a theory!

[16:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
hdh: right

[16:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
;-)

[16:50:03.0000] <hdh>
that comment mentioned Mars

[16:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
hdh: That might just be enough to communicate with Venus at the right time of year

[16:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Mars is too far, I think

[16:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
hdh: can you find any evidence that tcp.c ever actually contained that?

[16:54:00.0000] <hdh>
http://www.linuxhq.com/kernel/v1.1/83/net/inet/tcp.c

[16:55:00.0000] <hdh>
I hope the part just cut out of the diff is the same as the fortune

[16:55:01.0000] <annevk>
Moz is doing Storage.clear() too?

[16:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
hdh: hm, your searching skills are better than mine

[16:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: is their stuff still based on the old storage spec?

[16:57:00.0000] <annevk>
this is about implementing localStorage: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=422526

[16:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess you could ask

[16:58:01.0000] <annevk>
petele from MS told me IE8B2 either has both async and sync or just sync btw (they did change something versus IE8B1)

[17:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
IE doesn't seem to support accept-charset at all.

[17:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
webkit doesn't seem to support _charset_

[17:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
which makes testing this a pain for webkit

[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
Mozilla supports it, only splits on spaces, and takes the first one

[17:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the charset mime parameter?

[17:06:02.0000] <annevk>
How is this: "There be dragons. Use UTF-8."

[17:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
(that it supports)

[17:06:04.0000] <othermaciej>
in what context?

[17:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: the magical <input type=hidden name=_charset_> value

[17:06:06.0000] <othermaciej>
oh

[17:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
opera supports both spaces and commas and picks the first one

[17:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
(that it supports, i assume, untested)

[17:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey, the tag has come across the vagueness of the html specs: http://www.w3.org/mid/OF08D6A3D0.C2A54890-ON852574C2.00793300-852574C2.007A5D9B⊙lc

What happened to the guy who was going to redesign the WHATWG blog?

[17:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
Because the current theme makes me want to poke my eyes out...

[17:13:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, don't do that

[17:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
:)

[17:15:00.0000] <annevk>
here is that post: http://www.brandonfrohs.com/2008/08/whatwg-they-know-html-dont-they/

[17:15:01.0000] <annevk>
seems he's been back for a few weeks

[17:15:02.0000] <annevk>
maybe we should chase him

[17:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
don't chase him :-) but do feel free to remind him politely :-)

[17:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll contact him, if no-one else is

[17:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
I can't find an email or contact form for him, I'll just have to leave a comment

[17:28:00.0000] <Lachy>

[17:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh crap, there must be something wrong with the .htaccess on the blog

[17:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://blog.whatwg.org/2022 returns 404

[17:35:02.0000] <Dashiva>
You mean it's not 2022 yet?

[17:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, it can't be anything wrong with .htaccess, it must be a bug in the wordpress code

[17:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
probably because it thinks it's a year, not an article

[17:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
we'll have to move it

[17:39:00.0000] <annevk>
use two-thousand-twenty-two

[17:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
I must remmber this as a reason to make /2022/ and /2022 different

[17:39:02.0000] <Dashiva>
"Is it 2022 yet?"

[17:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
any suggestions for a new post slug?

[17:40:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: You've been asking that every five minutes since we left

[17:40:02.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, see above

[17:40:03.0000] <Dashiva>
See mine too

[17:40:04.0000] <jgraham>
Party like it's 2022

[17:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://blog.whatwg.org/two-thousand-twenty-two

[17:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll set up a redirect for /2022 so we don't break links from RSS feeds

[17:42:02.0000] <Dashiva>
But Lachy, then the blog won't be consistent in 2022!

[17:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Think of the children (somewhat literally ;)

[17:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
done

[17:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
I made it a temporary redirect

[17:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
so we can remove it by then

[17:44:02.0000] <annevk>
better make it permanent then

[17:44:03.0000] <annevk>
302 means you should keep the old URI around as it might redirect to something else later

[17:44:04.0000] <annevk>
301 means the old URI should not be used or cached

[17:44:05.0000] <Lachy>
in 14 years, it will

[17:45:00.0000] <annevk>
fair enough, I suppose

[17:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Interesting point, though

[17:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If the URLs current meaning has been permanently redirected, but you would like to put the URL into use again later, with a different meaning.... what redirect do you use?

[17:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
we should file a bug with wordpress so that they prevent post slugs like that which clash

[17:48:00.0000] <hdh>
I think 301 is better; in 2022 it will be 200, and there will be no record that it was redirection once

[17:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
hdh, you're assuming there aren't any tools or caches or whatever out there that keep permanent records of these things

[17:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
although, it's probably quite impractical to do so if people are careles and don't keep permanent redirects forever

[17:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not like people keep records of 410 URLs...

[17:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
410 is different though

[17:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's the same thing, just from the server's perspective

[17:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
browsers do keep records of 301's until the history is cleared

[17:51:03.0000] <Lachy>
so if someone never cleared their history, then it would affect them

[17:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's not the same thing. 410 means it's just gone, 301 means it's moved permanently elsewhere

[17:53:00.0000] <hdh>
ok, I got the cachable part wrong

[17:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Both require one of them to remember "There's nothing at this here URL."

[17:54:00.0000] <hdh>
so my whole sentence is backward, 302 is correct

[17:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What if we modify the scenario: Redirect for a few years, then 404/410 for a few years, then a new page is added at the same URL.

[18:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do i define form.reset()... hmm...

[18:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Along the line of this? for each input element in form.elements element.value = element.defaultValue

[18:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is <select> elements make this different

[18:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
and input checkbox and radio buttons too

[18:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
also i don't think it affects buttons

[18:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
lots of complications

[18:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
and i have to make sure i don't affect fieldsets

[18:17:05.0000] <Hixie>
but i do have to affect <output> elements...

[18:17:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, I bet there'll be a lot of interesting edge cases to explore :)

[18:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
i might just define an algorithm for each element and just invoke that for each one

[18:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
oop for specs

[18:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
polymorphic english

[18:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[18:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hmm... might be able to get away with less

[18:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh wait, you have to do the selects recursively to get options, right. Then it gets messy anyway.

[23:46:00.0000] <GregHouston>
It's just a quick proof of concept, but for anyone interested I created a hack for using canvas/vml in a page viewed with IE8 beta 2 with the document mode set to IE8 Standards. http://greghoustondesign.com/examples/canvas-ie8/

[01:28:00.0000] <annevk>
GregHouston, hmm, I thought IE8B2 fixed VML

[01:31:00.0000] <GregHouston>
With excanvas it works in browser mode IE7 with document mode in quirks mode. With moocanvas it works in all 6 of the 8 modes. VML does not work in the IE8 standards mode at all however. So without a workaround you either get VML or the new CSS features.

[01:32:00.0000] <GregHouston>
*6 of the 8 modes, not all 6 of the 8 modes

[01:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
8 modes?

[01:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
wait what? they removed VML?

[01:37:01.0000] <annevk>
I hope it's a known bug

[01:37:02.0000] <GregHouston>
Haha, yeah: So you have combinations of browser modes and document modes. Fun stuff. 

[01:38:00.0000] <GregHouston>
Sorry, this is long:

[01:38:01.0000] <GregHouston>
- Browser Mode: IE7, Document Mode: Quirks Mode

[01:38:02.0000] <GregHouston>
- Browser Mode: IE7, Document Mode: IE7 Standards Mode

[01:38:03.0000] <GregHouston>
- Browser Mode: IE8, Document Mode: Quirks Mode

[01:38:04.0000] <GregHouston>
- Browser Mode: IE8, Document Mode: IE7 Standards Mode

[01:38:05.0000] <GregHouston>
- Browser Mode: IE8, Document Mode: IE8 Standards Mode

[01:38:06.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, Option is a NamedConstructor

[01:38:07.0000] <GregHouston>
- Browser Mode: IE8 Compatibility View, Document Mode: Quirks Mode

[01:38:08.0000] <GregHouston>
- Browser Mode: IE8 Compatibility View, Document Mode: IE7 Standards Mode

[01:38:09.0000] <GregHouston>
- Browser Mode: IE8 Compatibility View, Document Mode: IE8 Standards Mode

[01:38:10.0000] <GregHouston>
No, they closed the ticket on VML the same day IE8 beta 2 came out. It just says: Closed by design.

[01:39:00.0000] <annevk>
sigh

[01:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
wow, good times

[01:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
competing with IE is gonna be easy if they just shoot themselvs in the foot the whole time

[01:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what will devs do? not support IE8? switch to IE 7 mode? use silverlight? Use flash? use Renesis? Use vlad's canvas control?

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
GregHouston: so what is Browser Mode: IE7?

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444222 is relevant for Window.name

[01:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: VML was never a serious solution for canvas anyway

[01:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: please send feedback by e-mail or bug report, i am not in a position to take notes right now

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's MS's refusal to implement canvas about? Apple's patents before HTML5 is a REC? Silverlight team? something else?

[01:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: they haven't refused to implement it have they?

[01:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: oops. s/refusal/failure to prioritize to coincide with VML removal/

[01:45:00.0000] <annevk>
I heard Apple patents again yesterday when petele replied to a question regarding <canvas>

[01:46:00.0000] <GregHouston>
Hixie, truthfully, it is still all rather confusing to me. With the developer bar in IE8 you can see what modes a page defaults to. How the browser mode is set is still unclear to me. You can set a page to quirks supposedly by not using a doctype. You can set it to IE7 Standars with the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.

[01:46:01.0000] <GregHouston>
With the toolbar you can test pages in all 8 modes to see what works. :D

[01:48:00.0000] <GregHouston>
Here is the first VML example I get on Google. It defaults to browser mode IE8, and document Quirks Mode. If you try to view it in IE8 Standards the VML dissappears. http://web.syr.edu/~prai/

[01:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
isn't VML more standard than canvas or SVG now that VML is in an ISO standard?

[01:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i doubt it is anything but lack of resources

[01:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
VML is an ISO standard?

[01:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
i really shouldn't ask these questions

[01:58:02.0000] <GregHouston>
hsivonen: How do I parse this: s/refusal/failure to prioritize to coincide with VML removal/

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, part of OOXML iirc

[02:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
GregHouston: substitute "refusal" with "/failure to  prioritize to coincide with VML removal

[02:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
"

[02:01:03.0000] <GregHouston>
Thanks.

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
dfn.js is nice

[02:13:00.0000] <GregHouston>
Just one last comment on this subject. I created a ticket for canvas in IE8 back in March. It was originally set to "Closed by design". At some point however they changed it to Closed (Postponed). So that is somewhat encouraging. https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=334060

[02:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/expertzone/chats/transcripts/08_0515_ez_ie8.mspx says of <canvas>, "In part because the specification still is in flux, this will not be in the IE8 product."

[02:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
what kind of a crazy bug state is Closed (Postponed)

[02:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
either the bug is invalid or it isn't

[02:18:01.0000] <GregHouston>
Haha

[02:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
GregHouston: That http://web.syr.edu/~prai/ page breaks because it uses non-standard CSS, which IE8 doesn't support since it tries to do CSS properly - see https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=333905

[02:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
It should still work if you use <?import ...?> instead, as far as I'm aware

[02:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: "REMIND and LATER considered harmful"

[02:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I never understood how REMIND or LATER were valid resolutions

[02:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
those are maybe milestones, not bug states

[02:26:00.0000] <GregHouston>
Philip: interesting.

[02:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
This isn't a bug tracker that Microsoft uses to track bugs and feature requests - it's just telling customers that Microsoft has acknowledged their issue but is not going to fix it in this release

[02:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
I would assume their internal bug tracker is better at handling not-going-to-fix-it-yet-but-maybe-in-the-future issues

[02:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Chrome is going to silently autoupgrade to major releases--not just security patches...

[02:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if there will ever be a major release, or if will always be 0.2 Beta

[02:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe their position is they will upgrade you when they feel like it

[02:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
you don't get a version, you get a "channel"

[02:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
they want to update it "as often as a Web app" which to me sounds a little naiive but maybe they are smarter

[02:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. It'll be interesting to see the competitive effect of that kind of "channel"

[02:43:00.0000] <ronny>
hi

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk>
hi

[02:45:01.0000] <ronny>
what are the reasons for inventing an own format for event streams instead of using an xml event stream?

[02:45:02.0000] <annevk>
simpler

[02:47:00.0000] <ronny>
annevk: from my point of view its more complex, basically all browsers already got some kind of sax parser, and it allows to just drop strucutred data to the client, while the new thing is some weird obscure text format that needs a new parser

[02:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
as a browser engine implementer, I'd rather write a parser for a trivial custom format than to use an XML format

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
ronny: XML streaming doesn't make sense really (XMPP notwithstanding)

[02:50:00.0000] <ronny>
Hixie: hu?

[02:51:00.0000] <ronny>
xmpp is basically just an evetn-stream, i dont see why browsers shouldnt get something semilar

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
XML doesn't define where a well-formedness error occurs exactly, so it's unclear where a stream should halt if there is a well-formedness error, for instance

[02:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
XMPP is not a good design, imho

[02:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
also, XML isn't really appropriate here. What we have is a streaming series of name/value pair dictionaries

[02:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
XML describes a single tree structure

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
mapping a streaming series of name/value pair dictionaries onto a tree structure is an unnatural mapping

[02:54:00.0000] <ronny>
how is that so much different to something like <name>value</name>

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
"value" can contain other elements, and can contain attributes

[02:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
er, and "name" can contain attributes

[02:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
XML describes an annotated tree

[02:55:03.0000] <ronny>
yeah, and how is that currently relevant?

[02:55:04.0000] <othermaciej>
ooh yeah I forgot about the streaming aspect

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
annotated trees are a very different data structure than name/value pair dictionary streams

[02:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
streaming xml is nuts

[02:57:00.0000] <ronny>
why?

[02:57:01.0000] <ronny>
its basically just a series of annotated events

[02:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
because it requires draconian error handling, but you can't tell whether an error occurred for sure until you get to the end of the document

[02:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so streaming it violates a fundamental premise of XML

[02:58:00.0000] <ronny>
brb, called away

[02:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(unless you send whole separate well-formed documents, but I don't think anyone considers that wise)

[02:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
XMPP is a dancing bear trick

[03:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's fun making ejabberd send namespace-ill-formed output to arbitrary clients and causing them to drop their connection

[03:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: you can do useful things without ever reaching the end of an XML document

[03:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in practice, streaming XML is tacitly well-defined except for the exact error byte within a tag

[03:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: it just seems sloppy to me

[03:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe a notion of "well defined fragment" and then sending a series of those would somehow make me feel better

[03:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but ideally you want error recovery so a single ill-formed fragment doesn't poison your connection

[03:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but also XML is a poor format for simple key-value pair data

[03:12:03.0000] <hsivonen>
sure

[03:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
XMPP says "An XML stanza exists at the direct child level of the root <stream/> element and is said to be well-balanced if it matches the production [43] content of [XML].", which sounds like that notion

[03:15:01.0000] <Philip`>

if i have a cd in a mac, and it somehow got unmounted, how do i remount it again without ejecting it and reinserting it?

[03:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
i am ssh'ed into the machine and have remote desktop but i don't want to have to walk over to the living room to reinsert the disk...

[03:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, try Disk Utility

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: using remote desktop, you should be able to mount it with Disk Utility

[03:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries

[03:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
sweet that worked

[03:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what the equivalent command line command would be

[03:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks, btw

[03:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, it's probably the mount command, but I don't know how to use it

[03:35:01.0000] <ronny>
re

[03:36:00.0000] <ronny>
othermaciej: since the stream is supposed to be valid i dont see whats wrong in considering a invalid fragment a critical error

[03:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ronny: it's a needlessly brittle way to design a high-level protocol IMO

[03:37:01.0000] <ronny>
othermaciej: these days generating invalid xml has only 2 causes - being malicious or being incompetent

[03:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[03:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it is silly to have the inefficiency of a text-based protocol and the brittleness of a binary protocol

[03:37:04.0000] <othermaciej>
ronny: saying that in this channel will earn you derisive laughter

[03:37:05.0000] <Hixie>
ronny: do you have any software that generates xml?

[03:37:06.0000] <hsivonen>
/me laughs

[03:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me prepares the Philip` Gun (tm)

[03:38:01.0000] <ronny>
Hixie: yeah, im very keen on keeping it valid, i dont want to be as incompetent as the other oart of the 80:20 rule

[03:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ronny: sorry for being blunt, but experience seems to show that even world-class XML experts cannot avoid generating invalid XML with their software

[03:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there has been much discussion of that phenomenon in these circles and it is part of why we think the HTML classic syntax of HTML5, and the well-defined error handling, is important

[03:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
ronny: as far as i am aware Philip` has never found any XML generating software that can't be tricked into outputting non-wellformed XML, so if you have a candidate for his testing skills, i'm certainly interested in a URL to give him :-)

[03:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not just a legacy thing, it is a feature to have a relatively error-tolerant delivery format when dealing with heterogenous producers and consumers

[03:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
"be tolerant in what you receive", as the saying goes, though tolerant in the very specific way defined in the spec, as i say

[03:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and it seems to me that chat is a case where the same benefits could accrue

[03:41:01.0000] <ronny>
hmm

[03:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's just not mission-critical enough for anything that serious people want to get in there and redesign the protocols

[03:41:03.0000] <ronny>
ok

[03:41:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Philip` hasn't found holes in validator.nu XML output since I got rid of third-party XML serialization code

[03:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it hardly counts if you consider software that has reaped the benefits of his testing already

[03:43:00.0000] <ronny>
i yet have to dig something up that requires disasterous testing

[03:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ronny: anyway, I hope that even if you still disagree, that you can at least see that the custom event stream protocol was not random or thoughtless but actually based on giving the issues a fair amount of consideration

[03:44:01.0000] <ronny>
well, i dont have to like it

[03:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
the event stream protocol was in fact designed to make it impossible to output invalid streams

[03:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
(at the syntax level)

[03:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am merely asking you to understand at this point, not to like :-)

[03:45:02.0000] <ronny>
bit given your input it seems much more nice

[03:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
i believe there isn't a single byte combination that can't be unambiguously parsed without error

[03:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
in that format

[03:45:05.0000] <ronny>
hmm

[03:45:06.0000] <Hixie>
so in a way it does have draconian error handling like xml... there just aren't any possible errors :-)

[03:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gotta quit for some testing, I'll be back

[03:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that does sort of finesse the issue

[03:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in a way, yyeah, ut the new code is independent of the Apache/Lotus-originating code

[03:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
but

[03:46:04.0000] <ronny>
btw, i think its wrong to give programmers any silent error-tolerant savety net for their own errors

[03:47:00.0000] <ronny>
they arent users, they should know better, and they should be punished for not knowing

[03:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
ronny: i agree that programmers shouldn't get their errors ignored, but the users shouldn't be exposed to the errors if errors slip through

[03:47:02.0000] <ronny>
Hixie: well, will browsers have a way to disable html5 error recovery?

[03:48:00.0000] <ronny>
(i mean a well defined way that allows to dump my own stupid erros just into my face)

[03:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
most already do, just open the error console in e.g. firefox, safari, chrome, or opera

[03:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose browsers could have a way to just abort as soon as an error is output on the error console, but that would make debugging hard since you couldn't do anything until you'd fixed all the errors before the one you were debugging

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk>
CSS extensions would make that really annoying

[03:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what dumping HTML5 parse errors to console would do to Firefox perf

[03:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
or browser perf in general

[03:53:00.0000] <ronny>
browsers should indicate how incappable the creator of the site is (ie show how stupid he is at making valid html5 that doesnt need any recovery)

[03:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
indicate to whom?

[03:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
And why?

[03:54:00.0000] <annevk>
someone requested a Web Workers diff, lots of people have requested html5 diffs meanwhile

[03:54:01.0000] <ronny>
well, people would care to fix if the browsers shows every lillle stupid thing they did

[03:54:02.0000] <ronny>
after all it is bad for reputation

[03:54:03.0000] <annevk>
based on the little amount of != 10 context diffs I suspect hsivonen to use context 50

[03:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: IIRC, I've used 200

[03:56:01.0000] <annevk>
ronny, it would just be annoying for end users and they would switch to some browser that was simpler

[03:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
You mean like an icon that was end-user visible? Since that would show up on >90% of web sites people wouldn't really associate it with badness in the site

[03:56:03.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, really? that's not in my cache list, hmm

[03:56:04.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I haven't diffed in a recent days, though

[03:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
ronny: based on studies we've done looking at literally billions of pages on the Web, somewhere in the region of more than 90% of Web sites have at least one error, so users would just see the indicator on most of hte Web and it would lose meaning

[03:57:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, ok

[03:58:00.0000] <ronny>
Hixie: well, one error isnt really stupid, it should be an icon that indicates the error rate, ie the more errors, the more incappable is the site-creator

[03:58:01.0000] <annevk>
seems rather rude to me

[03:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
ronny: there are hundreds of errors on common sites like cnn.com, i don't think most users care and i doubt cnn.com cares whether a browser says they're any good or not

[03:59:01.0000] <ronny>
annevk: thats the point, 1 error is most likely just overlooking something, but when it goes into the hundreds its bah

[03:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
ronny: but feel free to ask browser vendors to do it :-) (i hear iCab does it, you might want to use that)

[04:00:00.0000] <annevk>
ronny, doesn't mean we should bother end users with silly icons

[04:00:01.0000] <ronny>
annevk: well, how else would one spread awareness?

[04:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
ronny: If the browser displays "500 errors" (or whatever) on cnn.com it makes the browser, nt the site look worse

[04:01:01.0000] <takkaria>
someone needs to tell John Foliot to stop the +1 posts

[04:01:02.0000] <annevk>
ronny, education, advocatism, Web Standards Project, etc.

[04:01:03.0000] <jgraham>
ronny: Why do you care about spreading awareness?

[04:01:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think browser developer tools should include built-in support for validation

[04:01:05.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: +1

[04:02:00.0000] <ronny>
annevk: that doesnt make normal users aware

[04:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it would be cool if Safari's Web Inspector let you validate your CSS and HTML

[04:02:02.0000] <annevk>
ronny, my mom will never care

[04:02:03.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe even lint your JavaScript using someone's tool

[04:02:04.0000] <GregHouston>
The Opera error console already shows errors for html, as well as an assortment of other things, xml, css, javascript, svg. Plus you can filter them.

[04:02:05.0000] <othermaciej>
normal users don't care and shouldn't have to

[04:02:06.0000] <annevk>
ronny, normal users shouldn't be bothered with mistakes of others, would just annoy them

[04:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
imagine if your television pointed out every continuity error or instance of poor writing in the TV shows you watch

[04:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that would be pretty annoying

[04:03:02.0000] <othermaciej>
most of us here are Web technology geeks and care about things like content conformance and what the errors are

[04:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but normal people just don't care

[04:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
any more than we care to hear about awkward camera angles or bad lighting when watching tv

[04:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or poor quality paper or ink when reading a magazine

[04:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me points to the bookmarklets on http://about.validator.nu

[04:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
most people use the Web for the content, not the technical details of the medium

[04:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and we have to be humble enough to realize that

[04:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to draw a more technical analogy, what if your iPhone or Mac or PC or whatever told you about every compiler warning each time you launch an app

[04:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
when I run Firefox I don't really care that "warning: enumeration value ‘LIR64’ not handled in switch"

[04:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would guess you do not either

[04:07:02.0000] <GregHouston>
If I had to click through error messages for every fault in my home I would never make it through the front door.

[04:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
even I as a well versed C++ hacker would have no idea what to do with the knowledge that on line 1050, "warning: pointer targets in passing argument 2 of ‘strcmp’ differ in signedness"

[04:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(these are real error messages from building the JS parts of Gecko, btw, and I am sure they are useful to the developers of Gecko, but would not be to a Firefox user)

[04:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(but to most normal people html validation errors would sound about as comprehensible as those C++ warnings)

[04:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
sorry for ranting

[04:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
it would be more like your TV reporting every teletext formatting error, every cable programme guide data syntax error, every tuning error

[04:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
it's just such a pet peeve of mine

[04:10:00.0000] <roc>
every time the browser detects a conformance error, the site operator is taxed 1c

[04:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
oh man if I could get a penny for every warning my compiler finds while building mozilla...

[04:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
ronny: As you may have noticed you are not the first person to suggest such a thing :)

[04:11:00.0000] <ronny>
yeah

[04:11:01.0000] <ronny>
well, it should be irelevant what errors there are

[04:11:02.0000] <ronny>
just tell the user the people making the site are incappable of doing it right

[04:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
would you like to be told what native apps on your OS of choice had compiler warnings every time you launch?

[04:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"warning, Adium was written by silly people who left in 52 compiler warnings!"

[04:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(no offense to any Adium developers present and I am sure it is in fact a wonderful piece of software)

[04:12:02.0000] <ronny>
othermaciej: that would be nice, cause im pretty sure that would get fixed

[04:12:03.0000] <Lachy>
Adium certainly is buggy 

[04:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would get whatever OS is doing it uninstalled

[04:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
users hate useless warnings and error messages and such

[04:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
for a lot of people, it just makes them fearful of using the computer

[04:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you should never display an error message to the user when you have successfully recovered and there is no choice the user needs to make

[04:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's human interface design 101

[04:14:02.0000] <ronny>
othermaciej: uh, wouldnt that got vista uninstalled like AGES ago?

[04:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
vista isn't exactly having a roaring success

[04:14:04.0000] <Lachy>
as a real example, I really hate how VLC reports error messages almost every time I watch a DVD with it

[04:14:05.0000] <ronny>
well, its stil around

[04:14:06.0000] <Hixie>
it may in fact be the best example of othermaciej's point yet raised in this discussion

[04:14:07.0000] <jgraham>
Vista displays all he compile time warnings on startup?

[04:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess the security stuff?

[04:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
every time, the errors are meaningless to me, yet there's no way I've found to disable them completely

[04:15:02.0000] <ronny>
hmm, if the error notification is modal, there is something wrong

[04:15:03.0000] <othermaciej>
ronny: I hate to break it to you, but: <http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/130626.asp>

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
<form> is nearly done!

[04:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
getting vista uninstalled is a service many people want to pay for

[04:16:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me actually has no idea what warnings vista does display having almost entirely avoided it

[04:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
right, bed time

[04:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:17:00.0000] <ronny>
othermaciej: well, if those messages are modal dialogs, its done wrong from the beginnings

[04:18:00.0000] <ronny>
it should be more like the "oh, i blocked populs" notifications of firefox that appears, then disappears without much hassle and without blocking anything

[04:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
ronny: Most warnings may as well read "Two Jabberwockys have been froobed". There is no point in displaying that ever

an interesting link from earlier up in the minutes:

http://www.dev-archive.net/articles/xhtml.html#recommendations

[08:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
"even had to disabuse TBL of XHTML as failure canard"

[08:40:03.0000] <takkaria>
someone in the XHTML WG is working on that, and seems to basically recommend not serving XHTML

[08:41:00.0000] <annevk>
hehe, that presenter was me I think, though I believe I was clear on the text/html thing

[08:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
unless you want to use MathML or Ruby, in which case you should use XHTML

[08:43:00.0000] <annevk>
well, not anymore :)

[08:43:01.0000] <takkaria>

also, talks about "XHTML WG"

[08:52:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm somewhat displeased by the HTML WG being referred to as HTML5 WG and the XHTML2 WG as XHTML WG

[09:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
otherwise, the content of the article is refreshingly accurate

[09:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2008Aug/0137.html

[09:12:00.0000] <takkaria>
all the words these RDF people use to talk about things confuse me

[09:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"an obvious next step will be to define HTML+RDFa." -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2008Sep/0028.html

[09:25:00.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: yeah, I saw that. As if they weren't already stepping over the mark. HTML+RDFa is our domain, surely. Not that anyone's interested in it.

[09:26:00.0000] <takkaria>
seems a bit lame to say "we're not using CURIEs since the spec isn't ready, we'll just define it ourselves"

[09:27:00.0000] <annevk>
/me -> away

[10:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
where's the implementation report for XHTML 1.1?

[11:00:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2008/xhtml-m12n-11-implementation.html ?

[11:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: that's for Modularization--not for the XHTML 1.1 language

[11:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: that report doesn't cover implementations of the language in agents

[11:03:02.0000] <webben>
I see.

[11:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: it just says that their schemas worked with three validator engines

[11:04:01.0000] <webben>
Does someone say there is an implementation report?

[11:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: It's a REC and was edited recently

[11:05:00.0000] <webben>
I'm confused, how can an implementation report be a REC?

[11:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: XHTML 1.1 is a REC

[11:05:02.0000] <webben>
oh right

[11:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(unless new editions of old RECs are exempt of the implementation report requirement)

[11:07:00.0000] <webben>
/me doesn't know what requirement that is. I probably dunno enough of the context of what you're asking for to be helpful, so I'll just shut up it. :)

[11:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
"XHTML 1.1 doesn't need an implementation report, it's basically just HTML4 with XML, and both of those are in REC"

[11:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What could go wrong?

[11:47:00.0000] <webben>
heh

[11:48:00.0000] <lbruno>
/me says hi

[11:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is that an actual quote?

[11:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me can't detect sarcasm on this topic

[12:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, in your html5 live dom viewer, I can't figure out what the last parameter of window.parseHtmlDocument() is supposed to do:

[12:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
window.parseHtmlDocument(textarea.value, iframe.contentWindow.document, afterParse, null);

[12:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't look like it's actually used for anything in the function instelf, it just looks like an unused parameter

[12:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: it's an unimplemented error reporting callback

[12:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[12:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: yes, it is unused

[12:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
does this whole function work by parsing the textarea, creating all the nodes using the DOM APIs, and then inserting them into iframe.contentWindow.document?

[12:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
effectively replacing the document.write() call in Hixie's dom viewer?

[12:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm going to try and get both HTML5 and browser parsing integrated into my HTML5 Tools beta, side by side, with a UI to switch between them

[12:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: yes, and after it si done, it calls afterParse()

[13:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What the derivative of \sin^2 3x?

[13:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is sure he's doing something stupid

[13:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm. Calculator online says I'm write and answer in textbook is wrong.

[13:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
I bet it's not 6 sin^2 3x cos 3x

[13:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: So do I :)

[13:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I think 6\sin 3x\cos 3x

[13:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Textbook thinks 6\sin 3x

[13:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maxima agrees with you

[13:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I learnt not to trust textbook given answers I while ago :)

[13:31:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*a

[13:31:04.0000] <Philip`>
Bah, I've forgotten how the chain rule works :-(

[13:31:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: n00b.

[13:32:00.0000] <lbruno>
I should know this too.

[13:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Times by the power, the bracket with the power reduced by one, and the derivative of the content of the bracket

[13:32:02.0000] <lbruno>
/me is just a random passer by

[13:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
s/Times by/Times the/

[13:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
s/the the/the.

[13:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/the the/the/

[13:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, that's not very good typing

[13:33:03.0000] <lbruno>
gsnedders: that's true! I was deriving to cos, as in (sin 3x)^2. 

[13:33:04.0000] <lbruno>
dumb mistaek

[13:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
lbruno: It is (sin 3x)^2

[13:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
lbruno: It's just you need to keep (sin 3x)^1

[13:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
I hated finding derivatives, it never made any sense to me

[13:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me concludes this isn't a good place to ask about maths

[13:35:01.0000] <lbruno>
2 * sin(3x) * cos(3x)?

[13:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
ianloic: No, 3cos3x

[13:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
lbruno: sin nx derives to ncos nx

[13:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me works out where he got stupidly confused

[13:37:00.0000] <lbruno>
butbut... I failed Calculus I and II, don't listen to me anyway

[13:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me uses the excuse that he's only exposed to discrete maths nowadays

[13:37:02.0000] <lbruno>
now I see where the 6* came from

[13:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and if I really need to differentiate, I can use Maxima :-) )

[13:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(This is homework due for last Thursday, BTW)

[13:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:D

[13:38:03.0000] <lbruno>
/me appreciates the refresher

[13:38:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(That was one of the simple ones)

[13:38:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Most of the hard things I can do :P

[13:38:06.0000] <Philip`>
(although that is admittedly slower and more error-prone than calculating it by hand)

[13:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't claim to know anything about A-Level maths, on grounds he isn't doing it

[13:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
so I have no idea what Philip` (once) knew

[13:40:00.0000] <lbruno>
I can only give my warmest encouragement to those who have to know this

[13:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me did that and Further Maths and another three modules just for fun, but has forgotten most of it

[13:40:02.0000] <lbruno>
I wonder what A-level means

[13:40:03.0000] <lbruno>
/me is from .pt

[13:41:00.0000] <lbruno>
s,vel ,vel maths,

[13:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
.pt?

[13:42:00.0000] <lbruno>
Portugal

[13:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ah

[13:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
lbruno: They're the exams (and associated courses) for age ~16-18 (just before university) in sensible parts of the UK

[13:42:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Now integrate sin^2 3x :)

[13:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: No :P

[13:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I always forget how to integrate.

[13:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: It's much more fun than differentiating it :)

[13:43:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: The problem with integration is that in general nothing works. There are a few special cases where you can work things out

[13:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[13:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
(3x-(sin 6x)/2)/2 - easy!

[13:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
Um

[13:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Nope

[13:44:04.0000] <Philip`>
(3x-(sin 6x)/2)/6 - easy!

[13:44:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: wrong

[13:44:06.0000] <Philip`>
That's what Maxima says :-)

[13:44:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: + c :)

[13:44:08.0000] <Philip`>
That's just pointless pedantry :-p

[13:45:00.0000] <lbruno>
Philip`: education here lacks good sense too (generally)

[13:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No, it's a requirement in the marking scheme :P

[13:45:02.0000] <lbruno>
gsnedders: same here. +C is "a very good habit"

[13:46:00.0000] <lbruno>
but then we all look the other way and proceed to ignore it, as it's too much work

[13:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: http://xkcd.com/385/

[13:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: how does Maxima compare to Mathematica?

[13:46:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Also, I forgot about the c)

[13:46:04.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: All I know is it's much cheaper

[13:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
:-)

[13:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I've only done one more subquestion since this started!

[13:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me has a hate/hate relationship with mathematica

[13:47:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: So a 1 relationship with mathematica?

[13:47:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Mathematica has rather dramatic price discrimination going on

[13:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Every time I ever tried to use it, it was because the problem was too hard. Firing up Mathematica only gave me two problems

[13:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Why do you assume hate is non-zero?

[13:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
As a freshman, I was able to afford a student license of mathematica

[13:48:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Because hate is something.

[13:48:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It has to not be zero

[13:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Maybe it's just an arbitrarily-ordered enumeration of emotions, and hate happens to be assigned value 0

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Please note that I attempt to maintain "never found any XML generating software that can't be tricked into outputting non-wellformed XML" status by ignoring any software that can't be tricked, and claiming that's because it's too simple (e.g. doesn't accept enough user input) or just not saying anything and pretending I never saw it

[13:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: :D

[13:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I maintain it by not trying, and assuming it is broken

[13:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Also I often cheat and just find general XSS holes, which can be used to make XML ill-formed but are equally problematic in non-XML pages)

[13:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
((at least in the context of XHTML-outputting web pages))

[13:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: have you tried the new Validator.nu XML serializer yet?

[13:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I haven't

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm. I'm stuck. Again.

[13:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I won't try asking here.

[13:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[13:57:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hey

[13:57:04.0000] <jgraham>
I remember A-level-level maths

[13:59:00.0000] <lbruno>
gsnedders: do try :)

[13:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: (Is it meant to be unbreakable by an API user, rather than just an indirect web user?)

[14:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It's a question of how you prove the derivative of e^{3x}

[14:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(actually, it isn't, but I know what the derivative is, and I want to understand it :P)

[14:00:02.0000] <GregHouston>
Philip: Thanks for pointing out the namespace change with VML last night. It doesn't see to work if the VML is appended to the page though, and thus not with Excanvas or Moocanvas.

[14:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it's not meant to be unbreakable by the seralizer Java API user

[14:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it is meant to be unbreakable by the Validator.nu Web service API user

[14:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the Java API leaves NCNameness and correct nesting to the application for perf reasons

[14:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but it does sanitize character data and attribute values

[14:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and it generates ns declaration for the crazy cases

[14:03:01.0000] <lbruno>
gsnedders: How (or why)  d(e^{ex})/dx == 3 * e^{3x}, IIRC?

[14:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham:  d(e^{3x})/dx == 3 * e^{3x}

[14:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(not e^{ex})

[14:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
 gsnedders: Yeah. What's the question? How do you prove it?

[14:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Yeah (it's my question, the question in the exercise is just what it is)

[14:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: and cutting the output stream by provoking Out Of Memory in a stream write operation does not count

[14:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
df/dx = lim dx->0 (f(x+dx) - f(x))/dx

[14:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
(exp(a(x+dx)) - exp(ax))/dx = exp(ax) * (exp(a dx) - 1) / dx

[14:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ya

[14:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
= exp(ax)((1+a*dx) - 1)/dx in lim dx->0

[14:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
= a*exp(ax)

[14:08:02.0000] <jgraham>
But that's kind of cheating because you need to use the taylor series approximation for exp which is based on the derivative

[14:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
GregHouston: Have you tested whether it works if you use document.namespaces.add(prefix, uri, behaviour) to bind the behaviour?

[14:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I can't really read maths written in text. Meh. :P

[14:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
GregHouston: Actually, you probably mean it doesn't work if the VML content itself is written dynamically, in which case that probably won't affect anything

[14:10:01.0000] <GregHouston>
Yeah, that is what I meant.

[14:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me guesses you could define exp by its taylor series approximation and so circumvent the problem

[14:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I don't quite see where the final = a*exp(ax) comes from

[14:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is probably being silly

[14:12:02.0000] <lbruno>
/me wrote e^{ex} by mistaek. sorry

[14:13:00.0000] <GregHouston>
Philip: in the ticket it says that tagUrn is not set when adding the VML dynamically. I don't know what tagUrn is. Do you know if it is something that can be manually set?

[14:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: (1+a dx)-1 = a dx ; a dx/dx = a

[14:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: It turns out that mathematicians are quite anal http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/DerivativeOfExponentialFunction.html

[14:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Is that unexpected?

[14:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[14:14:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Not at all :)

[14:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me should go home

[14:15:01.0000] <lbruno>
I think I prefer the Wikipedia version. You are not asking why d(e^x)/dx == e^x

[14:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
Wikipedia version?

[14:16:00.0000] <lbruno>
the chain rule

[14:17:00.0000] <lbruno>
i'm not making any sense

[14:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
lbruno: Link?

[14:17:02.0000] <lbruno>
just before this section: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function#Formal_definition

[14:18:00.0000] <lbruno>
I think this is what you're asking about; if not... flames gladly accepted :)

[14:19:00.0000] <lbruno>
s/just before/just above/

[14:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
lbruno: just before is fine

[14:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(so is above)

[14:20:00.0000] <lbruno>
thanks

[14:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
GregHouston: I don't know, but I would assume it can't be set, in the same way that tagName can't be set

[14:21:00.0000] <lbruno>
/me is always doubting if the idioms he uses are correct

[14:21:01.0000] <lbruno>
/me finds writing about himself in the 3rd person quite peculiar

[14:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
lbruno: Using the chain rule is cheating unless you prove the chain rule :)

[14:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me has no idea how to do that

[14:23:00.0000] <lbruno>
jgraham: true, that was on my mind as well!

[14:23:01.0000] <lbruno>
but you've got to believe in something

[14:24:00.0000] <lbruno>
I mean, in some axiom

[14:24:01.0000] <lbruno>
this one looks useful

[14:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I am now sure I'm really being stupid

[14:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me would assume you prove the chain rule by calculating limits, but you probably don't want to prove that calculating limits is valid

[14:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Can \frac{2x^2+6x}{4x^2+12x-9} be simplified?

[14:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Probably not, but you should factorise it first

[14:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How?

[14:34:01.0000] <lbruno>
by finding zeros, I think, and expressing it as (x-<zero1>)(x-<zero2>).

[14:35:00.0000] <lbruno>
.oO(is that what factorise meant?)

[14:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
lbruno: That's what I mean

[14:38:00.0000] <lbruno>
I'm having some seriously silly difficulty to use the Magic Formula on the bottom part of the fraction.

[14:49:00.0000] <lbruno>
this is silly, I be able to do this from muscle memory by now. I sure flunked calculus enough times

[14:49:01.0000] <lbruno>
I cheated

[14:50:00.0000] <lbruno>
I found an online graphing calculator, plotted both parts of the fraction, and saw they didn't share common zeros.

[14:51:00.0000] <lbruno>
so I think the fraction can't be simplified that way.

[14:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=436083

[14:55:00.0000] <lbruno>
/me guesses it's enough OT for now

[14:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
lbruno: you want to be on-topic? why?

[15:00:00.0000] <lbruno>
just that I find a bit peculiar thinking about calculus on #whatwg

[15:00:01.0000] <lbruno>
not complaining, though

[15:00:02.0000] <lbruno>
I sure need the exercise

[15:00:03.0000] <gsnedders>
We discuss everything here :P

[15:00:04.0000] <lbruno>
mathematical and physical :-)

[15:00:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, and other things

[15:01:00.0000] <lbruno>
oy, it's IRC

[15:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me yawns

[15:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is too tired to do this

[15:01:03.0000] <lbruno>
OT is bound to happen anyway

[15:01:04.0000] <lbruno>
it /is/ getting rather late to do math calisthenics

[15:02:00.0000] <lbruno>
gsnedders: why the interest in math?

[15:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
lbruno: I have homework to do :P

[15:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
lbruno: For last Thursday, no less

[15:04:00.0000] <lbruno>
can't say I envy you. homework always seemed to deflate my interest in math

[15:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
lbruno: Love does not envy.

[15:05:01.0000] <lbruno>
?

[15:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[15:05:03.0000] <lbruno>
/me felt a bit of a draft overhead

[15:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is feeling vaguely Biblical

[15:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(1 Corinthians 13)

[15:06:01.0000] <lbruno>
ah.

[15:06:02.0000] <lbruno>
never did get to that part of the bible

[15:06:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Somewhere between 4 and 7, IIRC

[15:06:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has just read random bits

[15:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Quite a lot of random bits, but compared with the size of the Bible, next to nothing

[15:07:01.0000] <lbruno>
true, you can spend a lot of time around that book and read just an insignificant part

[17:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yt?

[17:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, in your live dom viewer script, within the update() function, what's the purpose of using a timeout for this: setTimeout(updateDOM, 100); instead of just calling updateDOM(); directly?

[17:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is that the one that prevents the thing updating at more than 10Hz, to avoid thrashing your CPU if you're typing fast?

[17:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, there's a timeout within the updateInput() function for that purpose

[17:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
this timeout gets called after the parsing has already been done, and updateDOM() just updates the various outputs, such as the innerHTML and DOM tree views

[17:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
so it seems there is little to gain from using a timeout here, at least as far as I can tell

[19:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yt?

[19:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, nevermind

[19:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
I got my local copy of the HTML Tools beta working with both browser based and HTML5 based parsing using hsivonen's parser. Now I just need to implement the UI for switching between them

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: so that any timeouts in onload handlers in the subdocument get processed before showing the dom

[03:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me fishes the draft TAG finding on versioning did more to highlight how CSS has it right

[03:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/fishes/wishes/

[03:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
weird typos

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: unfortunately people on the tag like versioning

[03:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: so they are unlikely to pay too much attention to what are the actual success stories (css, dom) and failures (js, html, xml)

[03:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think I'll take the time to comment anyway

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Comparing CSS and HTML, the big problem with distibuted extensibility in HTML is that instead of an element having a set of properties/attributes on equal footing, one property--the element name--is special

[03:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so an element can't be -webkit-canvas, -moz-canvas, -o-canvasw -ms-canvas and canvas at the same time

[03:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also,the canvasness is less optional than rounded corners

[04:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how thing would be different if the element name was just another boolean attribute

[04:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so that <p> was syntactic sugar for <p="">

[04:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, there's a bug in livedom.validator.nu, it doesn't fire onload events

[04:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://livedom.validator.nu/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cscript%3E%0Afunction%20init()%20{%0A%20%20w(%22init%22)%3B%0A}%3C%2Fscript%3E%0A%3Cbody%20onload%3D%22init()%22%3E

[04:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: yeah, known bug

[04:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[04:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I think putting time into full emulation like that wouldn't be justified by the reason why I made the parser work in GWT

[04:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: however, I want to expand it to cover other purposes, but I can't justify speding time on those things right now

[05:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I may have an easy way to implement it without too much trouble

[05:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
I also have a way to make it dynamically set quirks and standards mode

[05:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, it may only work in Firefox. I'll investigate it more

[07:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, I hate working with IE8. It's painfully slow, incredibly unstable and throwing up bogus security warnings! :-(

[07:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
and every time it crashes, it clears my clipboard! wtf?

[07:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, it's not actually clearing the clipboard, but after it crashes, it has trouble pasting until I recopy.

[07:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
maybe that has something to do with running it in VMWare ThinApp inside VMWare Fusion

[07:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I found and diagnosed a crash bug in IE8. Is anyone here able to file a bug? Here's a test case http://lachy.id.au/dev/2008/ie8b2-crash.html

[07:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Can't you file a bug?

[07:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, I never got given the ability.

[07:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I need to fix the TC, I just realised the pass condition is wrong, and revealed another bug in Firefox

[07:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think I still have invitation codes, if you want one :-)

[07:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
sure

[07:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
this is annoying. Thanks to IE8 continually trying to reopen a crashed page, it gets into a continuous crash and relaunch cycle :-)

[07:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does bug filing access come with some bad NDA stuff?

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's not a real one, like on paper with signatures or anything

[08:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't remember whether there's a checkbox saying "I agree not to tell people about blah blah blah"

[08:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
(As far as I can tell, the aim is just to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, not to keep anything secret)

[08:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me resists the temptation to suggest whatwg⊙wo as the html5 non-accessibility list

[08:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me already resisted

[08:09:00.0000] <takkaria>
does that mean you're done with resisting and are now going to suggest that? :)

[08:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: no, I moved onto some more email

[08:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: According to my textbook, \frac{d\e^{3x}}{dx} = \e^{3x} * 3 per the chain rule — how does the power not decrease?

[08:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't get how you do it through the chain rule

[08:10:03.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: It's true, though

[08:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: d(e^a) -> d(a) * e^a?

[08:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: yeah

[08:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: it says you do that per the chain rule, but that would involve decreasing the power by one

[08:12:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Why?

[08:13:00.0000] <jcranmer>
d [ f(g(x))]/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).

[08:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, (x+y)^a would be d(x+y) * (x+y)^{a-1}

[08:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*a

[08:13:03.0000] <jcranmer>
since d[e^x]/dx = e^x

[08:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But you're not derivating with respect to e

[08:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
True.

[08:14:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me headdesks

[08:14:03.0000] <jcranmer>
d[e^(3x)]/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) = f(g(x))*g'(x)

[08:14:04.0000] <Dashiva>
It's more related to 3^x than x^3

[08:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And ln e = 1, so the log part cancels out

[08:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(or something, been some years since I did this)

[08:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me missed all the teaching on differentiating exponents and logarithms

[08:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That would explain things :)

[08:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[08:33:00.0000] <hdh0>
http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/abrowser ubuntu debrands firefox

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
hdh0: Am I right in understanding that the branded version of Firefox is still available, and abrowser is just an independent package for silly people to choose?

[08:38:00.0000] <hdh0>
yes, firefox-3.0-branding versus abrowser-3.0-branding

[08:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Some people can't handle the truth

[08:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What truth?

[08:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: see about 40 minutes ago

[08:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Wrong. There is no spoon.

[08:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Incidentailly "proving" the chain rule turns out to be not so hard, at least to my satisfaction

[09:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
"I'm Feeling Lucky" is reasonable text for a UI button, but it really doesn't seem appropriate for an API call (http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/images/imageclass.html#Image_im_feeling_lucky)

[09:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why they didn't just call it auto_adjust or something

[10:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmmmm.

[10:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
\pi d-\frac{4000}{d^2} = 0 — solve for d.

[10:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't remember how to do that at all

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Multiply both sides by d^2?

[10:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't think this question should be so complex, and guesses his whole approach for solving it is wrong

[10:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not sure if I'm misreading or misunderstanding, but it seems trivial :-p

[10:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is d a variable, or derivation?

[10:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Variable

[10:16:02.0000] <Dashiva>
looks like a regular quadratic

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Doesn't look like that to me

[10:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Just multiply by d^2, add 4000, divide by pi, cube root, and maybe simplify a bit

[10:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I ought to start my physics homework, regardless of all this damned maths

[10:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Am I missing something obvious?)

[10:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: yes

[10:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: You end up with \frac{d^2+4000}{\pi} = d^3 when you say to take a cube root

[10:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Are you thinking that 0*d^2 = d^2?

[10:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: yes :)

[10:20:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, I thought it was pi/d, my misreading

[10:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hint: 0 != 1

[10:20:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: NO WAI

[10:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Unless I'm mistaken, I guess 0!=1 is true in general for any abstract algebra with more than one element, given the usual definitions of 0 and 1, or something, so it's not just a fluke of integer arithmetic)

[11:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Gandi is going to keep their pricing after beta

[11:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
they seem to have globally the best RAM per euro deal

[11:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dreamhost PS is actually pretty bad in terms of RAM per euro despite the exchange rate of the dollar

[11:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dreamhost PS doesn't even seem to give you root access, so you can't have fun compiling your own kernels and so on

[11:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I haven't had a need to compile the kernel on my server. In general, I don't like becoming an accidental sysadmin

[11:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
That sounds quite sensible :-)

[11:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I compared prices on Xen hosting, and this is what I learned

[11:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds it odd that Dreamhost advertises a $5.95/month rate, which only applies if you pay for ten years in advance, which is almost as long as the HTML5 timetable - who's going to know they're still going to want a web server that far in the future?

[11:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
my current host (kotisivut.com in Finland) has competitive RAM per euro pricing compared to anything except Gandi and Amazon EC2

[11:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Amazon EC2 does not scale down

[11:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Gandi isn't quite ready yet

[11:35:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Bytemark hasn't been able to keep up with Xen-based competition

[11:35:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Dreamhost PS is surprisingly uncompetitive

[11:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
companies in the Netherlands and in the UK have insane prices compared to Finland, France and the US

[11:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so my current host seems very good compared to anything but Gandi

[11:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and Gandi seems almost too good to be true

[11:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, I sent email to Gandi requesting a beta invite

[11:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Have you found anything about differences in reliability and support?

[11:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
no

[11:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but my current host doesn't say anything about CPU shares

[11:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
while Amazon and Gandi say what you get

[11:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh, and Amazon has totally different disk persistence characteristics

[11:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me presumes CPU is harder to advertise since it can be very bursty, whereas RAM can't

[11:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm also surprised that googling for Xen hosting didn't turn up any Swedish or Estonian offerings

[11:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps they don't do business in English or something

[11:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I want to see this area of business evolve into a model where someone own the datacenters and provides Xen paravirtualization and block storage, then someone else provides as open source on top of that App Engine -like automatic scaling so that the system is commodity open source and you can move to a different service provider

[11:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think Amazon SimpleDB and App Engine are services that should be there, but using that high-level software shouldn't lock me in to a particular data center owner

[11:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if there are some savings in Amazon running SimpleDB themselves instead of a third party running CouchDB on top of Amazon EBS and selling that service

[14:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's been over a month since the last standards suck episode

[14:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe they stopped sucking

[14:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
I uploaded the latest copy of the HTML5 Tools http://html5.lachy.id.au/beta/ - this one has both HTML5 and browser parsing in it

[14:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
but there's a bug I cannot figure out with the switching between the 2 modes

[14:30:01.0000] <annevk>
http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%22html%205%22 is also worth tracking

[14:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
lots of people tweeting about one article...

[14:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are they tweeting because of the article, or tweeting because of other people tweeting about the article?

[14:48:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, yeah, the last few are indeed not that useful

[14:48:01.0000] <annevk>
and arguably before that not too much either, but still, it's rather easy to follow

[15:56:00.0000] <tusho>
Why is it an error to explicitly close self-closing tags?

[15:57:00.0000] <tusho>
<link></link>, <input></input> etc

[15:57:01.0000] <annevk>
those are void elements and have a special syntax

[15:57:02.0000] <annevk>
i.e., <link> or <link/>

[15:57:03.0000] <tusho>
annevk: yes, but I don't see why it should be an -error- to close them explicitly

[15:57:04.0000] <tusho>
just optional

[15:58:00.0000] <annevk>
because people would be confused and think they can put stuff between those two tags

[15:58:01.0000] <annevk>
and because <br></br> means <b><br> rather than <br>

[15:58:02.0000] <annevk>
means <br><br>, sorry

[15:58:03.0000] <tusho>
annevk: it's just that i programmatically generate html and it's a lot easier to treat all tags equally

[15:59:00.0000] <nessy>
is that really the case? I don't seem to remember that being the general xml rule

[15:59:01.0000] <annevk>
nessy, it's the HTML rule :)

[16:00:00.0000] <annevk>
tusho, keeping a set around and doing a simple if x in set is not an option?

[16:00:01.0000] <tusho>
annevk: well, it is, but still :\

[16:00:02.0000] <nessy>
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-starttags <- has the <br</br> example

[16:01:00.0000] <nessy>
I think in this case we should stick with the general xml rule - this is totally non-intuitive and confusing

[16:01:01.0000] <annevk>
nessy, tusho, http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3Cbr%3E%3C%2Fbr%3E

[16:01:02.0000] <nessy>
it's also not the way it works in HTML4

[16:02:00.0000] <annevk>
nessy, in HTML4 <link></link> is an error too

[16:02:01.0000] <nessy>
really? 

[16:02:02.0000] <annevk>
yes

[16:02:03.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#h-12.3 "Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden"

[16:03:00.0000] <annevk>
HTML4 does not even allow <link/>

[16:06:00.0000] <nessy>
glad browsers are not that anal :)

[16:06:01.0000] <nessy>
I guess then it's a tradition

[16:09:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, the methods are still on HTMLFormElement?


2008-09-15
[22:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: the methods on HTMLFormElement are different, that's one reason i got rid of the others

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me does some cleanup in the comment section at the bottom of the spec

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
it was getting out of hands

[00:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's 2000 lines of nots there

[00:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
notes, even

[01:42:00.0000] <hendry>
what is the right content type for javascript? i've seen application/x-javascript (apache) application/javascript (somewhere) text/javascript (most common)

[01:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: application/x-javascript on the HTTP layer and text/javascript on the HTML layer

[01:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
use text/javascript

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: bjoern registered the types, so there are actual non x- types that one can use now

[01:45:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, oops, guess I should actually check WF2 first before making assumptions

[01:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do they work without problems?

[01:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
text/javascript is the only type i know that reliably works without problems

[01:46:00.0000] <annevk>
except in SVG

[01:46:01.0000] <annevk>
(server side types are ignored for <script>, fwiw)

[01:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: does SVG work without an explicit type

[01:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on the HTML side, the type is useless

[01:48:01.0000] <annevk>
I think it does on the SVG side, but I'm not completely sure

[01:49:00.0000] <annevk>

[01:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does this mean the funding structure now yields different incentives?

[01:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what does this mean to WS-*?

the mobile webs?

[01:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the Web?

[01:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
christ, the mission is even vaguer than the w3c's

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm amused that the wf's faq's answers are so vague and talking-point-y, given that they could pick the questions

[02:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so is the W3C transforming into this foundation or is this something that will be separate from the W3C?

[02:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tries to continue to read the FAQ

[02:01:01.0000] <annevk>
I believe it is a separate entity

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
but the FAQ indeed doesn't say much

[02:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
OK. I got the wrong idea from the personnel overlap then

[02:02:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's unclear what the purpose is

[02:02:03.0000] <othermaciej>
besides to collect donations

[02:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.webfoundation.org/about/concept2008

[02:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there used to be a WebFoundation.framework in the early days of WebKit development

[02:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me finally finds "It was preferable not to disturb the W3C ecosystem for building consensus around Web standards. "

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it might have been a good idea to put the question about the relationship with the W3C at the top...

[02:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm now less excited than I was 10 minutes ago

[02:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Tim is becoming quite the nonprofit entrepreneur

[02:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: are you not annotating changes to WF2 compared to what Opera implemented?

[02:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i haven't tested what opera does very carefully

[02:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
but mostly the only changes are cutting stuff out

[02:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[02:32:02.0000] <annevk>
it would be nice if you kept a small file somewhere that lists the changes

[02:32:03.0000] <annevk>
I can figure them out for myself, but it would make things easier

[02:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
does anyone have a list of the changes so far?

[02:35:01.0000] <annevk>
no XML form submission, repetition templates, form="" takes a single ID

[02:35:02.0000] <annevk>
you might have dropped external files for <datalist> and <select>

[02:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm basically just treating wf2 as part of html4 and using the same approach i do normally, btw, which is why i haven't really considered "changes" from wf2)

[02:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
are all html5lib users on this channel using lxml.etree as the tree impl?

[02:36:02.0000] <annevk>
(for a few features it's not really clear)

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I guess that's fair enough, WF2 was pretty big

[02:37:01.0000] <annevk>
(in terms of features)

[02:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I do, usually

[02:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/notes has a brief list

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i'll try to keep it updated, but remind me occasionally

[02:40:01.0000] <annevk>
thx

[02:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm wondering if I should distinguish methods by name and not only by signature 

[02:40:03.0000] <hsivonen>
that would be ugly in Java

[02:40:04.0000] <hsivonen>
but it seems it would facilitate subclassing in Jython

[02:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I am

[02:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: what did you do about tree builders under Jython? would you have wanted an elementtree tree builder/

[02:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[02:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Re: 2022: Wine took 15 years to go to 1.0

[02:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: My Jython code has no chance of ever running under CPython, so I don't care about having compatible interfaces; but I haven't written very much at all, and have only used SAX so far

[02:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
(And I have no desire to run my CPython code under Jython)

[02:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: re: your blog entry with comments disabled: I've been thinking about blogging about the new concept of a REC not being particularly useful

[02:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: what's the point of getting the particular feature set of CSS 2.1 to REC as one document when by the time it is a REC, both authors and implementations will be doing CSS 2.1 plus some CSS3 bits

[02:54:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, yeah, agreed, let me know when you post it and I'll add a link

[02:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems to me that maturity should be tracked per-feature or something

[02:55:00.0000] <annevk>
that's what the HTML5 annotation system does

[02:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(having a lot of tiny specs doesn't really work with the intertwingliness)

[02:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: right

[03:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
haha:

[03:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
“I’m really looking forward to the work we’re starting to do to ramp up building a test suite in the HTML Working Group,” says Microsoft Internet Explorer platform architect and WHAT WG co-chair Chris Wilson in an e-mail.

[03:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
-- http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/How_HTML_5_Is_Already_Changing_the_Web

[03:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
(laughing at "WHAT WG co-chair")

[03:12:00.0000] <roc_>
be nice

[03:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
to whom?

[03:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wasn't laughing at chris, i was laughing at the confusion we've managed to cause around the html5 process

[03:13:01.0000] <roc_>
oh righg

[03:13:02.0000] <roc_>
that passed me by

[03:31:00.0000] <takkaria>
that article is pretty impressively misleading :)

[03:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Their comment-truncating system is really very irritating

[03:41:00.0000] <takkaria>
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7613201.stm -- hmm

[03:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so what kind of certificate will foxnews.com get?

[03:48:00.0000] <roc_>
yeah, that way is perilous

[03:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
It doesn't sound like you'd get a certificate in that way - '"I'm not a fan of giving a website a simple number like an IQ rating because like people they can vary in all kinds of different ways," he said. "So I'd be interested in different organisations labelling websites in different ways".'

[04:00:00.0000] <roc_>
isn't that PICS all over again?

[04:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe you would choose a friend's RDF feed of site-trustworthiness scores and it would transitively compute the trustworthiness of the whole web on your own computer, so you can choose whose prejudices to be exposed to

[04:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc_: Hmm, I assumed it meant organisations labelling other people's websites, not their own

[04:01:01.0000] <roc_>
I thought PICS let organisations label other people's websites

[04:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[04:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wish Tim could be proud of the beautiful chaos of the human-readable Web he created

[04:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and stop chasing pipe dreams of a non-useless machine-readable Web

[04:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmph, HTML5 doesn't acknowledge the cabal any more :-(

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
wow, you guys look at the diffs closely

[04:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was trying to smuggle that change in :-P

[04:05:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, "XXX * find object at (x,y)" is in http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/

[04:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
will any cabal members publicly reveal themselves enough to object?

[04:05:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, Pillar and Hedral are your cats?

[04:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
(the cabal it used to acknowledge wasn't the one that people thought it was, and has been disbanded for years, so i figured i should drop it)

[04:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: what's the status of cssom-view?

[04:06:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, closer to REC than HTML5 :p

[04:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
(yes, Miss Cat Adorable Pillar and Sir Cat Hedral)

[04:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: no new features? :-)

[04:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't realise this stuff was that interoperable

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk>
it has a few new features that are not shipping yet

[04:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you knighted your cat?

[04:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
did you give him the accolate with a catnip chew toy?

[04:08:02.0000] <othermaciej>
*accolade

[04:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(dammit)

[04:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: q.v. ts elliot

[04:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: so what's your trick for being nearer to REC? :-)

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
less features ;)

[04:13:01.0000] <annevk>
we'll see I guess :)

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[04:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that HTML5 allows <ul></ul>, whereas HTML4 didn't (and requires at least one <li>)

[04:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
which solves a problem I once had when doing templated HTML generation with possibly-zero-length lists, which is nice

[04:19:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: How do UA's apply default style to the empty ul?

[04:19:01.0000] <virtuelv>
s/'s/s/

[04:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: No idea

[04:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: probably just 1em top-and-bottom collapsed margin

[04:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love how much press we've been getting just because of the 2022 date

[04:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's awesome

[04:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think this is only the second most amount of press we've gotten, after the checkin where i changed the requirement of ogg support for a note that said we needed a common codec

[04:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML5 won't support Ogg until 2022!

[04:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
by 2022 it'll probably require h.264!

[04:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: not so awesome if it makes people want HTML4+foo validation instead of HTML5 validation

[04:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
why would it make people want foo?

[04:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I like the counter-article of "HTML5 is improving the Web already"

[04:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
the comments on most of these articles is pretty balanced

[04:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the body of most of them, despite the sensationalist titles, is pretty fair too

[04:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: assume foo has the value ARIA

[04:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: then assume you are WordPress with Transitional templates and lots of talk about standards compliance

[04:28:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, fwiw, the XHTML2 and Froms WGs consider XHTML2 + XForms to be suitable for Web applications

[04:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: then you want to add some ARIA stuff

[04:28:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what do you do about validation

[04:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i'm sure they do

[04:28:05.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I'm not sure if the HTML 5 draft should make judgements about that

[04:28:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: should authors have to choose between either having ARIA and <video> or having border=0

[04:28:07.0000] <othermaciej>
"Valid XHTML 1.0!"

[04:28:08.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[04:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is what WordPress seems to want

[04:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: how me a real time strategy game written in xhtml2+xforms whose author says that xhtml2+xforms was a language that was satisfactorily designed for that purpose and i'll change the text

[04:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: well, XHTML 1.0 and HTML 4.01 are pretty much the same thing for my purposes

[04:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: (or, if the xhtml2 and xforms wgs are willing to provide alternative text for those sections that is still accurate, i'll change it to that -- we're still waiting for them to come back with text for the xhtml 1.1 section)

[04:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am just saying, their idea of standards compliance is already broken

[04:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: is this hypothetical or has it happened?

[04:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i haven't seen people asking for aria validation on any of these articles

[04:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: and wordpress doesn't seem complicated enough to warrant needing aria

[04:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I have had a question about validating ARIA in the context of WP specifically

[04:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I have had an inquiry about HTML4+ARIA validation

[04:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I get bug reports about HTML4 support

[04:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and I've gotten a non-ARIA inquiry about maintenance/development of the HTML 4 side

[04:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I wish the practical answer I could give was "Use HTML5 validation"

[04:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
why isn't that a practical answer? i mean, other than the fact that html5 is still in flux

[04:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: border=0, cellspacing=0, headers=foo, language=JavaScript

[04:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
why isn't my proposal for those satifactory?

[04:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
satisfactory even

[04:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
(also, i thought headers=foo was resolved, what about it is a problem?)

[04:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: that seems more about specific migration tax issues (possibly fixable) than about HTML5 not being done for a while

[04:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do you mean saying that the document is non-conforming but collapsing unimportant errors?

[04:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[04:35:04.0000] <hsivonen>
If stuff is unimportant, why say anything?

[04:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
why develop more UI for stuff that is less important?

[04:36:01.0000] <annevk>
because people editing the document later might think it is significant

[04:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
because it still wastes bytes, and because if you're not transitioning from a legacy, it's valuable to not have it as it eases maintenance

[04:36:03.0000] <annevk>
and might try tweaking it, etc.

[04:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. it _is_ important

[04:36:05.0000] <Hixie>
just not interesting in certain cases (namely, editing legacy documents)

[04:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
might this be something that is better classed as a warning rather than a conformance failure?

[04:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
what is the philosophy behind what kind of arguable errors make a document non-conforming?

[04:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: not sure what that would mean. html5 either allows things or doesn't.

[04:37:03.0000] <Philip`>
I don't know about RTSs, but HTML5 is not satisfactorily designed for writing FPSs :-(

[04:37:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: perhaps. but in principle, I can't do that without forking the conformance definition

[04:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean you get a diagnostic without a conformance failure

[04:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, I know about RTSs, but not about ones written in HTML)

[04:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i don't think it is a good idea to make effect-free attributes conforming.

[04:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
in other words, if the primary reason to disallow "border=0" is wasted bytes in non-legacy documents but it makes validating legacy documents needlessly painful, then disallowing it seems on net unhelpful

[04:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yup, there are lots of things that html5 can't do yet :-)

[04:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would point out that /> is effect-free in HTML

[04:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you already make effect-free stuff conforming

[04:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
as is the xhtml namespace talisman

[04:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me doesn't like those either

[04:39:05.0000] <hsivonen>
type=text/css

[04:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
we need type=""

[04:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would say effect-free things should be a conformance failure if they are more likely to be an error on the part of the author than to be legacy migration stuff or otherwise present for reasonable reasons

[04:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
making type="text/css" invalid would make maintenance more complicated

[04:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(granting arguendo that XML/HTML chameleon document is a reasonable reason)

[04:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if i write a new document, i shouldn't be using border=0 and shouldn't be allowed to do so

[04:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and thus it should be an error

[04:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: how realistic is it that there will ever be a style language other than CSS?

[04:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but if I have an existing HTML4 document that uses it, should I have to rewrite it if I want to move to HTML5?

[04:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: having all these attributes around is a net loss, because there are far more new documents than old

[04:41:04.0000] <othermaciej>
isn't that basically the same as the XHTML migration story, though not as severe?

[04:41:05.0000] <othermaciej>
a warning that doesn't break conformance would serve the purpose of discouragement just as well

[04:41:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: during the transition period, there are definitely more old documents

[04:41:07.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if you have an HTML4 Transitional document, you should have Transitioned already

[04:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: after all, HTML4 Transitional has been known as Transitional for over 10 years

[04:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's not about 10 years

[04:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: we'll never get out of the transition period if we don't stop allowing it

[04:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
perhaps it should have been called HTML4 Non-Fascist

[04:42:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: IE is still here

[04:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
making things a conformance error to encourage authors to save a few bytes seems like attacking a flea with a nuclear warhead

[04:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why you think it should be an error if the user types <p asdls=""> but not if the u

[04:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean, yes, it is better to save a few bytes by avoiding things that have no effect

[04:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
er

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I should point out that I also have a serious feature request for alerting people if they are saving bytes by omitting tags

[04:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but it's not the same as a syntax error

[04:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why you think it should be an error if the author types <p asdls=""> but not if the author types <img border=0>

[04:44:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: because asdls hasn't existed historically but border has

[04:44:04.0000] <annevk>
because asdis might mean something in the future, border=0 will always do the same due to legacy reasons

[04:44:05.0000] <othermaciej>
asdls="" is unlikely to exist in many existing documents, and certainly in none that care about validation

[04:44:06.0000] <Hixie>
border=0 has been deprecated for over a decade

[04:44:07.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and border is still needed for IE and Gecko

[04:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
and isn't needed anywhere

[04:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and asdls="" is more likely to be a typo or other mistake than intentional

[04:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the decade doesn't matter as long as IE and Gecko do what they do

[04:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
while border=0 is far more likely to be legacy than error

[04:45:04.0000] <annevk>
img { border:none } solves that though

[04:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
img { border: none; } has been supported in IE since at least IE4

[04:45:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you can start counting once both IE and Gecko have purged the default border

[04:45:07.0000] <Hixie>
and has been supported in Gecko since around M6 if not before

[04:45:08.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: not copy/paste friendly

[04:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh please

[04:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
<img style="border:none">

[04:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: copy/paste is a real use case

[04:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: c.f. random badges

[04:46:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: that's along the lines of what CC does

[04:46:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: not really an improvement

[04:46:06.0000] <Hixie>
as Philip` points out, if copy/paste is THAT important to these authors but they can't add one line to their CSS, they can use style=""

[04:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
but even that is dumb

[04:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is that an improvement?

[04:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: of the order of magnitude that I should bother countless of people about it?

[04:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
what they SHOULD be doing is making the badges have whatever semantics they want and then style the markup using CSS to get whatever look they want

[04:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
<style> isn't reader-friendly either - you can see an <img> when reading the page source, but you have no idea what's causing it to have no border, and it's pretty hard to work backwards to find the relevant selector

[04:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
is replacing border=0 with style="border:none" a useful way to spend one's time when upgrading to HTML5?

[04:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
html4 deprecated these misfeatures literally a decade ago, we're not doing anyone a favour by coddling them another 20 years

[04:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders when someone will tie 'view source' into a Firebug-like tool

[04:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
(assuming they haven't already)

[04:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: no, which is why i think that all these error messages should be collapsed into one message of the ilk of "well you aren't compliant, but the only problems you have left are with old deprecated markup. More details..."

[04:49:03.0000] <othermaciej>
your desire to make these conformance errors seems to be based on a moralistic impulse against them rather than practical benefit for authors or users

[04:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you know as well as I that "you aren't compliant" is not a state that anyone who cares about validation in the first place will want to stop at

[04:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if that's the output, they will waste a bunch of time or stop caring about the validator

[04:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(or both)

[04:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
the practical benefits are improved maintainability, improved authoring skill and understanding, and cleaner markup going forward

[04:50:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: right, which is why it's pointless to develop UI for that

[04:50:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: isn't that the same arguments used for removing <b> and <i>?

[04:50:06.0000] <othermaciej>
"cleaner markup going forward"

[04:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"we have to fix all this broken stuff on the Web"

[04:51:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, <b> and <i> are needed because they don't have replacements

[04:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is it the validator's job to tell people how they can make their stuff more maintainable before they know they want it?

[04:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
i have removed <b> and <i>, in the form they had in html4

[04:51:04.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: <span style='font-style: italic;'>

[04:51:05.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: <span style="font-weight: bold">

[04:51:06.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: <strong>, <em>

[04:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: if <img style='border: 0'> is a replacement

[04:52:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, ouch

[04:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but of course, that cure is worse than the alleged disease

[04:52:03.0000] <annevk>
<i> can be used for ship names and things typically rendered italic

[04:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: sure

[04:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that's pretty much all a validator does

[04:52:06.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that, and point out errors the author did know about but missed when editing the document

[04:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I thought the job of a validator was closer to a spell checker than to a prescriptive grammarian

[04:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: word processors have both

[04:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"(machine-checkably) nonconforming" should be a question of syntax, not style

[04:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me would like it if the validator acted like a spell-checker and gave you a list of suggested replacements and you could click on them to apply that replacement

[04:54:02.0000] <annevk>
I think I agree that finally removing a bunch of these attributes is a good thing

[04:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
style is a matter of taste and therefore many tools could have different approaches

[04:54:04.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, did people complain about them?

[04:54:05.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, or are you just worried by survey figures?

[04:55:00.0000] <annevk>
s/just//

[04:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: people are asking me to put more effort into the HTML4 code so that authors wouldn't need to make the jump to validating as HTML5

[04:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm all for helping with this transition period, but i won't help with the transition period at the cost of not transitioning at all

[04:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
this means we can't do what html4 did (we know it doesn't work)

[04:56:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, do you have more detailed information than that?

[04:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm OK with killing <font face>, axis='' and <basefont>

[04:56:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: no

[04:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: what happens if you only support HTML4 Strict?

[04:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: this is like the usual WHATWG requirement problem: people want stuff without specifying exactly why

[04:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
what would happen, even

[04:57:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I don't know.

[04:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
might be worth trying to implement HTML4 Transitional as just saying "Your document is not valid HTML4 Strict, because it uses features only available in the deprecated Transitional syntax." or some such

[04:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
instead of "Valid HTML4 Transitional"

[04:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, i'm open to ideas other than making these things fully conforming

[04:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the purpose of the HTML 4 features of Validator.nu is to act as a gateway drug for the service--not to tell people to go back to DTD-based validator

[05:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: one possibility is to make them conditionally non-conforming with the condition being non-machine-checkable :-)

[05:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: as with layout tables :-)

[05:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
And no, I don't have a good suggestion.

[05:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but I don't like the way things are now drafted

[05:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are lots of things i don't like in html5

[05:02:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, but maybe we can figure it out from the documents they want to use HTML4 validation for?

[05:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
the /> talisman for instance

[05:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: do you mean logging everything and trying to guess stuff?

[05:02:04.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I was hoping they would give examples of things that don't work

[05:03:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, and if that's the case, doing what Hixie suggested for HTML4 Transitional might not be so bad

[05:03:01.0000] <annevk>
(and XHTML1 Transitional for that matter)

[05:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: one problem is that people stick to HTML 4 because HTML5 is not 'ready'

[05:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
to be honest i'm not convinced that most of the pages that use these attributes only use them in their default state

[05:03:04.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I'm myself telling people not to upgrade to HTML5 doctype just yet

[05:04:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, right, that seems ok

[05:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
and if people use these attributes in non-default states, they'll have to do some edits anyway

[05:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
at which point, doing the rest isn't that much of a cost

[05:04:03.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I do encourage people to play with it and say that the HTML5 DOCTYPE just works, but overall waiting a little bit longer is safer

[05:04:04.0000] <hsivonen>
but once Firefox 3.1 ships with <video>, we need a better story than "don't validate because HTML5 is not ready"

[05:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and I don't know how to do that and avoid an Atom 0.3-like fiasco

[05:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
(and it's a cost i'd be willing to risk forcing people to take, given the benefits long-term)

[05:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the whole point of border=0 is using it in a non-default state

[05:06:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, Atom 0.3 fiasco won't happen given how we take into account implementations

[05:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: same for cellspacing and cellpadding

[05:06:02.0000] <annevk>
cellpading is not necessary

[05:06:03.0000] <hsivonen>
recommending HTML5 would be so much safer if there were two browsers out there with the parsing algorithm implemented

[05:07:00.0000] <annevk>
only cellspacing lacks the CSS equivalent in IE, iirc

[05:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or even just one

[05:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: when would you ever want to specify cellspacing and cellpadding on a data table?

[05:08:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, the conforming syntax does not depend much on a conforming parser...

[05:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you want the cell borders to touch each other but not text

[05:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: anyway, layout tables are a cowpath if there ever was one

[05:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
use border-collapse: collapse, you'll get much better control

[05:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
we don't want to pave cowpaths that go off a cliff

[05:09:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: does it work in IE?

[05:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me loads wmware

[05:09:05.0000] <Hixie>
vmware

[05:09:06.0000] <Hixie>
my typing tonight sucks, i should go to bed soon :-)

[05:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so far, evidence suggests that layout tables are further away from the cliff than e.g. CSS positioning

[05:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well the csswg needs to get its act together, but that's a separate story

[05:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
css layout tables are fine, and even work in IE now

[05:10:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: there's no point in poking authors about it until the CSS WG and IE have their "act together"

[05:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
IE8 will be out before html5 is ready for authors to use in any serious way

[05:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do they work in the oldest IE that Gmail still supports?

[05:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and yes, IE supports border-collapse)

[05:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: gmail only supported one version of IE until very recently where we added IE6 support, so gmail might not be the best example

[05:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: my point is that there's demand for ARIA validation today and for <video> validation RSN

[05:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: my point is that IE6 isn't properly dead if Gmail supports it

[05:14:00.0000] <annevk>
I have a hard time believing those features will be less successful because border=0 does not validate

[05:14:01.0000] <annevk>
<canvas> was successful and border=0 did not validate either

[05:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
if there really is demand, we shoudl leverage that demand to get people to move off border=0 and co

[05:14:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: Validator.nu is at risk of being less successful

[05:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: of course people will pick <video> over validation

[05:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
but frankly, i doubt <video> will be any more used than <canvas> in the near (12-18 months) term

[05:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: but they shouldn't have to abandon QA tools in order to use <video> or <canvas> or ARIA

[05:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
if people are using the validator as a QA tool, then a collapsed set of error messages for deprecated attributes would be fine

[05:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought we were assuming that people using the validator were people who wanted to be perfectly valid always

[05:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: no, I'm assuming they are people who want to find typos without the typos getting lost in noise

[05:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
collapsing all the messages into one removes all the noise and places it separately from the typos

[05:18:00.0000] <annevk>
Is it really hard to collapse the messages? It might at least be worth trying

[05:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: it's not trivial. I'd rather do only non-trivial stuff I believe in

[05:19:01.0000] <roc_>
What are we doing wrong with table borders?

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc_: image borders

[05:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
roc_: there's a default border on linked images

[05:20:02.0000] <roc_>
oh

[05:21:00.0000] <roc_>
there's a bug filed, I assume?

[05:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yes

[05:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
looking up the # now

[05:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=452915

[05:21:04.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, wouldn't it be as simple as grouping all attribute error messages for when the attribute name is in legacy-set?

[05:22:00.0000] <roc_>
thanks

[05:22:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/alt.html should test image maps

[05:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: UI is non-trivial

[05:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: the current grouping feature is non-trivial

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: OTOH, if the user isn't expected to be albe to actually toggle stuff in the UI, I might as well send the errors to the bit bucket right away without UI

[05:26:00.0000] <annevk>
if I had a legacy page I would probably want to know that I have them and where they are located

[05:40:00.0000] <aaronlev>
what's the latest thinking about math in html5?

[05:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
the spec says the latest thinking

[05:41:01.0000] <annevk>
that is, MathML is supported as part of the HTML syntax and as part of the HTML parser

[05:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
basically, there is a syntax for mathml in text/html defined, and people are expected to use mathml

[05:41:03.0000] <annevk>
hah

[05:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok bed time

[05:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
The spec also includes <img>, which you can use for maths

[05:55:00.0000] <annevk>
very accessible

[05:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
The spec also includes <img alt>

[05:56:01.0000] <annevk>
yes, but no text syntax for math

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
So use LaTeX :-)

[05:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
(inside the <img alt>)

[05:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
(since that's what you'll be generating the image from anyway)

[05:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: which LaTeX packages to assume?

[05:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Whichever ones your LaTeX-subset to image converter provides

[06:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/LaTeX-subset/(La)TeX-inspired language like Itex/

[06:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't know :-(

[06:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: so you don't expect a speech generator to grok LaTeX?

[06:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It could understand enough of the syntax to assist the user in making sense of the code, e.g. by understanding {} for grouping, and then the human can work out what the symbol and command names mean

[06:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's probably substantially easier than making a speech generator grok MathML

[06:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
and MathML has the disadvantage that sighted readers can't understand the textual source code either

[06:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: MathPlayer's speech rendering seems to work

[06:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
for determining the encoding algorithm, it whitespace around the value of the charset attribute supposed to be ignored? e.g. charset=" ISO=8859=2 "

[06:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
the spec only says "If the attribute's name is "charset", let charset be the attribute's value, interpreted as a character encoding."

[06:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yt?

[06:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#character1

[06:42:01.0000] <takkaria>
suggests that you ignore space characters

[06:43:00.0000] <takkaria>
but maybe that's a sightly liberal interpretation of the spec

[06:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
thanks

[06:45:00.0000] <annevk>
it suggests to ignore more than just space characters, fwiw

[07:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Re: markp's "my precious" tweet: is the Chrome icon Free as in Freedom for use in non-Google builds of Chromium?

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Their SVN repository only contains chrome/app/theme/chromium, which has the blue Chromium logo (instead of the multicoloured Chrome logo), and it doesn't have the chrome/app/theme/google_chrome directory which is used if you compile with GOOGLE_CHROME_BUILD

[07:30:01.0000] <annevk>
did "this week in html5" die?

[07:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
so I assume the idea is that only Chrome should use the Chrome icon, and everyone else should use the Chromium icon

[07:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, is it possible to browse the SVN online somewhere? I can't find it

[07:31:01.0000] <annevk>
sounds exactly the same as in Firefox

[07:31:02.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, http://src.chromium.org/

[07:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: thanks

[07:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
one might argue that losing color and having to use "ium" is less drastic than losing the fox and calling it a weasel :-)

[08:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
I expect the people who might care about this don't currently care about this, since Chrom* is nowhere near being able to run on Linux

[08:02:00.0000] <gavin>
there are non-weasel generic icons available to people who want to distribute non-branded firefox builds

[08:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gavin: that's what I meant by losing the fox [graphic] compared to merely losing color

[08:03:01.0000] <gavin>
oh

[08:04:00.0000] <gavin>
I haven't actually seen the chromium icon

[08:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why Chrome/Chromium bother changing the 'client' string when making requests to pages like http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://www.google.com&client=googlechrome

[08:04:02.0000] <gavin>
is colour really the only difference?

[08:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
gavin: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/app/theme/chromium/product_logo.png?view=markup

[08:04:04.0000] <gavin>
that seems like it might be a bit risky from a TM protection point of view

[08:04:05.0000] <hsivonen>
gavin: seems to be only a color difference

[08:04:06.0000] <gavin>
but IANAL!

[08:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Compare to http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/images/logo_sm.jpg)

[08:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that Safari and WebKit have a color difference

[08:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but I don't know if the WebKit version of the icon is Free

[08:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what does it mean that according to Google, www.google.com has functioned "as an intermediary for the infection of 2 site(s)"?

[08:12:00.0000] <gavin>
heh

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's nice to see <blockquote> being used for indentation again

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also nice is <img ... height=32width=78>

[08:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees that Chrome has unfair favouritism towards Google, by prefetching the DNS for www.google.com when you start the browser

[08:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: is that an explicit call or a side effect of something?

[08:32:01.0000] <gavin>
doesn't google chrome always ping google for something at startup?

[08:32:02.0000] <gavin>
update or omnibox or something like that

[08:32:03.0000] <gavin>
/me doesn't remember the details

[08:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It's at the bottom of http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/browser/net/dns_global.cc

[08:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
gavin: I suppose it does that too, though I think you can switch off the send-everything-you-type-in-the-address-bar-to-Google feature if you want

[08:34:01.0000] <gavin>
yeah,I remember hearing that there was something that wasn'y yet disableable

[08:34:02.0000] <gavin>
but that they were working on making disableable

[08:34:03.0000] <gavin>
I just don't remember what it is

[08:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's the Safe Browsing thing too

[08:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: at least it looks like it's a fallback if there is no overriding config file

[09:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: your exact examples in http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=258 are now WFM, but I can reproduce the problem with an unclosed <i>

[09:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Do you have a suggestion how to fix?

[09:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
in python, if I have an list of strings like ["a", "b", "c"], is there a method that will concatenate them all into a single string?

[09:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
with a separator in between

[09:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I don't know how to fix without either making it a fatal error to reconstruct formatting elements or to be non-conforming and violate the parsing algorithm

[09:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: "separator".join(["a", "b", "c"])

[09:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, thanks

[09:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: is http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=294 now fixed to your satisfaction, or should I vary the message somehow when the tokenizer is in an attribute that takes a URL?

[09:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd rather have a good catch-all message and not vary based on attribute identity

[09:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It doesn't seem to be fixed at all - if I write e.g. <a href="foo.cgi?src=bar&copy=baz"> then it still says just "Error: Entity reference was not terminated by a semicolon." which isn't very friendly

[09:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I haven't fixed it all states

[10:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: is the bug *now* fixed to your satisfaction?

[10:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No - for "<!DOCTYPE html>This page is &copy 2022" it should tell you to write &copy; not &amp;copy

[10:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though for <a href="...&copy=..."> it should suggest the other way around)

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, technically, the bug is only talking about URL attributes, so the brokenness of plain-text "... &copy ..." is not relevant, but I still think it's a brokenness :-p )

[10:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also it seems misleading for it to sound so sure about "Error: & should have been escaped as &amp;." (not saying anything vague like "Probable cause") when I write e.g. "... &lamba; ..." and the real error is not the failure to escape &

[10:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: what about now?

[10:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: On &lamba;, "& did not start a character reference. (& should have been escaped as &amp;.)" should still probably say "probably should"

[10:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
The phrasing of "Named character reference was not terminated by a semicolon. (Or & should have been escaped as &amp;.)" sounds odd, but otherwise I think everything seems possibly reasonable :-)

[10:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: what would you suggest

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Would it be hard to make it say something like "Character reference did not end with semicolon. (Should have been written as `&copy;` (©) or `&amp;copy`)"?

[10:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
(where it extracts the character reference name from the source)

[10:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
extracting it from the source would suck

[10:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but extracting it from the name table might work

[10:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
This is only in cases where it's successfully parsed, so I suppose it can come from the parse representation rather than the source

[11:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Please feel free to ignore me if I'm trying to make this far too complicated :-) )

[12:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Anyone feel like reviewing another follow-up from me about the headers+id thread?

[13:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I've e-mailed it to a bunch of you, now I'm off to watch Fifth Gear. :)

[15:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me yawns

[15:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't like writing a personal statement

[15:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I suck at sounding motivated to do physics

[15:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are you motivated to do physics?

[15:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah.

[15:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
Good - that should make it somewhat easier :-)

[15:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[15:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I still suck at knowing what to write

[15:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I can write stuff that makes me look awesome at comp.sci., but when 1/5th of the places your applying to are comp.sci., that isn't overly relevant

[15:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(the other 4/5th are phys.)

[15:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah i realised a few weeks ago that making the parser rules normative for a validator might be counter-productive

[15:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it might be that we should change the spec to allow validators to do whatever they like to recover once they hit one error in the parser

[15:26:00.0000] <Philip`>

/me sees that they're using the multicoloured Chrome logo

[15:31:00.0000] <hendry>
Philip`: i can't figure out what to run after installing it.

[15:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: I haven't even installed it, so I can't help :-(

[15:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
hendry, on which platform?

[15:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
woah, the icon they've used for the OSX icon is terrible. The resolution is far too low.

[15:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
looks like they've just stretched the 32px windows icon

[15:38:01.0000] <hendry>
Lachy: debian/linux

[15:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
there must be an executable somewhere. It's probably called "chromium" or something like that

[15:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe you have to start it from the command line if there's nothing you can double click to launch

[15:41:00.0000] <hendry>
Lachy: there is http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2860126641/ but I get "cannot execute binary file". I'll try in the morning after I've sobered up.

[15:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
hendry, what's the relevance of the flickr photo?

[15:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me strongly suspects a msipaste

[15:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
the OSX version doesn't integrate well with the system

[15:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh dear, svg 1.2 tiny is back in last call

[15:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, did it drop back from CR, or progress from WD?

[15:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
So there's tiny and basic, who implements full?

[15:46:00.0000] <hendry>
Lachy: oh crap, wrong link. i meant: /opt/cxchromium/support/chromium/drive_c/chromium/chrome.exe /me goes to sleep now

[15:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, that would be the windows executable. I'm guessing you need to use Wine to launch it somehow, though I've no idea how that works

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: progressed from LC, i think

[15:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
Running it under crossover seems like a bad way to get a fair first impression. I guess the animation and scrolling suck less on a native build

[15:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's definitely not good to run on the Mac. It's bad enough being like a windows up, but the integration problems make it largely unusable

[15:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
s/windows up/windows app/

[15:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which integration problems in particular?

[15:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
Expose doesn't work

[15:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
scrolling is bad

[15:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah the scrolling is abysmal. Oh well, I guess that's a wine bug.

[15:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
when you drag tabs off the tab bar, it's quite slow and the transparency is buggered up

[15:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
if I didn't have Windows in a Virtual machine to run it in, it would be ok, but it's not really worth it, especially since I already have webkit available

Firefox seems to have some strange behaviour with document.write in this case:

[19:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
<script>document.write("<\meta charset=UTF-8>");</script> doesn't detect has UTF-8, but

[19:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
<script>document.write("<\meta charset=UTF-8");</script>> does.

[19:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
good times

[19:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
AFAICT, according to the spec, both should be treated as UTF-8, since document.write just injects directly into the input stream

[19:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[19:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
What about <script>unknownfunction("<\meta charset=UTF-8>");</script> ?

[19:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, wait, I read you the wrong way around

[19:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like it only does the charset processing if the meta element is created through the normal non-document.write parser, or something?

[19:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
this works too: <script>document.write("<");</script>meta charset=UTF-8>

[19:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
looks like you can split it anywhere inside the string, and it only fails if the whole element is written with .write()

[19:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
my next challenge is to detect the current encoding the browser is using, using document.write() to output a conflicting encoding, trigger a reparse, and then detect and output a different one :-)

[19:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
i added relative checkin activity to the issues graph

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, coming up with a good description of what a <label> element represents is non-trivial

[01:44:00.0000] <annevk>
<label> represents a form control label

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
So what is the form control in <label>Foo</label> ?

[01:53:00.0000] <annevk>
there's none because it's not associated with any?

[01:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
well then it's not a form control label

[01:54:01.0000] <annevk>
<label> represents a label that is to be associated with a form control

[01:55:00.0000] <annevk>
using either an explicit reference (for="") or indirect (nesting

[01:55:01.0000] <annevk>
)

[01:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
there you're using the name of the element to define the element, which is poor form since it reads badly (repetition) and doesn't help the author who didn't know what "label" meant in the first place :-)

[01:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but the string "label" in the element name is an opaque string and the word "label" in the defining prose has a meaning in English

[01:58:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm, those authors can look at the examples

[01:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: surely it is ok to use the word "title" to define <title>

[01:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
you'll note that i also use another name

[01:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
er, another word

[01:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
namely "name"

[01:58:06.0000] <Hixie>
to define <title>

[01:58:07.0000] <Hixie>
similarly <caption> is defined using the word "title"

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
and <label> using the word "caption"...

[01:59:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe that will confuse authors

[01:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt it. i posit that many authors who are looking up an element definition are looking it up because the name of the element wasn't clear to them, so i try to avoid reusing the name of the element in its definition.

[01:59:03.0000] <annevk>
http://search.twitter.com/search?q=whatwg :)

[02:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if guessing from the name is ok, expect problems with <dialog> and <details>

[02:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
whether it's ok or not, people will do it

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
thankfully for <dialog> and <details>, the problem is mitigated

[02:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
for <dialog> because of the content model, so that authors will usually come across it in the right usage

[02:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
and for <details> because if its default rendering

[02:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah well

[02:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
<input> is next

[02:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
better go to bed!

[02:04:03.0000] <Hixie>

:) nn

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it annoys me that tweets with tiny urls don't show where the URLs lead

[03:09:00.0000] <annevk>
search.twitter has an (expand) function

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can I subscribe to an expanded version of any twitter feed?

[03:14:00.0000] <annevk>
dunno

[03:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
It would be nice if twitter allowed hyperlinks and didn't count the characters in the tag

[03:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
like <a href="http://example.com/my/long/url/">name</a> being 4 characters

[03:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm not sure SMS operators would allow you free bytes like that ;)

[03:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
on the plus side, twitter has helped to create a better market for URL-shortening services

[03:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
How about (revolutionary idea) not applying silly SMS limits to web-based entry?

[03:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm I guess SMS would be a problem

[03:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Does anyone even use Twitter over SMS?)

[03:18:03.0000] <annevk>
I believe so

[03:18:04.0000] <annevk>
not me though

[03:18:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
twitter over SMS doesn't work any more

[03:18:06.0000] <annevk>
oh

[03:18:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
they shut it down temporarily

[03:18:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
many months ago

[03:18:09.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: They still all obscufate the destination though

[03:18:10.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, in all countries?

[03:18:11.0000] <MikeSmith>
temporarily

[03:18:12.0000] <jgraham>
by necessity

[03:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
(the URL shortening services)

[03:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
I thought twitter SMS was still working in Aus

[03:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: don't work for me at least.. but I don't actually use SMS, I use the XMPP thing

[03:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://blog.twitter.com/2008/08/changes-for-some-sms-usersgood-and-bad.html

[03:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I thought they use they same backend for both

[03:20:03.0000] <Lachy>
says they stopped in some European places

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk>
anyway, placing a limit prevents people from writing essays

[03:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wish they would restore Jabber support, that's been gone for ages and I need it

[03:21:02.0000] <annevk>
counting < as four characters and such however is something they should probably stop with now

[03:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is still amazed by the use of the word need in relation to twitter

[03:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: yeah, the Jabber interface is what I had been using, over a bitlbee gateway so that it just shows up in my IRC client

[03:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Twitter wouldn't be Twitter if it didn't limit you to very short messages, but limiting URL length too is just a technical limitation that makes things awkward for readers and writers, rather than a useful social limitation that defines the service

[03:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, does it still work for you?

[03:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: nope

[03:23:03.0000] <Lachy>
what do you use now?

[03:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for posting, I use Vim with a pipe to a python script that posts to both twitter and identi.ca

[03:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for reading, I use the web

[03:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
I think the 140 character limit for twitter is the most annoying thing about twitter

[03:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
I understand why they have the limit for SMS reasons, but even for other clients, they restrict the output, which is totally unnecessary

[03:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I agree with Philip` and annevk about the limit. Yeah, it's arbitrary but having some limit it fundamental to the whole idea of the service

[03:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but they really should have a better way of handling URLs

[03:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but 140 characters isn't enough. They should double it, and the whole SMS system needs to be upgraded to remove the 160 char limit

[03:27:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
they could use their own url-shortener when sending sms

[03:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, SMS sucks massively anyway and should just be abandoned and replaced by SMTP/MIME e-mail

[03:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
SMS is a technology that never should have existed to begin with

[03:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe the danger is that if they started allowing arbitrary-length URLs, they couldn't claim technical reasons for the 140-character limit, and everyone would moan about how restrictive it is, and the Twitter people couldn't say "that's because you don't understand what's good for you, and if we let you write much longer posts then readers would need a longer attention span and the service would collapse"

[03:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
or people would write their messages as URLs

[03:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[03:29:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Alas, you might be onto something

[03:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I started becoming suspicious when I saw they say they count characters and not bytes

[03:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Would that be a problem if they didn't display the URL, only a short text link, and counted the length of the link text (not the URL) towards the 140 character limit?

[03:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, no, SMS is a good thing.  MMS, however, is stupid and should be abandoned everywhere

[03:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
You could still mouse-over the link to read the URL in your browser's status bar, but that's a bit rubbish

[03:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
so I assume people wouldn't do tht

[03:30:05.0000] <Philip`>
s//a/

[03:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: MMS is like circuit-switched 3G video calls: people figure out pretty quickly that the same device does the "same" thing in the best-effort packet-switched mode much more cheaply and well enough

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tries to resist starting his broken record about Skype on EDGE/HSDPA

btw, how's the geolocation stuff going? when should I expect Fennec on N800+GPS to work as a real-time mapping client to Google Maps?

[04:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wow I didn't notice that @headers thing when it first came up

[04:22:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, there's a draft for geolocation but no Working Group to publish it

[04:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in case anyone is curious, I can state for the record that the Decision Policy was specifically designed with the intent of preventing technical decisions from being made in telecons

[04:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
can't tell from latest email if the supposed Chair decision has been withdrawn or not, but it had better be

[04:23:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, I believe some kind of further clarification was forthcoming after more study from the chairs

[04:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I hope the clarification includes "we're sorry for not following the Decision Policy in the charter and will do so in the future"

/me wonders how <script defer> is specced in html5... http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/09/11/delayed-script-execution-in-opera/

[04:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe HTML5 requires you to wait for the document to be loaded on <script defer>, but also includes <script async>

[04:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#script

[04:26:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
how does document.write interact with those?

[04:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you mean if you document.write from a script loaded using one of those mechanisms?

[04:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or if you document.write such a script?

[04:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or if you document.write before or after starting the load, or what?

"A feature of Opera’s “Delayed Script Execution” option is that, even though scripts are deferred, document.write still works correctly. Opera remembers the script’s location in the page and inserts the document.write output appropriately." - is that really true, or does it just reparse the document (and the initial scriptless parse is just to prefetch the scripts and images without blocking)?

[04:28:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
 if you document.write from a script loaded using one of those mechanisms

[04:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me doesn't know exactly how dse works

[04:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm fairly sure I've heard that IE8 does speculative parsing past synchronous scripts, to prefetch the later included scripts)

[04:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but I have no idea which other browsers do similar things)

[04:30:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
like webkit

[04:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
webkit does speculative preload

[04:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but we won't parse or display while blocked on actually running a script

[04:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
doing so would cause bad results unless you reparse after running the script, I expect (which means you couldn't run any further scripts in the speculative rendering, even if inline)

[04:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway I think per html5 spec, <script async> document.write would write to a random place, and <script defer> document.write would clobber the document

[04:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
ah, I see, that page even explains Delayed Script Execution

[04:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit has sort of the equivalent of that feature too, "low-bandiwidth rendering"

[04:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it does a quick render w/o waiting for scripts or styles

[04:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and then reparses for real

[04:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but that's not even compiled in by default

[04:38:00.0000] <annevk>
document.write() would just do what it normally does

[04:38:01.0000] <annevk>
in html5

[04:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
what do you mean "what it normally does"

[04:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
<script async> is a newly invented feature so at least in that case there is no pre-existing "what it normally does"

[04:39:01.0000] <annevk>
it would be the same as executing a script at the point <script async> would be executed

[04:40:00.0000] <annevk>
(that is, document.write() does not suddenly throw or something because it runs from <script async> or <script defer>)

[04:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, but from <script async> I think it would insert characters at a completely unpredictable place in the document

[04:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and thus should never be used from <script async>

[04:41:01.0000] <annevk>
oh, I agree

[04:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think what (some) people want is for document.write to magically write after the point where the <script> tag occurs

[04:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
not realizing that you can't consistently both do that and not block the parser, short of reparsing later

[04:42:00.0000] <annevk>
for the <script src> case you can do some magic

[04:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
seems to me there is no way to get guaranteed identical results without reparsing the rest of the document after the script

[04:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(which is what it sounds like the Opera feature does, though maybe it optimizes some cases where it can prove reparsing is not necessary; I wouldn't know)

[05:05:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: perhaps the spec splitter should put the forms stuff on its own page?

[05:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: the problem I have is that I don't have an S60 app

[05:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: but my point is that Skype from N800 works across the packet data feature of my phone

[05:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: so it's kinda pointless to try to sell the features as circuit switched to me

[05:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[05:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
circuit switched is overrated

[05:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
most innovations in telecom technologies are overrated

some are literally overrated

I've had a video call enabled phone for a year, and I haven't used it for video call even a single time

[06:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"If browsers supported an implementation of SCRIPT DEFER that behaved similar to Opera’s “Delayed Script Execution” feature, we’d all be better off."

[06:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: doesn't Webkit already have something like delayed script execution?

[06:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I remember the Android announcement mentioning something that they had added

[06:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me finds WTF_USE_LOW_BANDWIDTH_DISPLAY

[06:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me finds https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2008-February/003341.html

[06:13:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: check the logs from 2h back :)

[06:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
"-DWTF_USE_LOW_BANDWIDTH_DISPLAY=1 is not so good. The loader in current builds is significantly faster and better at scheduling than those in other mobile browsers so I don't think we need hacks like this."

[06:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: OK

[06:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
I disagree with the conclusion of that delayed script execution article.

[06:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
If people would stop using document.write at all, we'd all be better off

[06:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
besides, innerHTML provides all the benefits of using string manipuation to populate the DOM, without the constraints of document.write

[06:21:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: expecting that is like pissing upwind

[06:21:01.0000] <virtuelv>
futile, and likely to cause a mess

[06:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, I'm not saying we should drop support for it, but encourage authors that want to improve script loading times to avoid it

[06:52:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm. should DOMParser and XMLSerializer be specced in dom core?

[06:54:00.0000] <annevk>
might make sense

[07:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: yes, I believe I mentioned the low bandiwdth display, though I got the name wrong

[07:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: yeah, I just re-read through the channel logs on the webkit-dev e-mail thread

[07:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I think with our speculative pre-parsing and speed in general it is probably not so good even for mobile, but you can certainly get long delays before seeing anything on mobile WebKit browsers/devices that don't use it (like iPhone)

[07:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: what Alp says about displaying a throbber sounds like something worth considering

MobileSafari UI ideas are something I am not really free to discuss publicly but I'll take that comment under advisement

I actually think a throbber or other load notification system is much 

[07:18:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
more effective. When users see unstyled content (HTML without CSS), they

does "WTF" in the WebKit define carry its usual meaning or is WTF a special technical term in WebKit?

[07:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WTF stands for Web Template Framework

[07:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
has a sort of similar layer in our stack to NSPR for Mozilla

[07:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>

[07:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[07:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but among other things it is where platform conditional macros get defined

[07:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(however, if you read some of the code you may choose to take WTF in a somewhat different sense, since it does make very liberal use of C++ templates...)

[07:40:03.0000] <wilhelm>
That would be Widget Test Framework at the Opera HQ. (c;

[07:40:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me assumes the choice of a term that acronymises to "WTF" was not purely accidental

probably not

so if CodeWeavers can get Chromium run on OS X with Wine, they have to have somme solution for multiple processes sharing a window

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does it run multiple OS X processes, or does Wine emulate Win32 processes within a single host process?

[08:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
at least the wine initialization takes a long, long time

[08:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder what it does during all that time

[08:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: there are multiple processes called 'wineloader'

[08:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
Perhaps it connects with rdesktop to an online Windows server that is executing Chrome

[08:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
one process called CrossOver Chromium

[08:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and one wineserver

[08:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps the CrossOver Chromium process runs an X server and the wineloader processes are X11 clients

[10:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: yeah

[10:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I might try putting html5.validator.nu in France while keeping most of my sites in Finland

[10:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but seriously, this virtualized data center thing needs to have better protections for tenant to make counterclaims of legality instead of someone just flipping off a switch

[10:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, I suppose those better protections cost more money

[10:10:00.0000] <annevk>
christ, which version of libxml2 to pick?

[10:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>

annevk: How about the latest of both libxml2 and libxslt

[10:13:00.0000] <annevk>
yes, but platform etc.

[10:14:00.0000] <annevk>
anyway, I found some easy to follow guidelines

[10:16:00.0000] <annevk>
ok, so libxml and libxslt seem to be working out, great

i went to extreme lengths to make it always work deterministically

[10:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: If you had sensible (root) access and a sensible Linux distribution then lxml would be trivial to install :-)

[11:03:00.0000] <annevk>
well, easy_install works now, but now I get a bunch of errors like this "src/lxml/lxml.etree.c: In function `__pyx_pf_4lxml_5etree_14_ParserContext___dealloc__'"

[11:03:01.0000] <annevk>
when trying to easy_install lxml

[11:03:02.0000] <annevk>
and things like "src/lxml/lxml.etree.c:102485: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type"

[11:04:00.0000] <annevk>
import libxml2 and import libxslt both work

[11:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: The "In function ..." line is not the error message - it's just before or after or something

[11:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
Probably the first actual error is the important one, and the rest might just be consequences of that

[11:06:00.0000] <annevk>
k, starts with "src/lxml/lxml.etree.c:150:31: libxml/schematron.h: No such file or directory"

[11:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, that sounds like the problem

[11:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
Where did you install libxml to?

[11:07:00.0000] <annevk>
to $HOME/opt

[11:07:01.0000] <annevk>
Python is in there too

[11:08:00.0000] <annevk>
I have this copy of libxml2: ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libxml2/2.6/libxml2-2.6.16.tar.gz

[11:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
You probably need to somehow tell easy_install (or whatever is doing the compiling of lxml) about that location, else it won't find the installed libraries

[11:12:00.0000] <annevk>
that's not the problem

[11:12:01.0000] <annevk>
my copy of libxml does not have schematron.h

[11:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[11:13:00.0000] <annevk>
at least, in opt/include/libxml2/libxml/ I can't find it

[11:14:00.0000] <annevk>

[11:23:02.0000] <annevk>
maybe both are too old?

[11:24:00.0000] <annevk>
/me copied the URIs from somewhere

[11:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libxml2/2.6/libxml2-2.6.30.tar.bz2 has schematron.h

[11:26:00.0000] <annevk>
thanks, I was just trying to download a newer version

[11:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't sure why that's the latest version there, when he has 2.6.32 installed

[11:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
2.6.16 is four years old

[11:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it seems reasonable for that to not work

[11:31:00.0000] <annevk>
still, it's a minor point release

[11:31:01.0000] <annevk>
oh well, lesson learned

[11:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Heck, 2.7.1 is katest

[11:31:03.0000] <Philip`>
I guess the policy might be that minor point releases can add API, they just can't remove or incompatibly change existing API

/me never had an installed copy of html5lib

[12:11:00.0000] <annevk>
/me assumes it will be ok

[12:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: No. If you do python setup.py install --prefix=~ (might be --home) then it will put it somewhere in your home directory that is also on your sys.path. If you really want to install it somewhere  different, look at the options under python setup.py --help

[12:11:02.0000] <jgraham>
as in it might be python setup.py --home=~

[12:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
but prefix sounds more likely

[12:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
(it is likely to be put under ~/lib/python2.5/)

[12:15:00.0000] <annevk>
python runtests.py within anolis works

[12:15:01.0000] <annevk>
now I need some example Anolis code

[12:18:00.0000] <annevk>
/me finds out that part of Anolis has no documentation

[12:20:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, in generator.py.process(), is **kwargs the commandline arguments you document elsewhere or something?

[12:23:00.0000] <met_>
figure microformat aka html5 figure http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-new/2008-September/001807.html

[12:25:00.0000] <annevk>
it would be better to just use HTML5...

[12:25:01.0000] <annevk>
but then browsers fail on <legend> :/

[12:26:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, if you can give me some sample code to work with that'd be great

[12:26:01.0000] <annevk>
/me off to buy some food

[12:30:00.0000] <met_>
annevk, for todays use it's ok, I wander why mf community doesn't prepare steps for future, like legend here, time instead of abbr there etc.

[12:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me still thinks that <legend> might be a deal breaker for <figure>

[12:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the problem that the figure microformat tries to solve?

[12:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, what's blocking prospective users from upgrading to HTML5?

[12:32:02.0000] <met_>
hsivonen, most probably the same problem as figure in HTML5

[12:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: See http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/file/cf4770338aa0/anolis and the dest arguments in the parser.add_option() calls

[12:35:00.0000] <met_>
hsivonen, users are ok, they can upgrade, but tools designed today shoud be ready for HTML5 already (tools can have long life), I wonder why microformats doesnt' say "this html5 syntax is 100% compatible with our syntax", so the tools can be ready for it

[12:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: yeah, maybe. for <details>, too. i just really really don't want to have to introduce a 12th or 15th or whatever it is element for marking up headers/titles/captions/names

[12:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I know, but practicallity beats purity. There's no point in introducing the elements if no one can use them afterall.

[12:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
met_: I also don't understand the motivation of asking for HTML4+ARIA validation

[12:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(a recent feature request for Validator.nu)

[12:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: yeah. hopefully parsers can be fixed.

[12:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The problem with relying on fixing parsers is that the reptillian part of browser dev's brains which deals with their natural survival instincts tells them that changing parsers can break web compat. and so is bad ;)

[12:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hdh: http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/rev/bf926a2e75ab

[12:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hence parsers seem to have longer regeneration cycles than many aspects of browser code

[12:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hdh: (I think it was you who I said to bully me to do that if I forgot to, but you didn't so it took a while)

[12:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: we're already relying on them changing the parser anyway

[12:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i'm happy to delay <figure> and <details> deployment until after the parser is deployed

[12:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: they're not critical features

[12:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe not critical but <figure> is certianly something that various people have said to me "oh I've wanted that for a long time", so it is a bit annoying to have to go "oh well actually it won't work for the forseeable future because it's not backwards compatible"

[12:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's backwards compatible if people are willing to do tricks like have <span> elements around the place

[12:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
Especially if you've just been talking about how HTML 5 tries to preserve backwards compatibility

[12:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me gives Hixie a hypocrite sticker

[12:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
backwards compatibility doesn't mean everything Just Works

[12:47:02.0000] <hdh>
gsnedders: it was me; thanks

[12:47:03.0000] <gsnedders>
then I run.

[12:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
i mean it's like saying the SQL database stuff "isn't backwards compatible"

[12:47:05.0000] <gsnedders>
It so is!

[12:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, but stuff that is really new features is easier to explain than stuff that is just markup

[12:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[12:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
Also, how can you sprinkle span to get FF to have the <legend> element in the DOM but no <fieldset>?

[12:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
<datalist> is no less of a new feature than <details>

[12:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
FF's <fieldset> thing is a bug and should be fixed regardless of any of this.

[12:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, and can I bully anyone here into giving me comments on my personal statement at short notice?

[12:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I can look this evening. By which I mean "in an hour or two"

[12:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: In an hour or two will do seeming I need to finish it first.

[12:52:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Really, any time in the next 26 hours will do)

[12:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: OK, I can read it then

[12:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok. lunch time. then i'll find something else to delay working on <input>.

[12:54:02.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, yeah, that sort of helps, but not really

[12:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: What else do you want?

[12:57:00.0000] <annevk>
I would like a python API rather than a commandline API

[12:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's basically the same

[12:58:00.0000] <annevk>
ok

[12:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: See generator.fromFile and .fromToFile()

[12:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: They take as keyword args those things

[13:00:00.0000] <annevk>
and how do I specify "those things" from Python?

[13:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
generator.fromFile(StringIO(), lxml_html=True)

[13:01:00.0000] <annevk>
ok, so lxml_html=True, omit_optional_tags=False, ...

[13:01:01.0000] <annevk>
?

[13:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah

[13:01:03.0000] <gsnedders>
w3c_compat_xref_a_placement=True

[13:01:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(HTML 5 needs that)

[13:04:00.0000] <annevk>
my generator file does not include fromFile btw

[13:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Get a later copy

[13:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[13:05:02.0000] <annevk>
grmbl

[13:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/archive/tip.zip — or install mercurial and clone the repo

[13:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me installed Mercurial on Dreamhost, and it seemed to work alright

[13:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but it's easier to not do so)

[13:07:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me seems to have mercurial on DH also

[13:07:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has it on DH too

[13:07:04.0000] <jgraham>
I think I may have just tried my luck with easy_install mercurial

[13:11:00.0000] <annevk>
alright, that's slightly better

[13:12:00.0000] <annevk>
so I use fromFile and serialize the output as document which is then rendered in the browser

[13:12:01.0000] <annevk>
so to prevent xss it should be run on a separate domain

[13:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: No, that doesn't help

[13:13:00.0000] <annevk>
what doesn't help?

[13:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: They can put a URL in it that processes another doc in the spec gen

[13:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Actually, if you use POST, that's irrelevant

[13:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: But didn't you want GET?

[13:13:04.0000] <Philip`>
To prevent XSS, send it as text/plain with content-type-options:nosniff

[13:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How about application/octet+stream?

[13:14:01.0000] <annevk>
why not just use a separate domain?

[13:14:02.0000] <annevk>
i want to see the output the tool generates so i just need to hit refresh

[13:14:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Using POST or GET?

[13:14:04.0000] <annevk>
I don't see how that matters

[13:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: If you use GET, I can use a URL that processes another document within it

[13:15:01.0000] <annevk>
that's not a XSS attack afaict

[13:16:00.0000] <annevk>
though it will probably use POST, as that makes the most sense for this

[13:17:00.0000] <annevk>
actually, ?url=http://www... would be a useful service too

[13:17:01.0000] <annevk>
guess both will be done

[13:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i don't mind, i can do post from wget too iirc

[13:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: uri to "gez's table"?

[13:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Was it you trying to run Anolis on Py2.3?

[13:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[13:23:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Can you get http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/archive/tip.tar.bz2 and try again?

[13:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was just going to wait for anne or someone to set up a web service instead :-)

[13:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I know, but I just want to see if it works on Py2.3 now :)

[13:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
give me a .sh file to run and i'll try it and give you the output

[13:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
include things like wget or whatever i need to fetch the file

[13:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Just running python runtests.py

[13:25:03.0000] <gsnedders>

[13:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>

there's no rush

[13:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
i' deep in wf2 territory right now

[13:28:06.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is listening to Force Ten by Rush from Hold Your Fire

[13:28:07.0000] <gsnedders>
obviously there is.

[13:28:08.0000] <Hixie>
and don't want to do the switchover in the middle of the wf2 work

[13:28:09.0000] <gsnedders>
(bad joke, I know)

[13:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: You never use generators, or the codecs package or anything?

[13:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Generators don't exist at all in 2.3?

[13:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Not afaik

[13:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: They seem to, just not generator expressions. I removed the only one of those, as it made absolutely no difference to perf.

[13:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh they were introduced in 2.3

[13:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Pre-2.3 only has a Python implementation of sets so html5lib may be significantly slower

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
html5lib is too slow anyway :-)

[13:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me blames python

[13:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although clearly it is mainly my fault :)

[13:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: You chose the wrong language!

[13:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
pure python is just a really slow environment

[13:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if mainstream python will get some of the dynamic speedup goodness that js is receiving

[13:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: http://juicystudio.com/wcag/tables/complexdatatable.html

[13:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
i already commented on that table and don't believe that nested headers would help it

[13:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
see the bugzilla bug

[13:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=5822

[13:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
That table has been so overplayed. 

[13:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
If there is one lesson we take from it, it should be taht requiring headers+id for such a simple layout reveals fundamental deisgn flaws

[13:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if there was anything else that he'd been bullied into putting into Anolis 1.0

[13:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
So, if we think it requires headers+id we would be better off fixing the fundamental problems rather than papering over the cracks

[13:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: cross-document cross-references? *puppy eyes*

[13:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Even with puppy eyes, no.

[13:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
bummer

[13:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
see if i put it a <gsnedders> element now! :-P

[13:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
put in, even

[13:44:05.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[13:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: What does that do? Make its content a hopeless romantic?

[13:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
it does nothing!

[13:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[13:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
certainly doesn't add cross-references cross-document, anyway :-P

[13:45:04.0000] <gsnedders>
That's less than the sarcasm end tag does!

[13:45:05.0000] <gsnedders>
That at least makes you take a deep breath!

[13:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm on another note i guess i should get plane tickets to TPAC tonight

[13:47:00.0000] <cmlenz>
hey folks

[13:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I ought to decide what I'm doing for the weekend before

[13:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I need to decide whether to stay with my uncle for a few more days, or whether to come down to the south coast

[13:48:01.0000] <cmlenz>
just read http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/09/02/ie8-security-part-vi-beta-2-update.aspx and am wondering whether the "Restricting document.domain" example is what was intended by the spec

[13:48:02.0000] <cmlenz>
it's pretty weird that you can't reset document.domain to the original value

[13:49:00.0000] <cmlenz>
(note: I did not read through the comments, so I may have missed something :P )

[13:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#domain

[13:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I don't think it should require headers/id. but visually, it does have chained header cells

[13:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
visually that table is a mess

[13:51:01.0000] <cmlenz>
Hixie: read that, and in makes sense in general, but not in that specific example ;)

[13:51:02.0000] <cmlenz>
s/in/it

[13:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
cmlenz: what's the specific example that doesn't make sense?

[13:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
and what doesn't make sense about it?

[13:51:05.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I agree

[13:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think chained headers should work

[13:52:01.0000] <cmlenz>
the one in the IE blog post

[13:52:02.0000] <cmlenz>
document.domain = "app1.example.com"; document.domain = "example.com"; document.domain = "app1.example.com";

[13:52:03.0000] <cmlenz>
last one throws exception

[13:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
right

[13:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
is the spec unclear about this?

[13:52:06.0000] <jgraham>
At leat I think that untill someone shows me research that they are more confusing to end users than less information would be

[13:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: that's backwards

[13:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i don't add features based on the absence of evidence that the features are harmful

[13:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i add them based on evidence that they are helpful

[13:53:03.0000] <cmlenz>
no, that follows the spec, I'm just saying it makes no sense that you can't set the property value back to the original, more restrictive, value

[13:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
cmlenz: aah

[13:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
/me points cmlenz to the /topic :-)

[13:54:00.0000] <cmlenz>
hmm :P

[13:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's just how most browsers behave

[13:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
and there are some half-sensible security reasons for it

[13:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(but only half)

[13:54:04.0000] <Hixie>
like, you wouldn't want to go user1.example.com -> example.com -> user2.example.com

[13:55:00.0000] <cmlenz>
sure, that rule is 100% needed

[13:55:01.0000] <cmlenz>
oh well, no big deal anyway, I guess

[13:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me screams, "MY BROWSER! LET ME DECIDE HOW BIG I WANT THE WINDOW!"

[13:56:01.0000] <cmlenz>
just seems like something I'd be all WTF about when encountering it

[13:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
cmlenz: Much of HTML is like that.

[13:56:03.0000] <cmlenz>
but then again, I probably never will

[13:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: what would you offer to authors who want to support legacy agents?

[13:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to get train tickets

[13:57:02.0000] <cmlenz>
maybe the spec could at least allow user agents to behave sensibly? :P

[13:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: For authors who want to support legacy agents, I would specify that headers pointing to td has to work, not be conforming

[13:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: In this case you're arguing that providing only some of the information that a visual user has access to is more useful so I would say that you are making the more extraordinary claim

[14:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
£21.50 to get from Lyon to Cannes. Not bad.

[14:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
(note I am more concerned with the normal case of a table marked up with <th> and <td> but no @headers than the accessibility-consultant-tweaked case where @headers is used)

[14:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I also think that if using only the first header in a chain is easier on the user then it is possible to implement that as a UA feature without breaking the spec, whereas I suspect at the moment all AT will just break the spec

[14:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since presenting less information in a new version is unlikely to go down well with the users

[14:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
How long should I leave between my flight arriving at CDG and my train leaving?

[14:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me decides it is time to go home

[14:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: the visual user has access to exactly the same information

[14:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: if there are no headers and no scope attributes

[14:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Not really. If I have a table like <tr><th colspan="6">Sample numbers<tr><th>A<th>B[...]<tr><td>2.34<td>4.65 then the visual user can easilly see that the value 4.65 applies to "Sample number B", whereas the current headers scheme would iirc just show it applies to "B"

[14:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which is less information

[14:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
Now it may be that the UA wants to optimise away the display of that extra information

[14:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
By e.g. saying "Sample Number A 2.34, B 4.65" as the user moves across the table

[14:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
But it should still be associated by the algorithm so it is there if it is needed

[14:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
according to the spec as it stands today, unless i'm misreading it, 4.65 has two header cells associated with it

[14:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
Sample numbers and B

[14:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, wait a sec, the problem is that B doesn't have samle number as a header cell isn't it

[14:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
given what i've seen of users reading cells with screen readers, that doesn't seem like useful information

[14:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
OK, imagine a more complex example where a value could be from batch 1 or batch 2

[14:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'd rather focus on real examples

[14:16:03.0000] <jgraham>
so the headers would be "sample", batch number sample number

[14:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: So would I but making them up is easier :)

[14:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's easy to construct hypothetical tables that are nigh-on-impossible to understand even visually

[14:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
and that would have many nested levels of headers

[14:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
and god knows what else

[14:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
but real tables like that suck

[14:17:05.0000] <Hixie>
and should not be encouraged

[14:17:06.0000] <Hixie>
and people who want to make things accessible shouldn't just slap on some headers="" attributes to those tables

[14:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
because all they're doing is making it harder to show that their tables aren't accessible (even to visual users)

[14:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not suggesting that they just slap on @headers

[14:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
you're not, no

[14:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think it's weird if, in my example above there is no way to find out that "A" is a sample number rather than anything else

[14:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: why pointing to td? why not pointing to th? (re: legacy clients)

[14:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
Since that information is trivially avaliable visually

[14:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: hit the "up" key

[14:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Presumably legacy clients will continue to support legacy tables so de-facto @headers pointing to <th> will work anyway

[14:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/<th>/<td>

[14:20:02.0000] <jgraham>
We may as well spec reality

[14:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
reality is that nobody really uses headers="" and we could drop it and the only people who would notice are on public-html

[14:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Maybe. Doesn't work in some situations where there are data cells between the two headers; I'm sure Ben had a few examples like that

[14:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
(that was re "up key")

[14:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm still confused as to the concept of headers with headers, personally

[14:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: UAs will continue to support it whatever we way

[14:22:03.0000] <jgraham>
say

[14:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: It just means that in cases where the table algorithm says C is a B is an A, it also says B is an A

[14:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me really is going home now

[14:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
would you ever focus a <label> and ask what <label>s it had?

[14:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
<label for=q>Secret question</label> <label id=q for=a><input><label> <label for=a>Secret answer</label> <input id=a> - you might want to go from the last input to its first label, and from that to the label's label, although that's probably a bit contrived :-p

[14:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmmm…¬

[14:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/¬//

[14:40:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I wonder if I could get anyone to pay me next summer to work on HTTP5

[14:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
good luck

[14:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
though actually the market for paying people to work on standards is slightly better now than it was five years ago

[14:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: try to disguise it as documentation for a SoC project

[14:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ergh. I need 22p more to get free shipping on Amazon. Sux.

[14:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
how much is the shipping?

[14:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
I found out last night that I'm going to be speaking at PubCon in November this year. http://www.pubcon.com/bios/lachlan_hunt.htm

[14:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
I finally get a chance to go to the US :-)

[14:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
you'll get over your enthusiasm as soon as you arrive in the US airport :-)

[14:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
and have to go through hell :-)

[14:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/hell/airport security/

[14:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
easy typo

[14:51:04.0000] <gsnedders>
What's the difference, again?

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
hell doesn't lie about its intentions

[14:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah.

[14:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I think the enthusiasm stops before boarding the plane

[14:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
possible, depends where he's flying from

[14:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
last year when going to TPAC, the first interrogation was in Amsterdam before boarding

[14:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
I will at least remain enthusiastic about temporarily leaving Norway

[14:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
amsterdam isn't the best place to leave from

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
then again, if you're flying through amsterdam you'll be so distracted by the risk of losing your luggage in the changeover that you might not notice the interrogation

[14:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's a better place to change than places like LHR and CDG

[14:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh well sure

[14:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
who would voluntarily fly through CDG

[14:54:04.0000] <Hixie>
jesus

[14:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm flying into CDG, but that's all right

[14:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Changing, however…

[14:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me flies through CDG to TPAC

[14:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
the key to these interogations is to answer every question curtly and precisely without volunteering extra information and absolutely without showing any sign of irritation or annoyance

[14:55:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(I get straight off plane and on to train right next to the terminal to Lyon)

[14:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
and to do everything they tell you

[14:55:06.0000] <Lachy>
what's CDG?

[14:55:07.0000] <Hixie>
paris charles de gaule

[14:55:08.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Aeroport de Charles de Gaulle

[14:55:09.0000] <gsnedders>
(près de Paris)

[14:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
a crazy retro-futuristic airport and, as far as i can tell, something that was originally only intended as a joke.

[14:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: it seemed to me that going from CDG to Nice by train would have required swithing trains in paris with metro in between tha stations

[14:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but I may be wrong

[14:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the SNCF site suck

[14:57:03.0000] <hsivonen>
sites suck

[14:57:04.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: No, you can get a train straight from CDG

[14:57:05.0000] <gsnedders>
If you have to change, it should be possible to do it somewhere sane like Lyon Part Dieu (where you'd just have to change platform)

[14:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, there are direct trains

[14:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Two per day

[14:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Certainly no need to go to Paris ever

[14:58:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(That's the one thing worse than changing planes at CDG)

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was just thinking to myself that something was missing, and was trying to work out what it was. but i think i've worked it out. there hasn't been any crazy whining on public-html for days now. wtf.

[14:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Want me to post something?

[14:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
no, no, i'm not complaining

[15:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: In my experience flights within France are stupidly expensive

[15:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hopes the airline he's coming back on from NCE to EDI doesn't go bust

[15:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Air France, which I'm flying out on, will just be bailed out by the government almost certainly, so there's no risk there)

[15:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(flying by Air France was 9p cheaper than EasyJet, oddly)

[15:02:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Now, I meant to do something useful this evening. I don't seem to have done so.

[15:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for the sake of the environment, I hope SNCF gets their Internet act together

[15:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(for some reason, db.de is the place that actually works for searching train schedules between France and Italy)

[15:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: DB just generally has a good website that works, though

[15:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, not good in terms of design, but perfectly usable

[15:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
cff has a pretty good site too

[15:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
don't know if it goes into france

[15:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
DB covers all of Europe, which is _really_ useful

[15:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
too bad that you can't actually buy tickets there

[15:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
christ i can't wait to start using a spec gen that doesn't renumber all the IDs every time i add a new <dfn>

[15:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
You can… within DE

[15:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but if you go to a vr.fi brick&mortar office, the person there uses the db.de extranet to book tickets e.g. between Hungary and Romania

[15:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Fun :\

[15:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
<input> is coming along

[15:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how long i can go without actually defining anything

[15:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I'd guess at least the end of this month

[15:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Now, PRODUCTIVE TIME!

[15:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Were you not born in Zürich?

[15:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Which makes you calling it CFF interesting :)

[15:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
geneva

[15:15:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, that makes more sense

[15:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me has a dozen cff trains and dozens and dozens of cff rolling stock

[15:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
swiss trains are so pretty

[15:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks over his shoulder not remembering if he did that that one or not

[15:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, I seem not to

[15:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I should upload my photos from Switzerland some time

[15:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes he can't really label them because they're far too old

[15:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
2003, IIRC

[15:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I really suck at writing about why I want to do physics at uni

[15:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Meh.

[15:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I have around three times the amount about comp.sci.

[15:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hits the magic 4000 character limit

[15:42:00.0000] <annevk>
back, lets see if I can get some Python to run

[15:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: You have 15 minutes to question me.

[15:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I will most likely ignore you anyway, as I need to get this done :)

[15:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
man, my abilites to procrastrinate know no bounds

[15:45:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, no questions, it probably won't work

[15:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I've done nothing since I got home at 15:40 (it is now 22:48)

[15:45:02.0000] <annevk>
answers.com says that word is without the second r, Hixie

[15:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
wow, anne's pretty good at it too :-P

[15:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
(thanks)

[15:45:05.0000] <annevk>
:p

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: the thing is i've done lots

[15:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I've been trying to write personal statement for UCAS since then, with the exception of 15 mins for supper

[15:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: just not what i set out to do!

[15:46:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, I've done plenty

[15:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
just look at the huge table in the <input> section

[15:46:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I've been looking up stuff for October, and photographic stuff

[15:46:06.0000] <Hixie>
yet still nothing is defined

[15:46:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, and I've been keeping up with most email as it comes in

[15:46:08.0000] <gsnedders>
And been active in IRC the whole time

[15:46:09.0000] <Hixie>
sadly there has been so little e-mail

[15:46:10.0000] <gsnedders>
Not good when UCAS form needs to be done soon.

[15:47:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, finally, Hixie replaced abuse of <em> with <i>

[15:47:01.0000] <annevk>
/me reads diffs first

[15:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yet more example of my procrastination!

[15:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me reads diff too

[15:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MUST WORK.

[15:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tweets about our ability to procrastinate

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd volunteer to ban you for 20 minutes at a time to help you work

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
but we don't have ops :-)

[15:49:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hah.

[15:49:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I'd just go to other channels.

[15:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
d'oh

[15:49:05.0000] <gsnedders>
http://twitter.com/gsnedders/statuses/923871883

[15:49:06.0000] <annevk>
file "A label and a button" could also be a "A text field and a button" ...

[15:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i'd rather not encourage people to give a text field, for security reasons

[15:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me passes Hixie a text field

[15:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me gets an image of a crop field growing text

[15:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Could I make you useful and get you to read over my personal statemnet?

[15:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*statement

[15:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
you could try

[15:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[15:54:04.0000] <Hixie>
i make no promises

[15:54:05.0000] <gsnedders>
You sensible person.

[15:54:06.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm meant to be doing far too much because of it.

[15:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.heas.com.au/publications/images/idealperformancestate.gif — I'm too far right on that.

[15:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Now, to write a conclusion.

[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
oooooh

[16:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
we're two weeks away from HTML5 being in CR according to the W3C timetable

[16:03:02.0000] <annevk>
</sarcasm>

[16:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I'm around again fwiw

[16:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: email coming soon

[16:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(like, I'm writing it now)

[16:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(the email, not the personal statement)

[16:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
sent

[16:17:00.0000] <annevk>
sigh

[16:17:01.0000] <annevk>
from anolislib import generator gives a 500

[16:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: What's in the log?

[16:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the point of a personal statement again? :-)

[16:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I'll send more detailed comments by email but my first impressions are a) you need to put computer science second and physics first b) you mention things that are bad too often

[16:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
(e.g. talking about the simplepie codebase being messy)

[16:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
my first thought was "these paragraphs are too long" but i'm not sure how to evaluate it beyond that given my lack of recall of what a personal statement is

[16:24:02.0000] <annevk>
oops, the first line didn't point to my custom version of python

[16:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The point is is to seel yourself to the university as someone who is interested in the subject and so likely to turn up to lectures

[16:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/seel/sell

[16:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[16:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
"I love studying" seems like a theme to focus on then

[16:25:03.0000] <annevk>
the error log does get an entry for every refresh though, "UserWarning: This version of libxml2 has a known XPath bug. Use it at your own risk."

[16:25:04.0000] <annevk>
sigh

[16:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I guess there is more to it than that but they want to make sure that they don't take people who chose the course at random)

[16:26:01.0000] <annevk>
/me will ignore useless warnings for now

[16:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: send me a copy again when it's fixed jgraham's pretty overarching feedback and has smaller paragraphs :-)

[16:43:00.0000] <annevk>
and I was wondering why file upload didn't work, as it happens specifying enctype=multipart/form-data is actually important

[16:44:00.0000] <annevk>
would be nice if that defaulted to the appropriate type depending on whether or not <input type=file> is present but I guess it's too late now

[16:57:00.0000] <dglazkov>
Hixie: remember this cool doogie-bob concept of a JS "promise" that you once described here?

[16:57:01.0000] <dglazkov>
I want to remember how it worked

[16:58:00.0000] <dglazkov>
this had to do with async calls


2008-09-17
[17:00:00.0000] <annevk>
cool, it actually works now :)

[17:00:01.0000] <annevk>
/me is happy

[17:06:00.0000] <annevk>
so most of the work was installing shitty python modules

[17:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Don't you be dissing pyhon

[17:06:02.0000] <jgraham>
:)

[17:07:00.0000] <annevk>
:angel:

gsnedders, found a bug, you're not replacing [STATUS] everywhere

[17:08:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, e.g., in style sheet links preceding the actual status

[17:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
dglazkov: ?

[17:12:00.0000] <dglazkov>
Hixie: there was this cool little concept you were explaining, oh, about 6 months ago that employed the idea of a "promise".

[17:12:01.0000] <dglazkov>
I can't remember the details -- that's where I had hoped you'd come in :)

[17:13:00.0000] <dglazkov>
this was related to an async API

[17:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have no idea what you're talking about :-)

[17:13:02.0000] <dglazkov>
damn

[17:13:03.0000] <dglazkov>
:)

[17:13:04.0000] <dglazkov>
ok, I'll scour the logs

[17:13:05.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Replied

[17:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: By the way re: labels on forms I can imagine wanting the browser to give me access to the fieldset legend when I was focussed on a label. That seems like the closest example to a nested table header that you would typically have

[17:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
dglazkov: Like Twisted's "Deferred", which represents a value that might not have been computed yet but it'll let you know once it has been?

[17:17:01.0000] <dglazkov>
Philip`:  yes!

[17:17:02.0000] <dglazkov>
Philip`: thanks a bunch

[17:17:03.0000] <dglazkov>

annevk: No possibility to do a spec by uri?

[17:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
how do i give it a uri?

[17:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
um, what jgraham said

[17:25:00.0000] <annevk>
you can't

[17:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
man, you guys make my life hard :-P

[17:25:02.0000] <jgraham>
That seems like it should be easy...

[17:25:03.0000] <annevk>
it is easy

[17:25:04.0000] <annevk>
but i didn't need it :)

[17:25:05.0000] <annevk>
sigh ok, more complex UI

[17:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Why do I get an internal server error if I try to run it on "<script>"?

[17:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can always generate the postdata clientside but that seems excessively complicated :-)

[17:26:02.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I don't know

[17:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Check the error logs? :-)

[17:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
um, are you using html5lib? it's pretty slow

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
and it's missing a DOCTYPE :-)

[17:28:02.0000] <annevk>
it's using lxml

[17:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[17:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it was fast with lxml

[17:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
and it has a mysterious <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

[17:29:02.0000] <annevk>
that could be the lxml serializer

[17:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
oooh, the IDs look much more promising

[17:30:00.0000] <annevk>
status: alphabeta

[17:30:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, might be somewhere in toc.py because of reversed?!

[17:30:02.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, seems like a gsnedders problem :)

[17:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
looks like it doesn't do the wordwrapping like bert's does, either, awesome

[17:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
I thought it used the html5lib serializer

[17:31:01.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, i can pick the serializer myself

[17:31:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh OK. The html5lib serializer shouldn't be as slow as the parser

[17:31:03.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, and i just copied some lxml code

[17:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
So fromFile just returns a tree?

[17:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
The html5lib serialiser is quite a lot slower than lxml's

[17:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: How much?

[17:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Quite a lot

[17:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: At least multiple seconds difference, which was enough for me to change my spec-splitter to use lxml's serialiser instead by default

[17:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
It looks like it's maybe a factor of ~5 slower

[17:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it's not that bad really, and I was just impatient at the time

[17:34:02.0000] <jgraham>
It hasn't been optimized much I guess

[17:48:02.0000] <annevk>
but I haven't figured out a way to give error information back so currently it will just say FAIL (... failed)

hm, there's a flag you need to flip for html5

[17:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
something about w3c-compatible placement of <a> elements in <code> elements

now i'm tempted to just update the spec even though i'm half-way through edits

I wouldn't start relying on it just yet, but I suppose you can

[18:00:00.0000] <annevk>

[18:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: No

[18:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
consider this the warning you asked for then :-)

[18:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
It won't break horribly, but it won't split things into the proper sections

[18:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
I just need to upload an updated version to make it work with the new section names, which should be easy enough

[18:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
well the new one is definitely faster than bert's

[18:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i'm now autogenning the spec to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/index-new

[18:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
so you can start fetching the file there whenever you're ready

[18:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
and then at some point we'll synchronise a switchover together and i'll take out the older version

[18:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh annevk 

[18:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
do i need to do anything special to get a pubrules compliant version?

[18:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess not

[18:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
nevermind.

[18:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
ohhh, the <meta> element came from the upload i did

[18:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
woah

[18:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
took 33 seconds that time

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
and if you want to prepare for the w3c version, the new one is at http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/.w3c-new/Overview.html

[18:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
83 seconds!

[18:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me is surprised Dreamhost is letting the process live for that long

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's no process killing in private virtual servers

[18:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
55 seconds

[18:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok this is clearly not faster :-)

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
uh

[18:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are validation errors in the output

[03:02:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Oh, regarding my last comment about definition lists. I thought about it and it may actually be better to group them as discussed in the previously mentioned thread.

[03:02:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
thanks

[03:02:02.0000] <bfrohs>
The reason for this is because of :last-child, :first-child, etc

[03:03:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Currently, it'll do the last definition in the definition list.. not the last for the definition.

[03:03:01.0000] <bfrohs>
This makes it a structure error rather than styling.

[03:04:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Uses: Multiple definitions for the same term/phrase

[03:04:01.0000] <bfrohs>
And it can't currently be styled without 'hacks'

[03:05:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, gsnedders, Philip`, if you stot anything silly, let me know

[03:08:00.0000] <bfrohs>
http://dev.ravenleague.com/bones.php - see red line at the bottom of the dl... should be two red lines, not one (if it was grouped that is)

[03:10:00.0000] <annevk>
s/5px solid/15px double/ ?

[03:10:01.0000] <annevk>
:p

[03:12:00.0000] <bfrohs>
But if you have a border around the 2nd level dl, then you won't be able to use double border to separate it correctly.

[03:13:00.0000] <bfrohs>
And by two borders, there should be one under description of cf_connect and cf_timer_stop

[03:14:00.0000] <bfrohs>
The only way to do this currently is to make each one it's own definition list (add </dl><dl> before EVERY <td>)

[03:14:01.0000] <bfrohs>
<dt>*

[03:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
jesus there's totally no interop on this nonsense

[03:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
(setting .type dynamically, setting .defaultValue dynamically, etc)

[03:24:00.0000] <annevk>
despite non interop not being the best thing, it has created an entire market place for browser patching libraries... but then it's questionable whether all that effort is not better directed at something else

[03:26:00.0000] <annevk>

"Given CSS and JavaScript, HTML can be reduced to _div_ and _span_." -- http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2008/09/f2fkc-agenda#html5Embedding

[03:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's not entirely true.

[03:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
in fact, it's not true at all

[03:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
but what they fail to realise in their comparison is that random XML in a namespace is effectively no more semantic than <span class="">, within a browser that doesn't understand the vocabulary

[03:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
html5 is so successful the tag is spending almost half their meeting discussing html5 topics

[04:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
sure, if your measure of success is directly proportional to the length of time spent being discussed in a TAG meeting

[04:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
the tag discusses what they think is important

[04:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
what they think is important is directly related to where they perceive power exists

[04:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
success is power

[04:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
fair enough

[04:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm amused by "3.4.2 Issue: HTML5 Should Be Modularized?"

[04:03:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Would it be possible to move html5 in a direction where it could use xml + namespaces in the future?

[04:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
is anyone arguing that html5 _shouldn't_ be "modularised"?

[04:03:02.0000] <bfrohs>
That way, sometime far into the future browsers will start using namespaces?

[04:03:03.0000] <bfrohs>
Then it will be semantic

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe they mean something different by "modularized" than i understand; i assume they mean splitting it up into different subspecs with new editors

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: html5 already uses xml + namespaces

it's interesting that the spec is already roughly divided into those kind of modules. It's just they they all exist in the same document

[04:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: and browsers (other than IE) already support it

[04:04:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I hope there'd still be a single-page version of the subspecs

[04:05:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders how semantic is related to namespaces (or XML)

[04:05:01.0000] <bfrohs>
Has IE made any comments about it? Last I knew they were waiting until the spec was finished or something.

[04:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: well the split they suggest is naive in the extreme, i mean, you can't split the parser from document.write and document.open, nor document.open from the navigation algorithm, nor the navigation algorithm from <a> and Window

[04:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: which spec? xml?

[04:06:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Well, XHTML in general. application+xhtml - a little unrelated but I'm sure you could give an answer quicker than me searching for it

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know what microsoft's plans are

[04:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
"3.4.3 URL Parsing In HTML5" is funny too -- "This necessarily introduces aspects of the overall HTML5 parsing, and might over time lead to HTML5 error behavior bleeding into the rest of the Web that is more than just browsers."

[04:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
"might"?

[04:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
didn't we get there about 15 years ago?

[04:07:04.0000] <annevk>
wow, Python is slow, having a frontpage just being written out by a Python script already adds a few seconds to loading time

[04:08:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, for the TAG they don't see to understand much of how things actually work :/

[04:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
no kidding

[04:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
is anyone from the HTMLWG going to be attending the TAG meeting?

[04:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: It's probably mainly CGI that is slow

[04:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
DanC and TV are in both the TAG and the HTMLWG, i think

[04:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: FastCGI or mod_python would presumably be much better, since they avoid the process startup overhead

[04:12:00.0000] <annevk>
thanks Philip`, looking into that now

[04:14:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Any insight into http://forums.whatwg.org/viewtopic.php?p=965#965 ?

[04:14:01.0000] <bfrohs>
Example (with a little more styles) - http://dev.ravenleague.com/bones.php

[04:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
dt + dd { ... }

[04:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[04:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
dd + dt { ... }

[04:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
and use border-top instead of border-bottom

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
in the general case though, css should be upgraded to handle things like that much better

[04:17:00.0000] <bfrohs>
But it isn't CSS's problem that the code wasn't made well. It's like... <section><h1>title</h1><p>text</p><p>text</p></section>

[04:17:01.0000] <bfrohs>
(I believe section is the correct tag in html 5)

[04:17:02.0000] <bfrohs>
We added it there, so why not in definition lists where it makes more sense?

[04:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
the code was made fine

[04:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's css problem that it can't handle the code

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
<section> was added to allow simpler copy-and-paste of entire sections into nested sections without having to renumber <hx> elements

[04:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's no such problem with <dl>

[04:18:02.0000] <bfrohs>
So you're saying dd:last *should* apply to the last dd in each definition term section?

[04:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
in particular, <section> wasn't added for css at all

[04:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
no

[04:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm saying you should use "dd + dt { border-top: ... }" to get the effect you want

[04:19:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm, http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Python_FastCGI

[04:19:02.0000] <bfrohs>
Yes, but what if we want to add something to the last dd that can't apply to the dt.

[04:20:00.0000] <bfrohs>
The way to do it now is to insert extra dd tags or separate each definition section into it's own dl

[04:20:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I guess FastCGI wouldn't speed up the spec generation process?

[04:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: like i said, for the general case, css needs fixing

[04:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: how would you put a border around groups of <li> elements in a <ul> that have class="foo"? css can't do that either.

[04:23:00.0000] <bfrohs>
But whatwg is about improving the web right? The argument before was there was no need for this because it didn't add anything. But now I've brought forward an argument that shows it does add something and you're just dismissing it by claiming it's the fault of CSS when it would work perfectly fine just with the new tag? (current spec - :last-child, :first-child, etc do not work because of...

[04:23:01.0000] <bfrohs>
...the code, not the css)

[04:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: whatwg is about improving html. not about working around limitations of css.

[04:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: to fix limitations of css, we should just fix css.

[04:23:04.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: No - it would just avoid having to launch Python and load all the imported modules every time you made a request

[04:24:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess that does help a bit

[04:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Also it would introduce more admin complexity and possible points of failure :-)

[04:26:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Hixie: But the 'class=foo' argument doesn't apply to this. Definition lists are often grouped by term>definitions, yet there is no code to show this. There is no tag to say 'hey, these are grouped'. That is the point of a definition list. Unordered lists are just that - unordered. If you want to group them, simply make separate ones or insert them into definition lists (now that makes...

[04:26:01.0000] <bfrohs>
...sense). But definition lists are meant to be grouped.

[04:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
definition lists _are_ grouped

[04:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
<dt> starts the group, and <dd> ends the group

[04:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
how about a group of adjacent rows all in the same <tbody>?

[04:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
css can't style those either

[04:28:01.0000] <bfrohs>
But there are multiple definitions to a single term sometimes. The current spec disables CSS's :last-child, :first-child, etc... so wouldn't this make it an error on HTML's side and not CSS's?

[04:28:02.0000] <bfrohs>
Tables are grouped by tables

[04:28:03.0000] <bfrohs>
That's why they have ONE header

[04:28:04.0000] <bfrohs>
If you want a new header, you make a new table

[04:28:05.0000] <bfrohs>
Definition lists are meant to display multiple definition terms and definitions.

[04:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you have a long table and you want to give a group of adjacent rows a particular style, e.g. a background that spans them all, there's no way to do that in css today

[04:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's exactly the same problem

[04:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
the groups are well-defined in something like <dl> <dt><dt><dd><dd><dd> <dt><dd><dd> <dt><dt><dt><dd> </dl>

[04:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
we don't need more markup to show them

[04:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
they are already unambgiuous

[04:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
unambiguous even

[04:30:01.0000] <bfrohs>
But there is no use to group rows in a table - they have the ability to switch back and forth if I'm correct

[04:30:02.0000] <bfrohs>
which is the only use I've ever seen in tables

[04:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
the spec doesn't disable CSS pseudo-classes, it's just that the CSS pseudo-classes don't do what you want here

[04:30:04.0000] <bfrohs>
Because dd:last-child should go to the last definition of a term

[04:30:05.0000] <bfrohs>
not the last definition of all the terms

[04:30:06.0000] <Hixie>
no it shouldn't

[04:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
it should go to the last child of its parent

[04:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
whatever that is

[04:31:02.0000] <bfrohs>
Exactly, so it's not the fault of CSS. It isn't doing what everyone expects it to do because the grouping isn't there when it should be.

[04:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
if you want a pseudo-class to match the last definition of a term, then ask the csswg to invent :last-definition-of-a-term or something

[04:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
the html is exposing all the semantics that you need to style this, it's css that isn't taking advantage of them

[04:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's just like how in css you can't style the third column of a table unless it has an explicit <col> element

[04:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's a limitation of css

[04:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
and it should be fixed

[04:33:00.0000] <bfrohs>
But that would be a waste of time on their part. If you came out with a new type of definition list, they'd have to do it all over again for that one. CSS shouldn't have to change because HTML is too lazy (or doesn't want) to add the grouping.

[04:33:01.0000] <bfrohs>
Yes, that I can see

[04:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and for all of these i proposed fixes years ago, i should point out)

[04:33:03.0000] <bfrohs>
But I still believe there should be more semantics for the definition list

[04:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
html shouldn't have to change because css is too lazy to add the expressiveness to handle basic html :-)

[04:33:05.0000] <Hixie>
adding a new element wouldn't add any semantics

[04:33:06.0000] <bfrohs>
Every designer I know wants it, but hasn't been able to come up with an argument you guys liked.

[04:33:07.0000] <Hixie>
the semantics are already all there

[04:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
why wouldn't you rather make css more powerful?

[04:34:01.0000] <bfrohs>
If you add the tag, :last-child and :first-child would work immediately

[04:34:02.0000] <bfrohs>
By not adding it, you're breaking CSS

[04:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
i've already explained why that isn't correct, though i understand that you don't necessarily agree

[04:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
but why wouldn't you rather make css more powerful?

[04:35:00.0000] <annevk>
by that argument CSS is broken, because <dl> came first (did it?)

[04:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
<dl> came first by several years

[04:35:02.0000] <bfrohs>
I've looked at it from both sides, I really have. And I'm looking at it from the outside so I don't have to work on implementing it. But from everything I've seen, this is the one solution that would make sense.

[04:35:03.0000] <bfrohs>
Yes, but just because something came first doesn't mean it's right.

[04:35:04.0000] <bfrohs>
"checked='checked'" for example

[04:35:05.0000] <bfrohs>
well, 'checked'

[04:36:00.0000] <bfrohs>
That leaves no room for forward-compatibility

[04:36:01.0000] <bfrohs>
We now see that with 'check all' boxes

[04:36:02.0000] <bfrohs>
There is no inbetween value

[04:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why you would rather fix just this one case instead of fixing all these cases all at once and making css much more powerful in the process

[04:36:04.0000] <bfrohs>
Because someone didn't see a use for it in the past.

[04:36:05.0000] <bfrohs>
But if CSS were to fix this, it would be ONE CASE

[04:36:06.0000] <bfrohs>
Not multiple

[04:36:07.0000] <bfrohs>
They already have the functionality for this.. it's just not grouped by HTML

[04:37:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Once again,  :last-child and :first-child were made for this

[04:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
no, css could come up with a generic solution that applied to multiple rows, multiple <li>s in a group in a <ul>, multiple columns, all the examples i gave and many many more

[04:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've proposed various solutions to this kind of stuff over the past ten years, if the csswg wanted to fix it they could

[04:38:01.0000] <bfrohs>
And they could say the same for whatwg

[04:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
we couldn't do anything that fixed all those problems at once

[04:39:00.0000] <bfrohs>
No, but the obvious grouping is there, you said it yourself. But it would be easier to implement it in html than css

[04:39:01.0000] <bfrohs>
In over 6 years of experience, I have never had any other trouble with grouping except with definition lists

[04:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
you're lucky :-0

[04:40:01.0000] <bfrohs>
I really don't see what's so hard about adding this tag that every designer I know of wants added

[04:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
adding the tag would be easy

[04:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's just the wrong solution

[04:41:00.0000] <bfrohs>
was thead and tbody the wrong solution?

[04:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't add anything to the language, its entire purpose would be to work around a (temporary) limitation in another language

[04:41:02.0000] <bfrohs>
Here, I'll try one more example

[04:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
<thead>, <tbody> and <tfoot> aren't present for styling, they're present to indicate the parts of the table that are grouped together

[04:42:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Table - doesn't allow for more than one thead/tbody

[04:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
<table> can have multiple <tbody>s

[04:42:02.0000] <bfrohs>
but not multiple theads

[04:42:03.0000] <bfrohs>
so...

[04:42:04.0000] <bfrohs>
<div><table><thead><tr>...</tr></thead><tbody><tr>...</tr></tbody></table></div>

[04:42:05.0000] <bfrohs>
That is like a definition list

[04:43:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
bfrohs: a new tag doesn't work well in ie

[04:43:01.0000] <bfrohs>
Repeat the table to repeat the definition group

[04:43:02.0000] <bfrohs>
And IE needs an incentive to get up to standards

[04:43:03.0000] <bfrohs>
They're losing the market share daily - something like this will push the browser wars back into full action for IE

[04:43:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
bfrohs: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0D%0A%3Cscript%3Edocument.createElement('x')%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cbody%3E%3Cdl%3E%3Cx%3E%3Cdt%3E%3Cdd%3E%3C%2Fdd%3E%3C%2Fx%3E%3Cx%3E%3Cdt%3E%3Cdd%3E%3C%2Fdd%3E%3C%2Fx%3E%3C%2Fdl%3E

[04:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: i don't see what the argument regarding multiple <table>s is supposed to show

[04:44:01.0000] <annevk>
bfrohs, oh come on

[04:44:02.0000] <bfrohs>
Tables have similar grouping to Definition Lists... add in the div to replace the <dl> tag. Table is the group.

[04:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: so?

[04:45:01.0000] <bfrohs>
thead is dt and tbodys are the dd

[04:45:02.0000] <annevk>
<dl> is already implicitly grouped

[04:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: you could say the same about <section><h1></h1><p><p></section><section><h1></h1><p><p></section><section><h1></h1><p><p></section>

[04:45:04.0000] <annevk>
for <table> you need <thead> is it not just the first row or something, it could be the first three rows

[04:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: the point is that with <dt> and <dd>, we don't need additional elements because the grouping is unambiguous

[04:46:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
bfrohs: you're giving Hixie a reason to not work on integrating <input> in html5 :P

[04:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: whereas with <tr><tr><tr> you have no way to know where the <thead> ends and the <tbody> begins

[04:47:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Well, I guess my major concern is :last-child and :first-child being broken. It works for tables with thead and tbodys

[04:48:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is reminded of http://twitter.com/gsnedders/statuses/923871883

[04:48:01.0000] <bfrohs>
I don't see why it is CSS's fault if they have a system in place to fix this, yet it doesn't work because whatwg won't put in the tag.

[04:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: no it doesn't

[04:48:03.0000] <bfrohs>
okay, well it works with sections and ps

[04:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: no it doesn't

[04:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: in <section><h1></h1><p>...  p:first-child doesn't match anything

[04:49:01.0000] <bfrohs>
How doesn't it work for p tags? 

[04:49:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
and so they added :first-of-type

[04:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
and in <h1></h1><p><h1></h1><p> p:first-of-type doesn't match the first paragraph of the second section

[04:49:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
h1+p

[04:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
dt + dd

[04:50:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes

[04:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
dd.lastrow { ... }

[04:50:03.0000] <annevk>
well, <h1></h1><img><p> too

[04:50:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
h1 + img + p

[04:50:05.0000] <zcorpan_>
:P

[04:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
or what Philip` said

[04:51:01.0000] <annevk>
h1 + video + p, h1 + embed + p, h1 + svg + p, etc.

[04:51:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
h1 + :not(p) + p

[04:51:03.0000] <bfrohs>
Okay, well, the one thing I want does work with h1 + p - :last-child

[04:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
h1 ~ p:not(:matches(p + #)) ? :-)

[04:51:05.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, fails if some <p>s are grouped in a section

[04:52:00.0000] <annevk>
s/section/<div>

[04:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: doesn't match the first <p> in the example above

[04:52:02.0000] <bfrohs>
But p:last-child works

[04:53:00.0000] <annevk>
only if there's no img at the end

[04:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
<script>for each (var p in document.getElementsByTagName('p')) if (arbitraryExpression(p)) p.className += ' first-paragraph'</script>

[04:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: so does dd:last-child -- your definition of "works" is wrong. :-)

[04:53:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me needs to go back to work

[04:53:04.0000] <bfrohs>
Works how people want it to.

[04:53:05.0000] <bfrohs>
Before <section> we used <div>

[04:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, get the css wg to fix css to handle this case too

[04:54:01.0000] <bfrohs>
Okay, I give up haha

[04:55:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Are ordered lists still using 'reversed' as the attribute?

[04:55:01.0000] <bfrohs>
rather than 'order' or something that makes more sense?

[04:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[04:55:03.0000] <bfrohs>
*refer to my checked example from earlier*

[04:56:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Why aren't we using 'order' instead?

[04:56:01.0000] <bfrohs>
What if another order option comes up in the future that we didn't see coming (like 'checked')

[04:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
kiss principle

[04:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
we can always add an order="" attribute

[04:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
reversed isn't the ordering

[04:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's just the decision of whether to put things backwards or forwards

[04:57:03.0000] <bfrohs>
Kiss principle is what made it so we only have 'checked' and 'not checked'

[04:57:04.0000] <bfrohs>
Even though there's the 'check all' box with 'some are checked' value

[04:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes it when boolean attributes are guaranteed to not grow a third state in the future

[04:58:01.0000] <annevk>
bfrohs, we can always add a new attribute if there really is a need

[04:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
bfrohs: tristate checkboxes are something we've looked at introducing, but so far we've decided not to. however, the checked attribute doesn't stop us from adding a third state using another attribute.

[04:59:01.0000] <bfrohs>
But we're so worried about backward-compatibility that no one is thinking about forward-compatibility

[04:59:02.0000] <annevk>
euhm?

[04:59:03.0000] <bfrohs>
If we make it 'order' now, we won't have to worry about 'is this going to break a browser if we add it' or anything of that nature

[05:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes we will

[05:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
because someone will say order="foo"

[05:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
even though it's not valid

[05:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
and so we'll have to make sure that we don't introduce a value order="foo" because it would break pages that (incorrectly) used it

[05:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, are tristate checkboxes being postponed till WF3?

[05:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[05:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
depends what gets implemented

[05:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Postponing tristate checkboxes means more ARIA

[05:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose that makes sense, since there were questions about what exactly the use cases were and whether or not the intermediate value needs to be submited in some way

[05:04:02.0000] <Lachy>
and how to submit it if needed

[05:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't really considered it, i'm just not adding features unless i have to until browsers get closer to having a lot of html5 done

[05:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
and i only have to when browser vendors are so hell bent on implementing something that they'll do it with or without a spec

[05:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. workers

[05:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. If I have time I'll look into them and perhaps I can talk to someone about getting an experimental implementation in opera

[05:06:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, there's a lot of other features from HTML5 browsers can add first that obsolete the need for parts of ARIA

[05:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i recommend focusing on already-specced things, we really have a lot to work with as it is

[05:07:01.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, if there's time I'd prefer we prioritize differently :)

[05:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, sure

[05:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: the further the spec gets from where browsers are, the less likely we'll ever get interop

[05:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't have time now, or in the near future

[05:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wanted placeholder well before tristate checkboxes anyway

[05:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
and there already is an implementation of that

[05:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
placeholder might make it 

[05:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
:-)

[05:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's a lot of demand for it and as you say, implementations are implementing it already

[05:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
type=search and the associated api would be nice too

[05:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
less of a priority but yes

[05:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok bed time

[05:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
I need to write an abstract for a presentation I'm giving in 3 weeks, any suggestions for what topics I can cover?

[05:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
It can be on any standards stuff I work on, including HTML5 stuff or Selectors API or whatever

[05:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me checks the list of what is being implemented

[05:21:00.0000] <annevk>
people like <canvas> demos

[05:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I can reuse the ones I used at @media

[05:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
CSS transforms

[05:22:02.0000] <annevk>
e.g. Super Mario & Large Hadron Collider from http://nihilogic.dk/

[05:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
thanks

[05:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, is that the webkit extensions?

[05:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: yeah, Gecko has some support for them now too

[05:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
with -moz- prefixes?

[05:23:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think roc blogged about it a few days back

[05:23:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
dunno

[05:23:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me always imagines the LHC curving in the other direction

[05:23:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to look for blog post

[05:23:07.0000] <Lachy>
do you have a link?

[05:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

[05:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
also http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2008/09/css_transforms.html

[05:26:01.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: or one of p01's canvas demos

[05:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
p01 favicon thing

[05:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
I should use that canvas favicon demo :-)

[05:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
year

[05:27:03.0000] <annevk>
yeah, he has some fun games too

[05:27:04.0000] <Lachy>
yeah

[05:28:00.0000] <annevk>
http://blog.whatwg.org/this-week-in-html-5-episode-5#comment-27308

[05:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
would be great to cover ARIA but I guess that's not the easiest thing to demo

[05:28:02.0000] <annevk>
it's quite easily explained though

[05:28:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
aye

[05:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
can talk about e.g. Google apps that have already added support for it

[05:29:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: p01 also has an awesome four panels thing

[05:29:02.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, yeah, I have a copy of that 4 panel thing already

[05:29:03.0000] <Lachy>
that's the one I used at @media

[05:29:04.0000] <Lachy>
I also used Philip`s canvex demo

[05:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
virtuelv, where can I find p01's demos?

[05:31:01.0000] <virtuelv>
www.p01.org

[05:32:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: there are also plenty of stuff to be found here: http://www.ozoneasylum.com/7808

[05:33:00.0000] <virtuelv>
this one is pretty awesome

[05:33:01.0000] <virtuelv>
http://www.p01.org/releases/DHTML_contests/files/20lines_hypno_trip_down_the_fractal_rug/

[05:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
I can't find that favicon demo

[05:35:01.0000] <virtuelv>
http://www.p01.org/releases/DHTML_contests/files/DEFENDER_of_the_favicon/

[05:37:00.0000] <hasather_>
Lachy: go and ask p01 if you can see his unreleased demos, you will be blown away

[05:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'm going to make the presentation a show case of new and upcoming standards that are being implemented.

[05:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
This is what I have on my list so far: canvas demos, video and audio demos, CSS transforms and animations,  getElementsByClassName, Selectors API, some Web Forms 2 controls, and an introduction to Web Workers

[05:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
that seems like reasonable coverage of HTML, CSS and JavaScript stuff

[06:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: who's the audience?

[06:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me imagines most canvas demos are totally irrelevant to most audiences

[06:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
Graphs are kind of useful, though

[06:24:00.0000] <annevk>
(the audience I had mostly does JavaScript for a living)

[06:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Re http://blog.whatwg.org/this-week-in-html-5-episode-5#comment-27295 : I thought IE did something like just strip the 8th bit off us-ascii content, instead of treating it like windows-1252?

[06:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: that's my hearsay recollection. Perhaps worth your comment on the blog?

[06:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I'd prefer not to spread hearsay, and I'm too lazy/busy to test it or look it up and get a more reliable answer

[07:01:00.0000] <jcranmer>
oh, fun, it looks like my CS teacher is trying to do a stack example with HTML...

[07:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, it's for a web standards group meeting, which is predominately web developers and designers

[07:05:01.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: I see

[07:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I presume you'll be saying stuff about what features they can use now and won't have to wait until 2022 for?

[07:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, yes, that's the point of focussing on stuff that they can use now or in the near future

[07:11:00.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: I'd be interested in seeing what you come up with for the part about Workers.

[07:11:01.0000] <billyjack>
 Seems like one common way to introduce concepts around something new like Workers is to compare it something the audience might already be familiar with

[07:11:02.0000] <billyjack>
but the only thing I can think of to compare workers to is message passing in Erlan

[07:11:03.0000] <billyjack>
Erlang

[07:12:00.0000] <billyjack>
which I guess is something most audiences are probably not going to be terrifically familar with

[07:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
That isn't quite the only place in the world where message passing is used

[07:12:02.0000] <Lachy>
I'll probably show a slide with a photo of a lazy council worker and write some bullet points

[07:12:03.0000] <Philip`>
What you need is a car analogy

[07:12:04.0000] <Lachy>
I know nothing about cars

[07:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
and I assume most web developers and designers wouldn't know much about them either

[07:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
Compare it to asynchronous XHR, except with the X or H or R and without a remote server

[07:14:00.0000] <annevk>
compare it with a single lane one way versus a double lane one way versus a triple lane one way, etc.

[07:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, something like that could work

[07:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe a diagram illustrating how things executing in a single thead is slower compared with multiple independent threads that notify you when they're done

[07:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
Car anaology: The main thread is like the driver, it is the only one with access to the controls (UI). workers are like passengers, the driver can ask them to do stuff like look at the map or listen to the radio for traffic information and can then change the route based on what they say, but they have no direct access to the controls :)

[07:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Point out how terrible it is that a page loaded with ugly animated adverts and pointless complex AJAX can only use 25% of your shiny new quad-core CPU, and wouldn't it be so much better if it could use 100%

[07:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
obviously map == database and radio == XHR

[07:17:02.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, that's a nice one

[07:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, of course, that's exactly what end users want: web pages that make their computers constantly use 100% of their processor

[07:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Sure - that's why we're adding support for multithreaded computation

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
And think how much faster raytracers written in JS could go, which will usher in a new era of useless tech demos

[07:21:00.0000] <billyjack>
I think it would be cool if you went through the whole car analogy or multi-lane analogy, and then at the end somebody raises his hand and says, "This is sort of uncanny, but your analogies make these Worker things sound a lot like message passing in say, a language like Erlang."

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Doing computation in workers seems a bit silly, since nobody really does that much computation (particularly since it needs a lot of computation on little data, to make the message-passing overhead worthwhile) - synchronous database/network operations sound a much more useful issue

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: In web-workers: "The worker then just listens for messages from the worker and acts on them as appropriate" - second "worker" should probably be "server"

[07:29:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: tristate checkboxes were dropped from aria iirc

[07:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Also s/backgroud/background/

[07:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: Ah. I had either missed that or had forgotten

[07:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i think it was about a year ago

[07:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
how does this sound for an abstract:

[07:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
What’s New in Web Standards

[07:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
An overview of the new and upcoming web standards that are being implemented in current or upcoming releases of browsers.  This presentation will show case a range of new features in HTML, CSS and the DOM that will be usable in the near future.

[07:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
(I want to leave it a little broad, rather than listing specifics, because the presentation isn't yet written and some things may be added or dropped between now and then)

[07:59:00.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: needs more cowbell

[07:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
explain

[08:00:00.0000] <billyjack>
more cowbell, man .. bang the cowbell more aggressively

[08:01:00.0000] <billyjack>
title: Is there really any hope left at all for Web standards?

[08:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_cowbell

[08:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
it's an american thing.

[08:02:00.0000] <billyjack>
America plus Alaska

[08:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me attempts to translate to Aussie slang

[08:03:00.0000] <billyjack>
title: Should we give up on Web standards completely?

[08:03:01.0000] <billyjack>
title: Do Web standards needs more cowbell?

[08:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm still trying to work out how to translate that description of the more cowbell skit into something meaningful

[08:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
that applies to my abstract

[08:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds it odd that an ISO standard defines "hippity"

[08:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
("HIPPITY – Bit 3 – A value of 0 indicates zero hippity cost, and a value of 1 indicates infinite hippity

[08:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
cost." etc)

[08:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me has no idea why they use that term

[08:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the abstract as written above is a bit generic. you need to pitch something more unique or something more controversial

[08:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
heh, that's what Marcos told me :-)

[08:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me goes to think about it...

[08:14:00.0000] <billyjack>
controversy is always good, even if you have to invent it

[08:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes Java classloaders were less picky about resource naming

[08:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
billyjack: i.e. trolling?

[08:16:00.0000] <billyjack>
Philip`: well, no, trolling is bad

[08:16:01.0000] <billyjack>
I mean as far as session descriptions go

[08:17:00.0000] <billyjack>
most session descriptions for events are so deadly boring that it's hard to work up much motivation to take any interest

[08:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
How about "The New Cool Stuff We've Got, All Without Distributed Extensibility or RDF"

[08:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Do people go to sessions because they want to learn something, or do they go because they think the speaker sounds entertaining?

[08:18:02.0000] <Lachy>
I think they go to the WSG meetings for the free beer

[08:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the latter

[08:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: that's only controversial on www-tag :P

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That would probably be meaningless to people who weren't already part of the HTML5 gang and knew about the animosity towards distributed extensibility and RDF

[08:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, well, I obviously suck at coming up with controversial titles. Any suggestions?

[08:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
You should call it "Your web sites are boring and ugly: We'll give you shiny things"

[08:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's a bit long

[08:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
Shiny New Things for Your Web Site?

[08:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
s/Shiny New/New Shiny/

[08:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
or s/New//

[08:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Just call it "Shiny!"

[08:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
if I called it that, it would need a good abstract to explain it

[08:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"Anything good coming out of Web standards?"

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Your abstract could just be "Shiny shiny shiny!"

[08:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Nobody could resist going along to see what it was about

[08:26:02.0000] <Lachy>
How about "Web 3.0"

[08:27:00.0000] <annevk>
boring

[08:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
see, I told you I suck at this :-)

[08:27:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen wins so far

[08:27:03.0000] <Lachy>
Shiny Stuff!

[08:27:04.0000] <Lachy>
New, shiny stuff is under development in web standards that are being implemented in current or upcoming browser releases.  This presentation will showcase a range of new toys to play with in HTML, CSS and the DOM that you can start using to spice up your web app.

[08:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen's title is good too

[08:28:01.0000] <annevk>
call it "Look ma, no Flash" or something

[08:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
Anything good coming out of Web standards?

[08:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
Yes! Come along and find out what.

[08:29:02.0000] <annevk>
standards scores high on being boring these days I think

[08:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
"Look What You Can Do Without Flash These Days"

[08:30:01.0000] <annevk>
too long

[08:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
Would normal web developers/designers be happy to be told they could stop using Flash and all its nice authoring tools and interoperability and everything, and should start writing loads of JS code in Notepad instead?

[08:31:00.0000] <annevk>
considering most still make HTML pages, yes

[08:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
the kind of people that go the the Web Standards Group meetings, where I'm presenting this, aren't really into Flash

[08:33:00.0000] <annevk>
then they might be happy to hear they don't have to use it anymore

[08:33:01.0000] <annevk>
:)

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
Ok, I could go with "Look, No Flash"

[08:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Don't Flash Me"

[08:35:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Look ma, no divs

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Look, Upside Down Text, Isn't That Useful"

[08:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if there are better examples of the CSS Transform stuff

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>

[08:44:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: ok

[08:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
and I don't know how to configure fallback fonts in Linux anyway

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I'll just put up with all the interesting characters being rendered as boxes

[08:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think I'm going to go with "Flashy Stuff, Without Flash"

http://lwn.net/Articles/298755/ # interesting 1.0 release of dirac video codec

[08:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
The problem with codecs like Theora and Dirac is that you can't compare them to e.g. MPEG-4 without it being an unfair comparison because Theora/Dirac encoders are rubbish compared to the state-of-the-art MPEG-4 encoders

[08:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, is that a problem with the implementations, or with the algorithms they're using?

[08:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>

[08:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Both, I expect - they could implement the algorithms better, and they could choose better algorithms to implement (while still outputting content that's compatible with any conforming decoder)

[08:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The specs only say how to decode the video, not how to encode it, so encoders can do whatever fancy tricks they can think of)

[08:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, really? I thought they defined how to encode it as well

[09:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
but that might explain why there's DivX and Xvid are both implementations of MPEG4, and yet are somehow different

[09:00:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, I wasn't sure how to start complaining about it

[09:01:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders why <label> is allowed to be associated with nothing

[09:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: http://www.theora.org/doc/Theora.pdf says "The Theora format is well-deﬁned by its decode speciﬁcation; any encoder that produces packets that are correctly decoded by an implementation following this speciﬁcation may be considered a proper Theora encoder."

[09:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
"... Where appropriate, a non-normative description of encoder processes is included. These sections will be marked as such, and a proper Theora encoder is not bound to follow them."

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I can only see about one bit describing the encoder process

[09:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
The rest is all just for decoders

[09:06:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, Anolis in JavaScript? http://ajaxian.com/archives/aptana-jaxer-benchmarks

[09:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
That graph would be more meaningful if the bar colours were labelled

[09:08:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, follow the link

[09:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, the image does have a legend, but it's cut off because it's wider than the content column

[09:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has used wxJavaScript for adding GUI scriptability to a C++ application, but oddly that library has migrated towards being a server-side web scripting engine

[09:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: That just shows that Rails is slow, which isn't really news

[09:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The wx parts obviously don't work at all on a web server, but it has modules for io and sqlite and curl and stuff)

[09:20:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, it shows that JavaScript is competitive

[09:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Does Jaxer have competitive functionality to Rails?

[09:22:00.0000] <annevk>
dunno

[09:22:01.0000] <annevk>
I meant in speed, not feature set

[09:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
It looks kind of like old-fashioned PHP where you embed all your code inside special tags in HTML files

[09:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me imagines it would be hard to find a language whose performance was not competitive with Ruby's

[09:27:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm ok

[09:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly all server-side web programming should be done in OCaml

[09:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Ruby 1.8 is supposedly a factor of ~3 slower than Python so python would be close to PHP. OTOH, js+tracemonkey might be a big win

[09:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
But only if you're spending significant time in JS, rather than in API calls

[09:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Sure. Some of those benchmarks look pretty microbenchmarky to me

[09:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
The python jit thing which I have forgotten the name of sped up html5lib quite a bit

[09:35:02.0000] <jgraham>
psyco

[09:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: You could try installing psyco on DH but it will only work if their servers are 32 bit which seems unlikely

[09:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Can you give me an example of [STATUS] not being replaced?

[09:37:01.0000] <annevk>
meh, I've installed enough custom fu for now

[09:37:02.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, it's because it's in an attribute value I found out

[09:37:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: That should still be replaced

[09:37:04.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, I made some notes: http://anolis.quuz.org/notes

[09:37:05.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, your docs suggest otherwise

[09:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It should work if you've got 32-bit Python even if the servers are 64-bit

[09:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: --w3c-compat-xref-a-placement — Hixie needs that :(

[09:38:02.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, yes, I enabled it by default

[09:38:03.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, I think you should just go with "compat" as default and kill the option...

[09:38:04.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.src.html is an example

[09:39:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, though maybe the problem is that you're not picking a default of ED...

[09:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Good point. Although I guess annevk installed with the default bittiness which presumably matches the processor arch

[09:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: w3c_compat_replacements needs to be set to True

[09:40:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: That's the case because those replacements only make sense for W3C docs

[09:41:00.0000] <hober>
lots and lots of html5 in the tag f2f agenda

[09:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: The validation errors are only present in the lxml copy :P

[09:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://html5.validator.nu/?=&doc=http%3A%2F%2Fstuff.gsnedders.com%2Fspec-gen%2Fhtml5.html

[09:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, libxml's serializer is b0rked

[09:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: gsnedders: 'When xref'ing <code>foo</code>, should you get <a><code>foo</code></a> or <code><a>foo</a></code> — I assume the former because you are linking the term, and not the word "foo".'

[09:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Hixie: "That makes sense, yeah."

[09:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I could be pedantic and argue that the default bittiness probably matches the OS architecture rather than the actual processor architecture :-)

[09:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has installed 32-bit Linux on a Core 2 because it seemed to have compatibility advantages and no real disadvantages (at least with only 2GB RAM)

[09:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Yeah, I always knew the physics part would be weaker :)

[09:55:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, well, changed my mind :)

[09:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Hixie just can't get the styling he wants with it :P

[09:57:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess it doesn't matter

[09:57:01.0000] <annevk>
anyway, I'm not planning on exposing the alternate version through the interface

[09:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I'd at least make the full w3c compat mode visible

[09:57:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(like w3c_compat=True)

[09:58:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe, have to figure out what's actually required

[09:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: XHR will need it

[10:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wishes ID generation was simpler

[10:00:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, it's a W3C doc, it's just an ED draft...

[10:00:02.0000] <annevk>
(re status)

[10:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: None of the other statuses make sense for non-W3C docs though

[10:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: And I have no means to know what status they are

[10:01:02.0000] <annevk>
why would non-W3C docs use [STATUS] etc.?

[10:01:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Besides, 1.0 is just the keeping Hixie mostly happy release

[10:01:04.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: They shouldn't, therefore it shouldn't replaced. It's quite expensive to do the string replacements.

[10:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: The problem you have is that it sounds like you are actually interested in CS and, although you claim to be interested in physics it's not really clear if its true

[10:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I suck at writing about physics :(

[10:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or if, for example, its' just that someone in your family told you to apply for physics because CS isn't manly enough or something (I guess that's not true but for some people it could be)

[10:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You should express your interest by saying "I read a lot about the LHC and I think black holes are cool so I hope they find one"

[10:03:02.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, hmm, it's annoying I need to flag it as W3C doc

[10:03:03.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, can I set a flag to try replacements by default?

[10:04:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, with ED as default? :)

[10:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Meh. There is no flag, I don't really want to add one. It's just expensive.

[10:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me remembers the diff. being far more what he just got testing

[10:06:01.0000] <annevk>
I might be able to hack it in :)

[10:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Just finding the W3C status takes 0.520s in HTML 5

[10:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(it fails to find any, needless to say)

[10:07:02.0000] <annevk>
you should be able to speed that up a bit

[10:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: It needs to do a case-insensitive search in every text node

[10:08:01.0000] <annevk>
why not only check in the first <dl> on the page?

[10:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Docs rely on its current behaviour

[10:09:01.0000] <annevk>
i can't name one

[10:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
CSSOM for example

[10:10:00.0000] <annevk>
CSSOM would set the status always within the first <dl>

[10:11:00.0000] <annevk>
http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/Overview.src.html but it's not there, so it should default to ED

[10:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: You have to be careful not to get the REC there

[10:11:02.0000] <annevk>
(status is derived from the "This version" link)

[10:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: No, actually, it isn't

[10:11:04.0000] <annevk>
it should be

[10:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/raw-file/1.0RC1/README.html#w3c-status

[10:14:00.0000] <annevk>
I think you can speed that up along the lines I suggested and not break existing specs

[10:14:01.0000] <annevk>
(or they can easily be tweaked)

[10:14:02.0000] <annevk>
also, turning on W3C replacements can be done if there's a "this version" with w3.org in it

[10:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could use the doctype to trigger (in)compatibility mode

[10:15:01.0000] <annevk>
(btw, the service is quite a big improvement already, I just want to make it a little better)

[10:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
If it says <!doctype html> then it's written by a cool person and you don't need to bother with all the old compatibility hacks

[10:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also, rather than searching all the text nodes, can't you just run a regular expression over the input document string?

[10:24:00.0000] <billyjack>
hallvord's latest blog post is beautiful

[10:24:01.0000] <billyjack>
definitely prime WTF material

[10:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
"<xsl:text disable-output-escaping="yes"><</xsl:text>" - that doesn't look well-formed - is it just an error in the translation into blog post format?

[10:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
These automated switches seem very Microsoft-esque

[10:31:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: seems to be a my.opera issue

[10:31:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, dunno, it's just convenience for me, and we can provide documentation

[10:40:00.0000] <annevk>
web-apps-tracker cache is pretty close to half a gibibyte, no wonder Hixie had some issues now and then :)

[10:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
You need compression :-)

[10:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
and expiry, I guess

[10:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me 's cache of the issues list is only 27MB, which is boringly small

[10:43:00.0000] <annevk>
why? I've lots of space

[10:43:01.0000] <annevk>
no need for expiry either as a diff between 2 and 3 or so is pretty static

[10:43:02.0000] <annevk>
(unless svn diff changes)

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Will you still have enough space by 2022 if you never delete the old cached files?

[10:44:01.0000] <annevk>
most likely

[10:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
Okay then

[10:45:00.0000] <annevk>
I have another 350 gibibyte

[10:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's, uh, quite a bit

[10:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could download a lot of Linux ISO torrents onto that

[10:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if the issue in http://my.opera.com/hallvors/blog/2008/06/06/extending-the-web-is-hard was posted somewhere where people would see it

[11:01:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: he submitted it to the daily wtf

[11:03:00.0000] <virtuelv>
did I dream this up, or did some guy actually write a c compiler in xslt?

[11:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/dream/nightmare/

[11:07:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, seems to solution is to simply drop support for replace="" ...

[11:11:00.0000] <billyjack>
/me thinks every browser project should have a Hallvord R.M. ... those that don't are severely lacking

[11:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Debugging other people's code is never quite as much fun as debugging your own; and debugging your own is no fun at all

[11:12:01.0000] <billyjack>
yep

[11:30:00.0000] <virtuelv>
fun fact, hallvord is also (or at least used to be) a professional dancer

[11:35:00.0000] <billyjack>
contemporary dance, at that

[11:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish I could just focus on coding app logic and didn't have to figure out deployment mechanics...

[11:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MUST. STOP. PROCRASTINATING.

[12:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Must you stop right now, or could you wait a little while before doing so?

[12:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ooo… Food!

[12:01:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, good idea. :)

[12:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: When will you be arriving to the hotel, roughly?

[12:02:01.0000] <billyjack>
hsivonen: if you could figure out a way to do that, I know  a few product-development organizations that would love to have that insight too

[12:02:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, not quite sure...we are allowed into the room at 14:00 on Friday

[12:02:03.0000] <BenMillard>
erm, I mean Sunday

[12:02:04.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: You have any idea if getting there before you will be any problem?

[12:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hopes not

[12:03:01.0000] <billyjack>
hsivonen: users/customers create all the real problems

[12:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
Developing web services is good if you don't like deployment

[12:03:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I should get there around 16:00

[12:03:04.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, all our names are on the reservation and the payment is done so I imagine it should work out alright.

[12:04:00.0000] <billyjack>
Philip`: I think you meant to refer to Semantic Web technologies

[12:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: one shouldn't define one's product in relation to a competitor. that said, one audience was amused by the text "Even 100% less Flash" in the corner of a slide pitching HTML5

[12:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
billyjack: I agree research technology is easier since you don't need users :-)

[12:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
(although actually the research project I'm working on is intending to release actual code and actual documentation to actual users in the next few months, which is a bit of a pain but quite useful)

[12:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
(although "actual users" actually means "other researchers")

[12:09:00.0000] <billyjack>
once you get real people involved, everything goes all to hell

[12:09:01.0000] <billyjack>
best to keep it all user-free

[12:09:02.0000] <billyjack>
like Ted Nelson's Xanadao

[12:09:03.0000] <billyjack>
Xanado

[12:09:04.0000] <Philip`>
Xanadu?

[12:10:00.0000] <billyjack>
yeah, that one

[12:10:01.0000] <billyjack>
/me notes 03:13am here and at least 3 tall cans of Yebisu

[12:10:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I could take out the reference to Flash

[12:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, is this better:

[12:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
Web standards and browser vendors are rapidly increasing the possibilities with development using web standards like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  New features are currently under  development to to provide designers and developers with more flexibility  for creating great looking, interactive and responsive web sites and applications. This presentation will showcase the latest features that you can begin using now or in the near future to enhance the user e

[12:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
xperience of your site.

[12:13:03.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, that first sentence doesn't work well

[12:13:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: actually, I am developing a Web service

[12:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Just be thankful you're not trying to deliver a standalone desktop Java application to a million users ;-)

[12:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the problem is that when I have some code ready in Eclipse, replacing the process on the server without visible disruptions is the part I don't like

[12:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
My current deployment process requires the server to run the compiler

[12:15:01.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: some might argue for "Web standards suck less than they used to because now smarter people are in position to have more influence over what gets standardized."

[12:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I want a system where my development machine compiles and pushes a tarball over ssh somewhere

[12:16:01.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: though I would not personally endorse any statement like that

[12:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
billyjack: Alternatively, we just have more hindsight now

[12:16:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me thinks in many cases the million users are the people who lose out from anything involving the words "desktop" and "Java"

[12:16:04.0000] <hsivonen>
and then it would be great if "somewhere", some automated thingy replaced the existing process so that the move over to the new process would be undetectable from the outside

[12:17:00.0000] <billyjack>
Philip`: and maybe more foresight too

[12:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think this is better: Browser vendors are working together to develop and implement new, innovative possibilities for developing with web standards like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. ...

[12:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
s/possibilities/features/

[12:17:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Replace "Java" with "Python" if you want, and it's still quite annoying to distribute to end users

[12:17:04.0000] <Philip`>
(Or "Perl" for that matter)

[12:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: No arguments there. Just randomly dissing Java-on-the-desktop :)

[12:18:01.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: implying that browser vendors are doing it alone seems misleading to me

[12:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me has been far happier releasing C++ applications, because it's just an .exe and some .dlls and then it all works, rather than worrying about a zillion module files and poorly-tested executable script wrappers and so on

[12:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me just survided a minor panic when he found an error in an equation from 3.5 years ago, which subsequently turned out to be a typo in the writeup

[12:19:01.0000] <billyjack>
we have perhaps a few cases from the last couple years where browser vendors wouldn't be doing jack unless JS toolkit developers and Gears had not lit a fire under their asses

[12:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, how's this?

[12:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
Browser vendors are working together with the community to develop and implement new, innovative features for developing with web standards like HTML, CSS and JavaScript; aiming to provide designers and developers with more flexibility for creating great looking, interactive and responsive web sites and applications. This presentation will showcase the latest features that you can begin using now or in the near future to enhance the user experience of you

[12:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
r site.

[12:21:03.0000] <jgraham>
billyjack: Not such a great sentence though "Having finally had a fire lit under their asses by js libraries and Google's gears, browser developers are finally coming together and going 'look, we can innovate too'"

[12:21:04.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: What new features are innovative? There's, like, databases which are stone age technology, video which Flash has done for ages, a primitive 2d drawing API, form controls that are slightly less primitive than they used to be, text that you can rotate and animate a bit

[12:21:05.0000] <billyjack>
jgraham: I love that sentence

[12:21:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: here's a translation of the audience-tested Flash reference I had: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/HTML5-percentages.pdf

[12:21:07.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: "great looking, interactive and responsive" doesn't sound right

[12:21:08.0000] <billyjack>
we should carve that in stone

[12:21:09.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, and there's concurrency, which is hardly a novel idea

[12:22:00.0000] <billyjack>
on somebody's tombstone

[12:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(there were many more slides in the presentation)

[12:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
(And taking some old technology X and creating a new technology "X on the Web!" is not innovation)

[12:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Because it's not clear if great is supposed to apply to all three items in the list and because there are already interactive websites

[12:24:00.0000] <billyjack>
Philip`: making video work without relying on third-party plugins seems like real innovation to me

[12:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me wants to go back to the original generic abstract that didn't have so many complications

[12:24:02.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: welcome to the Web

[12:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: What's the talk title?

[12:25:01.0000] <billyjack>
if we could just get rid of all the complications, everything would be so easy

[12:25:02.0000] <Lachy>
the title should probably change now that I've removed the flash stuff

[12:25:03.0000] <Philip`>
billyjack: I don't see how that's innovation - it's just picking up some third-party video rendering libraries and hooking them into your web browser codebase. It's not the kind of thing to make you say "wow, I never would have thought of doing anything like that"

[12:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, allowing authors to control the video using a DOM API using javascript is innovative

[12:26:01.0000] <billyjack>
Philip`: well, OK, Web Sockets is more innovative at least.

[12:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Plugins expose APIs to let JS control the video too

[12:26:03.0000] <gsnedders>
ooo… CSS are playing in Edi!

[12:26:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, wait, I'm in France then. :(

[12:27:00.0000] <billyjack>
/me sees a curve where the most innovative parts of HTML5 are the same part that have near-zero chance of actually getting implemented

[12:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And over 18s only.

[12:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I suck.

[12:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
billyjack: Sockets are old technology, and so "sockets, on the Web!" is not exactly a great innovation :-p

[12:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
Browser vendors are working together with the community to develop and implement new and improved features for developing with web standards like HTML, CSS and JavaScript; aiming to provide designers and developers with more flexibility for creating [insert adjective] web applications applications. This presentation will showcase the latest features that you can begin using now or in the near future to enhance the user experience of your site.

[12:30:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: You should probably start by talking about HTML 5. So something like "HTML 5 is bringing cool exciting stuff to the web meaning that you'll be able to make better webapps than you could before"

[12:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I was intending to cover more than just HTML5

[12:30:03.0000] <jgraham>
s/better/more-desktop-like/

[12:31:00.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: bo-ring

[12:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
billyjack, wtf?

[12:31:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: What? Selectors API? You probably don't need to be precise in the abstract

[12:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
CSS transforms are also on my list

[12:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
Normal people don't care which document a feature is in although they do put some weight on whether it has a blue heading and a W3C logo graphic

[12:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
Just say New develpoments in HTML 5 and CSS or something then. 

[12:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
We're not going to object if you pretend that all the other cool stuff happening on the web is part of HTML 5

[12:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's just good marketing

[12:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
is the Dirac demo content on the Web already? how does the decoder perform in terms of CPU requirements compared to H.264?

[12:33:03.0000] <jgraham>
Are the CSS working group actually going to do CSS transforms?

[12:34:00.0000] <billyjack>
jgraham: I doubt they will

[12:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
It will be pretty ironic to get two interoperable implementations and no working group that will touch it

[12:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
Is anyone else going to do CSS transforms?

[12:34:03.0000] <Lachy>
I hope they will, since webkit and mozilla are implementing them

[12:34:04.0000] <jgraham>
Although I guess irony implies some unexpectedness :(

[12:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, that's the same situation we've had for years with proprietary extensions

[12:35:01.0000] <billyjack>
well, we have the great precedent of the Apple/WebKit guys just doing an absolutely brilliant job on their own of spec'ing out canvas

[12:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
They had to document it in enough detail to put in their patent application, but not much more than that ;-)

[12:36:01.0000] <billyjack>
so I think we should just have faith that they've done an equally good job on CSS tranforms and everybody else should just implement it the way they spec(ed it

[12:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Well eventually much of the useful stuff got picked up. OTOH, how many proprietry extensions had people going up to the W3C and begging them to standardise it, only to be refused?

[12:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
the W3C have a history of refusing things at first, though more recently, they've turned around and done something about some things

[12:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
CSS variables is one case that they often rejected, until recently

[12:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, that's another thing I could talk about

[12:41:00.0000] <billyjack>
I for one fully support the evolution of CSS into a half-assed Turing-complete language

[12:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I don't want CSS to become Turing-complete

[12:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I see no use for it

[12:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
IE8 seems to be evolving away from that, which is good

[12:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
billyjack, if that's what you want, we could go back to that old JavaScript style sheets proposal that came from Netscape, IIRC

[12:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
Eh, I thought CSS variables were more like CSS constants meaning you could do things like defining a shade of grey and using it everywhere

[12:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: or XSLT or DSSSL

[12:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, no, XSLT is complicated and DSSSL is hard to say

[12:44:01.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: i'm for anything that would save use from selectors syntax

[12:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
why? what's wrong with selector syntax?

[12:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Presumably they're using the mathematical meaning of "variable", which is just a rebindable named constant

[12:44:04.0000] <Lachy>
it's significantly better than xpath

[12:45:00.0000] <billyjack>
Lachy: nothing. it's absolutely perfect. you're riht

[12:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[12:46:00.0000] <billyjack>
the relative logic and regularity of xpath syntax is a serious misfeature

[12:47:00.0000] <billyjack>
we should all prefer arbitrary symbols reminiscent of perl

[12:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
namespaces make XPath much worse

[12:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
what logic in xpath? It's so confusing, and I can never get it right the first time

[12:47:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me approves of anything reminiscent of Perl

[12:47:04.0000] <hsivonen>
we should all do s-expressions instead of these angular tags

[12:47:05.0000] <billyjack>
perl++

[12:48:00.0000] <billyjack>
hsivonen: rms++

[12:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
billyjack: I think you mean $perl++

[12:48:02.0000] <billyjack>
heh

[12:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Hooray for magic increment operator!)

[12:48:04.0000] <Philip`>
(++$perl is sadly non-magic, if I'm remembering it the right way around)

[12:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so will Perl 6 be Ready before 2022?

[12:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, maybe they're both magic)

[12:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: What does "Ready" mean? I wrote and executed a Perl 6 program two years ago, and it even worked

[12:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
albeit extremely slowly, in an interpreter written in Haskell

[12:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
and several basic language features weren't implemented

[12:50:03.0000] <Philip`>
but it worked

[12:50:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: was the Haskell interpreter for Perl syntax or for Parrot bytecode?

[12:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It was just Haskell, no Parrot

[12:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: someone must have had fun writing the whole parser in Haskell

[12:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: They intentionally optimised for fun

[12:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I guess it's Ready when Linux distros install Perl 6 by default and users don't install Perl 5 anymore

[12:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/7996

[12:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
clearly, Perl 5 is Ready compared to Perl 4 by now

[12:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's largely because almost nobody used Perl 4

[12:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
but now almost everybody uses Perl 5

[12:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
so there's rather a lot more legacy

[12:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
(And I think Perl 5 was mostly a superset of Perl 4, which isn't true of 6 vs 5)

[12:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
(so it's probably better to think of Perl 6 as an independent language, like Python or Ruby but crazier)

[12:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
how is this now?

[12:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
New developments in web standards like HTML, CSS and JavaScript are aiming to provide designers and developers with more flexibility for creating and enhancing web sites and applications. This presentation will showcase the latest features currently being implemented in browsers, including new JavaScript APIs, improved multimedia support and CSS.

[12:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
will CPAN fork?

[12:57:03.0000] <jgraham>
s/are aiming to/will/

[12:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[12:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure how one "enhances" a website

[12:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
they do it by using the new features

[12:58:03.0000] <jgraham>
But don't actually use the word "will" because you use it later

[12:58:04.0000] <Lachy>
what's wrong with "are aiming to"?

[12:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
It sounds too much like we might fail. Plus its not really true, we've already suceeded in as much as its been implemented in some places

[13:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
You're trying to get people to come so be positive

[13:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
Why "more flexibility"?

[13:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
cause it sounded good

[13:00:03.0000] <jgraham>
Would something like "better tools" work?

[13:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I don't want flexibility, I want goodness)

[13:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[13:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No idea - there's a cpan6.org, but it sounds like that's not trying to be a CPAN for Perl 6 any more

[13:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
New developments in web standards like HTML, CSS and JavaScript are providing designers and developers with better tools for creating and enhancing web sites and applications. This presentation will showcase the latest features currently being implemented in browsers, including new JavaScript APIs, improved multimedia support and CSS.

[13:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I think you could s/and enhancing/ with some adjectives describing the types of web sites. Like "advanced". But maybe that's cutting out the fact that it also works for simple sites

[13:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/applications/web applications/

[13:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
I tried using some adjective there before, but people complained

[13:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think that was me :)

[13:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
I didn't want to say "web sites and web applications"

[13:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
Otherwise, it sounds good. I would add version numbers to the specs

[13:05:02.0000] <jgraham>
HTML 5 CSS 3 and JS 2

[13:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe it reads better without web repeated

[13:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, JS 2 is just the name of Mozilla's implementation of JavaScript, and I'm really referring to DOM APIs

[13:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
but the term JavaScript seems a bit more marketable than DOM

[13:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
I thought JS2 == Ecmascript 3.1, these days, which is what I assumed you meant

[13:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
If you just mean DOM, don't say anything. You say javascript APIs later

[13:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
JS2 is an implementation of ES3

[13:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well whatever, but I would still expect your talk to include information about ES3.1 based on that abstract

[13:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
New developments in web standards like HTML 5 and CSS 3 are providing designers and developers with better tools for creating and enhancing web sites and applications. This presentation will showcase the latest features currently being implemented in browsers, including new JavaScript APIs, improved multimedia support and CSS.

[13:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
I still don't like "and enhancing" but otherwise it sounds good

[13:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't have anything to replace it with

[13:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well I'm going home now so there's not much I can do about it :)

[13:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me looks up a thesaurus

[14:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders how on earth to start a personal statement

[14:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(the current start is from lack of any better non-cliché idea)

[14:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What would you think if I just removed the first sentence?

[14:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hahaha. Yeah, jgraham, I did mean to say _why_ I missed school.

[14:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I wanted to go to bed by the time I wrote that :)

[15:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What do you think of just switching phys./comp.sci. around?

[15:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: In case nobody has mentioned this already: The first two paragraphs seem to have a fair amount of irrelevant details - the reader isn't going to bother visiting a web site so there's no point giving URLs, and they don't care about the exact names of groups or software

[15:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also it seems a bad idea to list things that you don't know - I expect it'd be much better to describe something you didn't know, but took the initiative to learn yourself

[15:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe you could start with the bit about why you're interested in physics and CS because you like understanding all the details of how a system works, and then go onto the more specific bits about interesting physicsy things and experience with computery stuff

[15:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also it might be good to go into more detail about what was involved in working in (presumably) a group on SimplePie, like how many other people were involved and what responsibilities you had, since everyone says teamwork is a good thing to say you can demonstrate

[15:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: email plz :P

[15:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I've got bored of thinking of things to say now :-p

[16:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
can anyone think of anything I should add to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#text2 other than stuff specific to the attributes listed in the penultimate paragraph of that section?

[16:01:00.0000] <annevk>
shouldn't it remove more line characters?

[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
like what?

[16:03:01.0000] <annevk>
CR?

[16:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
CR isn't a line break character in html5 is it?

[16:03:03.0000] <annevk>
you can insert it through the DOM

[16:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure but i mean it's no different than inserting a U+000\1

[16:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
U+0001 even

[16:04:02.0000] <annevk>
it's counted as a space character

[16:04:03.0000] <annevk>
FF too btw

[16:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, "If the input element is not dirty then set...", can you link the word dirty to the definition of the dirty state

[16:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
dirty flag*

[16:09:00.0000] <annevk>
"The autocomplete attribute is an enumerated attribute." enumerated attribute is not a pointer

[16:09:01.0000] <annevk>
prolly because the dfn is plural

[16:11:00.0000] <annevk>
that's not it

[16:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Switching the phy/comp sci around might help 

[16:11:02.0000] <annevk>
it simply misses <span>

[16:11:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if gsnedders is actually around atm

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: fixed the dirty flag and enumerated attribute xref problems

[16:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
looks like IE strips \n and \r and leaves everything else

[16:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i'll do that

[16:13:00.0000] <annevk>
I expected as much :)

[16:27:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, having a normative table that says which attributes can be specified on <input> depending on the state would be much better than two paragraphs at the end of each state

[16:28:00.0000] <annevk>
as you did in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#summary

[16:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i was thinking of having both

[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
the paragraph is useful because then it's right there

[16:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
with the rest of the state's definition

[16:29:02.0000] <annevk>
I suppose

[16:29:03.0000] <annevk>
if you can keep it all in sync :)

[16:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
wf2 had two too

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
it had the table in the appendix and a paragraph for each atribute

[16:31:00.0000] <annevk>
so is each attribute also getting a paragraph stating for what states it can be used?

[16:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
no

[16:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can find out who autocomplete is applicable to by clicking teh definition of the attribute

[16:34:00.0000] <annevk>
fair enough, I suppose

[16:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
gotta go

[16:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder where they got the idea that we dropped the repetition model

[17:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, we will, but i hadn't planned to do it until later

[17:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose i have already removed move-up and so forth

[17:48:00.0000] <hober>
Is anyone planning on observing any of the tag's 1.5 days of html5 discussion while @ tpac?

[17:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh these are tpac agenda items?

[17:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
i thought it was for their meeting next week

[17:55:02.0000] <hober>
oh

[17:55:03.0000] <hober>
yeah, didn't notice they had a separate f2f

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: ok, made a table for you

[21:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i can't find any news about requiem for itunes 8

[21:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
heard anything?

[22:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me installs freeenode just so he can see if there's an update

[22:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
apparently the guy is working on it

[23:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[23:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/mid/c9e12660809172229u79084b7dv5d57e18e2834e5f6⊙mgc

[23:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
some people have issues

[23:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
and then there's this guy

[23:49:00.0000] <weinig>
/me boggles

[23:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I actually replied to that - perhaps somewhat foolishly

[00:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: nice reply

[00:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, no news about requiem yet, the project page on freenet says he's working on it.

[00:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i installed freenet to find that out

[00:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[00:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
freenet is somewhat simpler to set up than it was four years ago

[00:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
but it's still a giant pain in the ass

[00:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
felt much faster though

[00:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what's requiem?

[00:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
there's a possibility that backing up the iTunes 7 key files, changing the path in the requiem source to use the backup instead and recompiling may work, however, I've been unable to test it because the free songs of the week have been iTunes Plus songs

[00:36:02.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, a utility for stripping FairPlay DRM from iTunes purchases

[00:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me covers his ears lest hearing of such things leads him into sin

[00:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I generally avoid buying songs with DRM on them

[00:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
so do I, but videos aren't available with DRM yet

[00:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but the fact that non-iTunes stores can offer them now but not iTMS due to the labels being jerks kind of annoys me

[00:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
music isn't the problem, i'm happy to buy music at amazon

[00:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
to the degree that it has reduced my level of music purchasing

[00:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
(though i do always check itunes first since it's so much easier)

[00:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
(and my girlfriend's reaction to hearing about requiem put me in a quandry -- "so... does that mean it's ok to buy songs from itunes that aren't tunes plus again?"

[00:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wasn't sure what to answer.)

[00:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, another possibility is to just keep iTunes 7 on one machine, or even in a virtual machne, specifically for stripping DRM, and putting iTunes 8 on your other machines

[00:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I only check iTunes because I don't want to be party to the labels trying to blackmail it so they can reduce its market power and then reimpose DRM and add crappy pricing policies

[00:40:04.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that "international later this year" meant approximately two English-speaking countries

[00:40:05.0000] <hsivonen>
(for movie rentals)

[00:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if the unavailability of TV shows and movies over here is contractual stupidity or if Apple feels it couldn't sell untranslated content

[00:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: right now i have a cron job that automatically decrypts videos each morning

[00:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
do you buy videos that frequently?

[00:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it would be way harder to do that if said job had to find encrypted data, move it to another partition, etc

[00:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[00:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
i watch stargate every week, and buy a couple of daily shows a week at laest

[00:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
and my girlfriend buys more for herself

[00:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
we have 718 tv shows on our main library

[00:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
and that doesn't include her latest stuf

[00:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
f

[00:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
(all bought from itunes)

[00:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
speaking of which i really should move her stuff to the main library

[00:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I guess from daily show we can calculate the negative value you put on the ads of the free'online versions

[00:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are four things that make me get the (paid) itunes version over the (free) web version

[00:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
1. the paid version is a standalone MPEG, and thus can be viewed offline, viewed on my ipod, viewed over a network on a remote itunes install, etc.

[00:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
(whereas the free version is stuck in a browser in a flash container)

[00:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
2. the free version has ads.

[00:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
3. the free version has unskippable content.

[00:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
4. the paid version is much easier to obtain (the itunes store is easier to navigate than the web site, possibly because when i want to watch tv i'm usually already in itunes, and not looking at a web site)

[00:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
#4 doesn't look good for the open web :-)

[00:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
if itunes had a free version with ads embedded, but otherwise was the same as now (ads skippable, no restriction on use, etc) i would probably watch that instead of the paid one

[00:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
4 is not a technology issue

[00:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
someone could make a web version of the itunes store

[00:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
sadly the state of ui design on the web is generally horrific

[00:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
for that to happen, you would have to convince the marketing dept. that allowing users to skip ads won't reduce the number of people that pay attention to them anyway

[00:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
eventually the ads will have to be embedded as an intrinsic part of the content

[00:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so that you cannot skip them even mentally

[00:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(i.e. product placement)

[00:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
some of the best Apple ads are seeing flashes of brushed aluminum cases on the teevee

[00:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: you really can't miss the ads in the free version. they are so repetitive.

[00:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm don't even know what the daily show is

[00:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
is this the one? http://www.thedailyshow.com/

[00:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: yes

[00:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I've seen a few clips of that on youtube before

[00:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: see, I knew I shouldn't have replied

[00:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
the daily show is arguably the best (and one of only a few) political satire shows in the US

[01:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's a satire?

[01:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
well, maybe satire is wrong

[01:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
colbert is satire

[01:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
daily show is probably just straight comedy

[01:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
it is very tame compared to european political comedy (e.g. have i got news for you, john bird and john fortune, etc)

[01:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
but sadly it's all we've got really

[01:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
if it's mostly political stuff, I'll avoid it. I have no interest in US politics, even though I hear about it from so many places already

[01:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah if you don't care about US politics the daily show (and colbert) isn't for you

[01:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't care about politics in general, regardless of what country it is.

[01:38:00.0000] <annevk>
colbert is awesome

[01:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
colbert is ok

[01:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
but he gets repetitive

[01:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
and shouts a lot

[01:44:03.0000] <annevk>
i haven't seen too much of him

[01:44:04.0000] <annevk>
mostly the white house thingy and that's great

[01:44:05.0000] <othermaciej>
he is personally funnier than John Stewart

[01:44:06.0000] <othermaciej>
but his show can be uneven

[01:44:07.0000] <othermaciej>
IMO

[01:44:08.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i've got 22.4 horus of him in my itunes library :-)

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: agreed

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
hours

[01:55:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, garrett smith lost it again

[02:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I don't think he ever found it

[02:01:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm, is Mozilla gaining a second XHR? https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=450452 :/

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders what happened to the days when they tried to follow standards

[02:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: isn't XHR without the DOM what was the plan for workers?

[02:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we're going to do the same for workers

[02:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think most would agree it is the right thing to do

[02:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is everyone going to call it XMLHttpRequest for compatibility, though?

[02:22:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, Web Workers has a nicer solution for that

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/#interface

[02:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: what am I missing?

[02:24:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm ok, Mozilla does seem to call it XMLHttpRequest as seen from code

[02:24:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe I'm missing something

[02:25:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, it seemed to me that doing what Web Workers defined was simpler than having a second XHR impl

[02:26:00.0000] <annevk>
lots of duplicate code now

[02:26:01.0000] <annevk>
which basically means you have to run the testsuite in both contexts I suppose in some way

[02:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
should not be hard to make a Workers version

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: wasn't it the expectation that C++-based browsers would have to duplicate some code?

[02:28:01.0000] <annevk>
I missed that discussion I'm afraid

[02:32:00.0000] <annevk>
in somewhat related news, this, together with native JSON support in XHR and postMessage in due course, will kill XML even more

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems to me that the document-oriented stuff is gravitating back towards HTML and the data oriented stuff is going to JSON

[02:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
however, doing document fragments over JSON sucks

[02:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's like RSS all over again

[02:35:02.0000] <aboodman>
having a DOMParser and XMLSerializer in workeres seems useful to me

[02:35:03.0000] <aboodman>
but everyone said it was hard

[02:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I renew my prediction that someone will create a pure-JS DOMParser and DOM for workers

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk>
people have already created complete DOM wrappers without workers :)

[02:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would not be as hard if one were willing to make every single worker a separate process

[02:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: has anyone written a conforming XML parser (not regexp hack) in JS yet?

[02:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I think that is kind of expensive

[02:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: or if one were willing to develop a second DOM impl in C++

[02:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well but that's a lot of work

[02:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why dom implementations have to require locking to be thread safe

[02:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
probably even more than making the DOM threadsafe at least at the separate document level

[02:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
what global state is there?

[02:39:04.0000] <roc>
caches

[02:39:05.0000] <othermaciej>
the global state is not intrinsic in the spec

[02:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
so long as you can never pass a dom node to another thread, what's the concern?

[02:39:07.0000] <othermaciej>
caches, global resource pools

[02:39:08.0000] <roc>
atomized strings and other objects

[02:39:09.0000] <othermaciej>
that kind of thing

[02:39:10.0000] <othermaciej>
I bet the set of things is similar in Gecko and WebKit

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
atomised strings seem like they'd be trivial to make threadsafe, given that they're readonly

[02:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I bet furthermore that most people know the likely suspects but not all of them

[02:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
though i guess you need locking to create them

[02:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the hashtable used to atomize is not read-only

[02:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
or are the refcounts read-only

[02:40:05.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: aren't nsIAtoms thread safe already?

[02:40:06.0000] <Hixie>
ah, if they have bound lifetimes, sure

[02:40:07.0000] <aboodman>
roc: how much of xhr impl is going to be shared between the worker and nonworker variants?

[02:40:08.0000] <Hixie>
though ref counting atoms seems like an unnecessary cost

[02:40:09.0000] <Hixie>
but what do i know

[02:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you'd also have to make sure the Worker DOM can never ever load external resources

[02:41:01.0000] <roc>
aboodman: no idea!

[02:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or you just pulled the cache in

[02:41:03.0000] <aboodman>
seems like an opp for bugs.

[02:44:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: I don't believe so

[02:45:00.0000] <roc>
you could make all the global storage for DOM optimizations thread-local. No idea what the performance hit would be

[02:45:01.0000] <aboodman>
we could add the x later

[02:45:02.0000] <aboodman>
it just seems silly to call it xhr initially, when there is no x involved :)

[02:45:03.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: ok. I thought they were thread safe and someone suggested making them not thread safe for perf

[02:45:04.0000] <aboodman>
maybe we should add the api now, and just have it throw not implemented?

[02:47:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: it looks like that suggestion was implemented last year :-) https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=387445

[02:47:01.0000] <annevk>
aboodman, the name is just an historical artifact

[02:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
which process are Gears workers in when a Chrome WebKit process spawns one?

[02:47:03.0000] <aboodman>
all plugins (including gears) run in their own process

[02:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: ok. so my memory isn't completely broken but I'm behind the times

[02:48:01.0000] <aboodman>
annevk: i know, but now it is getting even sillier.

[02:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
aboodman: per-plugin instance process or a shared plug-in host process?

[02:49:00.0000] <roc>
aboodman: is it true that V8 can only instantiate one single-thread JS runtime per process?

[02:49:01.0000] <annevk>
aboodman, just think of it as "URLRequest"

[02:49:02.0000] <aboodman>
annevk: heh, ok.

[02:49:03.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: I had to look it up --- my memory *is* completely broken

[02:49:04.0000] <roc>
well not really. It's just full.

[02:50:00.0000] <aboodman>
roc: not really, i mean, workers all run in threads in one process.

[02:50:01.0000] <aboodman>
but, the locking is rather coarse.

[02:50:02.0000] <aboodman>
i think they are working on making it finer.

[02:51:00.0000] <roc>
so no concurrent JS execution?

[02:51:01.0000] <aboodman>
i don't think so. i'm not super familiar with it.

[02:51:02.0000] <aboodman>
i believe right now it only yields at io.

[02:52:00.0000] <roc>
ok, that's what I heard. It seemed strange given that Workers have been on the radar for a while

[02:53:00.0000] <aboodman>
yeah, maybe something that just hasn't been tackled yet.

[02:53:01.0000] <aboodman>
i mean, workers aren't 'on the radar' for us

[02:53:02.0000] <aboodman>
they actually exist

[02:54:00.0000] <roc>
/me wonders how long it will be before JS engines are competing on scalability across stupidly-large numbers of processor cores

[02:54:01.0000] <roc>
yeah, exactyl

[02:54:02.0000] <roc>
which is why I was suprise

[02:54:03.0000] <roc>
d

[02:55:00.0000] <annevk>
it would be nice if the <canvas> API worked in a thread

[02:55:01.0000] <annevk>
so you can create fractals and then pass them over when they're done :)

[02:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a document that explains the interfaces between Gears and the host browsers and what Gears reimplments and what it reuses?

[02:55:03.0000] <aboodman>
freaking france.

[02:56:00.0000] <aboodman>
so i just did a quick test on chrome and i got concurrent js execution

[02:56:01.0000] <roc>
annevk: you can fill up a string with encoded values

[02:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
V8 does look like it supports multithreading, since it's got a load of references to the word "thread" and mutexes and things

[02:56:03.0000] <aboodman>
so i'm not sure, maybe they have already improved it

[02:56:04.0000] <aboodman>
or maybe they interleave the pumps of the message queue

[02:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
last I heard, V8 only supports semi multithreading with one thread running at a time but the potential to ield around I/O

[02:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
aboodman: how does Gears take over the network layer in Chrome btw?

[02:58:00.0000] <aboodman>
there is an extension to npapi

[02:58:01.0000] <aboodman>
called cpapi

[02:58:02.0000] <annevk>
roc, true, though having something like, canvas = new DOMCanvas(w, h) that supports the same as <canvas> might be nice

[02:58:03.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: then you'd need a threadsafe way to pass over the image data

[02:58:04.0000] <othermaciej>
so it would have to be either full copy or copy in write

[02:58:05.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, data URLs

[02:58:06.0000] <Philip`>
Most of the non-pointless computation-intensive worker uses (e.g. computing fractals) seem to involve quite large amounts of IO between the worker and main thread, which doesn't sound exactly great for performance

[02:59:00.0000] <aboodman>
hsivonen: i don't understand the question

[02:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: encoding and decoding data URLs is weak sauce for large images

[03:00:00.0000] <roc>
aboodman: hmm, see http://groups.google.com/group/v8-users/browse_thread/thread/482575a1186e8cba/855fef2fa7de58b8?lnk=gst&q=thread#855fef2fa7de58b8

[03:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: you just need an efficient way to transfer a large buffer when the worker is done

[03:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
probably some sort of ByteArray w/ underlying threadsafe copy-on-write when transferred

[03:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if we wanted to design for this, we could define a way for an object to be transferred, just like we do with message ports

[03:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i don't think off-thread image construction is a critical case though

[03:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there's no good way to represent generic binary data right now anyway

[03:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
something to think about as we try to add binary data to the platform

[03:01:03.0000] <hsivonen>
aboodman: is there a document that explains the integration to the host browser, like APIs used, etc.?

[03:01:04.0000] <aboodman>
roc: watching the behavior (not looking at the code), my guess is that there is a lock around every message queue dispatch on any thread.

[03:02:00.0000] <aboodman>
so only one thread is running at a time

[03:02:01.0000] <aboodman>
does not take advantage of multicore :(

[03:02:02.0000] <othermaciej>
JavaScriptCore can actually run JS code on multiple threads in parallel

[03:02:03.0000] <aboodman>
i think this will eventually improve

[03:02:04.0000] <othermaciej>
and our Worker implementation in WebKit will do so

[03:02:05.0000] <roc>
so does Spidermonkey/TM

[03:02:06.0000] <aboodman>
othermaciej: what can i say, you guys rox

[03:02:07.0000] <othermaciej>
presumably the V8 likely reimplementation will have to back that out and add locking and stuff

[03:03:00.0000] <aboodman>
othermaciej: why?

[03:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: is the name of the whole engine going to stay as spidermonkey or is tracing so big a deal that the name of the engine is changing to tracemonkey?

[03:03:02.0000] <roc>
no idea

[03:03:03.0000] <othermaciej>
aboodman: well unless V8 is able to run JS code on multiple threads concurrently for real by then

[03:03:04.0000] <aboodman>
hsivonen: no, sorry

[03:03:05.0000] <othermaciej>
though I did not get the impression that this was in any way planned

[03:03:06.0000] <hsivonen>
aboodman: ok. :-( 

[03:03:07.0000] <aboodman>
hsivonen: did you have a specific question?

[03:04:00.0000] <roc>
Spidermonkey can actually share arbitary JS objects between threads, which as far as I can tell is pretty stupid

[03:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that is kind of stupid

[03:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
JSC can't

[03:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
our threading is designed for full concurrency in the shared-nothing message-passing style case

[03:04:04.0000] <hsivonen>
aboodman: I have two: Does Gears reuse the host JS engine. And why does Gears show up on the list of NPAPI plug-ins if it's not one (or is it)?

[03:04:05.0000] <aboodman>
othermaciej: can't we just add a #if USE(V8) or something that waits for a lock before pumping messages?

[03:04:06.0000] <aboodman>
to webcore

[03:04:07.0000] <Philip`>
/me uses SpiderMonkey in multiple threads but has a completely separate runtime in each

[03:05:00.0000] <aboodman>
it seems like a pretty minor change

[03:05:01.0000] <roc>
I think I heard that there are certain Spidermonkey embedders that depend on that feature :-(

[03:05:02.0000] <aboodman>
hsivonen: let's take this into private chat to avoid annoying people

[03:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
aboodman: I do not get what you mean

[03:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
what I was trying to say is that WebKit

[03:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
's workers will support execution of JS on multiple threads concurrently for real

[03:06:03.0000] <roc>
BTW, the best way to compute fractals I've seen is to run them on the GPU with Vlad's Canvas3D :-)

[03:06:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but likely not the V8 version when/if Google reimplements it using V8

[03:07:00.0000] <roc>
Mandelbrot and other per-pixel iterators, anyway

[03:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
since V8 can't support actually running actual code in parallel, it only does coop threads effectively

[03:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Only if by "best" you don't mind being incompatible with most people's GPU hardware :-)

[03:08:00.0000] <roc>
yeah yeah

[03:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shader languages are a good way to do it

[03:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
most modern machines can support them

[03:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but

[03:09:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think there is a safe way to expose that capability to untrusted code from the Web

[03:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(other than as canned effects)

[03:09:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me 's first attempt at Canvas3D code only worked on NVIDIA on Windows, and failed on OS X because the drivers lacked a GLSL bug

[03:10:00.0000] <aboodman>
sorry, i am at a conference and the network sucks here.

[03:10:01.0000] <roc>
I think in principle, untrusted shaders should be OK

[03:10:02.0000] <roc>
in practice, drivers probably suck and crash in exploitable ways

[03:11:00.0000] <roc>
/me hasn't been able to find someone with the cycles to do that testing

[03:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
The current Canvas3D implementation seems to basically ignore the whole exploitability protection thing

[03:12:00.0000] <roc>
yep

[03:12:01.0000] <roc>
well

[03:12:02.0000] <roc>
it "makes optimistic assumptions"

[03:12:03.0000] <Philip`>
Like it assumes the content is not hostile? :-)

[03:13:00.0000] <roc>
again, in principle shaders can't read or write to system memory and errors should be trapped by the driver

[03:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
Some of my non-hostile content ended up getting random bytes of stack data from a function call :-(

[03:13:02.0000] <roc>
but we sure aren't enabling it for Web content by default without a lot more analysis

[03:14:00.0000] <aboodman>
othermaciej: yes, workers in chrome won't support true js concurrency until v8 does.

[03:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
There are enough differences in shader implementations between drivers that even if it was perfectly secure, it seems a really bad idea for interoperability - I don't want sites to require NVIDIA hardware, and I don't want to write sites myself that I can only test on NVIDIA and that totally break on other hardware

[03:18:00.0000] <roc>
I presuppose a future where drivers are less buggy

[03:18:01.0000] <roc>
but maybe "shaders" are a dead end and we'll just have different kinds of "cores" to run C code on

[03:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: Apple had some OpenGL extensions that were supposed to abstract away nvidia/ati/intel difference. do those extensions really work so that the user won't notice?

[03:19:00.0000] <annevk_m>
Hixie, should Password allow list=""?

[03:19:01.0000] <roc>
GL doesn't need extensions to abstract away differences

[03:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I would guess to the extent drivers consider security, it is in terms of protecting the kernel and privileged processes from normal apps

[03:19:03.0000] <roc>
there's already a common shader langauge

[03:19:04.0000] <roc>
it's just implemented poorly

[03:19:05.0000] <othermaciej>
not protecting normal apps from programs they run on the GPU

[03:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that being said many drivers have bugs whereby doing certain things could take the system down

[03:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
has anyone tried to come up with a canvas 3d abstraction that was in between the Opera and Mozilla levels of closeness to OpenGL?

[03:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Have you seen Larrabee? (which is Intel's idea of sticking a load of fast Pentium cores with 512-bit SIMD onto a chip, and then just writing graphics rendering software in C (or whatever language you want) and running it on there)

[03:23:01.0000] <roc>
I haven't actually seen one no

[03:23:02.0000] <roc>
I know about it

[03:24:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: if you want to support GPU programming then you need a language to write those programs in

[03:24:01.0000] <roc>
it's unclear why you'd want to create a new language rather than choose an existing one

[03:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: ideally, one wouldn't want a new language, but there seems to be a need for sandboxing capabilities

[03:25:01.0000] <roc>
there isn't really

[03:26:00.0000] <roc>
GLSL doesn't provide any facilities to access system memory or execute arbitrary code

[03:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
though I admit I don't really know anything about modern OpenGL shaders

[03:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I haven't programmed anything with OpenGL in 6 years

[03:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
would it be feasible for a browser to sanitize shaders? or are the bugs underneath too crazy?

[03:28:00.0000] <roc>
if the problems are all driver bugs, it's not clear how you sanitize against that

[03:28:01.0000] <roc>
maybe you can parse the code and re-emit it in some clean format to protect against driver parser issues

[03:29:00.0000] <roc>
maybe add some simple resource limits

[03:29:01.0000] <roc>
I dunno

[03:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
When you've parsed the code you can also check that e.g. all the external function calls are valid standard ones

[03:31:00.0000] <roc>
I guess so

[03:31:01.0000] <roc>
I don't know what kind of dangerous external function calls there might be

[03:31:02.0000] <roc>
you obviously can't call regular functions

[03:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm just thinking about interoperability again, e.g. if someone calls the function "clamp" then complain because it shouldn't exist even if the GL driver accepts it

[03:35:00.0000] <roc>
good point

[03:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's also the issue that not all implementors want to use GL (because e.g. on Windows the DirectX drivers are better, and on some devices (like consoles) there isn't quite an OpenGL implementation at all)

[03:36:01.0000] <roc>
yeah

[03:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
and translating GLSL programs into HLSL is not the most desirable of things to do

[03:37:00.0000] <roc>
but that gets back to the issue where if you're going to have a language, what do you do?

[03:37:01.0000] <roc>
implementing GLSL on D3D may suck, but does it suck more than implementing a new language on every stack?

[03:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and using something unstandardised like Cg is probably not a good idea either)

[03:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
OpenCL!

[03:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't really want OpenCL in a browser :-p

[03:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a sound techincal reason for D3D to exist or is it just a strategy thing?

[03:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't sure how to nicely do anything except not have programmable shaders, which would be quite annoying

[03:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: OpenGL is not sufficiently technically capable of excluding Microsoft's competition

[03:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: OpenGL has too much legacy cruft and too many users who don't want it to make their 15-year-old CAD programs stop working, so it's poorly suited to modern hardware and very hard to fix

[03:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
same kind of technical reasons as there are behind C#, VC-1, Managed C++, Silverlight, and other such sterling Microsoft technical initiatives

[03:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
or at least that's what people were saying when OpenGL 3.0 turned out to be really boring

[03:42:02.0000] <aaronlev>
hsivonen: have you thought about integrating validator.nu into tools like Komodo or Eclipse, for source-level error highlighting as you type?

[03:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aaronlev: It has occurred to me that it could be done, but I don't have concrete plans of doing it myself

[03:50:00.0000] <roc>
ah, the solution is staring us in the face

[03:50:01.0000] <roc>
we should write Web shaders in JS

[03:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: no, but i've already fixed the spec

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what julian had in mind (re his latest e-mail)

[03:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would love to have validator.nu support in the WebKit Web inspector

[03:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
wonder if xenon can be convinced

[03:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but we might need error messages in a good machine-parsable format to display them nicely, if we want to do more than just send you to the results page

[03:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: resolving issues according to calendar?

[04:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: does out=xml, out=gnu or out=json count as a good machine-parseable format?

[04:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: dunno, have not studied any of those, but they might well be

[04:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
roc: I'm not entirely sure how you'd implement e.g. eval() on a GPU

[04:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the validator.nu vim integration uses out=gnu, AFAIK

[04:06:03.0000] <Philip`>
and I don't think we'll convince the GPU manufacturers to design a hardware implementation of a JS interpreter

[04:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
although it'd be pretty cool if we did

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be the obvious evolution of the current JS performance increases

[04:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: wouldn't their HW impl have the same expected level of bugs as the current shader lang impl?

[04:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No, since they would be designing it to be used by JS programmers (who are often incompetent or malicious), whereas current shader languages are designed to be used (indirectly) by C programmers (who are also often incompetent or malicious but already have complete user-space access to the machine so it doesn't matter if you give them a few more ways to crash)

[04:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wants a JS engine that JITs to Verilog

[04:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: resolving how?

[04:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: forcing a decision maybe. I don't know.

[04:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that someone already suggested allowing something like ctx2d.globalCompositeOperation = function (src,dest) { ... }

[04:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: if he has something that he thinks is high priority, why doesn't he just tell me what it is?

[04:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
seems hard for hsivonen to answer that question

[04:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[04:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
it was mostly rhetorical

[04:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
as for DanC, I think he believes certain issues have been discussed in enough detail and can be closed after the WG has made a decision

[04:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
at least, that's the impression I get from telcons

[04:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I didn't read Chris's response to my flamage because I am worried it will piss me off more and I am close to my monthly stress quota

[04:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(about deciding things in telecons)

[04:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't recall it being worthy of such worry

[04:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
ah, http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/dns-prefetching explains the <meta name=dns> feature

[04:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
(which was killed in http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=1538&to=1539 fwiw)

[04:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually the two are unrelated

[04:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, they're both caused by content teams within google lamenting the slow speed of dns

[04:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you mean "unrelated" as in they do different things, or unrelated as in you had a similar idea totally by coincidence?

[04:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
but the feature that was in html5 and the feature in chrome weren't developed in tandem

[04:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so neither, in answer to your question

[04:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: the idea was had due to the same impetus, and they do similar things, but they weren't caused by each other

[04:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
mmmkay

[04:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
Web servers should parse the HTML they're serving, and pre-resolve all the DNS names into IPs before sending it to the browser

[04:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
(though i did advise the chrome team on their dns prefetching feature)

[04:42:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think dns prefetch will be merged to mainline WebKit at some point but the initial patch had some implementation issues

[04:42:05.0000] <annevk2>
the <meta> hack on that page looks terrible

[04:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in that it hooked DNS prefetch into the style system

[04:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: how so? it's just doing the same thing as the http header

[04:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh wow, the example suggests you can interleave <meta> and <a>, that's crazy

[04:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder who came up with that

[04:44:02.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, are those four separate examples or one example were the <meta> affects the preceding link?

[04:44:03.0000] <othermaciej>
ah, looks like it is being rewritten

[04:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
aboodman2: dude, we should fix that

[04:44:05.0000] <Hixie>
and by "we" i mean "you" :-P

[04:44:06.0000] <othermaciej>
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20690> for those playing along at home

[04:45:00.0000] <annevk2>
if we're going to have this feature can't we drop the x from the start?

[04:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i told them to put the x- in so that people wouldn't think google was trying to take over http or anything

[04:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i also told them they should bring it up in the httpwg

[04:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno if they have done that yet

[04:47:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: doesn't http://c.validator.nu/all/ include http://c.validator.nu/usemap/ ?

[04:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, fair enough

[05:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: according to code, it should. is there behavior that suggests otherwise?

[05:06:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: the about page says otherwise

[05:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: oops. thanks

[05:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: fixed. thanks

[05:40:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://www.w3.org/2007/09/19-xhtml-minutes.html#action09

[05:40:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm, so parsing <script> as CDATA in text/html is a bug?

[05:41:00.0000] <annevk2>
haha

[05:43:00.0000] <Lachy_>
zcorpan_, no, that doesn't appear to be what they're saying

[05:44:00.0000] <Lachy_>
since this mail that they're referring to is talking about XHTML http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html-editor/2007JulSep/0031

[05:44:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy_: "The example 'correct' code in sec. 4.8 does not work in either Firefox or IE" clearly means he tested text/html

[05:45:00.0000] <Lachy_>
yeah, but it's XHTML, so it shouldn't be using text/html, so that's irrelevant

[05:45:01.0000] <Lachy_>
it's correct without having to comment out the <![CDATA[ and ]]> markers

[05:45:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
so their reply should be "you're using text/html, the spec is talking about how to do it in xml", not "that's a bug in browsers that should be fixed and not documented in our spec"

[05:46:00.0000] <Lachy_>
yeah

[05:53:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
grddl discussion a bit up is interesting -- profile isn't good enough for xhtml2

[05:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Validator.nu shows bad-looking all-thread locking.

[05:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me goes investigate whether it's locking at shared IO points or something easily fixable

[06:04:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan_, please complain when you get the reply as we consider it to be feature, not a bug

[06:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: i don't follow

[06:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I was a bit worried about today already being the 19th until I noticed that the minutes were a year old

[06:16:00.0000] <annevk2>
ooh

[06:16:01.0000] <annevk2>
I thought that was recent minutes discussing zcorpan_'s comments

[06:16:02.0000] <annevk2>
doh

[06:24:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm i thought they were recent too

[06:25:00.0000] <zcorpan_>

(link at the bottom)

[09:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
setAttributeNode(document.createAttribute('aB:c')) throws in webkit

[09:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
"These methods (but not their namespaced counterparts) must compare the given argument in an ASCII case-insensitive manner when looking at HTML elements, and in a case-sensitive manner otherwise."

[09:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm so getElementsByTagName('foo') should match createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml','FOO') ?

[09:34:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
doesn't it make more sense to lowercase the argument before checking

[09:34:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me files a bug

[09:37:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
actually hmm

[09:39:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
webkit lowercases the argument

[09:39:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
which makes it impossible to look for svg camelcase elements

[09:40:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i guess the specced behavior is better since it works as expected in the valid case

smedero: I can say I will be arriving in Cannes at 15:02 on the Sunday

[13:49:00.0000] <smedero>
gsnedders: I can say I'm still looking for help with picking up part of the tab on my flight. :-D

[13:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[13:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: Have you already paid for it, or not?

[13:50:02.0000] <smedero>
gsnedders: nope. :-/

sigh.

[13:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: Get a train within France. Internal flights are crazily expensive.

[13:51:01.0000] <smedero>
hrm, okay

[13:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, don't go into Paris.

[13:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Get it straight from CDG, change in Lyon.

[13:52:00.0000] <smedero>
hrm, I had been thinking of doing something sorta like that....

[13:52:01.0000] <smedero>
I'll look into that route now though, thanks.

[13:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It'll take around 6 hours to do by train, but that isn't that much slower taking into account all the fun at airports

[13:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(I'm staying near Lyon for just over a week before)

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So I'm just doing it in two goes

[14:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Can anyone help me stop worrying?

re target=_blank and window.opener

[15:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
I looked in the part that talked about target=_blank, and the part that talked about window.opener, which was not a particularly obscure thing to think to do :-p

[15:06:00.0000] <annevk2>
Lachy, fun video

[15:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
I looked there too, but I somehow missed the bit about the opener

[15:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I doubt I can :)

[17:06:00.0000] <jruderman>
what is the difference between 'error' and 'failure' on http://files.myopera.com/blooberry/alexa/alexavalidation.htm

[17:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wish file.myopera.com would let me actually see the files, when I have Opera's referrer blocking switched on

[17:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
jruderman: It looks like errors might be fatal problems e.g. due to character encoding issues

[17:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
jruderman: Looks like 'failure' means like http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mop.com

[17:11:00.0000] <jruderman>
ahh, that's pretty sad

[17:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
html5.validator.nu seems to cope fine :)

[17:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
did hsivonen ever release the numbers from his study?

[17:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
i forget

[17:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think he did

[17:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: yes

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
do you remember where?

[17:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Nah

[17:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That would be useful.

[17:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
public-html, I _think_.

[17:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's a little vague

[17:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me fails to remember whether he has or hasn't seen such numbers released

[17:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Aug/0923.html

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
0.87% valid pages

[17:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's what i was looking for

[17:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
(that's treating transitional stuff as invalid)

[17:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Now, I want sane IDs

[17:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
the validation errors are stopping me from migrating right now

[17:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
some reporter just e-mailed me a question about html5

[18:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
which i replied to in detail, with links to various pages with more background information

[18:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
he replied back with "FWIW, I am hurrying a story and don't have time to read background materials. I want to know if this is a W3C technology."

[18:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
to which i felt like replying "well fuck you too"

[18:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you need a PR agency

[18:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have one

[18:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sure google would be happy to do the PR for me if i let them

[18:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
same reporter just asked me if there was some sort of editor's draft released today

[18:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i explained that the there have been eight so far today

[18:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think whatever article ends up coming out of this is going to be very confused

[19:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me ponders whether to bother keeping inputmode=""

[19:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
xforms is apparently not a stable reference point

[19:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
given that it changed since wf2 came out

[19:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
so much for persistent urls at the w3.org/TR/ space

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: has there been any desire for inputmode in iPhone Safari?

[19:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
what's inputmode?

[19:10:00.0000] <billyjack>
othermaciej: a means to specify what input mode to put the IME into when the user is in a particular input field

[19:10:01.0000] <billyjack>
e.g., kanji input, or numeric input

[19:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[19:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll ask

[19:10:04.0000] <billyjack>
seems like it's really only useful on handsets that don't have a full keyboard

[19:12:00.0000] <billyjack>
there are a couple few non-standard markup ways now for doing the same thing which are in pretty wide use

[19:12:01.0000] <billyjack>
as far as I know, there are no production browsers that support inputmode

[19:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i don't know of any either

[19:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
do you have any pointers for the non-standard ways?

[19:13:02.0000] <billyjack>
Hixie: yeah, I'll try to get the URLs now

[19:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
seems like the iphone would be able to use it, since it has a fully programmable keyboard

[19:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
cool, thanks

[19:14:00.0000] <billyjack>
one way is the Docomo "istyle" attribute, another is a WAP/WML thing that's used everywhere else

[19:17:01.0000] <billyjack>
<input type="text" style="-wap-input-format: 'N'"/>

[19:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool, thanks

[19:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i guess i'll tell people to use -wap-input-format

[19:23:00.0000] <billyjack>
Hixie: fwiw, the actual spec of -wap-input-format is here: http://www.wapforum.org/tech/documents/WAP-239-WCSS-20011026-a.pdf

[19:23:01.0000] <billyjack>
only seems to be available in PDF

[19:23:02.0000] <billyjack>
Opera supports that

[19:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[19:24:01.0000] <billyjack>
I think most all mobile browsers support it.

[19:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, definitely no point us defining our own things then

[19:25:00.0000] <billyjack>
yeah, mobile developers seem to be pretty happy with it

[19:25:01.0000] <billyjack>
though it seems overengineered to me in that it's both a way of specifying the input mode and also the microsyntax of the input

[19:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love removing things

[19:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
readonly="" was suspiciously easy to define when i got around to it

[19:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
the entire spec's discussion of "readonly" is "The readonly attribute is a boolean attribute. When specified, the element is immutable."

[19:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
granted, "boolean attribute" and "immutable" are both terms with underlying definitions

[19:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
but still

[19:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
ok dinner

[19:29:00.0000] <Hixie>

dglazkov|home: hei

[20:31:01.0000] <dglazkov|home>
hey MikeSmith 

[20:31:02.0000] <dglazkov|home>
how's W3 treating ya?

[20:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dglazkov|home: swimmingly

[20:32:01.0000] <dglazkov|home>
that's good

[20:32:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
dglazkov|home: big congrats on your move and new job

[20:32:03.0000] <dglazkov|home>
MikeSmith: thanks!

[20:32:04.0000] <dglazkov|home>
the job is great!

[20:33:00.0000] <dglazkov|home>
still reeling from the move

[20:33:01.0000] <dglazkov|home>
/me never in his dreams imagined he'd be hacking on WebKit full time

[20:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
dglazkov|home: what city were you in before the move?

[20:34:00.0000] <dglazkov|home>
Birmingham, AL

[20:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[20:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I lived in Montgomery when I was young. I had some second cousins in Birmingham. Do they still have the stinking paper mill place outside the city?

[20:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders if Hixie is subscribed to webkit-dev or knows Michael Nordman

[20:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
re: https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2008-September/004954.html

[20:39:00.0000] <dglazkov|home>
I know Michael Nordman

[20:39:01.0000] <dglazkov|home>
:)

[20:49:00.0000] <dglazkov|home>
MikeSmith: cool, Montgomery, wow!

[20:49:01.0000] <dglazkov|home>
I don't think the paper mill is there

[21:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dglazkov|home: seems like Michael might find it worthwhile to come on #whatwg to talk about the appcache stuff

[21:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Though dunno of course if he's a IRC-liker or not

[21:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[21:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me sees michaeln on the channel

[21:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
geez, I'll shutup now and quit being such goddamn busybody

[21:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me kicks himself

[21:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me writes 937th note to himself to mind his own business

[22:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
so the article that the guy who was e-mailing earlier was writing is out now

[22:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/09/18/Canvas_set_to_boost_AJAX_1.html

[22:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
it has fewer mistakes than i would have expected given the rush the guy was apparently in

[22:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
but it still gets one of the key points completely backwards

[23:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me reads http://webkit.org/blog/214/introducing-squirrelfish-extreme/

[23:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
polymorphic inline caching

[23:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that sounds pretty useful, whatever that is

[23:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it is :-)

[23:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JS learning from Self

[23:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: great writeup

[23:12:00.0000] <roc>
a text editor written in canvas???

[23:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: what you say?

[23:12:02.0000] <roc>
sorry, reading Hixie's URL above

[23:12:03.0000] <roc>
"Galbraith touted a responsive text editor he co-developed that was implemented in JavaScript entirely in Canvas and features syntax highlighting."

[23:14:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: actually ... technically, "retained image" is kinda accurate for canvas

[23:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, Paul Krill

[23:14:02.0000] <roc>
I could see that being a reasonable way to describe the idea that the canvas remembers its contents, as opposed to WM_PAINT-style event-driven application painting

[23:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: wow, that's crazy

[23:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the Paul Krill byline maybe explains a lot about Hixie's earlier comments

[23:15:02.0000] <roc>
I hope something was lost in translation

[23:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: I very much suspect it was

[23:17:00.0000] <roc>
since you can't get text metrics from canvas, I think writing an editor using it is completely impossible

[23:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe he draws the text by hand

[23:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh.. WREC is a nice acronym

[23:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: howcome likes to talk about "w3c wreck-ommendation stage"

[23:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I hope one day HTML5 can be a full W3C WREC

[23:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
2022

[23:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[23:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me is reminded of Hixie's "SVG Tiny 1.2 in Candidate Wreckommendation stage": http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1155235213&count=1

[23:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: :p

[23:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for better PR engagements, we need a Scott McCloud comic about HTML5

[00:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think we need Ralph Steadman for HTML5

[00:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ↑

[00:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me googles

[00:44:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: from http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/#html

[00:44:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
The inputmode attribute is supported; however, 

[00:44:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
its implementation is platform-dependant

[00:44:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
it is not enabled by default

[00:44:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
it is not in the Opera 9.5 Desktop version

[00:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: do you know if inputmode support in Opera actually implemented on any particular devices?

[00:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe on some S60 devices in Opera 9.5?

[01:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems like it would be trivial to enable support for it on any browser/device combination that already supports -wap-input-format

[01:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if Opera 9.5 for S60 is still coming or canceled

[01:01:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me thought it had already been released

[01:01:03.0000] <hsivonen>
wow

[01:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me goes check

[01:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/

[01:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: as far as I can tell, S60 is stuck at Opera 8.65

[01:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[01:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see the 9.5 beta is Windows Mobile only

[01:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the browser situation on S60 sucks ATM

[01:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
both Nokia and Opera haven't updated their offerings in a long time

[01:05:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, no public word of any progress at all on an updated Webkit browser for S60

[01:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
someone seems to be working on Gecko for S60, but it's going to be a long, long road for one guy to port it over

[01:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the Fennec product-dev team is not targeting S60 at all?

[01:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems like a decent business opportunity from any third-party company that wanted to come in a provide a better browser for S60

[01:07:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
A Webkit-based browser to displace the Nokia one, I mean

[01:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or really anything

[01:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
kind of surprised that Opera has exploited that more

[01:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
even though S60 is behind the times, I find I'm using my phone more often than my N800

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the reason is that Fennec is so far unusable on N800 (no release with soft keyboard support)

[01:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and MicroB gives a bogus YSoD on Planet Intertwingly

[01:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and Planet Intertwingly is one of my favorite mobile destinations

[01:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it works in Opera 8.65 on S60. The Nokia browser gets the character encoding wrong

[01:12:01.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: and you can't live with Opera Mini in the meantime?

[01:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what sucks about Opera 8.65 on Planet Intertwingly is the lack of domcontentloaded event

[01:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: it doesn't let me switch between SSR and desktop mode with one button without reload

[01:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: so no

[01:13:03.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: Mini requires crawling through menus and reloading

[01:14:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I come to never ever use desktop mode

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: the few tables that are actually data tables instead of layout tables look better in the desktop mode

[01:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notices that Opera has 7 builds for Windows Mobile

[01:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: doesn't Opera 9.5 mobile have adaptive zooming in desktop mode?

[01:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the banner advertising Opera Mobile 9 coming soon was pulled about a year ago, it seems

[01:20:00.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: afaik, yes, http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/features/

[01:21:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I detest smartphones for a number of reasons, and windows mobile even more for a bunch of different reasons, so  I haven't actually tested 9.5 mobile much yet

[01:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: I think you might kinda like some of the HTC devices at least

[01:33:00.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: I have seen the devices, and although their outward physical appearance is nice I can't stand the horrid slowness, subpar usability, sucky battery life and the abomination that is WM

[01:35:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the usability problems being a consequence of windows

[01:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[01:36:00.0000] <virtuelv>
besides, any phone that uses more than five seconds to boot == fail

[01:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, we will soon have another OS running on an HTC device that we can use for comparison purposes

[01:37:00.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: I'm not sure the Linux on phone situation is much better

[01:38:00.0000] <virtuelv>
nor do I believe that Android will save us all

[01:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on Android, all apps are equal but all rendering engines aren't

[01:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Android will at least add some competition and help raise the bar on user expectations about what's possible/usable on a mobile handset

[01:40:01.0000] <virtuelv>
the failing here is a far bigger one than the browser engine

[01:40:02.0000] <virtuelv>
in their insane rush to make the phone a general-purpose computing design, everyone seems to have forgotten the primary objective of a phone: the ability to make phone calls

[01:40:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
nope

[01:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's not the primary purpose for me at all

[01:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the primary purpose of my handset for me is mobile data services

[01:41:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
by a longshot

[01:41:03.0000] <virtuelv>
for me, it still is, together with the ability to send text messages

[01:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I'm blessed to live in a part of the world where we have real SMTP/MIME e-mail clients on handsets

[01:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I need some kind of Jetty thread pools for dummies guide...

[01:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I couldn't care less about text messages

[01:42:03.0000] <doublec>
email is too slow, text is instant. that's the attraction.

[01:42:04.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: so you never feel the need to send just "Ok", or "I'm there in fifteen minutes"?

[01:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
doublec: email on handsets in Japanese is instant

[01:43:01.0000] <virtuelv>
last phone I bought was a non-smartphone from Sony Ericsson

[01:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
we use email the same way most people use text messages

[01:43:03.0000] <virtuelv>
except that it tries to be a smartphone-in-disguise

[01:43:04.0000] <doublec>
interesting

[01:43:05.0000] <virtuelv>
booting it takes 20 seconds

[01:43:06.0000] <doublec>
do they have some non-polling method of getting it?

[01:43:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: yeah, I send email

[01:43:08.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: so basically empty e-mails with a subject?

[01:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
empty subject with a body usually

[01:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I use it when I want to say, I'll be there in 2 minutes

[01:44:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
or 1 minute

[01:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or when I want to send somebody a URL with my exact GPS location

[01:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so they know where to meet me

[01:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: what's the spam situation with received email?

[01:45:03.0000] <hsivonen>
my IMAP inbox is too big and spammy for Nokia's S60 email client

[01:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so my only mobile email use case is sending photos as attachments to an IRC bot

[01:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
SMS still going strong

[01:46:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I used to get very little spam on my handset e-mail

[01:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MMS: FAIL

[01:46:04.0000] <doublec>
same here, my s60 device can't handle my imap at all

[01:46:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm getting more lately

[01:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I'm sure in general spam will become as big a problem with mobile e-mail as it everywhere else

[01:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
doublec: yeah, non-polling

[01:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
carries push out notifications based on mailbox events

[01:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
to set the "message waiting" indicator on the handset

[01:48:02.0000] <virtuelv>
and with SMS spam is an almost inexistent problem

[01:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, the real important this as far as user experience on handsets is integration among the apps

[01:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., the ability to open a browser while you're in the messaging client

[01:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or the ability to invoke an app to get your lat/lon location and turn it into a URL and automatically put it in a message and send it to somebody

[01:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
having a Chrome-like process per browser view thing going on mobile would be good too

[01:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the browsers are unstable

[01:53:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and Google turns to Java for stuff like GMM

[01:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
in general apps on handsets are unstable

[01:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
often, if one app crashes the whole handset has to reset

[01:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
at least S60 is pretty good at recoving from browser OOM crashes

[01:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
recovering

[02:10:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: are you just using the regular 3 year old S60 browser on your device?

[02:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: yes.

[02:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: are there alternatives?

[02:11:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: opera :)

[02:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: oh, I thought you asked what "S60 Browser" I used.

[02:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: yeah, I use Opera for stuff other than the logs of this channel

[02:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(Nokia's S60 Browser has an annoyingly generic name)

[02:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
probably on purpose

[02:14:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: you use opera mini?

[02:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: I don't

[02:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ah. the paradox of choice with Jetty thread pools

[02:18:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: we're running JS tests on mobiles over at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-mwts/2008Sep/0003.html 

[02:18:01.0000] <hendry>
http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/2867376431/ my Thinkpad is 10x faster than my 'ipod touch'

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me finds http://www-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/scheme2js/

[03:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me checks in r2222

[03:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, does it have the <magic-fairy> tag?

[03:13:01.0000] <annevk2>
seems to be something more boring :)

[03:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[03:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: we'd like to extend inputmode with e.g. "number"

[03:20:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: so that on a mobile you can use the number input by default instead of tripletap

[03:20:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, image should also be barred from contraint validation

[03:20:02.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan_, doesn't it already have that?

[03:21:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: does it?

[03:21:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me thought it did

[03:21:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
not afaict

[03:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
"latin digits"

[03:26:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
aha

[03:26:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if I'm just bad at googling or if Jetty thread pool configuration is a domain with no canned recipe

[03:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd expect there to be a function that yields to optimal max thread pool size given some measurable inputs

[03:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan_, if nobody implements this though something like "number" might be better

[03:32:01.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, you could try asking questions on the thing from Joel Spolsky

[03:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: stack overflow?

[03:33:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: yes

[03:33:01.0000] <virtuelv>
registration's a breeze, openid all the way

[03:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I like the idea of OpenID

[03:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the problem is the paradox of choice with providers

[03:34:02.0000] <virtuelv>
I am my own

[03:35:00.0000] <hendry>
openid2 perl implementation sucks too

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I want to make http://hsivonen.iki.fi/ my OpenID, but I need to move it to a server that is better isolated from other users to feel secure about doing that

[03:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
you won't do banking with it ;)

[03:46:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: so delegate the ID to some other provider

[03:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: the threat model is that another user manages to run some utterly broken PHP that allows a cross-user exploit to bootstrap and a blackhat changes hsivonen.iki.fi to delegate to a bogus provider

[03:48:01.0000] <virtuelv>
yeah, I see your point

[03:48:02.0000] <virtuelv>
slicehost has vps hosting

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I already have a couple of VMs that are private to me

[03:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's just that hsivonen.iki.fi has legacy scripts that are hard to move

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as for using an external provider (regardless of delegation) bothers me, because I don't understand their business model

[03:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and the obvious business model is selling data obtained by observing user behavior

[03:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish iki.fi became an OpenID provider

[03:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(and an XMPP provider too)

[03:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
in fact, becoming an OpenID provider would fit the mission of iki.fi perfectly

[03:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the trouble is getting someone to implement and maintain stuff

[03:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(the general trouble with associations without paid staff)

[04:55:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, seems <input size> is conforming again?

[04:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, <input inputmode="latin digits x"> gives "Bad value latin digits x for attribute inputmode on element input: Not an absolute IRI."

[04:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: that's because x isn't an absolute IRI

[04:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and inputmode didn't seem to be worth optmizing UI for

[04:58:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the pubnotes for the next WD will be interesting

[04:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in what way?

[04:58:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
i guess it'll list differences between wf2 and html5

[05:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and inputmode didn't seem to be worth optmizing UI for

[05:14:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, inputmode doesn't take IRIs?

[05:14:01.0000] <annevk2>
or does it? hmm

[05:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
but yeah, don't bother with it

[05:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: it does (or did at least)

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: it was defined by reference to XForms

[05:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: in XForms, if a token does not contain a colon, it is a built-in token

[05:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: if a token does contain a colon, it is an absolute IRI identifying a custom input method

[05:28:00.0000] <hdh>
hsivonen: using v.nu, how do I override the doctype like http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/HEAD/ can?

[05:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hdh: change the preset

[05:30:00.0000] <hdh>
it still report Error: Legacy doctype

[05:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hdh: use the parser pop-up on the generic facet

[05:31:00.0000] <hdh>
same

[05:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hdh: which doctype?

[05:31:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
what's your doctype?

[05:32:00.0000] <hdh>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

[05:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hdh: it supports only HTML5, HTML 4.01 Strict and Transitional doctypes 

[05:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hdh: that's not allowed in text/html

[05:32:03.0000] <hdh>
I want to replicate http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/09/top-500-html5-validity.html

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hdh: the public validator.nu instance doesn't support legacy doctypes other than HTML 4.01 Strict/Transitional

[05:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hdh: however, the parser has a survey mode that suppresses doctype-related tree builder-level errors

[08:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it tooks me quite a while to figure out that the spec now has two h4 elements saying "The body element"

[08:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
which broke my spec scraper

[08:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the second heading is pretty confusing too

[08:20:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it suggests that the body element is obsolete

[08:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: would be clearer if it said "Attributes on the body element"

[08:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is there any chance of putting presence constraints of elements-specific attributes in parentheses after the attribute

[08:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[08:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: there used to be "(required)"

[08:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and then you took that out instead of putting the more complex requirements in

[08:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: how would that look for the input element?

[08:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: good point. but for other elements it should be feasible

[08:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in the case of input, it might be a good idea to have an element-level h4 for each input type=foo

[08:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i guess that makes sense

[08:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
they are now h6

[08:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me files a spec RFE

[08:34:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
though it would look weird in the toc

[08:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could fix that in the TOC generator

[08:38:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i think you should instead write code that figures out exactly which attributes are missing :P

[08:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I'm still waiting for oNVDL upstream to release that code

[08:39:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[08:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish oNVDL upstream had a publicly readable version control system so that I could go get code even when the maintainer is too busy to create a release

[08:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: seems pretty silly that they don't

[08:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'd wonder what version-control system they're using

[09:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm sleepy.

[09:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But a bit less worried.

[10:34:00.0000] <takkaria>
all I really want to know if when all these clever JS speedups will make it to other languages

[10:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: just compile your stuff into JS :-)

[11:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: Maybe it'll happen when those other languages have half a dozen competing implementations, each critically relied on by major software projects, with very little evolution of the language itself to take up the developers' time

[11:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
and when there's a billion users who are going to be directly affected by the language's performance

[11:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I wonder if I can convince anyone that javascript is the new C on the basis that it is becoming fast (for a dynamic language) but requires difficult and not entirely effective hacks to get the class-based object model that mainstream programmers like

[12:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: no, there's no chance because the constraints are far too complicated to put normatively into the summary

[13:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: :-(

[13:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are very few attributes for which the requirements, if different than "optional", are anywhere near as simple as "required".

[13:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in the machine-detectable cases the condition is rather simple, though

[13:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
do you have a list of the attributes whose requirement is not "optional"?

[13:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I can produce a list

[13:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd be curious to see it, maybe i'm wrong about how easy it would be

[13:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you're producing a list, the ideal list would be a list of all attributes and their requirement constraint

[13:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
do you mean listing optional attributes as well?

[13:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
if that's easy

[13:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
otherwise don't worry

[13:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
whatever you can generate

[13:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just looking for an overview

[13:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
to get a feel of the place, as it were

[13:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: if i move type="" attribute values up to the element level, what happens to the many commen attribute sections?

[13:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
"Most specs get grossly outdated within a few days of publication on the TR page."

[13:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
some are outdated even before they get published

[13:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: The common things aren't that common if you treat value/min/max as distinct when they differ in datatype

[13:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
shepazu, you're pointing to a member only thread on a public list

[14:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
host html5.validator.nu

[14:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
doh

[14:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
html5.validator.nu is now  isolated from the complex interface and parse tree

[14:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It is now on a VM that can be scaled up and down

[14:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm curious about the implementation of xen upflexing

[14:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
one would think they need to be able to migrate live VMs across real servers

[14:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me reads a paper about live Xen migration. cool stuff.

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: value/min/max?

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: there's like a dozen common attributes. value is one of them (and is already defined as such)

[15:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: not to mention the DOM attributes most of which are only defined once

[15:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I suppose those could go into a common definition section

[15:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, seeing the applicable attributes per type sate would be more readable than the table

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
the applicable attributes are already listed per type state

[15:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
the table is non-normative

[15:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
i only added it to please anne

[15:58:00.0000] <krijnh>
Pleasing anne does pay off sometimes :)

[21:59:00.0000] <shepazu>
er, point to a post on a member-only thread, I mean

[22:01:00.0000] <shepazu>
what the heck? why did Hyatt post that to the old SVG list?

[22:01:01.0000] <shepazu>
maybe he didn't know we work in public now

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
you know, a remarkable number of new features in html5 have been implemented in at least one browser

[02:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
we're further along than i thought

[02:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and parsing is implemented outside browsers as is the outline algorithm

[02:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is there anything implementing behavior triggered on <aside>?

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i know the main things missing any implementations at all are <datagrid> and all the various semantic elements

[02:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
including <aside>

[02:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
parsing algorithm is not implemented in any browser

[03:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I see Transformations, Transitions and Animations as medium priority on CSS WG's list. is the CSS WG working on them after all? http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work

there's a weird bug in mac os x software update

also why on earth does updating quicktime and itunes require a restart

[04:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: why doesn't the svg schema have holes for inkscape and rdf?

[04:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: or if it's intentional, why does the svg preset have the "unchecked" pseudo-schema?

[04:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: no good reason. perhaps the standalone schema should have the same holes

[04:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me looks at http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwebkit.org%2Fblog-files%2Fanimation-demo.svg&showsource=yes

[04:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notes that the results of the same svg embedded in xhtml with the xhtml5+svg schema are more useful

[05:00:00.0000] <annevk2>
heh, several people have been trying to figure out whether html5.org has a forum

[05:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
visits have gone up to ~20000 a day despite robots being blocked by robots.txt

[05:04:00.0000] <svl>
annevk2: unlikely that it's been "people" trying to find that out. There's several spambots which try visiting the common directories for frequently used forum software like phpbb

[05:04:01.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, it doesn't seem entirely reliable, ~200000 requests from MSIE/5

[05:04:02.0000] <annevk2>
where other browsers have more in the order of ~5000

[05:05:00.0000] <annevk2>
so probably some bot is still hitting it hard

[05:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what's a good apt-gettable apache log analysis package these days?

[05:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
but there's not a single host with ~200000 requests, probably uses several IPs or so... hmm

[05:09:00.0000] <svl>
annevk2: if it's the same, it's all botnets.

[05:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
I suspect it being the same, there's far too much MSIE/5 in there

[05:10:01.0000] <annevk2>
I don't really have much interest in investigating this further though as there's nothing to spam on html5.org and there's no load problem either

[08:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't quite decide whether it's going to rain and through that whether to go out or not. Meh.

[10:06:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, the TAG f2f minutes are interestinf

[10:07:00.0000] <takkaria>
or rather, the agenda

[10:07:01.0000] <takkaria>
apparently if you're embedding HTML fragments in Atom in CDATA sections, you might as well be embedding PostScript or "something equally opaque"

[10:14:00.0000] <billyjackass>
takkaria: you sure the "equally opaque" part wasn't referring to the actually f2f attendees themselves?

[10:16:00.0000] <takkaria>
heh

Hey. I have a question about firing media events

[17:48:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
the spec clearly says that some should fire synchronously, eg. "must synchronously fire a progress event called loadstart" (4.8.10.4)

[17:48:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
and others are clearly asynchronous, eg. "must queue a task to fire a simple event called play" (4.8.10.7)

[17:48:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
but the descriptions in the section on ready states (4.8.10.6) are somewhat ambiguous

[17:48:03.0000] <eric_carlson>
eg. "and fire a simple event called play"

[17:49:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
(even though "canshowcurrentframe" and "play" are explicitly asynchronous elsewhere)

[17:49:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
so are the ready state change events fired differently from others?

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
"fire a simple event" is synchronous, but that doesn't preclude an error in the spec :-)

[17:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i should probably remove th word "synchronously" from the spec so that it doesn

[17:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
't confuse people when i omit it

[17:51:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
OK, thanks.

[17:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
wait, hold on

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
it has to be asynchronous for those

[17:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's nothing to be synchronous with

[17:52:03.0000] <eric_carlson>
good, that's what I was about to argue.

[17:52:04.0000] <eric_carlson>
now I don't need to bother  ;) 

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll file a bug saying that these should be fixed to say that a task should be queued to fire the events

[18:01:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
that was quick. thanks!

[18:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL, someone pretending to be Hixie is posting spam to the whatwg blog :-)

[18:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
(unless Hixie really was posting about eugenics and nazis, but I doubt it)

[18:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
ooo

[18:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
where

[18:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
where

[18:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, it was in the moderation queue, I already marked it as spam

[18:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
but you wrote: "The biggest problem I see with supporting eugenics is the bad name it has aquired, through being associated with the Nazi movement, for instance. I'll leave that problem up to the PR folk to solve." -- ian hickson http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1023585606&amp;count=1

[18:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
Looks like it's a quote from that blog entry

[18:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
so you *really* were writing about eugenics and nazis :-)

[18:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
yup that's an accurate quote

[18:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
someone posted that on my blog too iirc

[18:19:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me let it through though

[18:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah doesn't seem like spam

[18:19:03.0000] <annevk2>
http://annevankesteren.nl/2008/09/re-two-thousand-twenty-two#comment-6629

[18:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what the relevance of that quote is

[18:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
considering it was posted twice and whoever posted it didn't use Hixie's email address, I figured it had to be spam of some kind.

[18:21:01.0000] <annevk2>
maybe about letting PR folks solve the problem, just like with 2022?

[18:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, I'm trying to figure out what I should go do this weekend while I'm on the Gold Coast

[18:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: heh

[18:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: check e-mail :-)

[18:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me checks...

[18:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
nothing yet.

[18:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, did you send me something, or is that a suggestino for what I should spend my weekend doing?

[18:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
the latter

[18:26:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, LOL

[18:35:00.0000] <annevk2>
checking e-mail during the weekend is sort of a waste of time I found out

[18:35:01.0000] <annevk2>
there isn't many

[18:35:02.0000] <annevk2>
/me suggests organizing parties

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[18:48:00.0000] <takkaria>
my life as a vegan got much better today: I found a spread that I like, and I found that the local supermarket sell vegan icecream

[18:49:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm not sure why this warrants mentioning here of all places, but so it goes :)

[19:07:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: a minor typo in "4.8.10.8. Seeking"

[19:08:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
step 9 says: "The user agent must queue a task to queue a task to..."

[19:08:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
probably don't need both of those "queue a task"

[19:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[19:09:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
sure

[19:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that it is quite cold out at 2am, but streetlights make the mist look pretty

/me tries to get postMessage working in IE in a spec-compliant way

[19:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
good luck!

[19:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to get postMessage working in any browser in a spec-compliant way

[20:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish webkit wouldn't complain about favicon.ico files being sent as text/html

[20:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't ask you to fetch favicon.ico

[20:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
there is no favicon.ico

[20:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
what you got back was a 404 and it had the right mime type

[20:01:04.0000] <othermaciej>
where does it complain?

[20:01:05.0000] <Hixie>
console

[20:01:06.0000] <Hixie>
Resource interpreted as image but transferred with MIME type text/html. favicon.ico

[20:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it probably should not complain in the case where it just asked for the default icon url and got back a 404

[20:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
well the funny thing is that if you do send the 404 as an image, it doesn't even use it

[20:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
so the message, not only is it a bug, it's also a lie

[20:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
the resource wasn't interpreted as an image

[20:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey how do you inspect the inside of an iframe?

[20:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in the latest WebKit you can see the DOM for the iframe under the frame element

[20:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or at least I seem to recall that being done

[20:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't seem to be the case

[20:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i believe i'm using last night's nightly

[20:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
let me check

[20:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
actually, let me ask the expert

[20:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: hmmm on tivofaq.com I see the document DOM under the <frame> element

[20:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(document node not represented, but the doctype and then the <html> element are there)

[20:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
opera doesn't support e.origin?

[20:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh it still has e.uri

[20:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok well i guess i won't demo opera for this part

[00:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me finds more bugs in IE's implementation of HTML5 stuff

[00:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
localStorage.getItem(...) return undefined instead of null for unknown stuff

[00:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
this is going well, i think i might pull this off.

[00:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me is trying to give a presentation about html5 made of purely demos with no future tense anywhere in the presentation

[04:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/color/color.html is trippy, especially in webkit

[04:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
(url will be dead in a few minute)

[04:24:00.0000] <annevk2>
cool demo

[04:24:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me makes a copy

[04:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Did Richard Maher's email contain a technical argument why Web Socket is "bollocks"?

[04:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[04:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:37:00.0000] <jruderman>
darn, i missed the demo

[06:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: AFAICT the closest to a technical argument was "it's not unfettered access to sockets"

[06:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: ok. but that's the whole point of the design

[06:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Possibly explaining that to him would work. Possibly not

[06:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
How does the "existing Socket support from SUN Java, Adobe Flex, and Microsoft Silverlight" handle security?

[06:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the email didn't make it clear why it's bad to restrict stuff like this

[06:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It seems obvious that it's bad because it's incompatible with how the rest of the world does sockets

[06:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: OTOH he didn't present any use cases that require real sockets rather than WebSockets

[06:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I want to write an HTTP client.

[06:23:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(that would be kinda awesome to do)

[06:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: that would be kinda stupid

[06:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: That's because they're obvious :-)

[06:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: according to Sun's FAQ, it seems that Java applets can open sockets to the host of origin

[06:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Then you know exactly how the HTTP client behaves :P

[06:24:04.0000] <hsivonen>
which is *bad* in the context of virtual hosts

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I didn't actually test anything

[06:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
("I have an existing socket-based service that does <var>X</var>, and I want to access it directly over the web" for any value of X)

[06:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/over the web/from a web browser/

[06:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: As you well know there is a problem when X is "sends email" and similar

[06:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Time to try re-writing my personal statement

[06:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs

[06:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Indeed - it doesn't seem like that general class of use cases is solvable

[06:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
Do any browsers have WebSockets implementations yet?

[06:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is composing a brief reply

[06:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: no

[06:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Writing a personal statement is ahrd.

[06:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*hard

[06:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"I am a sixth year pupil at Madras College, currently doing four Advanced Highers: computing, English, mathematics, and physics. I would like to study either computer science or physics because…" — does that seem a sane start?

[07:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: It sounds saner.

[07:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me can't remember what he put on his personal statement

[07:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess there might be a copy of it somewhere but I have no idea where that would be. Probably an old floppy disk that has long since died

[10:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders - well if it's executing circular motion mv^2/r = GMm/r**2 so E_k = GMm/(2r)

[10:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders where that is in his notes

[10:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(probably answer: somewhere)

[10:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I would hope its under the heading "circular motion" or somesuch

[10:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Angular Motion, somewhere, I expect

[10:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
OK, I just did a rather bad drawing of the gravitational fields of the Earth and Moon

[11:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: To hyphenate a single instance of a word, it's easier to write "foo\-bar" to give a hyphenation hint

[11:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I guess in this case there's no harm in having Brehmsstrahlung hyphenated in other places too

[11:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but thanks)

[12:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees that Silverlight has its own clientaccesspolicy.xml file to enable socket communication with the host

[12:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It supports Flash's crossdomain.xml for some features but not sockets)

[12:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
(according to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645032(VS.95).aspx )

[12:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
policy files are such a bad design

[12:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
crossdomain.xml showed that

[12:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Presumably it didn't show it to a sufficient extent to stop people from thinking it's a good idea

[12:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish there was a way to pause vmware without suspending it (which takes a lot of time)

[12:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I wish there was a way to not do homework (which takes a lot of time)

[12:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But it does have the use of keeping my mind off what would otherwise worry me

[12:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me sends a sig 17 to the vmware process

[12:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
that worked

[13:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me suggests adding the text "semantic in html have largely failed. If you find yourself having an argument about element semantics, it is possible that you should consider instead getting a hobby" to the HTML 5 text

[13:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[13:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
but this IS my hobby!

[13:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Can doing homework please _NOT_ be my hobby? *puppy-eyes*

[13:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Sadly it seems to be my hobby too :(

[13:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
holy crap, ie8 beta 2 actually managed to _break_ the rendering of acid3's _reference rendering_

[13:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
But I don't endorse long lilliputian arguments about whether it is proper to use <var> for variables that are constant or just variables that are variable

[13:14:02.0000] <jcranmer>
Hixie: it's so that it can match the reference rendering ;-)

[13:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
it actually makes the reference rendering look even less like the test

[13:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Impressive application of gun to foot there

[13:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Ah, it's given as $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$

[13:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: (i.e., relative to the moment of inertia)

[13:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: FWIW the result that in a 1/r**2 potential E_k = -E_p/2 is called the virial theroem

[13:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virial_theorem

[13:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is probably too tired to comprehend this

[13:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me gives up on the one question he can't do

[13:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hopes he hasn't got any other homework due tomorrow

Kinda impressive.

[15:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Not as impressive as invisible green hair :)

[15:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk2: Hmm Opera seems to use quite a lot of CPU running that

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's irony to using that logo without any script

[15:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh joy. Sun adds crossdomain.xml support to Java applet networking

[15:41:00.0000] <aboodman>
Hixie - any updates on workers?

[15:42:00.0000] <aboodman>
i didn't see any repsonse to that last thread, but maybe in person?

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
aboodman: i'm deep in web forms 2 right now

[15:47:01.0000] <aboodman>
i will ping jonas

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
aboodman: but workers is on the list for the next thing i need to work on after wf2

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone got a video i could use to demo <video>?

[16:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i tried using something from my media library but i can't get it to work, even in safari

[16:17:00.0000] <hendry>
Hixie: i have lots of video OGGs on http://video.natalian.org/ you're welcome to take

[16:18:00.0000] <hendry>
Hixie: though the test one I use http://video.natalian.org/test/sample.ogg is pretty boring

[16:19:00.0000] <roc>
Chris's page has some

[16:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, btw, will you reinstate those demos once the presentation has been given?

[16:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
my plan is to write them as i'm giving the presentation

[16:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
where is the presentation?

[16:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's an internal google thing

[16:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: is <video> in any released version of opera?

[16:55:00.0000] <annevk2>
just experimental builds so far: http://labs.opera.com/downloads/

[16:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, well, I meant the one you removed earlier today (regarding <canvas>)

[16:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
right

[16:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
my plan is to write it during the presentation

[16:57:02.0000] <annevk2>
doh

[16:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
the presentation is in less than 24 hours, so they'll be up soon :-P

using xiphqt?

[17:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually i'm having trouble getting safari to play video of any kind

[17:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if my quicktime is broken or something

[17:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't even work on apple.com

[17:22:00.0000] <nessy>
hmm

[17:25:00.0000] <nessy>
http://www.double.co.nz/video_test/test3.html works in my safari

running safari 3.1.2 on OS X 10.5.4 with XiphQT 0.1.8

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
my quicktime is clearly borked

[17:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
well

[17:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
<video> in firefox has interesting bugs

[17:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
such as not stopping when you reload :-

[17:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
|

[17:47:00.0000] <gavin>
known issue!

[17:47:01.0000] <gavin>
(449096)

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
good to know :-)

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[17:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
no ontimeupdate?

[17:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[17:55:01.0000] <gavin>
yeah looks like it isn't implemented

[17:55:02.0000] <gavin>
don't see any bugs filed

[17:56:00.0000] <gavin>
ah, looks like 449154 coers it

[17:56:01.0000] <gavin>
or part of it, at least

[17:57:00.0000] <gavin>
along with 449159

[17:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
timeupdate should fire basically continuously

[17:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't seem to be a bug about that

[17:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
basically timeupdate fires whenever the clock should change

[17:57:04.0000] <gavin>
oh...

[17:57:05.0000] <Hixie>
playback, seeking, pausing, etc

[17:57:06.0000] <gavin>
those bugs only do it for seeking

[17:57:07.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
we really need to start making a test suite for html5

[18:02:00.0000] <doublec>
Hixie, why does timeupdate get fired continuously?

[18:02:01.0000] <doublec>
"The current playback position changed in an interesting way, for example discontinuously. "

[18:02:02.0000] <doublec>
that doesn't read continuously to me

[18:03:00.0000] <doublec>
is the intent to really fire it when the clock changes for any reason, including playback?

[18:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
it

[18:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
er

[18:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's step 4 of "When the current playback position of a media element changes (e.g. due to playback or seeking)"

[18:03:04.0000] <doublec>
ie, at the framerate?

[18:03:05.0000] <Hixie>
which i just noticed is in the wrong section

[18:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
the idea is that you can update the clock accurately using just one event

[18:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it is precise when seeking, paused, etc, and also updates while playing

[18:05:00.0000] <doublec>
oh, it's in cue ranges

[18:05:01.0000] <doublec>
I've ignored that section since apple have been wanting changes

[18:07:00.0000] <doublec>
(by 'ignore' i mean not made it a priority)

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, feedback is building up. I have requests to look at video, offline caching, messageports, and notifications "asap"

[18:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
need to get this forms thing done

[18:09:01.0000] <doublec>
might want to change the description of the timeupdate event since it really gets fired whenever the playback position changes

[18:09:02.0000] <doublec>
rather than just in interesting ways

[18:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
good idea

[18:09:04.0000] <doublec>
heh, I don't know how you keep up - everyone wants everything asap :)

[18:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
though arguably the video itself playing is interesting :-P

[18:10:01.0000] <doublec>
haha, true

[18:10:02.0000] <doublec>
depends on the video

[18:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
re feedback -- eh, usually it's not so bad. it's just that the forms stuff is a long-term project, so things build up.

[18:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
and pretty much every browser vendor is in the part of their cycle where they're implementing stuff, so they're all interested in getting things changed

[18:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
s/they/you/ :-)

[18:11:01.0000] <doublec>
:)

[18:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
is playbackRate implemented?

[18:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[18:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
can i ask you a favour?

[18:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
any chance you could remove the unimplemented items from the idl before you ship?

[18:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
that way people can do things like  if ('totalBytes' in video) { ... }  to work around limitations in each implementation

[18:22:00.0000] <doublec>
Hixie, yes, good idea

[18:22:01.0000] <doublec>
playbackRate is not implemented in the Ogg backend

[18:22:02.0000] <doublec>
it is in the gstreamer one

[18:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me discovers the looping attributes k

[18:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
er

[18:22:05.0000] <Hixie>
what's the syntax you used for the looping attributes?

[18:23:00.0000] <doublec>
loopend, loopstart, etc

[18:23:01.0000] <doublec>
not implemented though

[18:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[18:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
i meant the value syntax

[18:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
but if they're not implemented, n/a :-)

[18:23:05.0000] <doublec>
What does apple do for the value syntax?

[18:23:06.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[18:23:07.0000] <Hixie>
can't get quicktime to work in safari at all

[18:23:08.0000] <Hixie>
even on apple.com with the quicktime plugin

[18:24:00.0000] <doublec>
I was just going for a value in seconds for now

[18:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
something's borked with my install

[18:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, a floating point number seems reasonable

[18:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
i expect i'll make the following be allowed:   7.24   7.24s  4m7.24s  1h4m7.24s

[18:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i need to define the parsing model soon though before we end up with a legacy to deal with

[18:25:01.0000] <doublec>
sounds reasonable

[18:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
found another bug for you -- if you pause video, go to another page, and go back, it starts playing

[18:27:00.0000] <doublec>
thanks, I'll add it to the list

[18:30:00.0000] <doublec>
bug 456316

[18:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there a way to seek implemented? currentTime = 0 doesn't seem to work

[18:32:00.0000] <doublec>
bug 449159 fixes that. It's just got a couple of review comments to get fixed up and it'll be in.

[18:33:00.0000] <doublec>
Ogg and seeking aren't made for each other

[18:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[18:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[18:33:03.0000] <doublec>
Neither is doing stuff like finding the duration

[18:34:00.0000] <doublec>
Ogg supports 'chained' files. You can concatenate ogg files together and they play as if it was one 

[18:34:01.0000] <doublec>
which means framerate, size, etc can change during playback

[18:34:02.0000] <doublec>
And duration has to be computed

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
that sounds... painful

[18:39:01.0000] <doublec>
computing duration is, it's crazy

[18:40:00.0000] <doublec>
the library I'm using doesn't support chained oggs at the moment so I at least don't have to worry about framerate, codec changes, etc midstream

[18:40:01.0000] <doublec>
but it's needed for things like icecast to work

[18:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey will you look at that i totally forgot to check for cross-domain access in the media features

[18:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
and new Audio() doesn't work in firefox, it seems

[18:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
and Opera loads the MP3 but doesn't play it...

[18:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
maybe I shouldn't demo new Audio().

[18:59:00.0000] <doublec>
bug 454971 is new Audio()

[18:59:01.0000] <doublec>
it's all ready to land

[18:59:02.0000] <doublec>
I'll use it in my 8080 emulator when it lands

[20:17:00.0000] <doublec>
If media file is currently in the midst of a seek operation, and a 'play' or 'pause' or another 'seek' is requested, what should happen?

[20:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it should be as if the play, pause or seek had been done after the first completed

[20:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
IMO

[20:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(not sure if the spec says that)

[20:19:00.0000] <doublec>
What if they choose to seek, the seek is in operation ,they then choose to seek again, and again, then play, then pause, then seek, etc

[20:19:01.0000] <doublec>
should it stack them up?

[20:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it should be as if each completed in order, but since seek is absolute, not relative, right?

[20:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so it makes no difference whether you cancel the pending seek or not

[20:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
though obviously play/pause should not cancel seek, just affect the play state once the seek completes

[20:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: so I am curious why you are preparing all these demos of HTML5 features working in browsers

[20:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: presentation coming up?

[20:24:00.0000] <roc>
I think he said it was a Google presentation

[20:24:01.0000] <roc>
i.e. within Google

[20:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would go if it is one of the open-to-the-public kind

[20:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
/me <3s HTML5

[20:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, giving a demo on monday

[20:27:00.0000] <roc>
doublec: I think that the last seek request and the last play/pause request should be remembered and applied

[20:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: would it be OK if I borrowed your demos for a presentation I am supposed to give on HTML5 at Apple?

[20:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[20:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
doublec: send mail, and i'll fix the spec to handle the case where you start seeking while seeking is true

[20:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: we have some demos from WWDC that maybe I could share

[20:29:02.0000] <doublec>
roc: so v.seek(1); v.seek(2); v.seek(3); will have different hehaviour depending on timing?

[20:29:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: though only tested in Safari I think

[20:29:04.0000] <othermaciej>
like a calendar app that uses both Database storage and LocalStorage

[20:29:05.0000] <Hixie>
doublec: as far as i can tell, play() and pause() are already well-defined (they're orthogonal to seeking)

[20:29:06.0000] <othermaciej>
though I guess it's probably too late for me to get them to you for a Monday preso

[20:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: my plan is to write all the demos on the fly during the presentation

[20:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
also have some sexy video demos that include compositing and transforms

[20:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: (i have no slides)

[20:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so they're all pretty small and self-contained

[20:30:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: very cool

[20:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ours are fancy

[20:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you know how Apple gets

[20:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[20:31:03.0000] <doublec>
'write all the demos on the fly' that's brave :)

[20:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
well

[20:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
i'm writing them first

[20:31:06.0000] <Hixie>
and will print them out :-)

[20:31:07.0000] <Hixie>
and type them in on the fly :-)

[20:31:08.0000] <Hixie>
they're all pre-debugged, hence all this work today :-)

[20:31:09.0000] <roc>
just prerecord your editing session

[20:32:00.0000] <roc>
then do like lip-syncing, but with your keybaord

[20:32:01.0000] <gavin>
heh

[20:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think that's what this presentation is going to be -- me recording my editing session :-)

[20:35:00.0000] <roc>
doublec: yeah I guess, but not really very different behaviour. At some point the video will seek to time 3 and then play from there

[21:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think microsoft broke drag-and-drop with IE8beta23

[21:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
2

[21:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
can someone with an older version of IE test http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/samples/author/dhtml/refs/obj_dataTransferEX.htm to see if it still works?

[21:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
christ, IE crashes at the drop of the hat when you do drag-and-drop stuff

[00:21:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, garrett's name in the comments of acid3 is misspelled (missing the second 't'), assuming it's the same garrett who posts to public-html etc.

[00:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[00:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
(thanks)

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the warning on http://html5.validator.nu/?=&doc=http%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com%2Fprivacy%2F is bogus as far as i can tell

[01:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'm ready for my talk in 11 hours.

[02:00:00.0000] <krijnh>
Hixie: what talk?

[02:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm giving a demo of html5 features at google

[02:01:00.0000] <krijnh>
Ah

[02:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have no slides, my goal is to just sit in front of an editor and write up 9 demo files on the fly

[02:01:02.0000] <krijnh>
Do you also talk on conferences? :)

[02:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
(which i have cunningly prepared and debugged already)

[02:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
not if i can help it!

[02:01:05.0000] <krijnh>
Heh

[02:05:00.0000] <krijnh>
/me <strike>s Hixie as a possible speaker for next year :)

[02:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: are you suggesting removing the warning on "</" inside CDATA?

[02:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: will the demos be public after the talk?

[02:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or might the whole presentation end up on YouTube/Google Video?

[02:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
the demos will be public

[02:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me didn't know that historically "deprecate" meant "to pray against evil"

[02:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
demos are already public, though not in usable form: http://whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/

[02:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: thanks

[02:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
why should <video> and <audio> not work cross origin by default?

[02:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: is there something saying they should not?

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I suppose I could just zap the warning...

[02:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
a bug report

[02:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: in Opera's bug tracker?

[02:23:02.0000] <annevk2>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6104

[02:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa

[02:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that would pretty radically change the Web works compared to images and iframes

[02:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/the/the way the/

[02:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: er, yes, i was suggesting removing the warning

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the spec was changed to make it ok, since people put xml in <script> blocks, and all

[02:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: when we expose metadata, it'll allow cross-origin data transfer

[02:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: same reason we don't want xhr cross-domain, or svg accessible cross-domain

[02:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
or html

[02:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, bed time

[02:28:00.0000] <annevk2>
we could make the metadata depend on access control

[02:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: Does AC support a post-GET privilege upgrade check?

[02:30:01.0000] <annevk2>
you would do it during the GET request

[02:30:02.0000] <annevk2>
in case of failure you wouldn't stop loading the resource, but you would disallow certain things

[02:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: ah

[02:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
how does AC work with cross-origin images drawn on <canvas>?

[02:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(and trying to read back <canvas> data)

[02:31:03.0000] <annevk2>
it could enable that if defined by HTML5, yes

[02:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
pretty much only such use case I could think of so far

[02:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how far-fetched it would be for someone to put private stuff in glyphs in a font...

[02:33:00.0000] <roc>
I want to make all new kinds of resource loads to be same-origin by default with Access-Controls support for relaxing that

[02:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: why?

[02:33:02.0000] <roc>
simplicity

[02:34:00.0000] <roc>
consistency

[02:34:01.0000] <roc>
protection against unforseen security issues

[02:35:00.0000] <annevk2>
wow, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/div-vs-table

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: "wow" at the question or at the answers?

[02:38:01.0000] <annevk2>
mostly question

[02:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: and is that a positive or negative "wow"?

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
mostly negative

[02:39:01.0000] <annevk2>
also just surprised

[02:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I tend to agree with him that the arguments usually presented against layout tables don't stand the kind of scrutiny we usually subject stuff to here :-)

[02:40:01.0000] <roc>
I have to confess I think the anti-table-layout sentiment is overblown. There are too many things that are easy to do with tables but hard to do with CSS

[02:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, the worst layout breakages I've experienced on mobile devices (with proper browser engines!) have been cases where someone has tried to emulate table layouts in CSS

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and things have gotten really badly messed up with thin view ports

[02:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(proper browser engines being Gecko and Presto as of Opera 8)

[02:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, CSS is lacking something

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk2>
hopefully someone gets around publishing and updating flexbox soonish

[02:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
CSS positioning is much worse than tables

[02:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and positioning was for a long time put forward as the righteous replacement for tables

[02:45:03.0000] <hsivonen>
(worse in the sense that stuff breaks on view ports that the author did not expect)

[03:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yet another anecdote about broken longdesc: http://html4all.org/pipermail/list_html4all.org/2008-September/000999.html

[03:37:00.0000] <hendry>
anyone know if I can to test if a iframe is responsive? (didn't have JS crash)

[03:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: if you control the iframe, perhaps have a postMessage ping protocol?

[03:40:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: reference? will that work on crap browsers like pocket IE?

[03:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: the HTML5 spec. and no, it won't work in crap browsers

[03:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: does your boss make you support pocket IE?

[03:41:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: it's an example of an old browser

[03:41:02.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: basically working on sunspider to make it work when JS crashes in an iframe in some older (mobile) browsers

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
<iframe onload=...> or something?

[03:43:00.0000] <hendry>
annevk2: don't understand... how would i know JS has crashed/stopped processing? a timeout?

[03:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh, hmm

[03:44:01.0000] <annevk2>
maybe you could run some interval in the outer frame that updates or polls some information from the inner frame

[03:44:02.0000] <hendry>
http://perf.webvm.net/sunspider-0.9/sunspider-driver.html is what i am working on btw

[03:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: why do you care about benchmarking browsers that are too broken to run sunspider

[03:45:01.0000] <annevk2>
(I wouldn't use setInterval, but rather setTimeout that itself sets setTimeout from its callback function to prevent it from stalling everything)

[03:47:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: i find it interesting :) though seriously i would like to come up with a generic test driver that can proceed in cases where the JS crashes. It's probably need done somewhere?

[03:47:01.0000] <hendry>
s/need/been

[03:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: if you are willing to edit the contents of the iframe, you could make the outer page set a function on the window object of the iframe and have the iframe send heartbeat by calling the function

[03:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(see Hixie's live dom viewer for how to set it up)

[03:51:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: thanks, looks promising

someone should tell him that if you subscribe to whatwg and not public-html, it's no trouble at all to keep up

[04:14:01.0000] <roc>
hmm, the message just before that is interesting

[04:15:00.0000] <roc>
the truth is, there was a flurry of activity, then I posted to the list (via dbaron) and all activity ceased

[04:15:01.0000] <roc>
FEAR ME

[04:21:00.0000] <hendry>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20070703#l-518 # testframe.onerror is not catching JS errors in FF3 :/

[05:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the warning is now gone

[11:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh wow, we're going to have the whole "should browsers have one rendering engine per html mode" argument again. public-html is like the white hole episode of red dwarf only less funny

[11:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Are you aware of any discrepancies between the html5 spec and the html5lib test suite?

[11:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: But it's still somewhat funny?

[11:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Yes.

[11:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
public-html is becoming more and more useless :/

[11:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: It became that a long time ago.

[11:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: Is <http://anolis.quuz.org/source> up-to-date?

[11:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I haven't done a svn up for a while, but <option> in body stuff changed

[11:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
might be fixed already in the repo.

[11:35:00.0000] <hallvors>
/me wonders why building the old W3C test suites is so complicated.. :-p

[11:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: OK. I guess I can just look for the stuff in the tests that doesn't work as a reasonable approximation of all the brokenness

[11:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the option stuff is still broken

[11:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I just did an svn up

[11:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and it crashes my harness

[11:56:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, I made a good-faith effort to reply, now I give up

[11:59:00.0000] <takkaria>
it looks to me lke Sam/Justin don't actually author much in the way of HTML

[12:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
lock-in is in the legacy, so leaving the processing of legacy a mystery is bad

[12:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, yes, I believe it is

[12:14:00.0000] <annevk2>
wow, I'm still amazed that people on public-html are actually considering the idea of having multiple browser code paths depending on the DOCTYPE

[12:16:00.0000] <webben>
maybe the whatwg faq needs to say explicitly that all doctypes' parsing will be specified by HTML5.

[12:18:00.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, that is, that HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, etc. as text/html will all be treated as per HTML 5

[12:18:01.0000] <webben>
yep

[12:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
turned out my test harness needed a bigger mark limit when going back and forth in the test file stream

[12:22:00.0000] <webben>
I suppose the FAQ could also clarify that in so far as DOCTYPE will be used it would be to switch parsing modes and that HTML5 specifies both the switch and the parsing modes.

[12:23:00.0000] <webben>
but that these parsing differences are minimal

[12:23:01.0000] <webben>
(or alternately, expensive(?) but necessary for legacy content)

[12:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the spec doesn't cover quirks mode parsing properly yes

[12:24:01.0000] <webben>
isn't it going to?

[12:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it is going to

[12:24:03.0000] <hsivonen>
afaik

[12:25:00.0000] <webben>
*will specify then :)

[12:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/yes/yet/

[12:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is it intentional that <title> in 'in body' no longer gets hoisted to <head>?

[12:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the test cases also test <title> to head hoisting

[12:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
A FAQ entry like that would have to explain why HTML5 works that way, rather than just stating that it does, otherwise people will still argue that it should work differently without being aware of the problems

[12:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
and then it's not really a FAQ entry, and it's more like design rationale documentation or something

[12:30:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, <title> shouldn't move

[12:30:01.0000] <webben>
well, the FAQ could always link to a design rationale note.

[12:30:02.0000] <annevk2>
can someone formulate a question?

[12:30:03.0000] <annevk2>
/me can try to fill in the rest

[12:30:04.0000] <takkaria>
"Why doesn't HTML 5 leave HTML 4 parsing to HTML 4?"

[12:30:05.0000] <takkaria>
or s/parsing/handling/

[12:31:00.0000] <webben>
or more generally: "How will pre-HTML5 be parsed?"

[12:31:01.0000] <webben>
*pre-HTML5 documents

[12:31:02.0000] <webben>
doesn't have the word doctype in though

[12:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
thx

[12:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: As far as I can tell, 'title' in 'in body' is no longer specified to push the head pointer onto the stack

[12:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, yes, <body><title>xxx</title></body> should not move <title>

[12:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: oops. sorry. I misread what you said

[12:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#How_are_pre-HTML5_documents_parsed.3F

[12:44:00.0000] <webben>
annevk2: seems good to me :)

[15:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, my talk will apparently be on youtube in due course

[15:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
so you can all laugh at my horrible talk :-P

[15:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Did you add a funny accent?

[16:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
I found http://twitter.com/jaguarjaws/statuses/930818392 and http://twitter.com/tjohns/statuses/930869517 which I believe are directly related to your talk

[16:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
the biggest "wow" was for type=date which i thought was funny

[16:02:00.0000] <annevk2>
heh, maybe everyone made a date widget at one point? :)

[16:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
probably :-)

[16:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, those twitters are almost certainly from people who saw the talk

[16:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/ has the demos btw

[16:11:00.0000] <roc>
your DnD demo has interesting behaviour when you drag across browser windows

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh, didn't try that

[16:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
what does it do?

[16:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh i guess it gets the local one

[16:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[16:15:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: MS only took a 3-year break in the development of IE

[16:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i ended up not even mentioning that, i should just remove it from the notes

[16:17:00.0000] <roc>
aw, no offline apps demo

[16:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's fricking hard to demo offline stuff

[16:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
i considered it, but i was over time anyway, so i stuck with what i had

[16:19:02.0000] <roc>
yes it is

[16:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me updated the widgets/ directory to have all the various demos he did in different files

[16:20:01.0000] <roc>
we've done it. "Look the app's working. <disconnect network> Look, the app's still working!!!" somehow it's hard to make that exciting

[16:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i believe one of my lines was "and now the most surprising thing about this particular demo... (loads the demo in IE, shows that it works) it works in IE! (silence) well I thought it was surprising. Moving on..."

[16:21:01.0000] <annevk2>
I do mention offline in talks, which is enough to excite people it seems

[16:22:00.0000] <roc>
it totally lacks the "oooh, shiny" effect

[16:22:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, hehe

[16:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
someone asked what the status of xhtml was

[16:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
i tried to be politically correct

[16:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
but i'm sure i'll get flamed when the video is seen by people in the xhtml2wg

[16:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
how long did your talk take?

[16:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
an hour or so

[16:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
plus questions

[16:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me gave a talk a year or so ago where he said he didn't even want a google-internal video to exist, and in that talk he was highly politically incorrect

[16:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
that was fun

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think this is my first to-be-publicly-seen talk

[16:24:01.0000] <annevk2>
that was indeed a fun talk

[16:24:02.0000] <annevk2>
/me remembers reading the slides in Boston

[16:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh right, i showed you the slides

[16:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
teehee

[16:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i had no slides for my talk today

[16:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
also a first for me i believe

[16:25:02.0000] <annevk2>
you just sat there with a laptop?

[16:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[16:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
projected my emacs and showed things in five browsers

[16:59:00.0000] <blooberry>
hixie: what was the type="date" result that was so "ooooh" worthy?

[16:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
that it existed at all


2008-09-23
[17:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wish people would ooooh over type="email" too

[17:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hopefully it will save us from the plague of broken regular expressions

[17:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders if there's a corrolary to Godwin's Law for cheating by naming Mussolini and fascists instead

[17:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
You are assuming browsers won't implement type="email" with broken regular expressions

[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
and that the servers won't continue to do the checking in a broken way

[17:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Luckily I know regular expressions, so I could make my own build ;)

[17:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I suspect a good deal of people in the group making broken regexpes are also in the group thinking clientside validation is sufficient

[17:11:00.0000] <blooberry>
dashiva: I immediately think of http://xkcd.com/208/ when I see that. ;-}

[17:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: :-/

[17:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Email validation is such a joke anyway. If the domain and mailbox don't actually exist, it doesn't matter how well-formed the address is.

[17:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
But it can help detect unintentional typos

[17:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I can't think of any common cases a regexp would detect, apart from forgetting the @

[17:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(which is incidentally the regexp I usually recommend, .+@.+)

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
<input type=file accept> seems problematic

[17:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
there don't seem to be any use cases that limit the type without also limiting other things, like image size, framerate, audio codec, or whatever

[17:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it seems pointless to keep it

[17:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
the main use case was to enable on-the-fly video/audio/photo upload, but maybe we're better off providing direct access to the camera/mic

[17:57:00.0000] <shepazu>
that seems like that should be part of the file-upload spec

[17:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i was about to say that it seems like something to punt to the binary data work

[17:57:02.0000] <shepazu>
which arun will be editing, it seems

[17:58:00.0000] <shepazu>
I do agree we need to allow (controlled) access to camera & mic

[17:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah that's been requested a lot from cutting-edge app authors

[17:59:00.0000] <shepazu>
well, Flash has had it for many years

[17:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[17:59:02.0000] <shepazu>
and I'm sure Silverlight has it (or will)

[18:00:00.0000] <shepazu>
hmmm... wonder how that plays into uploading RAW files from a USB camera/memory card? or would that just be a normal file upload?

[18:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[18:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: accept is more useful as a hint than a limit

[18:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: so the UA can show a specialized media browser for audio, video or image types for example

[18:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
instead of generic file open dialog

[18:01:03.0000] <shepazu>
those files are huge... but photo-editing webapps would do well to allow them

[18:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: does anyone do that? or have any plans to?

[18:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Apple does not comment on future product releases

[18:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but I think it would be a swell idea, given that both Mac OS X and the iPhone have specific media picker UIs

[18:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
hypothetically, should someone want this to remain in the spec, would they want it to just be image|video|audio|mime-type ? or just image|audio|video ? or just mime-type? or something more elaborate?

[18:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
comma separated list, any mime supertype? parameters?

[18:03:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know if any of the other base MIME types are particularly useful

[18:03:04.0000] <othermaciej>
text and application don't tell you much

[18:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess font is a root type though?

[18:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
multipart either

[18:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
application  audio  example  image  message  model  multipart  text  video

[18:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway the semantics I describe are not really exactly what would be implied by "accept"

[18:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
html4 has accept="mime/type" iirc

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
wf2 has accept="mime/type,mime/type,mime/type" (comma-separated list) where any of the mime/type entries can be mime/* or */* as well

[18:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
single instance of mime/* (or just the base part) is the use case I would be most interested in

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
HTML4 has a comma-separated list

[18:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
so i propose making it a comma-separated list _or_ one of "image", "video", "audio"

[18:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
and the selected file(s) must either have the given types or be of the given category

[18:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
sound good?

[18:16:00.0000] <blooberry>
would there be any use in allowing multiple types at once for the latter?

[18:17:00.0000] <blooberry>
say, "image,audio"?

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the use case?

[18:35:00.0000] <roc>
shepazu: Silverlight doesn't have it

[18:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
flickr might want an "image,video" uploader

[18:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(if this results in a media browser with only image and video categories, say)

[18:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, true

[19:03:00.0000] <blooberry>
othermaciej: yeah, that was my thought. A restriction to "sighted media" would encompass both image and video. I can't think of an easy case for mixing audio with the others.

[19:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I could imagine a site where you could post audio or video

[19:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or any of audio, video or image but not other kinds of files

[19:04:01.0000] <blooberry>
hmm.

[19:04:02.0000] <blooberry>
itunes now is currently sellers->consumers. It does both audio and video. If in the future such a service allowed posting of same...

[22:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: wondering if I might steal some of your demos for my presentation at Web Directions South later this week

[01:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
Work on an HTML5 parser in Perl: http://suika.fam.cx/www/markup/html/whatpm/readme

[01:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: go for it

[01:38:00.0000] <ginger>
MikeSmith: I see you're speaking at Sydney this week - are you from AU?

[03:10:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
am i missing something with dir="rtl" and the table header algorithm?

[03:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: like what?

[03:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: "HTML 5's proposed smart scope algorithm pretty much does this, except it overlooks dir="rtl"." -- http://www.w3.org/mid/e2a28a920809230152p707fb0ccoc4edc9c3947d9bf5⊙mgc

[03:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i thought it would work exactly the same for rtl tables so i'm not sure what the algorithm is overlooking

[03:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[03:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i forgot to swap it around for rtl?

[03:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
though i thought i handled it

[03:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
rtl tables are just mirrored in the rendering

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah the algorithms looks to be direction agnostic

[03:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
algorithm. or look. one of the two.

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[04:23:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
why is window[0].document undefined in webkit?

[04:24:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3Ciframe%20src%3Ddata%3Atext%2Fhtml%2Cx%20onload%3Dw(window%5B0%5D.document)%3E

[04:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
is there a difference between importNode and cloneNode?

[04:28:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
in browsers i.e.

[04:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i don't understand why people have been working so hard on replacing html with something "saner"

[04:31:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
when no-one has pushed for browsers do replace the dom

[04:39:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
seems the difference is only in setting ownerDocument

[04:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm wonder how i should define cloning

[05:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: the DOM and HTML are not part of the W3C's Techology Stack...

[05:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I started writing a blog post about the technology stack yesterday but didn't have enough hours in a day to finish

[05:12:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i don't follow but i guess i'll read your blog post WIR

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I mean: the W3C has not only dropped HTML but has also dropped the DOM from its powerpointware

[05:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so presumably the DOM doesn't count as "saner", either

[05:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: but does the w3c have a replacement for the dom?

[05:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: the SVG WG has a uDOM, but other than that, not that I'm aware

[05:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Just use XPath and declarative expressions

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oops. I take that back. DOM is in the stack but not where I expected to see it. Sorry.

[06:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
gsnedders: i need automatic xrefs to html5 for web dom core :)

[06:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok i've specced importNode and cloneNode, except i've not covered attributes yes http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core

[06:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>

[07:58:00.0000] <csarven>
Ahh, is there a way to use unicode values in input[type=value] ?

[07:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
csarven: yes. UTF-8 of backslash escapes

[07:59:01.0000] <csarven>
Doh! Thanks.

[08:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
s/of/or/

[08:01:00.0000] <csarven>
hsivonen Sorry, my mistake, I've meant the @value for input type submit.

[08:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
csarven: in HTML?

[08:02:01.0000] <csarven>
Yes.

[08:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
csarven: doesn't Unicode Just Work there?

[08:03:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it should...

[08:03:01.0000] <csarven>
Trying to show the heart character ? &#9829;

[08:03:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
wfm in opera

[08:03:03.0000] <hsivonen>
csarven: might be a font problem

[08:04:00.0000] <csarven>
Well the character does display if I use the symbol directly as opposed to the char value.

[08:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
csarven: which browser and OS?

[08:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
WFM in Firefox 3 and Opera 9.5 on Leopard

[08:05:02.0000] <csarven>
Firefox/Vista. I must be doing this wrong then.

[08:08:00.0000] <csarven>
Do I have to use the octal value?

[08:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can't use octal - you should use decimal (&#9829;) or hex (&#x2665;)

[08:12:00.0000] <csarven>
I swear that is not working for me.

[08:12:01.0000] <Philip`>

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
shows me a hearty button

[08:13:01.0000] <csarven>
I'm guessing that Firebug is fooling me.

[08:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
csarven: are you testing with a data url?

[08:19:00.0000] <csarven>
zcorpan_ No.

[08:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sorry about html5.validator.nu being down...

[08:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
fixing it...

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how you could possibly do feature-sniffing of something like APNG, e.g. if you wanted to emulate it with scripts in less able browsers but didn't want to hardcode a list of UA strings

[10:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
with setTimeout and <canvas> or does it always draw the first frame?

[10:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You could use a APNG wih the dead frame showing "Click here to win a million dollars" and have onclick to do script animation

[10:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
<canvas> is defined (though not implemented) to always draw the poster frame or first frame

[10:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: spec bug

[10:12:01.0000] <annevk2>
can the first frame differ depending on APNG support?

[10:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
("When the drawImage() method is passed, as its image argument, an animated image, the poster frame of the animation, or the first frame of the animation if there is no poster frame, must be used.")

[10:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: The first frame can, but the poster-frame-or-else-first-frame can't

[10:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
(If an APNG has a poster frame, then that's what non-APNG implementations will show; otherwise the APNG only has a first frame, which is what non-APNG implementations will show)

[10:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Opera doesn't appear to even bother animating images unless they're visible on the screen, so it'd be kind of hard to do any reliable timer-based testing anyway

[10:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(See e.g. http://philip.html5.org/tests/apng/tests.html in Opera, like how the "dispose ops" images change colour briefly if you scroll them off then back on the screen, at least in my copies of Opera)

[11:25:00.0000] <csarven>
What's more accessible: &#9829; or <img> with @alt.

[12:38:00.0000] <takkaria>
I fear public-html

[12:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
csarven: Probably <img> with @alt.

[12:52:00.0000] <webben>
csarven: I suspect gsnedders right (at least in terms of user-agent support - e.g. encodings, fonts, screen readers pronouncing things right)

[12:52:01.0000] <webben>
csarven: e.g. JAWS confuses mathematical comparison symbols.

[12:55:00.0000] <csarven>
gsnedders webben Thanks.

[12:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(I don't claim to be an accessibility expert, so maybe I'm right)

[12:56:00.0000] <csarven>
They are both fairly close IMO.

[12:56:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Having a list of symbol names is pretty simple, so it seems likely it wouldn't be supported :P

[12:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: IIRC, VoiceOver (in English) can fall back onto the unicode character name

[12:59:01.0000] <webben>
I think all pop. screen readers allow users to customize their dictionaries too

[13:00:00.0000] <webben>
of course, they'd need to know to do that in advance.

[13:01:00.0000] <webben>
Perhaps worth thinking about whether the unicode char name is what you really _mean_ however. e.g. it might be "black heart". "I black heart HTML5" for example doesn't necessarily convey the sense well.

[13:01:01.0000] <webben>
/me checks

[13:02:00.0000] <webben>
apparently the name is "BLACK HEART SUIT"

[13:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So you want text equivalents for text

[13:07:00.0000] <hdh>
just like smileys, abbr[title]

[13:09:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: is it text?

[13:09:01.0000] <webben>
(seems a bit inbetweeny)

[13:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, is a metaphor text?

[13:16:00.0000] <webben>
Not necessarily.

[13:16:01.0000] <webben>
You can speak a metaphor, for starters :)

[13:17:00.0000] <webben>
I'm not sure I (heart symbol) X is a strictly a metaphor anyways.

[13:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems less useful to ponder whether ♥ is text, than to ponder concrete use cases like how a non-visual UA could interpret that character

[13:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
e.g., I <abbr title="love">♥</abbr> Philip`.

[13:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
As opposed to, I picked up a <abbr title="suite of hearts">♥</abbr> card.

[13:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be nice if AI could work out whether it's an abbreviation for the word "love" or is representing a card suit or is part of a manual for medical students or whatever

[13:59:03.0000] <gsnedders>
How about &gt;3?

[14:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
☙

[14:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/g/l/

[14:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wonder how well you could do by just determining whether ♥ is being used as a verb, in which case it probably means "love"

[14:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what about ❤

[15:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
the criticism of whatwg in http://www.alistapart.com/articles/webstandards2008 misses the mark by a wide margin

[15:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are plenty of things to criticise the whatwg for

[15:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
those aren't it :-)

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. we're anonymous??

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
and lack of leadership?? i thought the whole problem was that my being a dictator.

[15:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/that//

[15:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
and "No economic support" is a con?

[15:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I like the repeated use of "Nothing demonstrates this more than..."

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
the second one of those is wrong too (webkit is always careful to prefix their extensions)

[15:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
and "Nothing demonstrates this more than Mozilla’s and Opera’s inability to grow a user base beyond a certain point." is totaly wrong

[15:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
first of all firefox market share hasn't peaked

[15:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
and secondly, opera's market share being flat is clearly not anything to do with proprietary stuff since firefox's market share is bigger than opera's

[15:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
the entirety of the "Is "breaking the Web" with HTML 5 a non issue" thread got caught in my "AAA-Productivity" folder

[15:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
my filters work remarkably well

[15:47:00.0000] <roc>
I think I'd better not read this or I will be unnecessarily enraged

[15:48:00.0000] <roc>
why is it so hard to resist the temptation

[15:48:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Rage, rage against the thread of the email

[15:55:00.0000] <gavin__>
Hixie: I think you missed the "rather than" in front of "anonymous"

[15:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, yes, good call

[15:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok then i'll complain that "not enough time for research" is ridiculous given that we do more research and have more time in our timetable than any w3c project to date


2008-09-24
[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
well crap

[18:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
html5 doesn't have anything that's comma-separated

[18:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
so making accept= comma separated is way more work than it should be

[19:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: But once you have comma support there's room for input @type=email-list :D

[19:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
-_-

[19:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
awh, don't give me that face

[19:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[19:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
rfc2045 doesn't actually define anything that matches   type "/" subtype

[20:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wakaba: you there?

[20:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
wanted to ask about you conformance-checker implementation

[21:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://blog.mozilla.com/blassey/2008/09/23/camera-input-tag/

[21:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: you there?

[21:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
yo

[21:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey man. Wanted to ask if I might be able to steal your demos from your presentation earlier this week

[22:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, totally

[22:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
you asked earlier and i said yes already in fact :-)

[22:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: sorry, I guess I missed your Yes. I got a crap network connection here

[22:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: you got a URL?

[22:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg.org/demos/

[22:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
link near the bottom

[22:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[22:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[00:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
aw, still no tag minutes

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
no XHTML2 minutes, either

[02:43:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i just marked all new (since yesterday) emails on public-html as read

[02:43:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hope i didn't miss something interesting

[02:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I just learned that I'm not getting email due to an electricity outage

[03:14:00.0000] <glazou>
hell

[03:14:01.0000] <glazou>
o

[03:15:00.0000] <glazou>
I have a question related to html5 drag and drop, section 6.8.4.2

[03:17:00.0000] <glazou>
how can the drag source know the draganddrop succeeded but on the desktop ?

[03:18:00.0000] <glazou>
I want my script, from onDrop on the source, to perform a special operation in that case

[03:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
funny, 3 out of 5 WHATWG demos are obsolete per latest thinking

[03:34:00.0000] <glazou>
hi annevk2

[03:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
glazou: bonjour. nice to see you here

[03:34:02.0000] <glazou>
hi henri

[03:34:03.0000] <glazou>
I'm playing with html5 d&d and find a few issues in a multi-app environmet

[03:35:00.0000] <glazou>
environment even

[03:35:01.0000] <glazou>
I think i'll send it to the mailing-list

[03:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
bonjour, dunno much about d&d

[03:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
d&d isn't my area, either

[03:37:02.0000] <annevk2>
there is this demo though: http://www.whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/dnd/dnd.html

[03:38:00.0000] <glazou>
looking

[03:40:00.0000] <glazou>
yeah does not help me

[03:40:01.0000] <glazou>
/me writes an email to the list

[04:01:00.0000] <glazou>
sent

[04:01:01.0000] <glazou>
hey tantek was here and I did not see hm :-(

[04:01:02.0000] <annevk2>
he's mostly lurking

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh hey, i should have checked irc before my e-mail

[04:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
glazou: just replied to your message

[04:08:01.0000] <glazou>
thanks Hixie

[04:09:00.0000] <glazou>
Hixie, you can't use mouse events...

[04:09:01.0000] <glazou>
you're outside of the window !

[04:09:02.0000] <glazou>
you don't even get the evens

[04:09:03.0000] <glazou>
events

[04:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
right, hence the capture API

[04:09:05.0000] <glazou>
exactly but it's not here yet

[04:09:06.0000] <Hixie>
(the idea is the (new) method would make it so all mouse events until the button is released would go to the element you pick, instead of the real target)

[04:09:07.0000] <Hixie>
correct, there's no real solution for this today

[04:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
even with that API, you still couldn't position or scale the window, so you couldn't do, e.g., what chrome or safari do with dragging of tabs

[04:10:01.0000] <glazou>
sigh

[04:10:02.0000] <glazou>
yep

[04:10:03.0000] <glazou>
/me is missing this right now in FF

[04:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
that's probably more something for css animation and css transform though

[04:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
at least the scaling and animation aspects

[04:11:01.0000] <glazou>
I guess the "detach sidebar item" menuitem is all I can do for the time being :-(

[04:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
the window positioning, i don't know

[04:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
part of the problem is that we're somewhat moving away from letting web authors control windows

[04:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. i see what chrome does with window.open() to be the way forward for window.open()

[04:11:05.0000] <Hixie>
which is in-tab

[04:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd expect things like docking, snapping, and dragging of ui elements to be a ua-level feature rather than webapp-level

[04:13:00.0000] <glazou>
Hixie: never heard of Prism or Adobe Air ? web-apps are ua-level these days...

[04:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
even with prism (or apps generated by <bb type=makeapp> in html5) the apps are still webapps, so they're still sandboxed

[04:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
adobe air apps are privileged, so they're not subject to the limitations (and they're as dangerous as native apps)

[04:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think we'd want to give Safari standalone web apps any special privs

[04:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's quite amusing how much of wf2 is written defensively. it's almost like a manifesto in places rather than a spec.

[04:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yet another way in which it is too reactive against XForms

[04:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[05:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
Karl is leaving the W3C: http://twitter.com/karlw3c/statuses/932668509

[05:12:01.0000] <glazou>
yep

[05:12:02.0000] <glazou>
Hixie: you've seen <input type="camera"> ?

[05:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
he's changing it in <input type=file accept=image/png>, no?

[05:13:01.0000] <annevk2>
or some such

[05:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
glazou: i haven't; uri?

[05:13:03.0000] <annevk2>
mikesmith posted it earlier

[05:13:04.0000] <glazou>
http://blog.mozilla.com/blassey/2008/09/23/camera-input-tag/

[05:14:00.0000] <glazou>
very ineresting

[05:14:01.0000] <glazou>
see also my blog for my comments

[05:14:02.0000] <glazou>
annevk2: hmm seems a bad change to me

[05:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, yeah

[05:15:01.0000] <annevk2>
wasn't sure about it either

[05:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
this is an area that needs some serious infrastructure work

[05:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
glazou: so if I don't have a webcam, how do I connect a jpg file to type=camera?

[05:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
because what we really need is a way to get stream objects

[05:15:05.0000] <Hixie>
so we can send video streams

[05:15:06.0000] <Hixie>
forms aren't really suitable for that

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(actually, all my Internet devices have a camera, but I run my MacBook with lid closed and Cinema Displays don't have cameras for some reason)

[05:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
probably an area for WebSocket, too

[05:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
and the blob apis, whenever we get around to those

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
given the security considerations, <input type=file> makes sense

[05:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if the text field is zapped

[05:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and there's UI for both browsing the file system and activating a camera

[05:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
woah, runaway error on the validator

[05:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me gets thousands of errors

[05:20:00.0000] <glazou>
hsivonen: if you don't have a webcam the input element shows "no webcam"

[05:21:00.0000] <glazou>
" UI for both browsing the file system and activating a camera" is faaaaar beyond an average user's knowledge

[05:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen, aha, originally the error here was <span title="foo</span> instead of <span title="foo">foo</span>

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
glazou: how is it beyond user's knowledge to have something like: 

[05:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Upload photo: [Use Camera] [Choose file]

[05:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[05:22:03.0000] <glazou>
that should be author's decision

[05:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
[Use Camera] [Choose file] is browser-managed

[05:23:01.0000] <glazou>
if the web page is made for cameras only for instance

[05:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
glazou: why author decisions instead of user decision?

[05:23:03.0000] <glazou>
author's decision overridable by user

[05:24:00.0000] <glazou>
hsivonen: when a web site gives you a wysiwyg editable area, do you need to override author's decision to show a textarea for source code ?

[05:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
so did karl decide to move on like dino?

[05:25:00.0000] <glazou>
Hixie: I started pondering about it long ago

[05:25:01.0000] <glazou>
and w3c has a few financial issues these days

[05:25:02.0000] <glazou>
seemed the right time to move on I guess

[05:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think we'd probably let <input type="file" accept="image"> have a camera option

[05:26:01.0000] <glazou>
d'oh firefox does not set screenX/screenY on ondragend

[05:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but that might not be as nice as an in-page preview

[05:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
glazou: camera is more hardware and user situation dependent

[05:26:04.0000] <glazou>
othermaciej, hsivonen: my only goal here is the following one : get rid of the dozens of flash-based widgets that do only webcam capture

[05:27:00.0000] <glazou>
and "please attach a portrait" with file upload 

[05:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
glazou: shouldn't the camera input degrade to file upload in old UAs, though?

[05:28:00.0000] <glazou>
yep

[05:28:01.0000] <glazou>
hsivonen: but that's a camera or input ; you suggested above camera and input

[05:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
that argues for type=file plus something in another attribute

[05:28:03.0000] <othermaciej>
glazou: I like replacing things that Flash does

[05:28:04.0000] <glazou>
not necessarily

[05:28:05.0000] <glazou>
othermaciej: eheh :)

[05:28:06.0000] <othermaciej>
is it important for picture taking UI to be direct in the browser window?

[05:28:07.0000] <othermaciej>
the preview at least?

[05:28:08.0000] <glazou>
yes

[05:28:09.0000] <glazou>
it's a webapp

[05:28:10.0000] <glazou>
standalone

[05:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the dialog on <input type="file"> is an important security feature in a way

[05:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
since it prevents Web Apps from tricking you into uploading a file

[05:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
glazou: why can't the browser put up a preview dialog/sheet?

[05:29:03.0000] <glazou>
well the browser should always ask "do you want to let this web page use your webcam ?"

[05:29:04.0000] <othermaciej>
a preview where you click a separate button to upload with no dialog could have security issues

[05:29:05.0000] <glazou>
hsivonen: because dialogs are bad

[05:29:06.0000] <hsivonen>
glazou: that seems like the wrong way. rather, I'd want the capture to be user action initiated

[05:29:07.0000] <othermaciej>
security alerts are bad, especially when divorced from the task

[05:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
like the Browse button on file upload today

[05:30:01.0000] <glazou>
hsivonen: I can live with that too

[05:30:02.0000] <glazou>
/me has a meeting at the French Senate and must run

[05:30:03.0000] <glazou>
bye people

[05:30:04.0000] <hsivonen>
bye

[05:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
i should go too

[05:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have a meeting with my bed.

[06:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
you could have an overlay the moment you hit "use webcam"

[06:07:01.0000] <annevk2>
just like you get an overlay for <input type=date>

[06:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i wonder if i need something more generic for HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR checking

[06:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
than listing all conditions for all methods when it should throw

[06:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe i should say "this is a legal tree" and "if running this algorithm would result an illegal tree, raise exception"

[06:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
how do you get a node from a cross origin document?

[06:33:01.0000] <annevk2>
re: adoptNode

[06:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees that Gandi's hosting will cost double what the beta did, and wonders if that affects hsivonen's preferences much

[06:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
something made Ubuntu crash...

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the new price makes it less attractive to keep both the Kotisivut.com VM and the Gandi VM

[06:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: having only a Gandi VM is a bit iffy considering that I'd have no practical recourse if Gandi opted to delete my VM (dealing with a local company is safer in that sense)

[06:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: having only the Kotisivut.com VM isn't that great, either, because it can't flex

[07:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: you set document.domain

[07:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan_, why should importNode not work when both sites have set document.domain?

[07:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: it should

[07:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan_, then it's still not clear to me when you can exchange nodes cross origin (because document.domain doesn't matter)

[07:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: you can exchange nodes when both nodes's ownerDocument have the same effective script origin

[07:58:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: setting document.domain affects the effective script origin

[07:58:01.0000] <annevk2>
"Providing search engines with dynamic URLs should be favored over hiding parameters to make them look static." from http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/09/dynamic-urls-vs-static-urls.html wtf

[07:58:02.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan_, in what scenario would the SECURITY_ERR be raised?

[08:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: hmm i see what you mean... it's not possible to get a reference to a node that you can't adopt

[08:04:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
or is it?

[08:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
I don't think it is

[08:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
sweet then i can just remove the check

[08:08:01.0000] <annevk2>
though now I wonder what the origin of responseXML is

[08:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: That blog post seems to be kind of confusing at getting the intended point across

[08:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
where the point seems to be that answer.foo?language=en&answer=3&sid=98971298178906&query=URL is better than answer.foo/en/3/98971298178906/URL because it's easier for a computer to work out what part of the URL is a parameter and hence might not significantly affect the document retrieved from that URL

[08:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
but it sounds quite easily misinterpretable as e.g. saying answer.foo?answer=3&... is better than answer.foo/3?..., which (I think) it doesn't mean

[08:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
yeah

[08:42:01.0000] <annevk2>
my weblogis indexed fine

[08:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
and they better keep it that way

[09:29:00.0000] <myakura>

[09:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
myakura: cool. have you tested it?

[09:33:00.0000] <myakura>
hsivonen: no. just started reading the code.

[09:34:00.0000] <myakura>
there's a test case though http://svn.coderepos.org/share/lang/javascript/exdomstorage/trunk/sample/index.html

[09:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
only the localStorage part of the demo works for me

[09:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, I think this should be on the wiki

[09:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like it's just implemented with cookies

[10:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: Stack Overflow also has: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42169/if-you-were-programming-a-calendar-in-html-would-you-use-table-tags-or-div-tags

[11:18:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, shouldn't you use .data rather than .message in the workers spec?

[11:18:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, event.data vs. event.message that is

[11:22:00.0000] <annevk2>
seems the mistake is only in the examples

[11:22:01.0000] <sicking>
annevk2, yeah

[11:41:00.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: yt?

[11:41:01.0000] <sicking>
yo, talking workers with Ben :)

[11:43:00.0000] <aboodman>
i think the key point you're missing is that it should be easy to create 'conversations'

[11:43:01.0000] <aboodman>
in fact, i would argue that should really be the only way to communicate with a worker

[11:43:02.0000] <aboodman>
this is real feedback we have gotten on gears workers

[11:44:00.0000] <aboodman>
once you accept that, it pretty much leads to my proposed design

[11:44:01.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, it's just as easy now as with your proposal, no? The difference is just in the name 'startConversaion' vs 'connect'

[11:45:00.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: one sec, loading spec

[11:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me thinks 'connect' looks much easier to spell :-)

[11:46:00.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, though there is a different way, as well, to communicate with dedicated workers, yes

[11:46:01.0000] <aboodman>
what is supposed to happen in the current spec when someone calls 'startconversation' on a dedicated worker

[11:46:02.0000] <aboodman>
does a 'connect' event fire inside the worker?

[11:46:03.0000] <sicking>
yeah

[11:47:00.0000] <aboodman>
k, there is a bug in the spec then

[11:47:01.0000] <sicking>
(btw, i'm fine with renaming 'startConversaion' to 'connect' if that makes a difference)

[11:47:02.0000] <sicking>
oh?

[11:47:03.0000] <aboodman>
onconnect is only on SharedWorkerGlobalScope from what I can see

[11:47:04.0000] <aboodman>
yes, we should make that change, startConveration() -> connect()

[11:48:00.0000] <sicking>
oh

[11:48:01.0000] <sicking>
wait

[11:48:02.0000] <sicking>
you're right

[11:48:03.0000] <sicking>
when startConversaion is called onmessage is called

[11:48:04.0000] <sicking>
not onconnect

[11:48:05.0000] <aboodman>
oh, because startConversation takes a message

[11:48:06.0000] <aboodman>
and where does the port show up?

[11:49:00.0000] <sicking>
and you get an event with a string and a port

[11:49:01.0000] <sicking>
right

[11:49:02.0000] <aboodman>
so we basically have *three* different mechanisms at work

[11:49:03.0000] <aboodman>
a) you can use workers the old school way, like gears is today, with one channel shared between all clients

[11:49:04.0000] <sicking>
two in shared and two in dedicated, with one existing in both

[11:49:05.0000] <sicking>
yeah

[11:50:00.0000] <aboodman>
b) you can call startConversation(), which fires a message event, and the worker code has to know to fish the port out of the event, instead of using the global port object

[11:50:01.0000] <aboodman>
c) you can create an instance of a shared worker, which will fire onconnect

[11:50:02.0000] <aboodman>
which has a port you can use to respond

[11:50:03.0000] <aboodman>
i think it would be very nice to combine all these into one mechanism

[11:50:04.0000] <sicking>
'a' only exists for dedicated, and 'c' only for shared

[11:51:00.0000] <sicking>
i agree it seems excessive

[11:51:01.0000] <aboodman>
right, but there are still three things to understand

[11:51:02.0000] <sicking>
yup

[11:51:03.0000] <sicking>
/me ponders

[11:51:04.0000] <aboodman>
in my proposal usage is always the same

[11:51:05.0000] <aboodman>
connect() gets you a port

[11:51:06.0000] <aboodman>
call sendMessage() on port

[11:51:07.0000] <aboodman>
on the inside, you get onconnect

[11:51:08.0000] <aboodman>
reply on the port you got from onconnect

[11:51:09.0000] <sicking>
it does make it painful for the most simple case though

[11:52:00.0000] <aboodman>
i don't agree :)

[11:52:01.0000] <aboodman>
it makes it one line more painful

[11:52:02.0000] <aboodman>
a small price i think

[11:52:03.0000] <sicking>
everybody will end up with code like        onconnect = function(e) { myPort = e.port; myPort.onmessage = myHandler }

[11:53:00.0000] <sicking>
everyone will have to write that snippet of code

[11:53:01.0000] <aboodman>
i would really prefer that we have a global onconnect, which would help that case

[11:53:02.0000] <sicking>
that is with a global onconnect

[11:53:03.0000] <aboodman>
sorry,

[11:53:04.0000] <aboodman>
global onmessage

[11:53:05.0000] <sicking>
that gets very messy with passable ports

[11:53:06.0000] <aboodman>
how so?

[11:54:00.0000] <sicking>
all of a sudden your global onmessage starts receiving more messages since someone passed in a port

[11:55:00.0000] <sicking>
and will your global onmessage still receive messages from ports that have been passed elsewhere?

[11:55:01.0000] <aboodman>
that would presumably only happen if the passed port is live

[11:55:02.0000] <aboodman>
but that's a good point with the idea of having a global onmessage

[11:55:03.0000] <aboodman>
that is a problem

[11:55:04.0000] <aboodman>
ok, i'm fine not having a global onmessage. the inside code becomes:

[11:55:05.0000] <sicking>
i think we can narrow it down to two communication methods maybe

[11:55:06.0000] <sicking>
the simple one for dedicated workers

[11:55:07.0000] <aboodman>
onconnect = function(e) { e.onmessage = function() { ... } }

[11:56:00.0000] <aboodman>
which is not that different from what people do with onload today

[11:56:01.0000] <sicking>
how so? today you just do onload = function () { ... }

[11:56:02.0000] <aboodman>
onload = function() { myButton.onclick = function() { ... } }

[11:56:03.0000] <sicking>
also you need to store e.port so you can post stuff out

[11:56:04.0000] <aboodman>
no you dont

[11:57:00.0000] <aboodman>
you get the port in the messages

[11:57:01.0000] <aboodman>
(i thought)

[11:57:02.0000] <sicking>
you do?

[11:57:03.0000] <sicking>
maybe as the source

[11:57:04.0000] <aboodman>
yeah, as the source

[11:57:05.0000] <sicking>
though that only works if you're inside a message handler

[11:57:06.0000] <sicking>
it doesn't work if you are just producing data

[11:58:00.0000] <sicking>
such as polling data from the network and sending out stuff to the window

[11:58:01.0000] <aboodman>
that is a lesser use case

[11:58:02.0000] <aboodman>
we only need to support it, not make it beautiful

[11:58:03.0000] <aboodman>
imo

[11:58:04.0000] <sicking>
isn't that what you guys needed for gmail?

[11:58:05.0000] <aboodman>
gmail? gears? what?

[11:58:06.0000] <aboodman>
:)

[11:58:07.0000] <aboodman>
no, we don't do that

[11:58:08.0000] <aboodman>
it was a hypothetical use case

[11:59:00.0000] <aboodman>
anyway you still don't need to store the port for that use case if you use closures, which is pretty common

[11:59:01.0000] <aboodman>
but i admit: there is more leg work here.

[12:00:00.0000] <aboodman>
on both sides.

[12:00:01.0000] <aboodman>
it's a tradeoff for having the api be consistent across all use cases.

[12:01:00.0000] <sicking>
so i think we should reduce to 2 communication methods. A simple one for the most common (imho) and simple case, dedicated worker with a single communication channel. And one complicated one for shared workers and/or multiple conversaions

[12:02:00.0000] <aboodman>
multiple conversations will be very common

[12:02:01.0000] <sicking>
i really think anything beyond just a single dedicated worker that you put off some heavy work onto is going to be much more rare

[12:02:02.0000] <aboodman>
the most common case that I'm aware of is synchronization

[12:02:03.0000] <aboodman>
of a local db with the network

[12:03:00.0000] <aboodman>
in that case, the common implementation will be: a single shared worker

[12:03:01.0000] <aboodman>
each UI action will create a conversation

[12:03:02.0000] <aboodman>
and wait for it's reply

[12:03:03.0000] <sicking>
i think it'll be more stuff like crypto or parsing or stuff like that

[12:03:04.0000] <aboodman>
the shared worker is filling the role of a server. so you need transaction ids.

[12:04:00.0000] <sicking>
for a shared worker i agree that having multiple conversaions is going to be the common case

[12:04:01.0000] <aboodman>
not just for a shared worker though.

[12:04:02.0000] <sicking>
which is why we should make that the only way to communicate to a shared worker

[12:04:03.0000] <sicking>
for a dedicated i think just a single conversation is going to be much more common

[12:04:04.0000] <aboodman>
if you have a worker providing services for a UI, and the user can initiate multiple actions in parallel, thenyou need conversations.

[12:06:00.0000] <aboodman>
say you have a UI that has three buttons, and each button sets off a lengthy operation that you perform in a worker.

[12:06:01.0000] <aboodman>
without conversations, you need to keep track of which reply went with which button manually.

[12:06:02.0000] <aboodman>
blech.

[12:07:00.0000] <sicking>
i agree that we should have conversaions for sure

[12:08:00.0000] <sicking>
but i don't think we should force that onto the usecase of a single dedicated worker wanting to perform some heavy work such as crypto on a worker

[12:08:01.0000] <aboodman>
in that case, it's just one extra line

[12:08:02.0000] <aboodman>
or 10 extra characters if you chain the method call :)

[12:08:03.0000] <sicking>
the difference is that i think it'll be the common case

[12:08:04.0000] <sicking>
so i prefer to optimize for making that simple

[12:09:00.0000] <aboodman>
s/10/8/g (i can't spell)

[12:10:00.0000] <aboodman>
ok, but at the very least, it sounds like you agree the api can be simplified for shared workers and conversations on a dedicated worker along the lines i proposed:

[12:10:01.0000] <aboodman>
* remove the port properties in the shared worker interfaces

[12:11:00.0000] <aboodman>
* make startconversation just return a port, and fire onconnect

[12:11:01.0000] <sicking>
are there port properties on shared workers?

[12:11:02.0000] <aboodman>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/#shared1

[12:12:00.0000] <sicking>
oh

[12:12:01.0000] <sicking>
ooh

[12:12:02.0000] <sicking>
i remember

[12:12:03.0000] <aboodman>
there is none on the inside, i don't know why

[12:12:04.0000] <sicking>
yeah, i'm fine with removing that

[12:13:00.0000] <sicking>
the way it works now is that when you create a shared worker

[12:13:01.0000] <sicking>
that basically calls startConversation

[12:13:02.0000] <sicking>
except onconnect rather than onmessage is fired

[12:13:03.0000] <aboodman>
right

[12:13:04.0000] <sicking>
and the 'outer' port is put on the .port rather than being returned anywhere

[12:14:00.0000] <sicking>
btw, there is basically no way we can remove onmessage as a way to set up conversaions

[12:14:01.0000] <sicking>
since you can just use    postMessage("here ya go", myPort)

[12:15:00.0000] <aboodman>
i don't follow

[12:15:01.0000] <sicking>
so today you can do this:

[12:15:02.0000] <sicking>
ch = new MessageChannel;

[12:15:03.0000] <sicking>
w = new SharedWorker(...);

[12:16:00.0000] <sicking>
w.postMessage("lets talk", ch.port2);

[12:16:01.0000] <sicking>
ch.port1.onmessage = function(e) { ... }

[12:17:00.0000] <aboodman>
i guess

[12:17:01.0000] <aboodman>
i still don't understand this use case at all

[12:17:02.0000] <aboodman>
but it is orthagonal to what i'm talking about

[12:17:03.0000] <sicking>
yeah, that's basically already part of HTML5, not part of workers at all

[12:17:04.0000] <aboodman>
if people also want the ability to pass ports around, ok...

[12:17:05.0000] <sicking>
Hixie has been talking about that a lot

[12:17:06.0000] <aboodman>
html5 is not really set in stone

[12:18:00.0000] <sicking>
so i assume that google wants that

[12:18:01.0000] <aboodman>
nobody has implemented this feature yet, right?

[12:18:02.0000] <sicking>
for widgets and the like

[12:18:03.0000] <aboodman>
somebody wants it, just not me.

[12:18:04.0000] <sicking>
not sure if the other postMessage implementations do that

[12:18:05.0000] <sicking>
heh :)

[12:18:06.0000] <aboodman>
i don't think it's valid to say 'it's already in html5, we can't remove it'

[12:19:00.0000] <aboodman>
the spec specifically says that it is in progress

[12:19:01.0000] <aboodman>
if there are good reasons to pass ports around, hey, great, let's keep them.

[12:19:02.0000] <sicking>
so i don't want to talk for hixie, but from what i understand there were requirements around widgets that required that

[12:19:03.0000] <aboodman>
he explained them in our last meeting, i just am still not convinced.

[12:19:04.0000] <aboodman>
anyway, i think that issue can be separated.

[12:21:00.0000] <sicking>
sure

[12:23:00.0000] <aboodman>
so would you be in favor of: (my proposal - global onmessage) + DedicatedWorker::sendMessage + DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope::onmessage

[12:23:01.0000] <sicking>
yup, think so :)

[12:23:02.0000] <aboodman>
ok, that is still a significant change from the current spec

[12:24:00.0000] <sicking>
i think it can be discussed if we should have an 'onconnect' or if we should reuse 'onmessage'

[12:24:01.0000] <aboodman>
you mean just overloading the event?

[12:24:02.0000] <aboodman>
so you get an onmessage event when a connection happens?

[12:24:03.0000] <sicking>
/me ponders

[12:24:04.0000] <sicking>
right, some such

[12:25:00.0000] <sicking>
hmm

[12:25:01.0000] <sicking>
doesn't really work for shared workers since they don't have onmessage

[12:25:02.0000] <sicking>
so yeah, what you said :)

[12:27:00.0000] <aboodman>
thanks, i will reply to the mail thread pointing to this irc log and summarizing

[12:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me reads the log and sees 'startConversaion', 'startconversation', 'startConversaion', 'startConveration', 'startConversaion', 'startConversation', and continues to think that renaming to 'connect' would be good

[12:38:00.0000] <aboodman>
:)

[12:38:01.0000] <aboodman>
as a rule, my poor typing should not be taken as indication of the quality of an api.

[12:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
aboodman: It's an indication of the problems that many other people are likely to experience

[12:40:00.0000] <aboodman>
i'm in favor of 'connect()'

[12:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Data suggests that <script langauge="..."> is pretty common

[12:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is apparently why we have <meter> instead of <gauge>

[12:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
So I think those typos are relevant evidence :-)

[12:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
although I'm probably wrong

[12:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
because people take more care when typing code than typing IRC

[12:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
and so typos will be much rarer when people write actual code, and only real spelling difficulties matter

[12:44:00.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, so with connect there will still be 3 ways to have a conversation (sort of) on a dedicated worker

[12:44:01.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, as the html5 spec stands today

[12:44:02.0000] <aboodman>
explain/

[12:45:00.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, i'm not really opposed to changing that, but it would need changing

[12:45:01.0000] <aboodman>
sicking: how so?

[12:45:02.0000] <sicking>
aboodman, so there will be     worker.postMessage('hi there');

[12:45:03.0000] <sicking>
ch = new MessageChannel(); worker.postMessage('lets converse', ch.port1);

[12:46:00.0000] <sicking>
and  port = worker.connect();

[12:46:01.0000] <sicking>
i'm not in love with the second one, but as things stand it's there

[12:47:00.0000] <aboodman>
i guess, i don't count that one because i don't see people doing it.

[12:47:01.0000] <aboodman>
you'll only use that when you want to do ... whatever it is hixie forsees people doing with it

[12:47:02.0000] <sicking>
well

[12:47:03.0000] <aboodman>
but ok.

[12:47:04.0000] <sicking>
there is the argument that impls will end up having to impl all 3 since hixie will use it in acid7

[12:48:00.0000] <aboodman>
let's keep the issue of passing ports separate.

[12:48:01.0000] <sicking>
no matter if people want it or not

[12:48:02.0000] <aboodman>
i think they really are separate concerns.

[12:48:03.0000] <sicking>
ok

[13:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me is very confused about the feedback on workers

[13:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: n00b.

[13:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: the original API had just one way of using messages, and you and aaron both asked for more ways (he asked for .startConversation, you asked for the API to be flattened onto the dedicated workers for ease of use)

[13:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: and now you're both asking for the APIs to be unified again but leaving some of the differences?

[13:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
what changed?

[14:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
holy wow

[14:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
i scanned 100 million documents and found absolutely no occurances of <input type=file accept>

[14:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me increases his sample by a factor of 10 and tries again

[14:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I am far too good at procrasintating.

[14:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Must. write. personal. statement.

[14:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But my stomach hurts and I don't wanna.

[14:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees some with <input type=text accept> and <input type=submit accept>, but isn't surprised that he doesn't see any on type=file because it's very unlikely that a site will have a file upload box on public pages

[14:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
there were lots of <input type=file> elements

[14:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
just none with accept

[14:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://google.com/codesearch?q=type%3D%22file%22+accept%3D

[14:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems reasonably common and varied there

[14:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
what does "Generating the page that the server would have generated on the fly on the client side while offline seems really hacky. I really don't 

[14:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[14:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
what does |accept="{@mime-types}"| do in xslt?

[14:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Wild guess: Sets the accept attribute value on the output element to be the value of the mime-types attribute on the input element (i.e. the element that matched the <xsl:template>)

[14:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me sees accept="text/*.xml" and is a little sadder

[14:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
ooh, that makes sense

[14:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[14:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like a lot of people use foo/*

[14:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
including text/*

[14:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is odd

[14:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
and people seem to put spaces around their commas

[14:38:04.0000] <Philip`>
where I guess {...} is string interpolation, and contains an XPath expression that returns a string, or something like that

[14:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
because it'd be kind of crazy and unintuitive if they designed the language in any other way

[14:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I like to assume people aren't crazy :-)

[14:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
accept="text/*.*"

[14:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
that fails in so many ways

[16:56:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: ping?


2008-09-25
[17:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anybody else from #whatwg at Web Directions South this week?

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
weinig: here

[17:36:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: hey, have Adam Barth or Collin Jackson (or others) talked to you about specing sending the Origin header for non-XMLHttpRequest requests? 

[17:37:00.0000] <weinig>
ie. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=446344 and https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20792

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's a topic that has come up in conversation

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i agree with maciej's comment on the webkit bug

[17:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm happy to spec it in html5 for form submission and the like, but http seems like a place to define the header, if not the value

[17:52:00.0000] <weinig>
/me nods

[20:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Nobody is working on a new version of HTTP, though: 2616bis is just revising the spec, and can't make any normative changes to it.

[20:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Which is kinda problematic if that's the place to define the header.

[20:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(and yeah, I really am up at 3:19am)

[20:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
This draft of the personal statement is absolutely shite.

[21:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me finally met MikeSmith in person at Web Directions

[21:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So MikeSmith is indeed a person?

[21:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, either that, or a really life-like robot.

[21:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I still suspect the latter.

[21:12:02.0000] <Lachy>
considering his name is a trademark, yeah, me too :-)

[21:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
he's probably made by some company in Japan

[21:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Mike™ Smith Robots, Inc.?

[21:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
heh

[21:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
gotta go, cya

[21:14:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Have fun

[21:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But he left before I could say even that :'(

[21:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I HATE THIS.

[21:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs

[22:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: ping

[22:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(though I expect I'll be at school when you pong me)

[23:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I really dislike writing a personal statement.

[23:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The first and last sentences are the hardest to write, certainly.

[00:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay. the server handling my email got electricity back

[00:27:00.0000] <krijnh>
hsivonen: do you have an article online somewhere about "[10:53] <hsivonen> CSS positioning is much worse than tables" ? :)

[00:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
krijnh: I don't, but dbaron had a presentation touching on the matter at XTech 2006.

[00:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me looks up the presentation paper

[00:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(though that was about floats, iirc)

[00:37:03.0000] <krijnh>
Ah, yeah, I think I've read that

[00:38:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hasn't dbaron whined on his blog about the matter too?

[00:38:01.0000] <krijnh>
Yep

[00:38:02.0000] <krijnh>
Re the One True Layout thing

[00:38:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://dbaron.org/log/2005-12#e20051228a

[00:39:00.0000] <krijnh>
And now the anti-positioning thing :)

[00:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the paper is http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/schedule/paper/146 but the paper doesn't really contain the point I imagine to recall from the presentation

[00:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
krijnh: anyway, my own experience with positioning is that people who go with positioning in order to avoid tables end up having their boxes overlap on narrow viewports

[00:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
krijnh: with tables at least the formatter takes care of cells not overlapping

[00:42:00.0000] <krijnh>
Our government advises http://www.webrichtlijnen.nl/english/manual/development/production/page-structure/body/#r-pd-6-2 - which would almost require position: absolute in all of the cases

[00:44:00.0000] <krijnh>
(If a main navigation which should be on top of the page visually is considered less important and put below the main body)

[00:45:00.0000] <krijnh>
Dunno if that would count as using positioning in order to avoid tables

[01:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: any news on the issue of changing the way we do getters and setters to be just exposed properties?

[01:23:00.0000] <heycam>
hi Hixie, no i haven't fixed that up yet

[01:23:01.0000] <heycam>
(that's the issue garrett raised, yes?)

[01:24:00.0000] <heycam>
i haven't had any time for webidl lately, unfortunately, with conferences and other work taking up my time

[01:24:01.0000] <heycam>
perhaps soon...

[01:24:02.0000] <heycam>
/me heads home and will be back online in an hour

[01:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Pong

[02:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
am i missing something?

[02:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
headers/id IS in the spec

[02:11:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: it can't point to <td>

[02:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
that doesn't seem to be what hsivonen was talking about in his last e-mail

[02:11:02.0000] <annevk2>
(maybe he was confused with Laura, who wasn't very precise)

[02:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
headers="" can't point to a <td> because we flipped the "cells that are both data and headers should be <td>" to "should be <th>" to improve accessibility

[02:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
headers="" isn't allowed on <th> because it hadn't been shown that it was necessary, though maybe data since then has changed that, i haven't checked

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i'm doing studies to see what the Web can tell us on the matter as we speak)

[02:16:00.0000] <annevk2>
btw, did you see sicking's message that the Web Workers demos spell data as message?

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[02:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
someone should remind me of that when i work on that part of the spec, if i forget :-)

[02:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
i wish aa and sicking would make their mind up about workers though

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders where to put the <dfn> for min/max/step given that those attributes are different in each case they apply

[02:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
where's mike

[02:20:01.0000] <annevk2>
in Australia

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me is reminded of TR/ publication

[02:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. I should have checked the status of headers in spec before replying.

[02:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what is the argument about then? chains?

[02:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
they want headers="" on <th> so they can point to other <th>s (and maybe <td>s?)

[02:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
and they might well be right

[02:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't actually gone through their feedback yet

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are 70 e-mails on the subject waiting in my folder

[02:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
70!

[02:26:02.0000] <annevk2>
people are using html5lib: http://simonwillison.net/2008/Sep/24/htmlwhitelist/

[02:26:03.0000] <annevk2>
/me is surprised

[02:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently though they think that somehow their pet issue, which affects a tiny, tiny fraction of the web (so few pages that when i do studies of this subject matter i have to use larger-than-usual samples from google's index), deserves some sort of fast-track treatment

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't worked out on what grounds, given that what they're asking for is already implemented (that's one of the reasons they use to argue for it)

[02:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
and given the utter disdain i got from them when i fast-tracked their last pet issue (img alt), i am not at all inclined to put them ahead of the people who actually politely work on far more important and more pressing issues

[02:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me receives another e-mail on the subject (from hsivonen) -- 71 e-mails...

[02:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oops. I cited the whatwg URL on public-html

[02:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: dewitt works with me, i was probably the one who brought it to his attention

[02:32:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, it's fair to describe data table header association as being one of my pet issues. :)

[02:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, although I'm well aware it's not a pressing issue in the context of HTML5, so I'm fine with it having a longer cycle of review

[02:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
having pet issues is fine, it's the crazies who want it prioritised above all else that get to me

[02:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
i mean i have plenty of pet issues, e.g. Web Socket, but I don't bring them to the front of the queue

[02:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
I mean, Web Socket probably had the longest delay of anything in the spec so far

[02:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me gets off his soapbox and goes back to working out wtf <input type=datetime min/max/step> do

[02:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, yeah a couple of website jobs and another pet project are ahead of any HTML5 in my personal queue atm

[02:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i always cite the whatwg url on public-html :)

[02:42:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
if i am to cite the spec

[02:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me too

[02:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
the whatwg spec has far more features

[02:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
like click-on-dfn

[02:42:05.0000] <Hixie>
which i use all the time now

[02:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
that's seriously useful

[02:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I always read the whatwg spec, but as a courtesy, I try to remember to substitute the W3C url before hitting send

[02:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can click on dfns? I never knew that :-/

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's very recently added

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
a week or so

[02:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[02:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
i use it all the time now though

[02:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's really useful in the wf2 section

[02:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
or for finding out which elements are flow-level, etc

[02:45:06.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it doesn't work so well in the multipage version

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
indeed not

[02:46:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I expect clickable navigation things to use <a href>.

[02:46:02.0000] <BenMillard>
<dfn><a href>...</a></dfn> perhaps

[02:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and the single-page version has awful performance and freezes for tens of seconds after loading, presumably while it's computing all these cross-references)

[02:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually no

[02:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
the freezing is caused by the status boxes being spawned

[02:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
the dfn links are calculated asynchronously in small batches

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
and shouldn't cause slowness

[02:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i should rewrite the status thing to be async too

[02:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
<dfn><a href> could happen while the spec is being generated? that would reduce the amount of work every UA must do when it visits

[02:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
and it could support the multi-page version quite easily

[02:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
was the change that allowed headers not marked as conformance-checker-sensitive?

[02:51:01.0000] <annevk2>
BenMillard, that doesn't give the same feature at all, did you try it?

[02:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm trying to track how I managed to miss it

[02:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: yeah, i was going to ask gsnedders to do something along these lines when we were transferred over to his script

[02:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: not sure

[02:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: if so, i apologise

[02:51:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: np. I just wanted to check my script wasn't broken

[02:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was looking at my table headers implementation earlier

[02:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
and noticed i wrote it in june 2007 or so

[02:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
and realised in great sadness that that meant i had over a year of updates to apply

[02:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
and decided it wasn't worth it

[02:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I don't remember it being so slow when it was just doing status boxes; now it spends about 70 seconds at 100% CPU load with the browser (Opera 9.5) being almost entirely unresponsive

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
but anyway it does i mean i narrowed it down and it happened sometime in the last year and a half!

[02:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
hope that helps!

[02:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: woah

[02:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: sounds like a bug

[02:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i don't notice anything more than a second or so of slowness in webkit

[02:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
In Firefox 2 it's more like 5 seconds

[02:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I suppose something's interacting badly with Opera

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
and firefox 2 is slow on html5

[02:55:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, I was guessing based on Hixie's description of it...trying Fx2 on the HTML5 single-page spec now

[02:55:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, yeah it's been running 4 minutes for me...now

[02:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
woah

[02:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
y'all should start using webkit, apparently

[02:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't realise html5 was so slow in other browsers

[02:55:06.0000] <Hixie>
that's insane

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's really snappy in webkit builds

[02:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
Nobody makes WebKit work nicely on Linux

[02:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
browsers on linux suck

[02:56:03.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I've dragged a window across Firefox 2 and it's not repainting and there's no "A script is stuck" message box, so I guess it's still doing stuff and hasn't died

[02:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
(maybe chrome for linux will help that)

[02:56:05.0000] <Philip`>
and even if they did, I'd still use Opera, because changing would be far too traumatic

[02:56:06.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[02:56:07.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I'd prefer a browser that has features, i.e. not Chrome

[02:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah well can't help you there

[02:57:01.0000] <roc>
Fx3 (and trunk) takes a while to load the HTML5 page for me, but it doesn't lock up

[02:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: (like what features?)

[02:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
roc, the titlebar of Firefox 2 now says (Not Responding)

[02:58:01.0000] <BenMillard>
roc, after nearly 7 minutes

[02:58:02.0000] <roc>
try 3

[02:58:03.0000] <BenMillard>
roc, I can't stand the UI of 3, sorry

[02:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
what os?

[02:58:05.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, XP SP3

[02:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: isnt't here a firefox 2 skin for firefox 3?

[02:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i was going to say, try a skin :-)

[02:59:02.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_ & Hixie, I expected there to be one but couldn't find it when I looked the other month

[03:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I currently use Winestripe and that over-engineered tabs extension to make it sort of fit in with XP

[03:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6898

[03:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: (Ad blocking, mouse gestures, feed reading, the ability to quickly disable all stylesheets, etc)

[03:01:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I found that one before. it doesn't fit in with XP...look at the tabs! :P

[03:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: (where "etc" means I can't think of any more things, though I'd probably notice if they were missing :-) )

[03:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: i've no idea what xp looks like, the only xp i have access to is in a VM and has all the fancy UI disabled :-)

[03:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yeah i like access over style sheets, and chrome is missing that. the other features, can't say i like them or use them :-)

[03:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I've used (and adored) the "Royale" theme that ships as the default with XP Media Centre Edition for a few years: http://projectcerbera.com/ui/windows/royale/royale.png (1,6000x1,200)

[03:05:01.0000] <BenMillard>
*1,600

[03:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't survive without the left-click-right-click mouse gesture for 'back'

[03:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: i don't know how you can stand xp :-)

[03:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I live in hope that one day things will get better. :)

[03:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Needs more padding in Explorer :-p

[03:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: let me know how that turns out :-)

[03:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sadly Vista makes the Windows Classic theme (i.e. the one that's like Win95) unusable, because it has crazy toolbars that look awful if you're not using the Aero themes instead :-(

[03:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan_, the security check is still there for adoptNode()

[03:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, after 21 minutes and 30 seconds, I think it's safe to conclude that Firefox 2.0.0.17 on XP has crashed on the single-page HTML5 spec (although multipage worked fine beforehand)

[03:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[03:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
sent error report...but the "More information" link doesn't work even though the error message that pops up shows the URL and that URL does work...I guess Hixie's right about XP :P

[03:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Browser bugs are meant to be exposed by HTML5 test suites, not by the spec document itself :-)

[03:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: thanks

[03:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: You could combine the features, though. Make the spec text only appear properly in the correct rendering

[03:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Dashiva, that's basically what I experienced just now

[03:20:02.0000] <annevk2>
aah, "access control check" is already written in such a way that HTML5 can easily use it for <img>

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk2>
and the CSS Fonts Module for @font-face, etc.

[03:21:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me is pleased

[03:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/mid/55687cf80809250152o796d6b74n57ce73e01eccf110⊙mgc is incredible

[03:32:00.0000] <annevk2>
he only ever flames on public-html

[03:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i just love the fact that he says he can't find any way for headers="" to be useful without chaining

[03:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: i just loaded html5 in a VMWare XP box with Firefox2, and it didn't even stall, loaded in a few seconds.

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
this is on a quite old mac book pro, with the VMWare instance having at most one CPU and not much memory.

[03:37:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: you mentioned your talk being published through YouTube - is that up yet?

[03:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems not

[03:40:00.0000] <annevk2>
will it be on googletechtalks?

[03:40:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, meh. Steve is wrong, specifically because irregular data tables can use <th> for one layer of header cells and associate the relevant <td>s with them using headers+id (which I imagine is the use case you had for adding that ability)

[03:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
along with using headers+id as a "patch" for largely regular cases which include an irregularity which Smart Headers, scope and other features aren't able to fill

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: i assume so

[03:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: there are bazillions of examples where headers="" can be used without chaining, absolutely

[03:42:01.0000] <annevk2>
hey abarth

[03:42:02.0000] <abarth>
hi annevk2 !

[03:43:00.0000] <abarth>
i read that you've been having fun registering HTTP headers :)

[03:43:01.0000] <annevk2>
they should move it to a wiki :)

[03:44:00.0000] <annevk2>
"expert review" is a silly concept anyway, it's in a spec that gets review from experts already

[03:44:01.0000] <abarth>
i think you're an expert, you should review it

[03:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: (many of them -- at least two thirds of tables that use headers="" today according to a study i did last year -- can be done with scope="" too, but still)

[03:44:03.0000] <annevk2>
hehe

[03:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: more review is always good :-)

[03:45:01.0000] <annevk2>
not if it doesn't happen

[03:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
then it's not more review :-)

[03:45:03.0000] <annevk2>
and if it's the only way to get some header names on a page

[03:45:04.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, :p

[03:45:05.0000] <hsivonen>
is there only one resident expert for a given registry at IANA?

[03:46:00.0000] <annevk2>
I think it's just whoever signs up to the mailing list

[03:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. I thought there were appointed guardians of IANA registries

[03:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me complains that the Tokyo subway map is hard to understand

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
test

[03:54:00.0000] <abarth>
test succeeds

[03:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. It seems that I have noticed the headers/scope spec change, implemented it, and forgotten about it

[03:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so probably not a problem with the spec annotations...

[03:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
ok i have some stats on tables

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
out of about 8 billion pages, guess how many had a <th> element with a headers="" attribute

[03:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
200?

[03:56:00.0000] <annevk2>
10000?

[03:56:01.0000] <annevk2>
(billion is 1E9 here right?)

[03:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
and then guess how many of those pages had no cells with duplicate IDs, no headers="" pointing to non-cells, no headers="" pointing to cells in other tables, no headers="" pointing to themselves, and no cycles.

[03:57:00.0000] <annevk2>
2%

[03:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
(yes, on the order of 8e9 pages)

[03:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
5?

[03:57:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me thought html4 didn't really encourage headers on th

[03:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i found 350,000 pages with <th headers=""> (<0.005%), and about 150,000 had none of the above errors (less than half)

[03:58:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me is less and less confusing short scale and long scale

[03:59:00.0000] <annevk2>
that's  a whole lot better than longdesc, but that's not saying much

[03:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like I was too pessimistic ;-)

[03:59:02.0000] <annevk2>
/me too

[04:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: aren't the errors trivially recoverable, though, except for the case where there are duplicate ids across tables and the other-table-id comes in document order first, so that smart recovery couldn't use gEBI

[04:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
they're recoverable, sure

[04:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that doesn't mean the tables will be accessible

[04:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is the whole point here

[04:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but are the 150000 tables accessible?

[04:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
http://junkyard.damowmow.com/344 has a sample of the pages that the script found <th headers=""> on with no obvious problems

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
so you can find out :-)

[04:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me starts looking at them

[04:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and the does headers/id after recovery make the remaining 200000 worse?

[04:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://webopac.gosford.nsw.gov.au/libero/WebopacOpenURL.cls?DATA=GCL&ACTION=DISPLAY&RSN=4363

[04:05:00.0000] <annevk2>
headers="" was not needed on http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Extra/FiveStrongDividendPayingStocks.aspx

[04:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
on the above one, headers="" is redundant in the first table and points to a header called "Field Name" in the second

[04:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is about as pointless a header as you can get

[04:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Extra/PovertyNowComesWithAColorTV.aspx misuses <th>

[04:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
0.005% <th headers> is far more than I found :-(

[04:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
(I see it on one out of 130K pages)

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
based on the sample urls, they're all on very "deep" pages

[04:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
http://www.maastricht.nl/maastricht/show/id=93271/notextonly=42282 almost certainly doesn't need @headers

[04:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
so likely not those you'd find in your sample source

[04:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://library.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/libero/WebOpac.cls?VERSION=2&ACTION=DISPLAY&RSN=74818&DATA=DWO&TOKEN=Y8uUcWNA859284&Z=1&SET=13 apparently has changed since my script looked at it

[04:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
since i can't find headers="" on it

[04:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
(I see http://www.skydebanegaard.dk/ which seems to be referring to a cell in a different table)

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
(though I'm not sure why it's necessarily a problem for headers to point to a different table)

[04:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
because it's not accessible to users who don't have TAs

[04:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://webopac.slub-dresden.de/libero/WebOpac.cls?LANG=DE&RSN=14195675&ACTION=DISPLAY&TOKEN=y7QBaahcVB3613 should just lose its <thead> altogether and not use headers="" at all

[04:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.hildesheim.de/hildesheim/buergerservice/rathaus/soziales.shtml points to <th>s that are empty!

[04:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
dotjay, hi you've joined us during an accessibility research session :)

[04:12:01.0000] <dotjay>
BenMillard: Marvellous. :)

[04:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand the language on http://www.kiesbeter.nl/patientenorganisaties/detail/tno-preventie-en-zorg/ to determine if it's useful or not

[04:13:01.0000] <BenMillard>
dotjay, http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20080925#l-343 onwards

[04:13:02.0000] <dotjay>
BenMillard: Thanks. Will have a read in a moment.

[04:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, looks like a profile for a company

[04:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i mean i don't understand the words in the headers to work out if they're useful or not

[04:15:01.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, the kiesbeter.nl duplicates a lot

[04:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
(in the way that "field name" is blatently not useful)

[04:15:03.0000] <annevk2>
"Naam" means "Name"

[04:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, seems to be a regular layout which could use a blank top-left cell

[04:16:01.0000] <annevk2>
not sure why the table has the header "TNO, Preventie en Zorg" as that just duplicates information

[04:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it may not be useful, but it's a case of chained headers :-)

[04:16:03.0000] <annevk2>
BenMillard, actually, the first row could be removed and it would be useful, but maybe the CMS software doesn't support that

[04:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
http://www4.mdr.de/www3/sport/ergebnisse/inhalt_e_del_m_08.shtml is the first one i've seen that'd arguably useful, but even there i'd argue that the user doesn't need to know that "Eisbären Berlin" is a "Mannschaft" since those reading the subject matter will almost certainly know that anyway

[04:16:05.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, yeah that's a good point. I guess it doesn't need column headers at all

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: hm?

[04:17:01.0000] <annevk2>
BenMillard, though even if it was kept, headers="" would not be needed there, and in fact it uses scope="row" too!

[04:18:00.0000] <annevk2>
(which with a smart enough algorithm also wouldn't be needed)

[04:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Omschrijving is a heading and Naam is a heading for Omschrijving 

[04:18:02.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, yeah it's a regular layout so it only needs plain <th> and a simple-as-mud algorithm

[04:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Extra/FiveStrongDividendPayingStocks.aspx makes the same mistake as the other moneycentral page

[04:18:04.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, what does "gezondheidsonderzoek" and the other entries in that cell mean? Is their use of lowercase significant or just lazy?

[04:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: sure, but we shouldn't add the feature if it doesn't actually help when used, so does it help?

[04:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
sicking, https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20879 (also interesting for aboodman)

[04:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I guess you'd have to ask an AT user whether it helps in that particular case

[04:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
BenMillard, it's a list of things they do, "gezondsheidsonderzoek" means "health research" or some such

[04:20:01.0000] <annevk2>
(without the s after gezond)

[04:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.afpa.fr/formations/derniere-minute/places-disponibles-en-formation.html?tri=date&domain=M has the same redundancy as the mdr.de one -- the heading is obvious given the contents of the cells, so doesn't have to be repeated each time

[04:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, cool I can guess what other languages say from context. :)

[04:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
same with http://sport.ard.de/sp/komponente/ergebnisse/tabellen/tennis.jsp?liga=WTA%7CTier+III%7CBali&runde=Damen%7CEinzel%7C1.+Runde

[04:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://neuerwerbungen.slub-dresden.de/cgi-bin/getrsn.pl?rsn=14223077 is the same as the earlier one on the same domain

[04:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://library.bankstown.nsw.gov.au/libero/WebopacOpenURL.cls?DATA=DBK&ACTION=DISPLAY&RSN=709279 too

[04:22:02.0000] <annevk2>
so I guess most add the complexity because browsers and screen readers are silly with respect to table headers

[04:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
not because it's actually needed by the tables

[04:23:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I noticed tables tend to have consistent authoring throughout a website, but there are exceptions.

[04:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[04:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
what does lang=nl Praktijknaam mean?

[04:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, there's also a sense among content providers (not HTML authors) I've worked with that a table isn't really a table unless it has a complete set of column headers, even if they are useless.

[04:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
looks like the thead in http://www.kiesbeter.nl/eerstelijnszorg/Dietist/detail/thuiszorg_het_friese_land_4/ is redundant, assuming "Praktijknaam" means "name" or some sort

[04:24:02.0000] <annevk2>
it means "name of the practice"

[04:25:00.0000] <annevk2>
which is "Thuiszorg het Friese Land" in that table

[04:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[04:26:01.0000] <annevk2>
this was also the case in the first kiesbeter.nl example

[04:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
then that's just wrong

[04:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
shouldn't be a <th> at all

[04:26:04.0000] <annevk2>
yes, both are actually completely wrong

[04:26:05.0000] <BenMillard>
I'd say they shouldn't even be tables, as the type of data in each cell is pretty clear from the data itself

[04:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.maastricht.nl/maastricht/show/id=93271/textonly=42282 is wrong too

[04:27:01.0000] <annevk2>
I'm guessing the CMS works in a way that the first row is mandatory and always headers

[04:27:02.0000] <BenMillard>
like an address is obviously an address as it follows the typographic conventions of an address and has place names and area codes in it

[04:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
and http://www.sestao.eu/agenda/agenda.asp?sestao_idioma=EU&nivelMenu=6&actualMenu=14&dia_seleccionado=24/5/2008&p=12 is a calendar, with the months pointing at the year

[04:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
which seems unnecessary, but is probably the closest to a valid use case in the set

[04:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
summary="Egutegia"

[04:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
my conclusion is that the data doesn't support the assertion that headers="" is indispensable on <th>

[04:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
maybe, in some cases, it's marginally useful

[04:29:03.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, maastricht.nl doesn't use headers="" or <td>; I think that page works fine probably if screen readers just read from LTR TTB

[04:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
but that's as much as this data suggests

[04:29:05.0000] <annevk2>
I meant, or <th>

[04:29:06.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: be sure to look at the textonly version

[04:30:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm

[04:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, that's enough time wasted on this for now, back to forms...

[04:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh yeah, when I use curl I get indeed something that's wrong

[04:31:01.0000] <annevk2>
may I ever fail at my current job, I can always start fixing random sites on the Web

[04:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if fixing random sites pays rent/mortgage

[04:34:00.0000] <annevk2>
ok, not so random then :)

[04:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
oh shit, lunch

[04:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, fixing sites (usually CSS layout problems) is part of my day job and pays £25 per hour but work comes in at irregular intervals.

[04:42:01.0000] <BenMillard>
auditing government websites against web standards and writing a report pays the same and is a bit more regular

[04:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I know people who charge incredibly larger amounts for doing either type of work, though

[04:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: not random, though, I presume. Do people with broken sites find you or do you find them?

[04:44:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, it's a bit of both.

[04:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's encouraging that there's business in fixing broken stuff on the Web

[04:44:02.0000] <BenMillard>
yeah, I think so :)

[04:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
my boss (http://www.sdesign1.com) sometimes approaches places, other times people we've worked with before come back to us for more, sometimes other agencies subcontract us

[04:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
there's definitely work to be had doing that kind of thing, but the site commissioner needs to care about it in the first place

[05:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: the <ol><li></li> ...rest of page... case isn't the html parser though, is it? or maybe you could detect that in the parser

[05:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I was thinking of making the fatal check in the tree builder

[05:05:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: btw, could the bugmail include full URLs?

[05:05:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: ok

[05:05:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I'll try to find the configuration parameter

[05:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I have now set the urlbase bugzilla parameter

[05:07:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: thanks

[05:11:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: perhaps <dfn>s should have tabindex=0

[05:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
on the long term, as i was telling BenMillard, my plan is to do all this statically with the spec gen tool

[05:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
at which point, we should consider this stuff

[05:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
until then, i'm happy to just wait

[05:14:00.0000] <annevk2>
by static you mean generating an awful lot of additional markup to be downloaded?

[05:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[05:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
it'll be offset by the removal of the data templates section :-P

[05:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
i'll make sure to measure that

[05:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[05:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, the bonus is it'll then work in the static copy too

[05:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
multipage even

[05:19:00.0000] <annevk2>
it's too bad Content-Location failed

[05:20:00.0000] <annevk2>
I was thinking of setting up an HTML5 archive service that would allow you to get a given SVN version

[05:20:01.0000] <annevk2>
would've been a lot easier with Content-Location

[05:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Like using something like Trac, where you can view any revision of the repository?

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
not all resources are in the repository

[05:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, another bonus is links are a more familiar UI for navigating between and within documents on the web.

[05:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, links are what i use to do the actual navigating

[05:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
but there has to be some way to show the links

[05:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: what's a "value URL"?

[05:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
should be valid

[05:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
will fix

[05:44:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I'm looking at the single-page version in Opera and see how it works now

[05:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok bed time

[05:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie & annevk2, so <a href title="Referenced by ..."><dfn>...</dfn></a> could work directly when there's only 1 reference, but for multiple references <a onclick title="View References"><dfn>...</dfn></a> would show the popup list of links?

[05:50:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(or something to that effect)

[05:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: what's wrong with <dfn onclick>?

[05:52:00.0000] <annevk2>
I don't think <a href="..."><dfn> makes sense, I'd rather have <dfn onclick> consistently

[05:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me grmbls at the access control cache stuff

[05:53:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, if it's "something to that effect" then I'd say it's fine

[05:54:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i'd like to be able to open the popup with the keyboard

[05:57:00.0000] <annevk2>
krijnh, https links don't work and the link in http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html-wg/20080816 is also wrong

[06:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, maybe <a onclick> should be focusable like <a href> is? would doing that for <dfn onclick> also make sense?

[06:01:00.0000] <annevk2>
yes

[06:01:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: not sure all onclicks should be focussable by default but you could set tabIndex = '0'

[06:02:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
e.g. i might want to set onclick on a container and do something with the target without wanting the container to be focusable

[06:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, how would a non-pointer user operate that feature?

[06:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: e.g. by activating links in the container

[06:04:01.0000] <krijnh>
annevk2: somebody smarter than me should fix the regex making those links

[06:04:02.0000] <annevk2>
krijnh, https should work by s? or something no?

[06:04:03.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, I thought <a href> was allowed more exotic content now, so you could wrap some (or all) of cases in <a href> ?

[06:04:04.0000] <annevk2>
or [s], hmm

[06:05:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me sighs

[06:05:01.0000] <krijnh>
The issue is bigger though

[06:05:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: you can't nest links

[06:05:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: consider a menu with expandable items

[06:05:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: without script you fall back to server side expansion

[06:05:05.0000] <annevk2>
maybe it should be an app-engine service

[06:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, oh, I see

[06:06:01.0000] <annevk2>
pass a string of text and it will linkify stuff

[06:06:02.0000] <krijnh>
annevk2: https links work now

[06:06:06.0000] <krijnh>
Hmm

[06:07:00.0000] <annevk2>
it shouldn't consider - to be special, except when it's followed by a space or EOL

[06:07:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, but if that expansion is useful to pointer users, it would also be useful to non-pointer users? so the onclick should still be focusable so they can activate it to expand/collapse that section, or just Tab past it to the next section of navigation?

[06:08:00.0000] <annevk2>
annevk2, well, and ., etc. :p

[06:08:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: it is available to non-pointer users

[06:08:02.0000] <krijnh>
Yah, teh win \o/

[06:08:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: activating a link with the keyboard sends a click event

[06:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: you wouldn't want to focus the *container*

[06:09:01.0000] <annevk2>
krijnh, maybe you should open source the log converter script so we can suggest improvements more easily

[06:16:04.0000] <krijnh>
Yeah

[06:16:05.0000] <annevk2>
I guess you need to do () matching and such :/

[06:16:06.0000] <BenMillard>
if there's a ( in the URL, I guess you should include one )

[06:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
It should work in most cases if you only match balanced parentheses, which is provably impossible in regular expressions but fortunately real regular expressions aren't regular

[06:17:01.0000] <krijnh>
Foo sucks (as seen on http://foo.com/)

[06:30:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, maybe I'm bad with tables :)

[06:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the summary in that table seems useful for anyone

[06:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, you side tracked me again; looks like a <caption> to me

[06:42:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me back to caches

[07:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
That email from Gez was pretty useful, it actually identified a specific problem which could be good to consider

[07:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
since the solution in this case is pretty obvious and might well generalise

[07:14:00.0000] <annevk2>
i was thinking the same

[07:14:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me made some progress meanwhile

[07:23:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
jgraham: i thought the smart headers algorithm did the right thing in that case

[07:24:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
at least iirc it was a case ben and i were discussing when he was looking in to this first

[07:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: the example was contrived, so there's insufficient data regarding what the real-world Right Thing is here

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me expects Ben to have better data

[07:25:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: yes we had actual tables with the same thing except for columns iirc

[07:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
or perhaps it was a colspan case we were discussing

[07:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: Maybe it got lost in the great smart foo rewrite that I did

[07:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
jgraham: clearly we need regression tests :)

[07:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: Does it make sense for columns also?

[07:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: I had regression tests at one point but I don't know what I did with them

[07:29:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me was sure he checked them in to svn

[07:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
jgraham: yeah in the tables we looked at it was columns

[07:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
but this was so long ago i don't remember the details

[07:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: Should be fixed now

[07:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
jgraham: cool

[07:38:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm actually

[07:38:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
it doesn't work with http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/clark2006/06-gui/minimal

[07:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
jgraham: btw, would it make sense to preserve dir="rtl"?

[07:41:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
jgraham: in the inspector

[07:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe it was this case i was thinking of http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/clark2006/11-controls/minimal

[07:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
where headers of the same width would be skipped after seeing a TD in between

[07:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/clark2006/19-movies/minimal is another case where it fails

[07:49:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
dunno about http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/clark2006/23-watches/minimal

[07:49:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/finance/01-wisc-rev/minimal another example of the case i was probably thinking of

[07:50:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/finance/02-wisc-alloc/minimal

[07:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/thatcher/01-water/minimal

[07:52:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/thatcher/02-monitor/minimal might be a case of a "conceptual header data cell"

[07:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
I'm a bit uncomfortable with the statement that intranet usage should be given as much weight as Web usage... They're quite different after all

[07:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: they indeed are quite different. However, are Google's apps more like intranet apps or more like the Web?

[07:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd expect Web technology to be for the Web and intranets be an incidental spillover--not a design target.

[08:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in fact, so far it seems that bad design happens when intranets become the design target rather than the spillover

[08:09:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, lots of intranets are a "design target"

[08:10:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, IE serves two different markets, the intranet and the Web, one of the issues the IE Team is having

[08:12:00.0000] <smedero>
Don

[08:12:01.0000] <smedero>
erm

[08:12:02.0000] <smedero>
(itchy trigger finger)

[08:12:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: isn't it exactly a problem that IE has two markets to serve?

[08:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: or more to the point: that their intranet market limits agility in the Web market

[08:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
interestingly, http://www.webaim.org/discussion/mail_message.php?id=10610 mentions axis

[08:17:00.0000] <annevk2>
hsivonen, yes, hence me being uncomfortable with it :)

[10:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, I'm guessing any implementor would LOL at that table and therefore it won't get implemented.

[10:23:00.0000] <annevk2>
:p

[10:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
like I said, I live in hope :)

[10:27:00.0000] <annevk2>
I'm not sure what the status of aria-labelledby is

[10:27:01.0000] <annevk2>
I do know people will misspell that attribute all the time

[10:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
...and use it to associate things which are right next to each other

[10:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, sometimes I suspect these WAI groups of making things intentionally complicated

[10:30:00.0000] <annevk2>
for instance, when ARIA was still full of namespaces

[10:30:01.0000] <annevk2>
(and ARIA itself is highly problematic too, of course, in terms of ease of usage etc., though some of that is mitigated by libraries)

[10:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, I guess they haven't taken the red pill yet? (http://annevankesteren.nl/2007/04/html-red-pill)

[10:41:00.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, #html-wg discussing ownage of rel= values

[10:41:01.0000] <annevk2>
apparently the XHTML2 WG claims ownership

[10:41:02.0000] <annevk2>
fortunately none of it really impacts anything

[10:47:00.0000] <smedero>
annevk2: that would be this email in case you missed it: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2008Sep/0037.html

[10:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
hah

[11:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I just checked the logs and saw the discussion about Smart Headers with spanned cells and suchlike

[11:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Gez Lemon wrote: 'The table inspector reports "Budgeted", "Actual", and "Forecasted" as headers for the data in the columns "TCO", "ROI", and "NPV". That's not correct. The automatic association has assumed the headers run to the end of the row.' http://juicystudio.com/wcag/tables/nestedheaders.html

[11:30:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I think that is indeed a case zcorpan and I talked about way back last year

[11:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it was his idea to apply the same cleverness to rowspan that we had found useful for colspan, but based on observing real tables

Hixie: If you want me to do something, email me :P

[14:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i don't yet

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
1e1 is scientific notation, 0.1e3 is engineering notation, what do we call "10" again?

[15:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Sanity.

[15:37:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: decimal notation?

[15:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: aren't the other two also decimal notation?

[15:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You could call it 'ordinary decimal notation' to be explicit

[15:39:01.0000] <webben>
Hixie: You could express it in a regex to be 100% specific maybe

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben: oh it'll be expressed in detail, i just need a section title

[15:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
decimal-digits-with-possible-minus-sign notation

[15:40:02.0000] <webben>
"Long decimal notation"?

[15:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah see that becomes a bit verbose

[15:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
"10" is shorter than both 1e1 and 0.1e3 :-P

[15:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Wikipedia article on scientific notation called it 'ordinary' when comparing

[15:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm ok

[15:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[15:42:00.0000] <webben>
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22ordinary+decimal+notation%22&btnG=Search looks promising

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm...

[15:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
looks like i can just do away with the ordinary form

[15:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
and support the scientific form

[15:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
since i only use the ordinary form for new features in html5...

[16:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know of a way i could forward a usb port from one machine to another over the network?

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. plug in a device in one machine and have it appear on another machine as a local usb device?

[16:11:00.0000] <gavin>
"usb over ip" seems to return some promising results

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
oooh, good call

[16:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
no good mac solutions it seems

[16:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[16:20:00.0000] <phroggy>
hi!  How do you guys feel about Apple's <input type="search">?

[16:21:00.0000] <phroggy>
I see tons of sites using JS/CSS hacks to implement similar functionality; it seems like standardizing it should be helpful, and Apple already has a working implementation.

[16:27:00.0000] <webben>
phroggy: What exactly would you require of a user agent to conform?

[16:28:00.0000] <webben>
phroggy: and what problem does it solve?

[16:28:01.0000] <smedero>
a while back lachlan & mpt also (briefly) made the case for <input type="search"> here: http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-May/011367.html

[16:29:00.0000] <phroggy>
here's the details as I understand them:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=456229

[16:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me likes <input type="search">

[16:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and also placeholder

[16:31:01.0000] <phroggy>
I've heard that the "placeholder" option is being added to all (relevant) input types (not just search); I'm not sure if that's an official HTML 5 thing or just something Mozilla is doing.

[16:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
which is separately useful even for non-search input types

[16:31:03.0000] <phroggy>
agreed

[16:31:04.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit has placeholder on all text-like input types

[16:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
some of the <input type="search> stuff duplicates more general mechanisms in WF2

[16:32:01.0000] <webben>
the autocomplete stuff?

[16:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I would like to deprecate them when we add the relevant WF2 stuff but not sure we can ever remove

[16:32:03.0000] <othermaciej>
well incremental

[16:32:04.0000] <othermaciej>
and the event that results

[16:32:05.0000] <phroggy>
that makes sense.

[16:32:06.0000] <othermaciej>
would be oninput

[16:32:07.0000] <othermaciej>
in WF2

[16:32:08.0000] <webben>
ah okay

[16:33:00.0000] <phroggy>
the main issue is, right now everybody is reinventing the wheel, and some implementations are better than others.

[16:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Mozilla sounds like they are just copying what WebKit has

[16:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so I don't think there is reinvention exactly

[16:34:02.0000] <phroggy>
if there were a standard way to do it in HTML, that everybody could use, then they'd just use that, and either use JS to fake compatibility with old browsers (same as they're doing now), or let old browsers have reduced functionality if that's easier.

[16:35:00.0000] <phroggy>
othermaciej: that Mozilla bug was something I recently submitted, when I couldn't find an existing one.

[16:35:01.0000] <phroggy>
I attempted to describe Apple's implementation, but that doesn't mean Mozilla is actually doing it.

[16:35:02.0000] <phroggy>
I think they did say placeholder will be supported soon though.

[16:36:00.0000] <webben>
phroggy: Do you think devs are after the Safari functionality or the Safari look-and-feel?

[16:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
phroggy: I see

[16:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it would probably be better to support <input type="search"> with the relevant WF2 replacement features

[16:37:00.0000] <webben>
phroggy: If they were offered IE-native, Fx-native, Op-native look-and-feel would they take it? Or would they continue to try to craft out the Safari look?

[16:37:01.0000] <phroggy>
well, one of the things Google mentioned was that they feel Safari's rounded corners would be inappropriate on Windows, so they'd like to come up with a different appearance

[16:38:00.0000] <webben>
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/ and http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/ are two other drafts that seem relevant here.

[16:38:01.0000] <webben>
phroggy: Oh I suspect browser makers would make the interface look native; I'm more thinking about what site designers are trying to do.

[16:39:00.0000] <phroggy>
oh, I gotcha

[16:40:00.0000] <phroggy>
no, I think web designers aren't too picky about the appearance, although obviously I'd expect Apple to continue making the search box on www.apple.com look the way it does today

[16:41:00.0000] <webben>
hmm, less certain of either :)

[16:41:01.0000] <webben>
I suspect the search box on www.apple.com will track Apple UI changes generally.

[16:42:00.0000] <phroggy>
personally I love the little magnifying glass icon - it's a bit weird that it's the "results" option that makes it appear, but having a tiny little icon like that, that I don't have to make myself, the appearance of which could be platform-specific, would be great.

[16:42:01.0000] <phroggy>
heh, well yeah, that's what I meant ;-)

[16:43:00.0000] <roc>
we already have code to style search boxes with platform-specific look

[16:43:01.0000] <roc>
we use it in XUL

[16:43:02.0000] <webben>
I'd tend to agree that being able to distinguish search inputs (I wouldn't want to be more specific than that in terms of conformance) and being able to jump to search inputs (e.g. with a quick key) would be good.

[16:44:00.0000] <phroggy>
yeah, Firefox uses it for things like the download window

[16:44:01.0000] <webben>
seems likely to make the web a lil more usable :)

[16:45:00.0000] <webben>
although it's possible jumping might be better helped with a container for the form as a whole (e.g. in case of search instructions).

[16:48:00.0000] <phroggy>
I recently implemented something where I wanted the functionality to basically work like searching in iTunes - it filters the results with each keypress.  I had to experiment with using onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup, see what worked and what didn't

[16:51:00.0000] <phroggy>
I wound up using setTimeout with a 50ms delay, to make sure the value of the textbox would have changed by the time my function was called...

[16:52:00.0000] <phroggy>
and added code to that function to copy the value to a variable, after checking to see if it was different, to avoid repeatedly searching for the same string

[16:53:00.0000] <phroggy>
anyway, it just felt like I was reinventing the wheel, and probably poorly.


2008-09-26
[17:04:00.0000] <phroggy>
also, in my case, I want the little magnifying glass icon to indicate the purpose of the box, because I don't want to take the space to add a label, and using a placeholder isn't appropriate because I automatically focus on page load (so the user can immediately start typing to filter search results).

[18:50:00.0000] <phroggy>
there's something I've never understood:  why is target="_blank" deprecated?  The official workaround is to simulate this behavior with JavaScript, which is obviously appropriate in some situations but in others just seems like reinventing the wheel.

[18:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
aha, the video of my talk is available internally now. should be public soon.

[18:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
i say "um" far too much.

[18:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
wonder how to work on that.

[18:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
phroggy: target=_blank isn't deprecated in html5

[18:51:03.0000] <phroggy>
it isn't?  oh good.

[18:51:04.0000] <phroggy>
it was in 4.01, right?

[18:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
target="" wasn't in HTML4 strict at all

[18:52:01.0000] <phroggy>
well, right...

[18:52:02.0000] <phroggy>
so, in 5, is it back in, or still left out?

[18:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
html5 has target=""

[18:52:04.0000] <phroggy>
"deprecated" was the wrong word, I suppose.

[18:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
in general though i strongly recommend against using target="" at all, creating new windows for the user is not a good experience

[18:52:06.0000] <phroggy>
it can be.

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
should be the user's choice imho

[18:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i basically just stop using sites that think they know better than me when to open windows

[18:54:00.0000] <phroggy>
for example, I'm making a contact directory where I ask the user for various things like their MySpace/Facebook/LiveJournal names, or the URL to their home page or whatever, and on the confirmation screen I offer these as URLs they can check.  I believe it would be totally inappropriate for these to open in the same window/tab.

[18:56:00.0000] <phroggy>
it should be the user's choice whether to open them in a new window or a new tab, but navigating away from the current page is not desirable.  Obviously I use target="_blank" very sparingly, but simulating it with JavaScript (as was recommended by W3C for 4.01 Strict) is just ridiculous.

[19:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
if i was on that page, i would expect the links to open on the same page and to use the back button to return to the form

[19:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
and it would piss me off if a new tab or window opened

[19:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
to the point of not using the site again

[19:13:00.0000] <phroggy>
except that this is the result of a POST form, and some browsers don't like to cache those.

[19:15:00.0000] <phroggy>
I believe that most of my users would find your preferred behavior disruptive.  Obviously I could be mistaken.

[19:32:00.0000] <phroggy>
Hixie: what's your opinion of <input type="search">?

[19:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well, we're publicly claiming full pass of Acid3 now, I hope enough time has passed that the test won't change again

[19:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
also I don't know if you or anyone else intends to officially verify

[23:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
phroggy, I would also expect those links to be normal links, but I'd probably open each one in a new background tab since I'd only need to see the page title to confirm it's the right page.

[23:41:00.0000] <karlUshi>
annevk2: here?

[23:41:01.0000] <karlUshi>
I have a simple question about html5lib

[23:42:00.0000] <karlUshi>
Does the serializer drop the elements which are not authorized by the HTML 5 content model?

[23:42:01.0000] <karlUshi>
such as center for example

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
phroggy: i like type=search

[23:58:00.0000] <karlUshi>
hmm interesting

[23:58:01.0000] <karlUshi>
http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/source/browse/trunk/?r=947#trunk/python/src/html5lib/serializer%3Fstate%3Dclosed

[23:59:00.0000] <karlUshi>
I'm looking at the code of the serializer and it doesn't seem to clean up elements which are not included in the content model

[23:59:01.0000] <karlUshi>
which would make them non conformant HTML 5 "writer"

[23:59:02.0000] <karlUshi>
s/them/it/

[00:01:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
karlUshi: that's not the responsibility of a serializer, though, is it?

[00:02:00.0000] <karlUshi>
zcorpan_: well it depends what you mean by serializer.

[00:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: is there any documentation on exactly what the smart headers algorithm is and exactly how it differs from the "smart headers"-based algorithm in the spec

[00:02:02.0000] <karlUshi>
if the role of the serializer is to output an *HTML 5 document*

[00:03:00.0000] <karlUshi>
I would say that it should remove the obsolete elements. no?

[00:03:01.0000] <karlUshi>
if the serializer is a garbage in/garbage out, indeed it doesn't emit html 5 markup

[00:03:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
right

[00:04:00.0000] <karlUshi>
I wonder if someone has worked on a product taking the parsed document and outputing conformant html5

[00:04:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
you could have a layer before the serializer to strip out stuff

[00:04:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
or convert it to html5 equivalent

[00:05:00.0000] <karlUshi>
hixie: is it in the plan to define the rules for sanitizing the output?

[00:05:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
karlUshi: in my mind a serializer is just the reverse of a parser: emit a stream of characters (or bytes) from a tree

[00:06:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
karlUshi: everyone would want different rules for sanitizing

[00:06:01.0000] <karlUshi>
zcorpan_: yes I can accept this, but it should clearly be mark as such in the spec. I haven't checked yet though :)

[00:07:00.0000] <karlUshi>
zcorpan_: hmm about different rules. Well, I think that would benefit many people and remove a bit of anger. ;) I'm trying to address this in blog post. 

[00:08:00.0000] <karlUshi>
so I stand corrected for the serializer thanks.

[00:08:01.0000] <karlUshi>
I will fix the article. (not published yet)

[00:08:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[00:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
karlUshi: html5lib also has a sanitizer.

[00:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlUshi: it is for xss security, not conformance, though, afaik

[00:09:01.0000] <karlUshi>
yep seen that in the ruby version

[00:10:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
karlUshi: there's http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Sanitization_rules

[00:11:00.0000] <karlUshi>
it keeps center which is not in html5

[00:11:01.0000] <karlUshi>
(for example)

[00:11:02.0000] <karlUshi>
understood that it is for security

[00:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
karlUshi: sanitising what output?

[00:12:01.0000] <karlUshi>
/me didn't use sanitizing at the start of the discussion

[00:13:00.0000] <karlUshi>
just saying

[00:13:01.0000] <karlUshi>
Garbage In -> HTML 5 Parser -> HTML 5 Writer (output = html 5 conformant document)

[00:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
given garbage in, there is no way that i know of in the state of the art today to give conformant output

[00:14:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
print "<!doctype html><title></title>"

[00:14:02.0000] <karlUshi>
the serializers in HTML 5 lib do not fix the markup to be conformant according to html 5 spec

[00:14:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
karlUshi: so you want an HTML5Tidy

[00:15:00.0000] <karlUshi>
yes which would be basically html5 serializer + html5 content model filter

[00:15:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, not in complete and absolute detail in one place, AFAIK.

[00:15:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
karlUshi: it would probably also have to include SVG Tidy and MathML Tidy :)

[00:15:03.0000] <karlUshi>
to create a virtuous circle

[00:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I recall James Graham wrote up a snapshot of what was implemented some time ago but that doesn't compare it to what's in HTML5...ah here it is: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Mar/0075.html

[00:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: k

[00:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: thanks

[00:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: ah yeah i used that when writing the spec

[00:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
iirc

[00:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: (though i made some changes because the spec had other constraints to worry about as well)

[00:17:03.0000] <BenMillard>
yeah, I think you mentioned it in #whatwg

[00:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, the main difference I know if is the chaining of header cells. my vision for Smart Headers is it would be implemented by UAs, make all possible associations through the table, pass this on via platform-specific accessibility APIs, then ATs would use their already very sophisticated verbosity controls to only provide the relationships that are useful to their specific customer base (and individuals would have the abilit

[00:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
as they can customise verbosity already)

[00:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
in the tables I studied during 2007, only 20% used <th> for all their header cells (http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/)

[00:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I didn't count how common <td scope="row"> was for row headers compared to <th> or <th scope="row">

[00:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
but my impression was that <td scope> was common enough to be worth supporting

[00:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
i need to look at the feedback in the tables directory

[00:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
but my impression from the data i got yesterday was that chained headers hardly ever happen in the wild

[00:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
and when they do, almost never happen correctly

[00:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
and so it's probably not worth adding that feature

[00:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
i certainly am not convinced we want to chain headers automatically

[00:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I don't mean chaining of the headers attribute, I mean cases where a <th> has another <th> which is related to it, such as a table with 2 or more levels of column headers

[00:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
but again, i'll have to look at the data and feedback closely when i get to this issue again

[00:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
the thing i don't understand is why would a user ask for the headers of a header?

[00:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
surely it's the data the user is looking for

[00:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
and the data cells already have those headers applied

[00:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
creating a comprehensive html5 tidy will be hard

[00:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
for example, it would need to fix tables with overlapping cells

[00:27:00.0000] <karlUshi>
hsivonen: didn't say it would be easy. It has certainly a lot of issues, but a set of canonical rules would improve interop and would help people to move forward.

[00:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
much of it could be done by hacking jing internals

[00:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the 'curies are not qnames' explanation is interesting when curies share the characteristic of qnames being criticized

[00:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me had a look at xhtml2 minutes

[00:35:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, you sometimes need to understand the context of a header cell as you move through a table non-visually. A table I wrote recently, in the "Comparison of Techniques" section here: http://projectcerbera.com/blog/2008/09/untangle

[00:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
if you're moving down the 2nd column, it's probably useful to hear when you've moved out of the "Test File" section into the "Corrected" section, etc

[00:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
another one from me, a bit older, at the bottom of this page: http://projectcerbera.com/web/articles/breadcrumbs-markup

[00:37:01.0000] <BenMillard>
moving across the 2nd row, it's probably useful to hear when you moved out of "Filesize (bytes)" column group and into the "Familiar" column group

[00:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
BenMillard: send what you just wrote in email :)

[00:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan_, good idea

[00:54:00.0000] <karlUshi>
many thanks henri, zcorpan_ and hixie. Published. rotten tomatoes as usual in the comment box :) 

[00:58:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
pointer?

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: yeah, i could see that

[00:58:02.0000] <karlUshi>
zcorpan_: http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/09/fixing-html-with-html5

[00:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: not sure it's really common enough to warrant adding to the spec, but i'll have to look closer

[01:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, for sure. but it is a regular layout and it does exist outside of my website, for example: http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2007/tables/odi/06-collated/original

[01:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
might make sense to just have headers have headers and treat them the same was cells are treated, without doing any nesting

[01:03:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, the original source for that is still online, "Table 6" on this page: http://www.odi.govt.nz/publications/going-beyond-compliance/survey/appendix-4-task-speed.html

[01:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
(that gets around the problem of loops)

[01:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
(though it doesn't get around the problem of self-reference)

[01:03:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
karlUshi: choise of quotes is a bad example since you're discussing content model and quotes is syntax :)

[01:03:05.0000] <karlUshi>
zcorpan_: but I'm pretty the question will arise :)

[01:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, the original source uses plain <th> and expects it to Just Work (which seems reasonable to me)

[01:04:01.0000] <karlUshi>
in fact will love to loose a lot of times on these points ;)

[01:04:02.0000] <karlUshi>
s/fact/fact, people/

[01:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
BenMillard: those tables will work fine as far as i can tell

[01:05:00.0000] <karlUshi>
s/pretty/pretty sure/

[01:05:01.0000] <karlUshi>
/me in plain demonstration of my article :p unfortunately. Clumsy one day, clumsy for ever

[01:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, when moving across the 2nd row of "Table 6" it's probably useful to hear when you move from "Fastest" to "Slowest"?

[01:08:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(similar arrangement as my breadcrumbs-markup table)

[01:09:00.0000] <BenMillard>
in fact, I'd say it's essential since the header text is the same for the columns within those 2 column groups

[01:09:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so you need the main column header from row 1 to disambiguate the column headers in row 2

[01:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i could see that

[01:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
"<Hixie> might make sense to just have headers have headers and treat them the same was cells are treated, without doing any nesting" -- yeah that'd make sense

[01:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2 has a table where hearing headers as you move through headers seems useful: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2007Aug/att-0003/offset-mess.htm

[01:31:01.0000] <BenMillard>
specifically, moving across row 2 and row 3

[01:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(I think the top-left cell could be blank and the browser names could use <th>)

[01:32:01.0000] <annevk2>
sounds reasonable

[01:33:00.0000] <annevk2>
karlUshi, dunno much about the serializer, but it seems it worked out already

[01:34:00.0000] <karlUshi>
/me thanks annevk2. Will look further. Need to catch my train.

[01:34:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so multiple levels of column headers are somewhat easy to find...but multiple levels of row headers? maybe I'm the only person who does that :P

[01:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
aha, my 2007 collection has this: http://www.avert.org/aofconsent.htm

[01:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Australia", "United Kingdom" and "USA" in the first column have a 2nd column of row headers giving smaller regions within them

[01:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
so if you're moving down the 2nd column of "United Kingdom" it's probably useful to hear when you fall into "USA"

[01:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me wonders what to make of http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Stephen_Shea

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=373864#c4 is also interesting (and public!)

[02:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, I just summarised in an on-list e-mail the tables I was discussion earlier where header cells being announced when moving between other header cells seemed useful to me: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Sep/0475.html

[02:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool, thanks

[02:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'll add it to the tables pile

[02:17:03.0000] <BenMillard>
cheers :)

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: Larry's right, though I think he's missed the WHATWG side of things

[02:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well that's interesting

[02:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annvevk2: I find this one interesting: <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-forum/2008JulSep/0189.html> (W3C Member-only again)

[02:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: in light of the fact that any rational look at working groups and their effectiveness would surely put XForms and XHTML2 on the cut list

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
given a=1234 and b=5678, what is the mathematical expression that yields 1234.5678 ?

[02:29:02.0000] <annevk2>
othermaciej :)

[02:29:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well, the simplest such expression would be 1234.5678

[02:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you want it to involve a and b, then a + b / 1000

[02:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if a and b are actually general variables with varying numbers of digits

[02:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean given any value of a and b, with the result being equivalent to casting a and b to a string and then concerting a + "." + b to an integer again, except without going through strings.

[02:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
then a + b * (10 ^ -(1 + floor(log10(b))))

[02:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or something like that

[02:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
pity

[02:32:01.0000] <BenMillard>
do you get a bonus for connecting 4 closing parentheses in a row? :)

[02:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
former lisp hacking habits

[02:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
f(x) = { x if x < 1; f(x/10) otherwise }; a+f(b)

[02:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's still a mathematical expression :-)

[02:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if one were writing this in code then yes a loop dividing by 10 might be more effective

[02:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
of course, this assumes a and b are integers

[02:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though if they are not the question is ill-posed

[02:35:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me wonders what problem this is solving

[02:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
Or you could write "a.b" and people may know what that means

[02:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm sure I've seen that notation several times in the past)

[02:53:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me is a bit surprised that the smart header algorithm only now gets attention, especially after yesterday's telcon where some people were stressing for deciding on this right "now"

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: really? you're surprised? after the way they've been acting?

[03:03:00.0000] <annevk2>
maybe disappointed is better

[03:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish someone would tell me what the rush was about, frankly

[03:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
but anyway

[03:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
time for bed

[03:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[03:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie why do you hate blind people so much

[03:24:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, hsivonen is porting his java parser to Gecko

[03:31:00.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, he said as much anyway

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yes, I'm porting it

[03:37:00.0000] <annevk2>
lot of work?

[03:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the parser core is suitable for mechanic translation to C++

[03:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
we'll see :-)

[03:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
might be annoying to keep the two up to date all the time I imagine

[03:38:01.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: prod?

[03:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I expect the integration to Gecko to be more work than the Java to C++ translator

[03:39:00.0000] <annevk2>
but maybe someone else can do maintenance after you did the hard work?

[03:39:01.0000] <annevk2>
olliej, yo

[03:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk2: the idea is to keep them in sync by generating C++ code from the Java source

[03:39:03.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: xhr spec says that the XHR object's document is the document of the object it is invoked on

[03:39:04.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: which works if 'this' is a window

[03:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"object it is invoked on" is kind of an ambiguous phrase

[03:40:01.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: but what happens if i do (for the sake  of argument) new ({a:XMLHttpRequest}.a)

[03:40:02.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: what document should it get?

[03:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I told olliej I thought it meant the "this object"

[03:41:00.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: esp. if you imagine windowa.foo = function(){new ({a:windowb.XMLHttpRequest}.a) }

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
sigh, I'm not sure what that syntax does

[03:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: olliej is setting it up so that the object that the XMLHttpRequest constructor is invoked on, is not a Window object

[03:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
more readable example:

[03:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
var randomObj = {};

[03:42:04.0000] <othermaciej>
randomObj.XMLHttpRequest = someWindow.XMLHttpRequest;

[03:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
new randomObj.XMLHttpRequest();

[03:43:01.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, I never tried that, does that work in IE?

[03:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I bet IE binds the original window object the XHR constructor comes from

[03:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
rather than using the one it is invoked on

[03:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
you could tell the difference with:

[03:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
window.foreignXHR = otherWindow.XMLHttpRequest

[03:45:01.0000] <annevk2>
what the spec says is what IE does for the non randomObj cases

[03:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
new foreignXHR();

[03:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
what does IE do in that case?

[03:45:04.0000] <othermaciej>
does it use window or otherWindow?

[03:45:05.0000] <annevk2>
i'm not sure about that case either, I don't have IE handy

[03:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would guess then that it was not the intent of the spec to voice an opinion on these cases

[03:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
olliej: I guess you should test in IE and maybe Firefox and Safari and Opera and send your results to the webapps-wg mailing list

[03:49:00.0000] <annevk2>
http://tc.labs.opera.com/apis/XMLHttpRequest/open/ has tests for the "simple" client = new otherwindow.XMLHttpRequest() cases

[03:49:01.0000] <annevk2>
it does seem like this needs addressing, indeed

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me finds http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-wai-pf/2008JulSep/0509.html (W3C-Member only)

[04:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mmm, condescenscion

[04:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
for the window.foreignXHR = otherWindow.XMLHttpRequest case I'd expect window.document to be the Document pointer

[04:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's good to know nothing goes on in the w3c that needs hiding

[04:43:00.0000] <annevk2>
the PFWG should really be public, not sure why it isn't

[04:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
they are the experts

[04:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
why should they need outside input?

[04:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: if you expect that, you expect the "this" object to be used, but in that case the randomObject case should fail

[04:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, I would never suggest such a thing, merely that we might want insight in their wisdom

[04:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
They should open up and try to emulate the great success of public-html

[04:44:03.0000] <annevk2>
othermaciej, I feel another HTML5 dependency coming

[04:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
public-webapps works pretty well

[04:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think public-html fails because the launch of the HTML WG got so much publicity

[04:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and because HTML is such a central piece of the Web technology stack

[04:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and because it is easier to wrongly believe you understand HTML than to do so with CSS or DOM APIs

[04:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
webapps attracts implementors and people who write relatively advanced JS

[04:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
these factors contribute to a much higher level of highly opinionated but poorly informed people

[04:47:01.0000] <annevk2>
www-style has that too for less technical topics

[04:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and people who are there not to provide expertise but to score political points for their pet objectives

[04:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
public-webapps is one of the best standards mailing lists I am on

[04:48:02.0000] <annevk2>
othermaciej, weinig, http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/webapps/20080926

[04:48:03.0000] <annevk2>
/me hilited the relevant bits

[04:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: yeah, that's what Gecko does

[04:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
which does not appear to match the spec as I read it

[04:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not sure what IE does

[04:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the Gecko behavior would not be hard to implement

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk2>
ah yes, "The associated Document object is the one returned by the document attribute from the object on which the XMLHttpRequest() constructor was invoked (a Window object)." needs some tweaking

[04:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk2: it was actually olliej who pointed it out, not Sam

[04:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
olliej == Oliver Hunt; weinig == Sam Weinig

[05:17:00.0000] <annevk2>
oops

[05:18:00.0000] <olliej>
annevk2: :D

[05:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
olliej: do you have test cases for the rebinding examples discussed a little while ago?

[05:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so someone can test in IE

[05:21:02.0000] <olliej>
othermaciej: errr, not really

[05:22:00.0000] <olliej>
othermaciej: problem being that i don't know xhr well enough to make useful tests

[05:22:01.0000] <olliej>
s/well enough/at all

[05:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok I might try at some point

[05:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
I was confused I guess because weinig does XHR2

[05:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
olliej just hacks whatever he feels like

[05:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
either that or canvas and XHR have some secret relationship

[05:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"WebKit erfüllt alle Acid3-Kriterien"

[05:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
somehow it sounds cooler in German

dun dun duhh

http://ajaxian.com/archives/maintaining-css ouch

[08:36:00.0000] <hendry>
anyone have tips for running IE6 in XP (alongside 8beta2 I currently have running)?

[08:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use the VirtualPC image?

[10:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, zomg: "</body><body>"

[10:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
and the 4 </div> means up to 3 are invalid (although that shouldn't cause real problems, it is ugly)

[10:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh not it doesn't...Firefox 2 wasn't displaying the end of the conditional comments even when I scrolled right to the end (had to select the sample for them to show up)

[10:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
actually, I was right the first time: up to 3 are invalid since there's only 1 <div> start tag in browsers which aren't IE7, IE6 or IE5

[10:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
for some reason I thought Ajaxian was actually good...guess my judgement was clouded by memories of Galaxian :)

[12:10:00.0000] <tusho>
Is <time>2006-09-23</time> fine?

[12:11:00.0000] <tusho>
As opposed to <time datetime="2006-09-23">2006-09-23</time>

[12:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
As far as I can see, yes

[12:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"If the datetime attribute is not present, then the date or time must be specified in the content of the element, such that parsing the element's textContent according to the rules for parsing date or time strings in content successfully extracts a date or time."

Hixie: So is it inversely proportional for groups > 1 person?

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's all to do with whether the group has someone actually maintaining the community and actually calling people (privately) on their rudeness

The 2022 date is working in our favour

[15:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
because the xhtml2wg is buying it

[15:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
and thus don't think we're a threat ("years from adoption")

[15:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Unlike xhtml2 which is decades away? ;)

[15:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
"years from adoptions" could be a simple sign error

[15:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since "adoption staarted years ago" is the correct answer

[15:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What discussion about removing iframes on whatwg@ seems a bit silly

Hixie: in the intro to the talk you use the future tense a lot

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
d'oh!

gsnedders: He wrote the talk back in 1999, didn't you know?

Hixie: I do like the aim of demoing everyting

[15:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Where's the full demo video you use?

[16:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: http://www.whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/video/

[16:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: whatwg never got the kind of giant publicity explosion in the same way

[16:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: a least not at laucnh

[16:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: and it is not conducive to politically oriented types

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
that was intentional -- i told the w3c not to make a big deal out of it, but they felt compelled to do it anyway

[16:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
both due to lack offficial status, and due to the way ou run things

[16:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
still can't believe they released a _press release_ with the FPWD

[16:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
so stupid

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's more evidence of how they are trying to keep the w3c alive at the cost of the web, instead of the other way around

[16:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, they need money and attention can be helpful towards such goals

[16:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
still, if the W3C wanted good general PR, there are much better things they could do or be doing

[16:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but they do not seem to have the management in place to do sane things

[16:27:00.0000] <roc>
hostile takeover by the WHATWG

[16:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
were it only possible

[16:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I must admit, learning that the W3C fails even at making money shocked me

[16:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I thought it was the one thing they were halfway good at

[16:37:00.0000] <roc>
they could of course save a lot of money by shutting down all the bogus groups

[16:37:01.0000] <roc>
but I guess that would also impact revenue

[16:39:00.0000] <jcranmer>
how does the W3C even get revenue?

[16:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Member fees?

[16:39:03.0000] <jcranmer>
oh

[16:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is anyone a member just to participate in the winfest that is OWL?

[16:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I figure anyone involved with OWL has interests in all the other SW stuff

[16:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
all of which is equally a winfest

[16:45:00.0000] <roc>
hmm. I assume "winfest" expands to "festival of wins", but that doesn't sound right

[16:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
roc: There may or may be some element of sarcasm involved

[16:46:01.0000] <roc>
/me recalibrates his detector

Hixie promotes @alt in the video

[16:47:01.0000] <Hixie>

Boo, canvas

[17:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: how was the talk?

[17:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
should i blog it?

[17:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It was good. Personally I was disappointed when canvas turned out to be the last thing, since canvas is totally old to me. But for a regular person, sure.

[17:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And you're good at repeating the questions asked :)

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i try!

[17:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[17:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
glad you liked it

[17:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
i was really worried it would just come out really bad

[17:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
but i'm pretty happy with how the video turned out

[17:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The "oops it doesn't work" parts gave it an authentic feeling, and since you managed to pick most of them up fast, it didn't crash and burn either ;)

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: each one was scary because i'd prepared the thing the weekend before and so i thought i'd gotten out all the bugs!

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: especially the firefox frame reload thing

[17:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: i should have caught that in preparing for it

[17:47:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, that one surprised me, since reloading the frame was the very first thing I thought of

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i shift-reloaded, it should have reloaded it for me!

[17:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
also i forgot to set up the "earlier.txt" file in the editor demo, so it came up blank... not that anyone realised i was trying to bring one up i'd prepared earlier

Hixie, any reason section numbers that consist of one or four numbers have a trailing dot, but those with two or three numbers don't?

if you think that's awesome try removing the context.restore() line

[22:12:00.0000] <erlehmann__>
oh hi, future commitee of the web

[22:23:00.0000] <erlehmann>
can anyone explain to me why the draft says something about images that are just decorative ? shouldn't that be handled by CSS ?

[23:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: often, yes, but it's harmless to have decorative images that are specific to the page, e.g. in some of my blog entries i have pictures of trees i've made.

[23:34:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: "This image is randomly selected from Flickr using Yahoo!" ?

[23:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
that wasn't the one i was thinking about, but that's another example, yeah

[23:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1180683614&count=1 is one example

[23:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
the second two images are just decorative

[23:50:00.0000] <erlehmann>
"just decorative" as of 4.8.2.1.6. "A purely decorative image that doesn't add any information but is still specific to the surrounding content" ?

[23:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[23:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[23:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
well those are kinda different

[23:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
but they both get alt=""

[23:52:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i just want to understand the semantics of the new <img> rules ...

[23:52:01.0000] <erlehmann>
so what was your rationale to not have these images in CSS ?

[23:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
they're allowed in CSS

[23:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it is often convenient to be able to put one-off images in the markup instead of CSS

[23:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
otherwise you end up with many one-off rules in CSS

[23:54:00.0000] <erlehmann>
well, inline CSS is still allowed, or isn't it ?

[23:54:01.0000] <erlehmann>
then, more correctly, if these images in your blog aren't like "4.8.2.1.6." ones, what semantice function do they have ?

[23:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, you're right, these kinds of images simply aren't mentioned

[23:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
i should add a section about them

[23:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
<Hixie> hm, you're right, these kinds of images simply aren't mentioned

[23:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
<Hixie> i should add a section about them

[23:58:02.0000] <erlehmann>
ah thx

[00:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, noted the request

[00:00:01.0000] <erlehmann>
i'm still a bit confused - what exactly distinguishes them (the 2 imgs in question) from "purely decorative" ?

[00:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[00:01:00.0000] <erlehmann>
well, the first image has a very specific alt text and is clearly related to the text. clearly something would be amiss, if there weren't.

[00:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
right

[00:04:00.0000] <erlehmann>
so what would be amiss, if the second type of image just went away ? if the answer is "something", it should (semantically) be viewed as content (and thus probably have an alt text ?). if the answer is "nothing", then images of this type are deco, or aren't they ?

[00:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
nothing would be amiss

[00:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
the only reason to put these in html rather than css is conveniene

[00:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
convenience

[00:37:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: i believe this should be discouraged. i mean, i remember people who laid out tables "for convenience" ...

[00:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
using tables for layout causes harm, because it makes the page less accessible, in that the page doesn't represent the actual structure of the page, and pretends to use a data table when it does not

[00:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
these problems don't occur with using <img> for one-off purely decorative images

[00:40:00.0000] <erlehmann>
that's right, indeed.

[00:42:00.0000] <erlehmann>
but the semantic value tends to be zero and that makes me somehow uneasy.

[00:42:01.0000] <erlehmann>
(my table analogy was only from a pure semantic POV, not from a practical accessability one)

[00:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that using css for this should be encouraged

[00:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
but there's no reason to make this more complicated for authors than necessary just for purity

[00:47:00.0000] <erlehmann>
well, it makes the rules more complicated, but it certainly is a viable solution for those who don't need the flexibility provided by CSS.

[00:49:00.0000] <erlehmann>
is there something intended for the spec like "best CSS practices" perhaps in an appendix ?

[00:50:00.0000] <erlehmann>
like "Things that you CAN do with this specification but they are better handled using other technologies that are further described herein"

[00:53:00.0000] <erlehmann>
or should this rather be the domain of tutorials ?

[00:53:01.0000] <erlehmann>
(as in, not mentioned anywhere in the spec)

[00:56:00.0000] <takkaria>
putting best CSS practices in an HTML spec seems like it's a bad idea

[00:56:01.0000] <takkaria>
I'd suggest CSS best practices go in a CSS spec of some kind

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: for the img case i expect when i add the aforementioned section i'll mention that css is potentially a better plan too

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
but in general no, there's no plan for tutorial-like stuff there

[00:58:02.0000] <erlehmann>
good \o/

[01:01:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i was only asking b/c of "10. Things that you can't do with this specification because they are better handled using other technologies ..."

they are moving to the name web forms after 5 years just we are moving away from it

[13:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
will XHTML2 be renamed to HTML-A? :-)

[13:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
HTML-A could be seen as HTML-10

[13:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, i see

[13:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
WebForms A -> WebForms 10 in decimal, and Web Forms 10 in binary -> WebForms 2 in decimal

[13:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand what http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/specs/XForms1.2/modules/streamlined/index-all.html is supposed to be

[13:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't seem to be xforms, and it doesn't seem to be html4 forms

[13:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>

Do they really have blockquote { font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif, arial; } !?

[14:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: That generalisation seems clearly false - e.g. consider something that people want, then add a load of unnecessary complexity so that nobody wants it any more; then they would still want the simplified version, since it's exactly the same as the pre-complexification thing that they wanted

[02:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. it appears that Flash Player allows an .swf bug the user about localstorage until the user accepts

[02:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, if I deny, the confirmation dialog just pops up again

[02:42:00.0000] <annevk2>
/me read that as ".swf bug" initially

[02:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asking for the confirmation is kinda pointless when the user is repeatedly tanted to allow anyway

[02:46:00.0000] <roc>
asking users for confirmation of anything in a modal way is pointeless

[03:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>

hsivonen: are you a dev ? or why do you use flash ?

[05:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe dialog boxes need "I don't know" and "I don't care" buttons that do the sane thing

[05:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Then they could remove all the other options and just leave "I don't know or care", and then they could automatically press that button for you and not have to show the dialog box at all

[05:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But expert uses know and care

[05:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
*users

[05:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
They're far too much in the minority to be worth catering for

By themselves, maybe, but they also direct other users, like students taking a course or employees using a service.

erlehmann: I use Flash for watching Comedy Central content.

[05:27:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen: that fails at so many levels ... ;)

[05:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(my guess is that they use Flash local storage for keeping track of which ads they have shown to a given user)

[06:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
something is wrong with the DNS server responsible for validator.nu

[06:45:00.0000] <deane>

[06:47:00.0000] <deane>
cool, thanks

[06:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: profile was in the draft on 24 February 2006 at least

[08:08:00.0000] <tusho>
http://camendesign.com/code/using-abbr is it just me or is this totally wrong.

[08:21:00.0000] <hasather>
tusho: it's not just you

[08:21:01.0000] <tusho>
:)

[08:21:02.0000] <tusho>
also the writing style is absolutely awful

[08:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
why is it *totally* wrong? the main point makes sense

[08:22:01.0000] <tusho>
i couldn't read more than half of the article because of it which is why i resorted to asking ... ::P

[08:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the CSS example is questionable, though

[08:23:00.0000] <hasather>
hsivonen: I mostly looked at the examples. The spec says "The attribute, if specified, must contain an expansion of the abbreviation, and nothing else.". That is not what the author is doing

[08:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"When you read a bad document, you naturally expand the errors as appropriate in your mind."

[08:23:02.0000] <hasather>
hsivonen: that was about the title attribute of course

[08:23:03.0000] <tusho>
(heh -- from the writer's site: [['Webkit, like Gecko' in a user-agent is obscenely wrong. Why don’t user-agents say something meaningful, like “Acid 2”, “Acid 3”?]] ... the acid tests are great and all but it's not as if they'd be meaningful as a user agent string...)

[08:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
tusho: Because then we're test sniffing and not UA sniffing@

[08:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*!

[08:27:02.0000] <tusho>
gsnedders: Exactly...

[08:28:00.0000] <tusho>
And considering the Acid tests deliberately test non-standard stuff too...

[08:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
tusho: Nononono, I mean, we're testing for capabilities!

[08:28:02.0000] <tusho>
gsnedders: i'm not sure what point you're trying to make as you're not making much sense to me :P

[08:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
tusho: What non-standard stuff?

[08:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
tusho: Me? Make sense? Why would I do that.

[08:29:02.0000] <tusho>
Dashiva: Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't acid3 test handling of invalid code?

[08:29:03.0000] <tusho>
& markup or whatever

[08:29:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't think so. Acid2 certainly does.

[08:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
tusho: The handling is part of the standard, though.

[09:32:00.0000] <erlehmann>
<abbr title="does not equal">!=</abbr> LOLWTF

[10:39:00.0000] <tusho>
erlehmann: totally

[10:44:00.0000] <erlehmann>
can't someone update user-agent spec ?

[10:45:00.0000] <erlehmann>
like Engine / Version (Browser / Version)

[10:46:00.0000] <hasather>
erlehmann: there is no spec for that

[10:46:01.0000] <erlehmann>
hasather: then there should be.

Hello all

[13:56:01.0000] <KrocCamen>
My access logs pointed to here, I wanted to find out more about questions that were brought up about my article. You're the experts, ne? :)

[14:02:00.0000] <svl>
KrocCamen: I think you want to look at http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20080928#l-124

[14:03:00.0000] <KrocCamen>
That's what I'm doing; very surprising that Google caught that that quick, and yet it's live, I can even see my own messages in there; freaky O-o. I'd love to be able to answer questions people have about my article, and accept any feedback people have

[15:01:00.0000] <roc>

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174351

[15:01:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I told annevk that I'd help with his current XML5 draft ages ago…

[15:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
roc: With regards to that comment, IE is strict about it, WebKit trunk is too

[15:04:00.0000] <roc>
intriguing

[15:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(IE doesn't really support XHTML, so it doesn't happen in that example which obviously sends text/html to IE)

[15:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
For generic XML and feeds it is strict, though

[15:05:02.0000] <roc>
would you mind commenting in the bug?

[15:05:03.0000] <roc>
I can parrot your comments but it sounds better first-hand

[15:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me ought to be writing an English essay

[15:05:05.0000] <gsnedders>
But sure. :)

[15:06:00.0000] <roc>
then you shouldn't be hanging around on IRC!

[15:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
True.

[15:06:02.0000] <roc>
thanks

[15:06:03.0000] <gsnedders>
But my English is terrible today :(

[15:07:00.0000] <KrocCamen>

[15:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
KrocCamen: :P

[15:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
roc: Need I really copy my comment starting with "IE doesn't really support…"?

[15:10:00.0000] <roc>
why not

[15:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess everyone will know

[15:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But hey, I don't care :P

[15:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
roc: Will that comment do?

[15:15:00.0000] <roc>
yes, thanks

I wonder what percentage of posts using the term 'opportunity cost' are hsivonen's :)

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
most people don't think of the opportunity cost of things, and that's especially the case in public-html

[18:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
and of those who do, many think the opp cost of replying to e-mails where the opp cost is being ignored isn't worth it

[18:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
so probably the majority :-)

[18:05:00.0000] <jcranmer>
and people wonder why there's an economic crisis...

[18:05:01.0000] <jcranmer>
honestly, if people can't apply basic economic principles to every day situations, what good is our school system?

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
which school system?

[18:07:00.0000] <jcranmer>
our = <insert any country here>

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[07:40:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm 10 october doesn't seem like 3 weeks (for svg 1.2 tiny)

[07:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
oh it was a reminder

[09:10:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
does http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core#dom-node-insertbefore make sense or am i smoking crack?

[09:10:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
and http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core#legal-hierarchy

[09:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
undefined=null should be in the IDL

[09:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
and you should prolly say that it should go between the previous sibiling and the refChild

[09:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: does DocumentFragment insertion really happen as shorthand that calls other public APIs?

[09:12:02.0000] <annevk2>
and you should handle what happens if you pass non DOM objects

[09:12:03.0000] <annevk2>
or if newChild is null

[09:12:04.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: if not, it should probably say that the impl. must call its internal methods if the public methods have been replaced in JS

[09:12:05.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: (this comment is without testing)

[09:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: otherwise, looks good

[09:14:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: ah. didn't think about that. i guess i should just say "recursively invoke this algorithm" or some such

[09:23:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok fixed both, thanks

[09:25:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: doesn't webidl cover what happens when you pass the wrong thing?

[09:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm maybe it doesn't

[09:36:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: what if refChild doesn't have a previous sibling?

[09:36:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk2: isn't the current text clear enough?

[09:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm what if refChild isn't a child of the relevant node

[13:00:00.0000] <phroggy>
so what would it take to get a Safari-compatible <input type="search"> officially added to HTML 5 (or Web Forms 2.0 or whatever specification is appropriate)?

oh, maybe it isn't

[13:02:01.0000] <takkaria>
ah well

looks like it has been filed under WF3: http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/cgi/issues.cgi/folder/WF3-search

[13:06:00.0000] <takkaria>
heh, as if you can tell the gender of someone from their twitters...

[13:06:01.0000] <phroggy>
I asked some Mozilla and Opera people about adding support, and they basically said unless W3C or WHATWG puts it in a standard they're not interested.

[13:07:00.0000] <phroggy>
so I figured I should ask here. ;-)

[13:08:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, send mail to the whatwg list saying what problems lead you to believe it's necessary

[13:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: We're just around to make telling gender a bit harder

[13:09:00.0000] <takkaria>
if you ever guess my gender, please tell me, cos I don't have a clue :P

[13:10:00.0000] <phroggy>
the problem is that a bunch of sites emulate various aspects of this behavior through creative JavaScript hacking; they all have to reinvent the wheel, and some of them reinvent it poorly.

[13:10:01.0000] <phroggy>
does that sound sufficient?

[13:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Well, there's a 60% chance you're female.

[13:11:00.0000] <takkaria>
phroggy: well, if you follow the process, and say what your problem is, and why <input type=search> is a good solution over JavaScript or other solutions, then that would be very useful

[13:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: (Before I clicked on, "No…", I was 85% female)

[13:13:00.0000] <phroggy>
takkaria: I assume that other people have already been talking about it, so I'm curious if there's any opposition?  I haven't been able to find much discussion.

[13:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
phroggy: the link I pasted a while ago is the record so far

[13:18:00.0000] <takkaria>
phroggy: the editor hasn't considered the feedback yet, it seems, but when he does, it would be useful if as many people as possible put forward problem descriptions and reasons for choosing given solutions

[14:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Will you have time in the next 22 hours?

[14:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: And/or you?

[14:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(to look at my personal statement)

[14:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I looked at it briefly, but unfortunately it looks much better than the older version so I can't think of anything non-trivial and constructive to suggest

[14:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Maybe that isn't that unfortunate :P

[14:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Depends on your perspective :-)

[14:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: My guidance teacher thinks it is ready :P

[20:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
nothing, or throw?

MikeSmith: thanks, I'll try that.

[23:58:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i wonder - what is the reason for not deprecating stuff that severely lacks semantics - like <b> or <i> or the target attribute ?

[23:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
we've given them semantics

[00:03:00.0000] <erlehmann>
well, i see that you tried - but say with <b>, we have "text to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance". and isn't exactly that totally non-semantic ?

[00:04:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i mean, a <span> + CSS can also be used to bolden text and has the same amount of "not conveying any extra importance"

[00:07:00.0000] <erlehmann>
and then there's a cognitive dissonance on my part - why mark something up, if it hasn't a special (semantic) role ? doesn't <b>stuff</b> imply that stuff is somehow important ?

[00:10:00.0000] <erlehmann>
and even if it has, IMO it's to shallow defined to contrast <em> or <strong>, which are often italized or boldened themselves.

[00:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
<b> is for like keywords and stuff

[00:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
which aren't important in the way that <strong> is

[00:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
it has nothing to do with bold really, nor does strong

[00:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
same with <em>, <i>, <var>, <cite>... they're all "italics" by default, but that's not really the point

[00:15:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i usually mark up my keywords with <em>. so what exactly, in HTML5 terms, differs from marking them up with <b> ? is it just that keywords by itself aren't important, ever ?

[00:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
<em> means stress emphasis

[00:16:01.0000] <erlehmann>
like in speaking ?

[00:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
there are detailed examples in the spec

[00:16:04.0000] <erlehmann>
so would it help if i think of <b> as <keyword> ?

[00:16:05.0000] <erlehmann>
if so, thank you.

[00:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, though it's not just for keywords

[00:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's a couple of other examples in the spec

[00:19:00.0000] <erlehmann>
then i'd still suggest replacing "spans of text whose typical typographic presentation is boldened" with a more specific list - a mean, if that's possible, at all

[00:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
<b> is kind of the "fallback" element, which is why it's an open ended list

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: so what problem would be solved by not having <i> and <b>?

[00:22:01.0000] <erlehmann>
yeah, i see it. i'll try not to encounter the case where i'll have "exhausted" semantics, though. ;)

[00:23:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen: i got it. was just too fixated on the "spans of text whose typical typographic presentation" parts.

[00:25:00.0000] <erlehmann>
now my second question: the target attribute. wasn't that commonly listed as one of the worst (read: most annoying) design mishaps in web history ?

[00:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: what authors would be instead is even worse

[00:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: making bad stuff declarative makes it more detectable by UAs and easier to opt out of

[00:26:01.0000] <erlehmann>
synthax error. did you mean " what authors would USE instead"

[00:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
s/be instead/be doing instead/

[00:26:03.0000] <erlehmann>
ah okay.

[00:29:00.0000] <erlehmann>
so the reasoning for keeping it is that bad coders would do pop-ups and stuff with javascript ?

[00:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: yeah

[00:32:00.0000] <erlehmann>
assuming a coder is so bad that he'd do that, wouldn't it be safer to just write into the spec why doing that is a very, very, very bad idea ? i mean, i've seen stuff like <a href="javascript: [...] "> but hell, those coders i've seen are still using <font> and frames. why would they even be interested in HTML5 ?

[00:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: there have been people who've done window.open in order to cater for html 4.01 or xhtml 1.1 validation

[00:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: the requirement to open windows may come from a client or boss or something

[00:34:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen: i hate people who do that with utmost dignity.

[00:36:00.0000] <erlehmann>
(i told the last client who wanted a song to play when the site loaded that i could, but wouldn't do and why)

[00:39:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i'll be back when i can coherently argument against catering to bad web designers. meanwhile, thank you for answering my questions.

[00:51:00.0000] <phroggy>
I use target="_blank" when I have a very specific reason for doing so.  I do it very sparingly, and having to hack around it with JavaScript would annoy me.

[00:52:00.0000] <phroggy>
whether the browser chooses to implement it by opening in a new window or a new tab doesn't matter to me; that should be the user's preference.  However, there are times when navigating away from the current page is undesirable.

[00:52:01.0000] <phroggy>
of course I've seen this abused - retarded marketing people who think users should never navigate away from their page under any circumstances.

[00:54:00.0000] <erlehmann>
phroggy: are you aware of the fact that almost every browser let's the user choose - by means of distinguishing left, and middle-click, for example ?

[00:55:00.0000] <phroggy>
yes, but many users aren't sophisticated enough to make that choice intelligently.

[00:55:01.0000] <erlehmann>
assuming you are, what are these "very specific reason[s]" ? that boss / client says so ?

[00:55:02.0000] <phroggy>
and, when I specify target="_blank", middle-click still works.

[00:55:03.0000] <erlehmann>
many users are confused when the context changes in unexpected ways, the back button breaks, and so on.

[00:56:00.0000] <erlehmann>
so tell me, phroggy, when do you use it ?

[00:57:00.0000] <phroggy>
I just built a directory that allows users to enter various contact information including their MySpace, Facebook and LiveJournal IDs, then on a confirmation page presents these as clickable links that the user can test before submitting the form to save the info in the database.  I set those links to use target="_blank".

[00:58:00.0000] <phroggy>
I know there are some people who would prefer to navigate to those links within the same window, then click the Back button to get back to the confirmation page (which is the result of a POST form and therefore not cached very nicely by some browsers)

[00:58:01.0000] <phroggy>
but I'm betting that MOST of my users don't want that.

[00:59:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i see. i'd NEVER work with myspace users, though ;)

[01:00:00.0000] <phroggy>
yes, well, this is a contact directory for old friends from high school.  I personally despise MySpace, but some of them use it.

[01:01:00.0000] <phroggy>
but there's also a field for an arbitrary "home page" URL

[01:01:01.0000] <erlehmann>
also i never assume that i'm smarter than my users - but that lies probably in my choice of mates / clients / users :)

[01:01:02.0000] <phroggy>
which behaves the same way.

[01:01:03.0000] <phroggy>
indeed.

[01:02:00.0000] <erlehmann>
why don't you just accept the info and let them edit later ? or parse myspace / livejournal for info ?

[01:02:01.0000] <phroggy>
they can edit it later, but they're more likely to catch mistakes if I immediately offer a clickable link they can try before submitting.

[01:03:00.0000] <phroggy>
the key to good design isn't necessarily being smarter than your users, but it is anticipating what your users will expect.

[01:04:00.0000] <phroggy>
you've heard of the Principle of Least Surprise?

[01:05:00.0000] <erlehmann>
links opening in the same window surprise me the least >:]

[01:06:00.0000] <phroggy>
yep, but I'm betting having the confirmation page go away will surprise my users more than having the links open in new windows.

[01:06:01.0000] <phroggy>
hmm, that's odd...

[01:06:02.0000] <phroggy>
I think my ISP just broke something.

[01:09:00.0000] <erlehmann>
phroggy: you are playing on the same level as garvin hicking - quote: "What I absolutely dislike about xhtml+xml content type is that at least the last time I tried in Firefox any validation error will kill to display the blog. Until [sic !] the validation of XML dies so hard on user input, it's IMHO useless."

[01:10:00.0000] <erlehmann>
TLDR - understandable, but severely annoying in the end

[01:11:00.0000] <phroggy>
I have yet to make a site that allows users to submit arbitrary HTML code.

[01:12:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i currently do - we just validate our input against a subset of the XHTML DTD.

[01:12:01.0000] <phroggy>
:-)

[01:13:00.0000] <erlehmann>
of course, complaints of the form "my input isn't accepted" are expected

[01:13:01.0000] <erlehmann>
but i say: those who can't do markup shall abstain from (X)HTML

[01:14:00.0000] <phroggy>
quite so.

[01:14:01.0000] <phroggy>
if I were to implement something like that from scratch myself without using anybody else's stuff, I would probably invent something like BBCode.

[01:15:00.0000] <erlehmann>
lotsa people use BB code. and it's crap.

[01:15:01.0000] <phroggy>
yes - if I had to do it myself, what I invented would most likely be crap.

[01:15:02.0000] <erlehmann>
like earlier versions of HTML, its purely presentational

[01:16:00.0000] <phroggy>
but BBCode is probably the direction I'd go.

[01:16:01.0000] <erlehmann>
BTW: where is the the XHTML5 DTD ? Hixie ?

[01:16:02.0000] <phroggy>
yes, that's because presentational markup is what users want.

[01:17:00.0000] <phroggy>
(well, it's what authors want when they're writing the code, not what users want when they're viewing the results.)

[01:17:01.0000] <erlehmann>
phroggy: do they ? if you press for it, users won't ever think "that's BOLD RED".

[01:17:02.0000] <erlehmann>
they say "it's all caps because it's IMPORTANT !!!!!111one1eleven"

[01:18:00.0000] <phroggy>
sure they will.  If they're lazy they'll use caps, if they're less lazy they'll say "how can I make this bold and/or red?"

[01:18:01.0000] <phroggy>
not "how can I indicate that this has emphasis, which I can trust will be rendered appropriately later?"

[01:20:00.0000] <erlehmann>
then you do not press hard enough. or your users are retarded :þ

[01:20:01.0000] <phroggy>
most users are retarded, and they prefer it that way.

[01:21:00.0000] <erlehmann>
every one who complains about internet explorer rendering errors deserves a smacking.

[01:22:00.0000] <erlehmann>
likewise everyone who usese XHTML, but can't do well-formedness

[01:23:00.0000] <phroggy>
this is weird.  Something is apparently broken at my ISP, but the only indication I have that there's a problem is, my IRC connection to irc.opera.com dropped and won't reconnect.  A traceroute to that IP gets stuck in an infinite loop after the first hop past my LAN, but I haven't run into anything else similarly broken yet.

[01:24:00.0000] <phroggy>
never mind, it's fixed.

[01:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: there's no DTD for (X)HTML5

[01:27:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: a schema perhaps ? or will that come only in 2009, when the spec is finished ?

[01:28:00.0000] <phroggy>
that's because DTD is an SGML and XML thing, right?  And HTML 5 is neither?

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
XHTML5 is XML but does not use a DTD

[01:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
DTD is optional for XML

[01:29:02.0000] <erlehmann>
well, how do i validate then ?

[01:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
with an HTML5 validator

[01:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
such as <http://validator.nu/>

[01:30:02.0000] <erlehmann>
i want to validate input is part of my app.

[01:30:03.0000] <phroggy>
othermaciej: I think what he's looking for is, how to write one?

[01:31:00.0000] <erlehmann>
phroggy: exactly. if there's none, i'll make one. modularized, like XHTML 1.1

[01:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
ah, then the HTML5 spec says what a conformance checker is required to do

[01:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
you can't implement correct HTML5 conformance checking with a DTD, unfortunately

[01:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
erlehmann: validator.nu has a REST API

[01:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
at least, not solely with a DTD

[01:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Validator.nu_Common_Input_Parameters

[01:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
other recent W3C markup languages are not defined by DTD either

[01:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Validator.nu_GNU_Output

[01:33:03.0000] <othermaciej>
for instance SVG 1.2 does not have a DTD

[01:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nor does XForms 1.1

[01:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
many people consider DTDs to be obsolete, or so I have heard

[01:36:01.0000] <erlehmann>
othermaciej: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.2/rng/

[01:36:02.0000] <erlehmann>
HURR DURR

[01:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that is a RelaxNG schema, not a DTD

[01:37:01.0000] <phroggy>
othermaciej: I suppose the obvious question is, if DTDs are obsolete, what replaces them?

[01:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
phroggy: that would be beyond my personal expertise

[01:37:03.0000] <phroggy>
:-)

[01:37:04.0000] <erlehmann>
schemas

[01:38:00.0000] <erlehmann>
so where's the HTML5 schema ?

[01:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: if you want to validate HTML5, you write a schema, or some C++ code, or whatever, to validate HTML5, following the rules in HTML5, the same as if you want to write an HTML5 editor, or an HTML5 web browser, or whatever

[01:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: there is no official schema, and will never be one

[01:39:00.0000] <erlehmann>
" there [...] will never be one" WAIT, WHAT ? why would you do that ?

[01:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
do what?

[01:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
we're not writing code, we're writing a spec

[01:39:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
erlehmann: the RNC schema files that validator.nu uses are here: http://svn.versiondude.net/whattf/syntax/trunk/relaxng

[01:39:04.0000] <erlehmann>
not doing a formal, machine-readable specification ?

[01:39:05.0000] <Hixie>
because that's an implementation, not a specification

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
implementors should be free to compete on writing their own implementations

[01:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
having an official implementation results in no competition, which results in poor quality implementations

[01:40:02.0000] <phroggy>
I thought a schema was a spec, just in a machine-readable form instead of a human-readable form?

[01:40:03.0000] <erlehmann>
phroggy: it is.

[01:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
just look at how the html4 validators never really competed -- the html5 validator is already better than anything we ever got for html4

[01:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
a schema is not a spec

[01:41:00.0000] <erlehmann>
wat

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's an implementation of a spec for syntax checking

[01:41:02.0000] <phroggy>
hmm.

[01:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
we don't have any reference implementations

[01:41:04.0000] <othermaciej>
an implementation can be a spec

[01:41:05.0000] <phroggy>
/me remains unconvinced

[01:41:06.0000] <othermaciej>
just not clear if that is desirable

[01:41:07.0000] <othermaciej>
(Hixie apparently thinks not)

[01:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
an implementation of something simple can be a spec, but for something as complicated as html, that's a non-starter

[01:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
as an implementor I like it when certain parts of specs are in a formal machine-readable notation

[01:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
like IDL or BNF grammars

[01:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
schemas or DTDs, not especially helpful for content display

[01:42:04.0000] <phroggy>
a schema would say e.g. <input type="date" name="date"> is part of the specification, but not say how to render it - that would be an implementation detail.

[01:43:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: i disagree strongly and would like to add that a formal schema is the only way to distinguish correct markup from incorrect one.

[01:44:00.0000] <phroggy>
erlehmann: I would disagree that a machine-readable schema is the only way.

[01:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the biggest problem with using a schema to define markup syntax is that you end up limiting yourself to what the schema language can express

[01:44:02.0000] <erlehmann>
a schema isn't an implementition, a validator is.

[01:44:03.0000] <phroggy>
it may be the only way to do it without human involvement...

[01:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it can also make the spec very hard to read

[01:45:01.0000] <phroggy>
othermaciej: yes, that would be my assumption as to why there won't be one

[01:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
for instance reading the SVG spec (either 1.1 or 1.2), it is really hard for me to tell what attributes any given element supports

[01:45:03.0000] <phroggy>
and yes, that's something that I always hated about trying to read anything about HTML at W3C

[01:45:04.0000] <erlehmann>
othermaciej: that's why XHTML 1.0 has an appendix

[01:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
erlehmann: as othermaciej mentions, there are some constraints in the spec that are not expressible in any schema language; for those cases, validator.nu uses custom code to check those constraints

[01:46:01.0000] <phroggy>
^^ THAT is a legit reason for not having a schema

[01:46:02.0000] <phroggy>
:-)

[01:46:03.0000] <othermaciej>
you could define your spec as "schema + extra constraints"

[01:46:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[01:46:05.0000] <phroggy>
erlehmann: your task now is to invent a schema language in which HTML 5 can be fully described.

[01:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but then validators end up being tempted to just use the schema and ignore the extra constraints

[01:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: right

[01:47:02.0000] <erlehmann>
phroggy: i'll try.

[01:47:03.0000] <erlehmann>
but as XML schema is XML, it's extensible.

[01:48:00.0000] <erlehmann>
MikeSmith: you work on validator.nu ? what exactly are those corner cases ?

[01:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
erlehmann: hsivonen alone made validator.nu

[01:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
for details about the other cases, see http://about.validator.nu/

[01:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and they aren't just corner cases

[01:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
one thing is check the integrity of tables -- e.g., to make sure they have no overlapping cells

[01:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/table-integrity-checker/

[01:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
erlehmann: also http://hsivonen.iki.fi/thesis/html5-conformance-checker.xhtml

[01:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/thesis/html5-conformance-checker.xhtml#non-schema

[01:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
using a schema language to express a specification requires adding another specification, written in english, to specify the schema language

[01:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
it just adds a level of indirection, massively increasing the overall complexity

[01:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or you could do like programming language weenies do, and define the schema language in itself

[01:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
then how do you know what any of it means?

[01:53:02.0000] <phroggy>
random guessing. :-)

[01:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: html5.validator.nu uses RELAX NG for the easy stuff, a custom RELAX NG library and custom Java code

[01:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
close your eyes and hope the axiom of foundation goes away?

[01:54:02.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: RELAX NG is already specified.

[01:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
but ok, that solves the problem quite nearly... let me define a schema language that can be used to express both all the rules of html5 and all the rules of its own schema language

[01:54:04.0000] <othermaciej>
/me wonders if he finally made a joke too nerdy for anyone on the channel to get

[01:54:05.0000] <erlehmann>
if it's XML, possible

[01:54:06.0000] <erlehmann>
othermaciej: bad joke.

[01:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: schema languages aren't expressive enough to capture the conformance criteria of HTML5

[01:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
this schema language has files that are exactly one bit long. If the bit is a 0, then it defines the schema of the schema language. if the bit is a 1, it defines the schema of html5.

[01:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
i now present you the complete schema for html5: 0x01.

[01:55:03.0000] <hsivonen>
DTDs weren't expressive enough for HTML4, and the result was that validators stopped at whatever the official DTD said instead of improving

[01:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: relax ng isn't powerful enough to express html5's validation requirements.

[01:56:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen, Hixie: so where are the problems ?

[01:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: e.g. table integrity in html5

[01:57:00.0000] <erlehmann>
D:

[01:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: awesome, now I just have to write a processor for Hixie Schema Language

[01:58:01.0000] <erlehmann>
HSL is the future !

[01:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose i should define error handling for my schema language

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
if the file is shorter than 1 bit, then the user agent must report a fatal error

[01:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I didn't make Validator.nu alone. fantasai started the schemas and there are lots of 3rd-party libs.

[01:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
if the file is longer than 1 bit, it must ignore all bits after the first one

[01:59:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: doesn't the 0x00 schema define error handling?

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: no this schema language only defines validaity of input streams against schemas

[02:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I though schemata by their nature only define correct syntax, not erro rhandling

[02:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: it doesn't define UA behaviour

[02:00:03.0000] <othermaciej>
*error

[02:00:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: ah

[02:00:05.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: RELAX NG sucks for ancestor-descendant constraints

[02:00:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: point taken

[02:00:07.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: right, but a schema language spec still has to define what to do with schemas that aren't themselves conforming

[02:00:08.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: RELAX NG simply can't express table integrity 2D grid constraints

[02:00:09.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen: like <x> can or cannot be inside <y> ?

[02:00:10.0000] <erlehmann>
oh, bummer.

[02:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: like <x> cannot be a descendant of <y> (with possibly <z> in between)

erlehmann: RELAX NG can express that, but it's extremely inconvenient

[02:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
seems to me the question of validating against an invalid schema is ill-posed, but fair enough

[02:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: to the point that it's just not worth it trying to express it in RELAX NG

[02:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: it can be expressed in Schematron, though

[02:02:04.0000] <hsivonen>
but Schematron performance sucks

[02:03:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen: maybe one could generate that schema with XSL (chuckle) :D

[02:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so I optimized it away in Java

[02:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: how so?

[02:03:03.0000] <othermaciej>
well let's say validation is a function from ordered pairs (S, D) of a schema and a document to the set { true, false}

[02:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if people are expected to use schemas with different implementations of the schema language, you can easily end up with people making mistakes and finding that different implementations handle those mistakes differently, if you don't define hwo to handle the mistakes

[02:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(Making Schematron performance not suck is a much harder implementation problem than making a naïve Schematron validator)

[02:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one would assume that if validate(M, S) == false where M is the metaschema (the schema for the sechema language) then vaidate(S, D) == false for any D

[02:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though I suppose one can define otherwise

[02:05:02.0000] <erlehmann>
away with that linguist jokery !

[02:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: seriously though, the main reason we don't, and won't, have a schema is that in html4, having a schema caused the market to not innovate in the validation space, something which has almsot certainly contributed to the great mess that is html on the web

[02:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/thesis/html5-conformance-checker#incorrect-rng-expectations

[02:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: with html5, not having a schema has caused at least one person (hsivonen) to actually focus on writing a better conformance checker

[02:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: and i expect there to be more over the years (including myself, hopefully)

[02:07:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Hixie: i though the problem was that UAs accepted HURR DURR braindead markup

[02:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: that's a feature!

[02:07:02.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen: tag soup apologist !

[02:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: one might well assume that, but i expect implementations will fail to catch all such errors (in the same way that html UAs in the early days didn't look for errors)

[02:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
erlehmann: there are many contributing factors

[02:08:02.0000] <othermaciej>
s/apologist/enthusiast/

[04:43:00.0000] <phroggy>
other than onsearch, is there any other JavaScript event that fires every time the contents of a text field are modified without blurring?

[04:43:01.0000] <phroggy>
including using the mouse to paste/cut/clear from the Edit menu.

[04:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
phroggy: oninput

[05:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. the tokenizer has a lot of fields

[05:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
52 (non-static) fields

[05:14:00.0000] <phroggy>
Hixie: alright, why do onsearch and incremental exist if we have oninput?

[05:15:00.0000] <phroggy>
is it because oninput didn't exist at the time?

[05:20:00.0000] <phroggy>
hmm, I notice a slight difference in behavior.

[05:39:00.0000] <phroggy>
/me submits a recommendation for <input type="search">, and finds that's a much harder case to argue than for placeholder support

[07:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, using the Audi R8 (Le mans prototype, not road car) with Medium tyres in Arcade Time Attack mode, I did a 6:10.819, pitted (tyres only), then a 5:47.665

[07:03:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so I'm guessing you used a different R8 or Super Hard tyres or just had a lot of crashes

[07:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me hopes gsnedders reads the log.

[07:04:01.0000] <erlehmann>
BenMillard: this isn't CARWG

[07:05:00.0000] <erlehmann>
or was this a complex car analogy ?

[07:05:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I'm meeting him at W3C TPAC 2008

[07:05:02.0000] <annevk2>
erlehmann, please see the topic :)

[07:05:03.0000] <erlehmann>
"Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks!"

[07:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
It is illogical to discuss off-topic issues such as racing games in a technical HTML channel, but the channel doesn't care much for logic and therefore it is perfectly on-topic and acceptable

[07:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
that statement violates the topic :p

[07:13:01.0000] <BenMillard>
we'll be playing the game at times during the TPAC, so we're figuring out each other's pace so we can spend more time having fun games and less times balancing the gameplay, therefore we'll be happier and more productive during the meeting time

[07:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: How so? My statement was quite illogical

[07:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: You should just play Mario Kart instead, so if one of you is a worse player then they'll get all the red and blue shells and can easily catch up

[07:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, strangely enough I don't find Mario Kart to be quite as deeply engaging as Gran Turismo 4 :)

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Sure, but you can push Princess Peach into the path of a giant pinball, so it's clearly a better game

[07:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, then our tastes differ...and speaking of which, I'm off for lunch!

[07:51:00.0000] <virtuelv>
/me completely sucks at Mario Kart WII

[08:54:00.0000] <annevk2>
zcorpan, on http://simon.html5.org/html5-elements you need a space between spaces and title on <link>

[08:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: thx

[09:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: (if you see this), I think I was on SSH, and crashed a fair bit too.

[09:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But hey, it was my first two laps on GT4 in a year

[09:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Probably only Hard, actually

[09:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/SSH/RSH/

[09:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I also think it wasn't crashing that much, it was just really big crashes

[09:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
or just going off on a long straight costing me a lot of time

[09:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
How many pedestrians and/or zombies did you crush?

[10:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Down to 6:10.704

[10:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I can probably match your time given a week to get back in practice

[10:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: There are pedestrians and/or zombies in GT4?

[10:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: There should be

[10:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"All bright kids are depraved."

[10:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Also, the cars should have giant meat grinders mounted to the front

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
(U2XMP did - it was great fun to fire the rocket boosters and leap over the top of a hill and hit a jumping enemy player and cause them to explode gratifyingly)

Looking in IRC logs: http://gender.twitmarks.com/g.php?username=whatwg links to http://twitter.com/home?status=... - does that automatically change your Twitter status, or does it have an extra confirmation step to prevent the totally obvious CSRF attack?

[10:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me is away: Less talk, more pimp walk.

[10:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Are you planning to reply to that?

[10:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: yes

[10:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me guess that `with (new XMLHttpRequest()) { open('POST', 'http://192.168.0.1/update_firewall_settings'); send(...) }` is one of the more obvious problems

[10:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: feel free to add more concrete threats

[10:40:00.0000] <hasather>
Philip`: that just sets the text in the textarea, it doesn't submit anything

[10:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
hasather: Ah, good

[10:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
(though of course you could load that page with the prefilled textarea into an iframe and then hide everything except the submit button, and trick someone into clicking on it, but hopefully nobody would be so cruel)

[11:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
phroggy: Saying "Nobody uses that" (on <isindex>) is dangerous, since people do use it :-)

[11:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. http://www.oasislasvegasrvresort.com/ (which oddly doesn't work in Opera)

[11:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
and http://www.sdsc.edu/~hutton/cgi-bin/tracert.cgi

[11:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
and I only had to search through a hundred thousand pages to find those

[11:43:03.0000] <phroggy>
alright

[11:43:04.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, and http://www.ijs.si/cgi-bin/rac-slovar

[11:45:00.0000] <phroggy>
I stand corrected.

[11:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's as common as the <centr> and <fontcolor=red> and <nyt_links_onsite> tags, in my set of pages

[11:49:00.0000] <phroggy>
as I said, it could be resurrected, but I don't see a compelling reason to do so.

[11:49:01.0000] <phroggy>
particularly because it's not a form element, and it's often useful for a search form to have other fields.

[11:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not disagreeing with your conclusions at all :-)

[11:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
<isindex> is not a feature I would want to encourage

[11:50:02.0000] <phroggy>
:-)

[11:50:03.0000] <Philip`>
because it's, like, totally crazy

[11:51:00.0000] <phroggy>
hehe

[11:51:01.0000] <phroggy>
indeed.  I was unfamiliar with it until it was mentioned on the list and I looked it up.  I suspect I was deliberately unfamiliar with it.

[11:52:00.0000] <phroggy>
one of those things I've seen before, but after glancing at, chose to ignore.

[11:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cbody%20onload%3Ddocument.body.appendChild(document.createElement('isindex'))%3E%0A%3Cisindex%3E

[11:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray for interoperability

[11:55:00.0000] <phroggy>
uh, wait, what?

[11:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
IE and Opera show one labelled box; Safari shows one labelled and one unlabelled; Firefox shows two labelled

[11:55:02.0000] <phroggy>
ah..

[11:55:03.0000] <phroggy>
I understand Safari's behavior...

[11:56:00.0000] <phroggy>
actually, no, I think I understand Firefox's behavior better.

[11:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
Firefox puts ISINDEX in the DOM, Opera puts ISINDEX containing text and HRs and stuff, Safari puts DIV containing text stuff and a ISINDEX type="khtml_isindex", IE did something different but it's crashed now and I can't be bothered to restart it

[11:56:02.0000] <phroggy>
fabulous.

[11:56:03.0000] <phroggy>
yeah, let's not support this tag.

[11:56:04.0000] <phroggy>
heh

[11:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Well, we have to support it, because people still use it

[11:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me goes home

[11:59:01.0000] <phroggy>
browser developers have to support it, but HTML 5 doesn't.

[12:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: do people really insert it via the DOM and expect it to work?

[12:06:00.0000] <phroggy>
I'd guess many of the people using <isindex> began doing so before JavaScript existed...

[12:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I really hope not

[12:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
and given how few people use it statically, and most of those seem to be ancient sites, I wouldn't expect anyone to ever insert one dynamically

[12:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
phroggy: HTML 5 is aiming to specify everything that browser developers need to support, so it has to support isindex in that sense (though it doesn't have to allow authors to ever use it, but I'm not sure whether that's what you mean)

[13:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
phroggy: onsearch and incremental don't exist in html5, only oninput

[13:47:00.0000] <phroggy>
Hixie: could they?

[13:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
why would they need to?

[13:48:00.0000] <phroggy>
why did Apple implement them?

[13:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
same reason we added oninput to the spec, i would posit

[13:50:00.0000] <phroggy>
did Apple implement onsearch before oninput existed?

[13:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
around the same time iirc

[13:51:00.0000] <phroggy>
onsearch (with incremental) has the advantage that it includes a built-in delay, so that doesn't have to be simulated (which is somewhat annoying to do well)

[13:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
oninput does too

[13:54:01.0000] <phroggy>
not according to my testing...

[13:54:02.0000] <phroggy>
it looks to me like oninput fires on every single keystroke

[13:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's an allowed implementation strategy (the delay is 0), but a delay is allowed

[13:59:00.0000] <phroggy>
hm.

[14:00:00.0000] <phroggy>
can I specify whether there should be a delay or not, or is that entirely up to the browser?

[14:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
browser

[14:01:01.0000] <phroggy>
there are times when I want something to fire on every keypress, and times when I want a delay.

[14:01:02.0000] <gavin>
do any browsers implement a delay?

[14:01:03.0000] <phroggy>
not that I saw.

[14:01:04.0000] <gavin>
seems to me like that might break a lot of pages

[14:02:00.0000] <phroggy>
indeed.

[14:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[14:04:01.0000] <phroggy>
if they expect it to fire on every keypress and it doesn't...

[14:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
how would it break them?

[14:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
they'd already be broken with copy and paste, presumably

[14:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
and drag and drop

[14:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
and IME

[14:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
and anything else taht doesn't have a 1:1 keypress -> input mapping

[14:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
incidentally the print versions of the spec are no longer being generated reliably, the document is so big that the PDF generator gets killed by the kernel

[14:06:00.0000] <phroggy>
let's see...  how about a character count for a textarea; if you're a fast typist, it won't update while you're typing.

[14:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone wants to provide a web service that generates them, i can hook things up to them, but in the meantime, we have no print version

[14:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
phroggy: so? it'll update as soon as you stop typing, why isn't that ok?

[14:07:00.0000] <phroggy>
it's not expected behavior, it's not desirable behavior, it's not current behavior.

[14:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems like fine behaviour to me

[14:08:00.0000] <phroggy>
maybe not the best example, but the only one I could think of off the top of my head.

[14:08:01.0000] <phroggy>
there's other crazy JS stuff that manipulates your text while you type it...

[14:08:02.0000] <phroggy>
firing after a delay wouldn't necessarily "break" anything, but it's not always desirable behavior.

[14:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems like it's much better to fire any of those behaviorus after a delay rather than slow down the typing with computation on every keypress

[14:09:01.0000] <phroggy>
it is desirable when you're doing an AJAX query, or anything that requires massive processing.

[14:09:02.0000] <phroggy>
but if the processing required is minimal, it won't slow down the typing.

[14:10:00.0000] <phroggy>
e.g. updating a character count won't slow anything down.

[14:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
the UA can scale the delay based on how long the processing takes

[14:12:00.0000] <phroggy>
hmm, I'm not sure how that would work....

[14:13:00.0000] <phroggy>
how is the UA supposed to know how long the processing will take, before doing the processing?

[14:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
do the processing once, time it

[14:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
jesus christ, these type=search and placeholder= threads have gotten huge

[14:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Bigger is better.

[14:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
no, no it's not

[14:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But HTML 5 is big!

[14:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
mmm… "Will you attend the reception on the evening of 22 October?"

[14:17:01.0000] <jcranmer>
Hixie: there's a thread on c.l.j.p that's a few K large

[14:17:02.0000] <jcranmer>
dominated by "shut up"\"no, you shut up" posts

[14:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Who actually goes to that?

[14:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
jcranmer: key difference being that i don't have to reply to all those e-mails

[14:18:02.0000] <phroggy>
Hixie: the processing isn't guaranteed to take the same amount of time for every execution, particularly since the value of the field the processing is probably being done on is (by definition) changing each time.

[14:18:03.0000] <phroggy>
(with some exceptions)

[14:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You going to that?

[14:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has no idea

[14:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is n00b

[14:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
phroggy: sure, the UA can just scale the timeout based on how long recent calls have taken

[14:19:04.0000] <jcranmer>
Hixie: hell hath no fury like a web developer whose idea isn't implemented

[14:19:05.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: isn't that the AC thing?

[14:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: "This reception is open to W3C WG/IG/Incubator participants in good standing, AC reps, AB, TAG, Offices staff and Team."

[14:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[14:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
i.e., no./

[14:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
s#/##

[14:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[14:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
probably yes

[14:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It's one of the things on the registration form

[14:21:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Which I thought I probably better fill up now :)

[14:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
i don't pay much attention to the registration form :-)

[14:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether to observe PFWG

[14:26:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: should a media element fire event(s) when it's document becomes inactive?

[14:26:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: section 4.8.10.7 says "If the media element's owner Document stops being an active document, then the playback will stop until the document is active again"

[14:26:02.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: but the section on media playback doesn't mention this case

[14:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
the word "Stop" links to the normative conformance criteria that defines that case

[14:28:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
reading it again...

[14:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: If you want, I can be beside you when you move to Anolis :P

[14:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
did the spec compliane issue get fixed?

[14:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: That's a bug in libxml2's serializer. Using html5lib it is fine

[14:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
well I need something that is fast and compliant

[14:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
(specifically, I need something that is fast, and the W3C needs something that is compliant)

[14:31:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hopefully if I put it on my server it'll be quicker, and still reasonable using html5lib

[14:31:03.0000] <annevk2>
hmm, what goes wrong with libxml2 ?

[14:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
libxml2 presumably can't parse html to save its life

[14:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: It has an HTML mode which works kinda well

[14:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
apparently not

[14:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: The parsing works fine for HTML 5, the serializing doesn't

annevk2: http://html5.validator.nu/?=&doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatwg.org%2Fspecs%2Fweb-apps%2Fcurrent-work%2Findex-new

[14:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: does serialization have the problems Julian raised about XSLT?

[14:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
you sure it's the serialisation that goes wrong? i thought it was the parsing.

[14:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Like losing the DTD, or what?

[14:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: No, it works fine if you use the parser and html5lib's serializer, IIRC

[14:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand how the serialiser can have the bug i saw

[14:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
but ok

[14:34:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: What bug?

[14:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
the conformance issue

[14:34:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: That's a serializer issue, I'm pretty sure

[14:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: I meant void elements

[14:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
the <dt> thing?

[14:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
how can the dt thing happen?

[14:37:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: I must be thick today, but I don't see which part describes what to do for the case of a document becoming inactive.

[14:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tries with lxml parser and html5lib serializer

[14:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the relationship of the backplane XG and PFWG?

[14:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
is backplane ARIA-relevant?

[14:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
the </dt> is the only issue with lxml's parser

[14:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: "When a media element is actively playing and its owner Document is an active document, its current playback position must increase monotonically at playbackRate units of media time per unit time of wall clock time." is the only thing that actually makes the media "move" in time

[14:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: so it _is_ a parser issue?

[14:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That appears to be

[14:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[14:39:03.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: Got that. 

[14:39:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I think if we have a quick enough server html5lib shouldn't be that much of an issue

[14:39:05.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: so where's the problem?

[14:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It should still be quicker than the CSS3 Module Postprocessor

[14:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: agreed. do we? even libxml2 was to slow when anne put it on his server

[14:40:02.0000] <annevk2>
maybe we can use validator.nu to serialize to XML first :)

[14:40:03.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: my question is should fire an event when it stops playing because the document becomes inactive.

[14:40:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I'll try setting it up on gsnedders.com this weekend

[14:41:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: eg. as it does when pausing for user interaction, or because it runs out of data.

[14:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: it's still "actively playing", so no. i mean, the spec doesn't say it should, right?

[14:41:02.0000] <gsnedders>
http://html5.validator.nu/?=&doc=http%3A%2F%2Fstuff.gsnedders.com%2Fspec-gen%2Fhtml5.html — that's an html5lib copy

[14:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: it was the w3c version that was causing me issues iirc

[14:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
header-w3c + source

[14:44:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: are you saying that a media element that was playing continues to be "actively playing" when its owner document becomes inactive??

[14:45:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: even though it must stop playback

[14:45:01.0000] <annevk2>
/me though there was agreement to add placeholder already

[14:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: yes, the term "actively playing" doesn't mean it's, ah, actively playing, it means whatever the term is defined to mean. The condition that causes the playback to actually advice is when a media element is "actively playing and its owner Document is an active document", as per the quoted text above

[14:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
"A media element is said to be actively playing when its paused attribute is false, the readyState attribute is either CAN_PLAY or CAN_PLAY_THROUGH, the element has not ended playback, playback has not stopped due to errors, and the element has not paused for user interaction."

[14:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
nothing in that definition says it's actually playing

[14:47:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: ah "actively playing != "actually playing" :)

[14:48:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: so it stops playing but no other state changes so no events are fired.

[14:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: right

[14:52:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: Thanks. Now that I understand what you mean I get it, but "actively playing" is a confusing state because "playing" means something very specific for media (to me anyway).

[14:53:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: not that I have anything better to suggest just yet.

[14:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: yeah there's a lot of places in the spec where because of the way the text evolved, some of the terms used are poorly named

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: feel free to mail the list asking for terms to be renamed if you come across any (like this one) that are confusing

[14:54:01.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: will do.

[14:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
eric_carlson: maybe "potentially playing" or "playing-enabled" or something would work here

[14:57:00.0000] <eric_carlson>
Hixie: "playable" ?

[15:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
that would probably be ok too

[15:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: http://html5.validator.nu/?=&doc=http%3A%2F%2Fstuff.gsnedders.com%2Fspec-gen%2Fhtml5.w3c.html

[15:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: I should be able to get to around your time in the next week

[15:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Whether I'll be able to drive anywhere else in any other car will be interesting, though :)

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: cool

[15:29:01.0000] <annevk2>
gsnedders, is that with html5lib?

[15:30:00.0000] <annevk2>
I can turn html5lib on on anolis.quuz.org, but I fear for awful performance

[15:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://html5.validator.nu/?=&doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatwg.org%2Fspecs%2Fweb-apps%2Fcurrent-work%2Findex-new is what i get today

[15:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://html5.validator.nu/?=&doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatwg.org%2Fspecs%2Fweb-apps%2Fcurrent-work%2F.w3c-new%2FOverview.html for the w3c version

[15:31:01.0000] <annevk2>
yeah, I agree that that's not good

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
and that took 73 seconds to generate

[15:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is about 72 seconds more than i'd like

[15:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[15:33:03.0000] <annevk2>
for EUR 100 a month I might be able to arrange something quicker :)

[15:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
for 100 EUR a month, i'd have a new computer :-)

[15:36:00.0000] <annevk2>
it already takes like five seconds just to get the frontpage

[15:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: re svg and evt/event, my personal preference would be dropping <handler> altogether...

[15:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[15:36:03.0000] <annevk2>
of anolis.quuz.org

[15:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
wow, yes

[15:36:05.0000] <Hixie>
why does it take so long

[15:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, slow down and go faster. :)

[15:37:01.0000] <annevk2>
no idea

[15:37:02.0000] <annevk2>
it's the way python is installed I think, annevankesteren.nl responds quickly

[15:37:03.0000] <Philip`>
Is it Python CGI and loading a zillion modules just to render the front page?

[15:37:04.0000] <annevk2>
(though runs on PHP)

[15:38:00.0000] <annevk2>
Philip`, pretty much

[15:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk2: I'd guess that might be the problem, then :-)

[15:41:00.0000] <annevk2>
<input> is such a mess it's almost nice

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[15:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: i recommend running a profiler and fixing the bugs :-)

[15:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
(that make it slow)

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
the front page of that site shouldn't need any scripting at all as far as i can tell

[15:47:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, the processor and frontpage is a single file

[15:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[15:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
well then

[15:47:03.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, I should look into FastCGI or something though

[15:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
you definitely need to optimise something :-)

[15:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
what on earth is it doing that takes five seconds?

[15:47:06.0000] <Hixie>
that's just silly

[15:48:00.0000] <annevk2>
ask Guido? :p

[15:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
emacs loads in less than five seconds

[15:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm thinking he would say the script was badly written :-)

[15:48:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It was the first large thing I ever wrote in Python

[15:48:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Where large = > 10 lines

[15:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's one more than i've ever written :-)

[15:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[15:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Would it help if I tried setting up anolis on hoppipolla.co.uk (running on web faction)? Might be easier to get a more complex setup working there since they are selling themselves on being designed for python

[15:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: If you want to try, sure

[15:55:01.0000] <phroggy>
http://phroggy.com/ is something like 3,000 lines of perl (I kept adding features every time I got bored, for YEARS) and it executes fast enough that you don't really notice it, especially after waiting for all the graphics to load.

[15:55:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me finally has some time since he has finished moving out of his house

[15:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
phroggy: Using mod_perl?

[15:56:01.0000] <phroggy>
nope.

[15:57:00.0000] <phroggy>
not even FastCGI, just plain old regular CGI.

[15:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
where is the source to anolis.quuz.org?

[15:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
phroggy: Ah, okay

[15:57:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: /source

[15:58:00.0000] <phroggy>
wc -l *.pm says 3156 total

[15:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
Ah, I tried /src/ /src /source/ but not /source

[15:58:02.0000] <phroggy>
for...  good lord, 15 modules

[15:59:00.0000] <phroggy>
5 of which are object classes

[16:17:00.0000] <hallvors>
load https://www.vyke.com/js/common.js and search for "zzz". :-p

[16:18:00.0000] <hallvors>
I particularly like the exclamation mark
